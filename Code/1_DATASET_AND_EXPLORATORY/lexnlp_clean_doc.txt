UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN
SOUTHERN DIVISION
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION
Plaintiff, Vo 
ROBERT BOSCH CORPORATION
COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND
Defendant.
NATURE OF TIlE ACTION This is an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to correct unlawful employment practices on the bases of religion, and to provide appropriate relief to Jeff Carter who was adversely affected by such practices. The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (hereinafter "EEOC") alleges that Robert Bosch Corporation (hereinafter "Defendant") failed to provide a reasonable accommodation to the known religious practices of Carter, who is a member of the International Old Path Church of God Inc. The Defendant unlawfully terminated Carter because his religious practices conflicted with an employment requirement.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
1. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 451, 1331, 1337, 1343, and
1345. This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706(0(1) and (3) and 707(e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3) and 2000e-6(e) ("Title VII"), and Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. 1981a.

STATEMENT OF CLAIMS
6. More than thirty days before the institution of this lawsuit, Carter filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Commission alleging violations of Title VII by the Defendant. All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.

The Defendantâ€™s unlawful employment practices include the unlawful failure to provide a reasonable accommodation to the known sincerely-held religious beliefs of Carter, to wit: the belief that he should not work on from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. Such unlawful employment practices also include terminating Carter because his sincerely-held religious belief conflicted with an employment requirement.
