IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA Case No. 02-60652-Civ-GRAHAM/GARBER
ELGIN O. JONES,
Plaintiff,
V.
CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA,
Defendant.
__________________________________________
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
v.
CITY OF FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA,
Defendant.
__________________________________________
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
This action, originally filed as Case No. 02-61262 and later consolidated with Case No. 02-60652, was brought by the United States of America ("United States") against the City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida ("the Defendant") to enforce the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., as amended ("Title VII"), following receipt by the Department of Justice from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") of a timely charge of discrimination filed by Elgin O. Jones (Charge No. 15A-98-0317). Title VII applies to the Defendant because it is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a), and an employer within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b). This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f) and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1345.
In its complaint, the United States alleges that the Defendant has discriminated against Mr. Jones in violation of Sections 703(a) and 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2(a), 2000e-3(a) by, inter alia:
a. failing or refusing to promote Mr. Jones to the position of Engineering Inspector I in February 1998 because of his race;
b. subjecting Mr. Jones to harassment that adversely affected the terms, conditions, and privileges of his employment because he opposed employment practices by the Defendant that he reasonably believed to be unlawful practices on the basis of race, filed an internal complaint of discrimination with the Defendant, and filed a charge of discrimination with

the EEOC, Charge No. 15A-98-0317; and
c. failing or refusing to take appropriate action to remedy fully the effects of the discrimination against Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones eventually was promoted to the position of Engineering Inspector I in September 1998, but did not receive back pay or other relief.
The Defendant denies the United States' allegations and further denies that it engages in or has engaged in any unlawful employment discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in violation of Title VII. The Defendant asserts that it is committed to a policy of equal employment opportunity and voluntarily enters into this settlement agreement. The Defendant's signature on this agreement should in no way be viewed as an admission of liability under Title VII.
Desiring that this action be settled by an appropriate settlement agreement and without the burden of protracted litigation, the parties agree to this Court's jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of this action. Subject to the approval of this settlement by the Court, the parties waive, for the purposes of this settlement agreement, hearings and findings of fact and conclusions of law. This settlement agreement is a full, final, and complete resolution of all claims alleged in the United States' complaint, and the United States agrees not to further pursue those claims. Each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and costs. The parties accept this settlement agreement as final and binding between themselves as to the issues resolved herein.
It is therefore agreed as follows:
GENERAL CONDITIONS
1. The Defendant agrees not to engage in any act that unlawfully discriminates against any employee or potential employee because of that individual's race.
2. The Defendant agrees that it will not retaliate against any person in a manner prohibited by § 704(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), because that person:
a. made an internal complaint of discrimination; b. filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, the Florida Commission on Human Relations, or the Broward County Human Rights Division; c. participated in or cooperated with the initiation, investigation, litigation or administration of this settlement agreement; or d. provided information to the Department of Justice.
3. Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this settlement agreement, the Defendant will post notices in the form attached hereto as Appendix A. Such notices will be posted in a prominent and conspicuous location or locations used for posting notices in City Hall and in the Department of Public Services. Such notices will remain posted for a period of ninety (90) days after the date of execution of this settlement agreement.
4.

Defendant's anti-discrimination policieswill make clear that the Defendantwill take into account compliance with these policies, including City of Fort Lauderdale Policy and Standards Manual, Chapter 14, Section 1, entitled "Prohibition of Unlawful Discrimination and Harassment in the Workplace," in conducting performance evaluations for all City employees and when deciding whether an employee should receive a promotion, award, or other performance-related benefit.
5. If the Defendant finds that any of its employees has engaged in discrimination or retaliation in violation of Title VII, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a City employee has engaged in actions made unlawful by Title VII, the City shall, at a minimum, place a letter in the employee's personnel file documenting the employee's failure to comply withthe Defendant'santidiscrimination policy and/or federal law.
6. The City will post anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies in a prominent and conspicuous location or locations used for posting notices in City Halland in the Department of Public Services.
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION TRAINING
7. The Defendant will arrange for a mandatory live training for all employees, including supervisors, in the Distribution and Collection Division of the City of Fort Lauderdale's Department of Public Services regarding Title VII's prohibitions against racial discrimination, retaliation, and harassment because an employee has engaged in activity protected by Title VII. This training will be completed by December 31, 2003, in a manner that accommodates the Defendant's operational needs. The Defendant also will arrange for a mandatory live training regarding Title VII's prohibitions for the Executive Management Team (i.e., employees fulfilling the duties currently performed by the Internal Auditor, Director of Administrative Services, City Manager, Assistant City Managers, Finance Director, Director of Parks and Recreation, Director of Communications, Public Services Director, City Clerk, Police Chief, and Fire Chief); employees working in the Office of Professional Standards (which is responsible for reviewing or investigating discrimination complaints); and other employees with managerial responsibility for personnel and human resources matters (i.e., employees fulfilling the duties currently performed by the Employee Relations Director, Assistant Employee Relations Director, Employment Manager, Personnel Director, Classifications and Compensation Manager, and Director of Organizational Training and Development). All persons required to attend this live training will sign an attendance verification sheet. The Defendant will maintain a copy of the attendance verification sheet in each attendee's personnel file as long as this settlement agreement remains in effect. The United States and the Defendant will confer and agree on who will administer this training, and the Defendant will bear the costs of such training.
a. None of the employees, managers, or supervisors specified herein will be exempted from this mandatory live training except for an approved absence. Notwithstanding an approved absence, the Defendant will require any employee or supervisor who is unable to attend the live training to watch a video replay, administered by the Defendant, within two weeks thereafter or as soon as practicable. All employees attending the video replay session will sign a training attendance verification sheet. The Defendant will maintain a copy of this training attendance verification sheet in the employee's personnel file as long as this agreement remains in effect.
b. After the live training session, for the life of this agreement, the Defendant will conduct annual training via the internet, by video, or other means, regarding Title VII's prohibitions against racial discrimination and retaliation, for all employees of the Distribution and Collection Division of the City's Department of Public Services (or its successor, if the

name of this entity is changed while this settlement agreement remains in effect); the Executive Management Team (i.e., employees fulfilling the duties currently performed by the Internal Auditor, Director of Administrative Services, City Manager, Assistant City Managers, Finance Director, Director of Parks and Recreation, Director of Communications, Public Services Director, City Clerk, Police Chief, and Fire Chief); employees working in the Office of Professional Standards (which is responsible for reviewing or investigating discrimination complaints); and other employees with managerial responsibility for personnel and human resources matters (i.e., employees fulfilling the duties currently performed by the Employee Relations Director, Assistant Employee Relations Director, Employment Manager, Personnel Director, Classifications and Compensation Manager, and Director of Organizational Training and Development). The Defendant will require every person required to attend the annual training to sign a statement certifying that he or she has received, understands, and will comply with the antidiscrimination and anti-harassment provision of Title VII. The Defendant will maintain a copy of this certification in each attendee's personnel file as long as this settlement agreement remains in effect.

INDIVIDUAL RELIEF

8.

Because the Defendant and Plaintiff Elgin Jones have reached a separate settlement agreement

in this case, which includes a monetary settlement to be paid to Mr. Jones, the Defendant is not required

to provide individual relief to Mr. Jones as part of this settlement agreement between the Defendant and

the United States. Payment to Mr. Jones of the monetary relief specified in the Defendant's agreement

with Mr. Jones fully satisfies all of the United States' claims for individual relief for Mr. Jones that were

or could have been alleged in the United States' complaint. The Defendant agrees to provide the United

States with copies of the checks evidencing payment to Mr. Jones within ten (10) calendar days after

such payment is made.

9.

Before either party may move the Court for resolution of a dispute under this settlement

agreement, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve informally any disputes that may occur

under this settlement agreement. If the parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after

a matter has been brought to the attention of either party by the other party, the issue may be submitted

to the Court for resolution. This settlement agreement between the United States and the Defendant is

not intended to confer rights on any organization or individual not a party to this case, nor does it

prevent the Defendant from raising in any later lawsuit any defense otherwise available under Title VII.

Revisions to the City of Fort Lauderdale's

a. The fourth paragraph of the section entitled "Policy" in the City of Fort Lauderdale's Policy & Standards Manual, 14.1.1.1 shall be revised as follows:
Acts of unlawful discrimination, retaliation, or harassment, including unlawful harassment of an employee because that employee opposed practices he or she reasonably believed were discriminatory

or participated in the investigation of any complaint of discrimination or retaliation, are strictly prohibited and constitute a violation of the City's personnel standards and rules.
b. The City's definition of "Retaliation," contained in the third and fourth paragraphs of the Section labeled "Definitions" in the City of Fort Lauderdale's Policy & Standards Manual, 14.1.1.2 shall be revised as follows:
Retaliation means intentional adverse treatment of an employee, including harassment of an employee, by a supervisor because the that employee has reported an incident of unlawful discrimination or harassment; filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, the Florida Commission on Human Relations, or the Broward County Human Rights Division; participated in or cooperated with the initiation, investigation, litigation or administration of a settlement agreement between the United States and the City of Fort Lauderdale regarding Title VII matters; or provided information regarding employment discrimination or retaliation to the Department of Justice.
