(HD 4960) 210 SOUTH BROAD STREET, UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY NEW JERSEY PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY, INC., a New Jersey non-profit corporation; Plaintiff, v. JAMES DAVY, In his Official Capacity as Commissioner of Human Services for the State of New Jersey, Defendant.","Civil Action No. 305-cv-01784 (SRC)  AMENDED COMPLAINT PRELIMINARY STATEMENT Every day, hundreds of individuals are unnecessarily and illegally confined in New Jersey\u2019s state psychiatric hospitals.","These individuals no longer require inpatient care and treatment.","The only reason they continue to be confined and are not living in the community is because the Defendant has failed to develop suitable community living placements and programs for their release back into their communities.","The failure to release people who no longer require hospitalization has gone on for over a quarter of a century in New Jersey.","The Defendant was sued in the early 1980\u2019s on behalf of several patients seeking release from continued unnecessary confinement.","In re S.L., 94 N.J.","At that time, Defendant argued that even though the individuals seeking discharge no longer met the legal standards for commitment, it would be cruel to release such individuals because there were no discharge plans or available community placements.","However, keeping those individuals hospitalized posed a problem, as there was no legal basis for keeping such persons confined.","In an effort to prevent the abandonment of psychiatric patients by the State, the New Jersey Supreme Court found legal authority for keeping persons confined to the State\u2019s psychiatric hospitals when they no longer required inpatient treatment.","The court articulated this legal authority in the case In re S.L., 94 N.J.","In that case, the court determined that the State's parens patriae power was sufficient to continue the confinement of individuals in state hospitals and maintain their segregation from the community at large.","S.L. gave rise to what is known as \u201cConditional Extension Pending Placement\u201d (CEPP).","CEPP status was designed to provide the State with time to develop an appropriate community placement before discharging a patient while simultaneously protecting the patient\u2019s due process rights.","A person can be placed on CEPP status at a review hearing if the judge finds that the individual is entitled to discharge but an appropriate placement is not available.","The procedure is set forth in New Jersey R. 4:74-7(h)(2).","Unfortunately, the Defendant has egregiously misused CEPP status to retain staggering numbers of individuals in locked and dangerous facilities when they have a right to reside in and receive mental health services in the community.","Today, CEPP status would not be necessary at all if the Defendant\u2019s predecessors over the past twenty-five years had developed community placements and initiated timely discharge planning for patients deemed no longer in need of hospitalization.","Rather than develop the community programs and placements these individuals need, the State instead has allowed them to languish in confinement far beyond the reasonable expectation for any CEPP status.","This case is about compelling the Defendant to develop and provide community placements for individuals in state psychiatric hospitals, individuals who have been adjudicated as no longer meeting the standards for civil commitment.","THE PARTIES 1.","Plaintiff New Jersey Protection Advocacy, Inc. (NJP&A or Plaintiff), a non-profit corporation, is the federally funded agency designated since 1994 to serve as New Jersey's protection and advocacy system for people with disabilities.","Pursuant to this designation, NJP&A serves as the agency to implement, on behalf of the State of New Jersey, the Protection and Advocacy System for Individuals with Mental Illness established under 42 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1080110807.","NJP&A is part of a nationwide network of protection and advocacy agencies located in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the federal territories.","The protection and advocacy system comprises the nation\u2019s largest provider of legally based advocacy services for people with disabilities.","NJP&A has statutory authority to pursue legal, administrative and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of individuals with mental illness who are or will be receiving care and treatment in New Jersey pursuant to the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10801 et seq. 4.","NJP&A is pursuing this action to protect and advocate for the rights and interests of \u201cindividuals with mental illness\u201d as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10802.","Specifically, NJP&A brings this action on behalf of individuals with mental illness who are confined to state psychiatric hospitals within New Jersey whom a court of this State has adjudicated as no longer meeting the statutory requirement for involuntary commitment to a state psychiatric hospital.","These individuals have each suffered injuries, or will suffer such injuries, that would allow them to bring suit against Defendants in their own right.","Defendant James Davy is Commissioner of the Department of Human Services of New Jersey (DHS), a public entity covered by, inter alia, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(1).","Defendant Davy is ultimately responsible for ensuring that New Jersey operates its service systems in conformity with the constitutions of the United States and New Jersey and with the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504).","He is sued in his official capacity.","DHS also operates state inpatient psychiatric facilities and is responsible for discharge planning, placement, and follow up for individuals residing in such facilities.","DHS is the recipient of federal funds and administers state mental health programs.","JURISDICTION 10.","This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (for civil actions arising under the laws of the United States), jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(a)(3)&(4) (for actions under laws providing for the protection of civil rights).","Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 et seq. FACTS A.","The Origin of Conditional Extension Pending Placement 12.","The New Jersey Supreme Court created the status of Conditional Extension Pending Placement (CEPP) in 1983 in the case In re S.L., 94 N.J.","At that time, the Task Force on Mental Commitments (Task Force) had been formed to suggest an appropriate way to treat institutionalized individuals who no longer met the commitment standard Id.","at 134.","The Task Force recommended development of an intermediate standard of commitment that would cover \u201can individual who by reason of mental illness is unable to care for himself without some level of aid or supervision.\u201d","at 139.","The New Jersey Supreme Court specifically declined to develop such an intermediate standard Id.","Rather, it recognized such continued commitment as being a violation of an individual\u2019s due process rights and, therefore, found that the State could not keep non-dangerous individuals on committed status using its police powers.","The court recognized, however, that in accordance with its parens patriae responsibility, it could not \u201ccast [patients] adrift into the community when the individuals are incapable of survival on their own.\u201d","at 140.","The court held that the State \u201cmay therefore continue the confinement of such persons on a provisional or conditional basis to protect their essential well being pending efforts to foster placement of these individuals in proper supportive settings outside of the institution.\u201d","The court set forth strict procedural requirements for continued commitment under these circumstances.","Of significance is the requirement of an initial placement review hearing within sixty days of the entry of an order of CEPP Id.","Thereafter, subsequent placement review hearings must occur at least every six months Id.","at 141.","If placement is not possible, the court must determine whether the State has undertaken all good faith efforts necessary to place the individual in an appropriate setting outside of the psychiatric institution.","At each of the placement review hearings, the State must show what efforts it has made to locate placement for the individual.","If immediate placement is not possible, the court must determine if the State has undertaken all good faith efforts to ensure that the individual is placed in an environment least restrictive of his or her liberty within the institution Id.","at 141.","While the individual remains confined in the institution, all reasonable efforts must be made to improve the individual\u2019s ability to function in a community-based setting.","Only under these limited and strict conditions is \u201cthe continuing confinement of individuals who do not meet standards for commitment and are eligible for discharge but are not able to survive independently... in accord with due process.\u201d","at 142.","The Plaintiff does not allege that CEPP status is illegal; rather the Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant\u2019s practice and application of CEPP status runs afoul of his obligations under the ADA to comply with the landmark United States Supreme Court decision, Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).","L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).","The Reality of Conditional Extension Pending Placement 21.","The State has misused CEPP status to justify the continued confinement of thousands of individuals while simultaneously failing to develop suitable community supports for those individuals.","Every person on CEPP status bears the stigma inherent in being unnecessarily segregated from other citizens in the community.","The narrowly tailored due process protections of CEPP status, designed to permit hospitals to continue the confinement of individuals while the State develops a community placement, now serves as the very sword against the individuals it was designed to shield.","Excluding the State\u2019s lone forensic hospital, on any given day nearly 50% of the individuals in New Jersey\u2019s psychiatric hospitals are on CEPP status.","In other words, nearly half of the people who are institutionalized in New Jersey\u2019s psychiatric hospitals have been determined by a court no longer to require such institutionalized care.","While on CEPP status these individuals are routinely housed in the most restrictive part of the institution despite being viewed as ready to return to the community.","These wards also contain the most volatile patients, including those who are on committed status and often have not yet been stabilized.","The CEPP population remains on the most restrictive wards because of the lack of space in less restrictive parts of the hospitals such as cottages where greater freedoms in a comparatively more community-like setting are permitted.","There are few openings in cottages because the State has failed to move the cottage residents into the community.","Consequently, no opportunity exists for other CEPP individuals in the hospitals\u2019 more restrictive wards to move from those wards into the cottages or other less restrictive placements in the hospital.","CEPP patients residing on overcrowded and understaffed wards are routinely subject to abuse and neglect.","While remaining on restrictive and volatile hospital wards, CEPP patients routinely receive the same treatment by staff as involuntarily committed patients.","For example, staff continues to grant and rescind privilege levels that determine whether or not the CEPP individual will be entitled to go outside on the grounds of the hospital, attend social activities, and use the library or other hospital facilities.","It does not matter that a judge has determined that the individual no longer even needs to be hospitalized; a CEPP patient may not go outside for fresh air unless a staff member permits it.","While on CEPP status and confined to state hospitals, those individuals for whom intensive therapy is indicated are unable to receive such therapy because, apart from psychotropic medication, very limited therapy is offered in state psychiatric hospitals, even for conditions for which therapy, and not medication, is the recommended treatment.","Despite being adjudicated as ready for community living, the individuals on CEPP status who are confined to institutions remain on locked wards without the ability to control simple events in their life such as turning lights on or off, when they will lie down to rest, when they will eat or sleep, when and if they will have access to the outdoors, and when they will shower.","By allowing the continued confinement of thousands of individuals under the above conditions, the Defendant has flagrantly failed to minimize the restrictions on the liberty of the individuals on CEPP status, as required by fundamental tenets of due process and human liberty.","This failure has profoundly impacted, and continues to impact, the lives of thousands of citizens of this State.","Examples of two such individuals who have been profoundly impacted by their extended stay on CEPP status follow.","Carol C. is a 60-year-old woman who was committed to a state psychiatric hospital in 1993.","She was on committed status for less than one month when a New Jersey Superior Court Judge determined that she could be discharged to a community placement.","Upon information and belief, Carol C. remained continuously on CEPP status from 1993 to March 2005.","During most of that time, she remained in the most restrictive and volatile ward of the hospital; other patients assaulted her on numerous occasions, and she required emergency medical treatment at the local general hospital emergency room for such injuries.","While needlessly hospitalized since 1993, Carol C. was unable to participate in the activities she enjoyed, such as supported employment, attending church, and enjoying shopping in local stores.","Another such individual, Brian B., is a 38-year-old male who has been hospitalized in a state psychiatric hospital and on CEPP status since 2003.","Brian wishes to reside in the community, and both a Superior Court judge and his doctors agree that he is ready for discharge.","He wishes to reside in a group home with his peers and would enjoy participating in community activities such as musical performances and dances.","He also enjoys cooking and would like to prepare, or assist in the preparation of, his own meals.","He enjoys long walks and trips to the mall.","Brian\u2019s mother, who provides moral and emotional support to Brian, believes that he has been institutionalized for too long and looks forward to seeing him reside in the community.","Because there is no appropriate community placement for Brian B., he remains hospitalized in an extremely volatile ward of the hospital where his safety and security are in jeopardy on a daily basis.","The above examples are only two out of nearly a thousand individuals who are on CEPP status, individuals who are kept in institutions segregated from other citizens unnecessarily and against their will.","The Failure to Create or Implement an Effective Plan 43.","Since the landmark decision of Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), states have been required to create and implement a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings.","L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), states have been required to create and implement a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings.","New Jersey has ignored this important mandate and continued its shameful method of CEPP warehousing and institutional expansion.","In Frederick L v Dept.","of Pub.","Welfare, 364 F.3rd 487 (2004), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has held that a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings and a waiting list that moves at a reasonable pace and which is not controlled by the State\u2019s endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated \u2013 is a minimum requirement for states in this Circuit.","New Jersey has neither an effective plan nor a true waiting list, much less one that moves at a reasonable rate.","In fact, the DHS\u2019s true plan is not to discharge such individuals into the community, but rather to endeavor to keep its institutions fully populated with those individuals.","The percentage of individuals on CEPP status has been and remains consistently high.","It is, therefore, an undeniable fact that the State is spending its allocated mental health funds on keeping institutionalized individuals on CEPP status rather than on developing community placements.","In fact, a shockingly large portion of each dollar spent on New Jersey\u2019s psychiatric institutions is being spent on individuals who are no longer on committed status and do not belong there.","The dedication of such high dollar amounts to the institutionalization of individuals on CEPP status is exactly the prohibition the court set forth in Frederick L. when it proscribed the State\u2019s endeavors to \u201ckeep its institutions fully populated.\u201d","The Failure to Implement the Public Policy 48.","It is the public policy of the State of New Jersey that adequate nonresidential facilities be provided for the treatment of individuals with mental illness, and that such facilities be closely integrated with other community health, welfare and social resources.","It is also the public policy of the State of New Jersey that every patient in treatment in the State\u2019s psychiatric hospitals shall be entitled to all rights set forth in the Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights.","30:24.2 (Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights).","Among the enumerated rights in the Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights is the right to the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes of treatment, N.J.S.A.","30:4-24.2e (2); the right to privacy and dignity, N.J.S.A.","30:4-24.2e (1); the right to be free from unnecessary or excessive medication, N.J.S.A.","30:4-24.2d (1); the right to be free from physical restraint and isolation, except for emergency situations, N.J.S.A.","30:4-24.2d (3); the right to be free from corporal punishment, N.J.S.A.","30:4-24.2d (4); the right to enforce any of these rights by civil action or other remedies otherwise available by common law or statute, N.J.S.A.","30:24.2h; including the right to seek a writ of habeas corpus based on violation of these rights.","By failing to administer services to Plaintiff\u2019s constituents in the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes of treatment, Defendant violates the public policy of the State as set forth in N.J.S.A.","30:4-24, the Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights.","30:4-24.2e (2).","New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination (LAD) is also an expression of the public policy of the State of New Jersey.","It makes it unlawful to subject people to differential treatment based on, inter alia, mental or physical disability, or perceived disability.","N.J.S.A 10:5-3 through 10:5-4.","The LAD prohibits unlawful discrimination against those with a mental or physical disability in employment, housing, places of public accommodation, credit and business contracts.","In preventing Plaintiff NJP&A\u2019s constituents from being integrated into the community, the Defendant denies NJP&A\u2019s constituents important advantages in public accommodations and in publicly assisted housing as guaranteed by the LAD, in violation of the public policy of the State.","It is also the public policy of the State of New Jersey that \u201c[e]very individual who is mentally ill shall be entitled to fundamental civil rights....\u201d N.J.S.A.","One of the fundamental civil rights in New Jersey\u2019s Constitution is the right to due process of law.","N.J Const art.","Defendant violates the State\u2019s public policy to guarantee the due process rights of individuals with mental illness by failing to have an effective plan to ensure their safe return to the community and by continuing their uneccesary confinement.","COUNT I Due Process 1.","Plaintiff repeats and realleges each Paragraph of this Complaint as if set forth at length herein.","Defendant's conduct, as described in this Complaint, is carried out under the color and pretense of New Jersey state law.","Plaintiff NJP&A\u2019s constituents, individuals on CEPP status, by definition cannot be retained under the State\u2019s Police Powers because they are not a danger to themselves or others.","The State continues their commitment indefinitely based upon its parens patriae powers only.","The State has failed to make good faith efforts to place individuals on CEPP status in the community.","The State does not have the authority to continue confining these individuals indefinitely and without a legitimate and realistic plan for their return to and integration into the community.","These indefinite restrictions on Plaintiff\u2019s constituents\u2019 liberty without an effective plan to ensure their safe release when they have been deemed suitable to return to the community by a reviewing court, deny these constituents their right to due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.","Such rights are enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.","COUNT II Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act 1.","Plaintiff repeats and realleges each Paragraph of this Complaint, and each Paragraph of Count I above, as if set forth at length herein.","Plaintiff NJP&A\u2019s constituents are individuals with mental illness.","They have mental impairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities.","Plaintiff\u2019s constituents are qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2).","Plaintiff\u2019s constituents reside in the State\u2019s psychiatric hospitals and have been adjudicated as being ready for discharge into the community through an Order of Conditional Extension Pending Placement.","They wish to participate in more integrated community residential programs that meet their mental health needs.","Institutional segregation of such persons who have been deemed able to live in and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons with mental illness are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.","Confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of these individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.","In order to receive needed treatment services, Plaintiff\u2019s constituents must, because of their disabilities, relinquish the right to participate in community life that they could enjoy, while persons without mental disabilities can receive the services they need without similar sacrifice.","With reasonable accommodations by way of services and supports, Plaintiff\u2019s constituents can be served in a suitably integrated setting.","Defendant is responsible for the operation of public entities covered by Title II of the ADA.","42 U.S.C.\u00a7\u00a7 12131(1)(A) and (B).","Title II of the ADA prohibits Defendants from discriminating against individuals with disabilities in programs and activities.","42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131, 12132.","Defendant violates these provisions by discriminating against those on CEPP status who are unnecessarily segregated from the larger community.","Title II requires that \u201ca public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.\u201d","28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(d).","In the landmark decision Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the U.S. Supreme Court held that these provisions of law are violated when a state places people with mental illness in \u201cunjustified isolation,\u201d and that a person with mental illness may sue the state for failing to place him or her \u201cin the most integrated setting appropriate to [his or her] needs.\u201d","L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the U.S. Supreme Court held that these provisions of law are violated when a state places people with mental illness in \u201cunjustified isolation,\u201d and that a person with mental illness may sue the state for failing to place him or her \u201cin the most integrated setting appropriate to [his or her] needs.\u201d","The Defendants are obligated under the ADA to administer New Jersey\u2019s programs in a manner that supports the availability of services and programs in the most integrated setting for individuals with disabilities.","The Defendant has failed to meet his obligation to provide services and programs in the most integrated setting and instead has kept, and continues to keep, thousands of individuals segregated in state psychiatric hospitals.","Psychiatric hospitals are not the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of persons on CEPP status.","The State cannot demonstrate that it has a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing CEPP patients in less restrictive settings.","The State has no rational waiting list that moves individuals on CEPP status into the community at a reasonable pace.","The State\u2019s continued expansion of the capacity of its institutional psychiatric facilities is evidence that it intends to keep its institutions populated.","COUNT III Violation of The Rehabilitation Act 1.","Plaintiff repeats and realleges each Paragraph of this Complaint, and each Paragraph of Counts I and II above, as if set forth at length herein.

(hereinafter collectively identified as \u201cMcCormick Schmick\u2019s,\u201d \u201cM&S,\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) as follows: INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 1.","Defendant McCormick Schmick\u2019s is a national restaurant chain that discriminates against African Americans throughout the United States on the basis of race with respect to hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion to managerial positions, discipline, and other terms and conditions of employment.","M&S has a nationwide corporate policy and practice of preferring white employees over African American employees for \u201cfront-of-the-house\u201d positions (i.e., prominent positions such as server, hostess\/host and bartender where customers can  2006 WL 1787244 easily see and\/or interact with the employees), and management positions in its restaurants and offices throughout the United States.","M&S disproportionately hires white employees for, and assigns white employees to, front-of-the-house positions and disproportionately assigns African American employees to back-of-the-house positions (i.e., positions in which employees are less likely to be seen by, heard by, or interact with customers).","Those back-of-the-house positions include busser positions, bar back positions, and certain less desirable kitchen positions.","The few African Americans assigned to server positions are given less desirable assignments.","M&S discourages applications from African American applicants for \u201cfront-of-the-house\u201d positions and disproportionately refuses to hire African Americans for such positions.","To the extent that M&S hires African Americans, M&S disproportionately channels them to back-of-the-house positions.","When qualified African American applicants (both incumbents and individuals from outside the Company) inquire about employment in the restaurant, managers and other M&S representatives sometimes tell them that the restaurant is not hiring, even though it is.","When African American applicants submit applications, managers and other M&S representatives acting at their direction sometimes throw them away without seriously considering them.","Furthermore, promotions are often given preferentially to white workers 6.","M&S hires, assigns, compensates, and promotes individuals using subjective, arbitrary, standardless, and unvalidated criteria, without requiring a formal application process.","In addition, M&S systematically takes adverse employment actions against qualified, high-performing African American employees in front-of-the-house positions by giving them less desirable job assignments, lower pay, fewer promotional opportunities, and more frequent and harsher discipline.","Managers have been instructed by corporate headquarters to \u201cclean up the restaurant,\u201d meaning to hire fewer African Americans, to keep the African American employees away from front-of-the-house positions, and to subject African American employees to harsher discipline.","This class action is brought by (a) current and former African American non-management employees of M&S throughout the United States; and (b) African Americans who applied to, or were deterred from applying to, M&S at its restaurants or offices in the United States for \u201cfront-of-the-house\u201d or management positions, but were not hired.","This action seeks an end to M&S\u2019s discriminatory policies or practices, an award of backpay and front pay, as well as compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief, including rightful place relief for all Class members.","JURISDICTION AND VENUE 11.","This Court has jurisdiction over the First Claim for Relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.","This Court also has jurisdiction over the First and Second Claims for Relief under the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d), because this is a class action in which: (1) there are 100 or more individuals in each proposed Class;

Civ P. 23(b)(2) because McCormick Schmick\u2019s has acted and\/or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Classes, making appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Representative Plaintiffs and the class as a whole.","The Class members are entitled to injunctive relief to end McCormick Schmick\u2019s common, uniform, and unfair racially discriminatory employment policies and practices.","Class certification is also appropriate pursuant to Fed R.

California, and applicant to McCormick Schmick\u2019s.","In November 2004, Mr. Byrd applied to become a bartender at M&S\u2019s Spenger\u2019s Fish Grotto in Berkeley.","He was interviewed by the General Manager\/Bar Manager, a non-African American male Mr. Byrd thought the interview went well, but he never heard back about the job.","In January 2005, Mr. Byrd learned that McCormick Schmick\u2019s was again seeking applications from bartenders, so he applied again.","He was interviewed by the same non-African American male and by a white female.","He was invited to come back and work the bar for a test shift.","He did so, working for approximately 4-5 hours.","The General Manager\/Bar Manager told Mr. Byrd that he had done a good job on this test shift Mr. Byrd was never paid

POLICIES OR PRACTICES OF DISCRIMINATION 40.","The denials and abridgments of employment opportunities suffered by the Representative Plaintiffs are part of a general policy or practice of discrimination on the basis of race in employment that has existed at McCormick Schmick\u2019s since at least May 10, 2002.","These are not isolated employment practices or individual decisions.","On the contrary, these incidents are representative of McCormick Schmick\u2019s systematic discrimination against African Americans and in favor of white applicants and employees, to create an overwhelmingly white image to the public.","The under-representation of African Americans in front-of-the-house positions throughout McCormick Schmick\u2019s approximately 61 restaurants in the United States results from a policy and practice of discrimination on the basis of race in hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion to managerial positions, discipline, and other terms and conditions of employment.","McCormick Schmick\u2019s has pursued policies or practices on a continuing basis that have denied or restricted job opportunities to qualified African American applicants and employees.","Such discriminatory policies or practices include, without limitation: 2006 WL 1787244 a. reliance on subjective, arbitrary, standardless, and unvalidated criteria in making hiring and job assignment decisions, focusing on whether applicants and employees properly reflect the preferred white look and image rather than whether they would be responsible, effective, diligent employees who could perform their jobs well; b. reliance on subjective, arbitrary, standardless, and unvalidated criteria in making decisions in compensation, shift, and weekly hour allocations, focusing on whether applicants and employees properly reflect the preferred white look and image rather than whether they would be responsible, effective, diligent employees who could perform their jobs well; c. shunting African American applicants and employees to back-of-the-house positions where they are out of the public eye and\/or do not interact with the public; d. offering and providing African American employees with fewer hours and\/or less desirable job duties and\/or assignments than their white counterparts; e. targeting white candidates for recruitment for front-of-the-house positions, but avoiding, ignoring, discouraging or dissuading equally qualified African Americans from applying for those positions; f. subjecting front-of-the-house African American employees to harsher discipline based on their race without regard to their performance on the job; and g. failure to promote African American employees to managerial positions.","M&S acted or failed to act as herein alleged with malice or reckless indifference to the protected rights of Plaintiffs and the Class members.","Plaintiffs and the Class members are thus entitled to recover punitive damages in an amount to be determined according to proof.","FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Federal Civil Rights, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981) (Brought by the Representative Plaintiffs on behalf of a nationwide Class) 45.","Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 43, as alleged above.","This claim is brought by the Representative Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and the Classes they represent.","McCormick Schmick\u2019s has maintained an intentionally discriminatory system with respect to hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion to managerial positions, discipline, and other terms and conditions of employment.","The foregoing conduct constitutes illegal intentional discrimination with respect to the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts prohibited by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7

C.","The Court hereby provisionally FINDS and CONCLUDES that the injunctive relief 1 settlement class set forth above satisfies all of the requirements for certification under Rule 23(a) 2 and Rule 23(b)(2).","The class is sufficiently numerous (approximately 3,000 persons) that joinder 3 is impracticable.","The members of the class share common issues of fact and law regarding (1) 4 whether McCormick Schmick\u2019s employment policies and practices were intentionally 5 discriminatory and\/or had an adverse impact on African Americans; and (2) whether Title VII or 6 Section 1981 have been violated.","Juanita Wynne\u2019s claims are typical of those of the class she 7 represents because they arise out of the same policies, practices and course of conduct alleged on 8 behalf of all class members.","Juanita Wynne is an adequate representative of the class she 9 represents, because her interests are co-extensive with those of class members, and she has 10 retained experienced counsel to represent the class.","Plaintiffs are seeking meaningful declaratory 11 and injunctive relief applicable to the class as a whole.","Accordingly, the Court hereby 12 provisionally CERTIFIES the injunctive-relief settlement class under Rule 23(a) and Rule 13 23(b)(2).","The Court also hereby provisionally FINDS and CONCLUDES that the monetary 15 relief settlement class described above satisfies all of the requirements for certification under 16 Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2).","As discussed in Paragraph 3, above, the requirements of Rule 17 23(a) numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy appear to be satisfied.","In addition, the 18 Court provisionally concludes that the monetary relief settlement class satisfies the requirements 19 for certification under Rule 23(b)(3).","Questions of law or fact common to the class predominate 20 over individualized issues, and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair 21 and efficient adjudication of the controversy.","Because certification of the monetary relief 22 settlement class is proposed in the context of a settlement, the Court need not inquire whether the 23 case, if tried as a class action, would present intractable management problems.","Accordingly, the 24 Court provisionally CERTIFIES the monetary-relief settlement class as set forth above, under 25 Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3).","26 II.","APPOINTMENT OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVES AND CLASS COUNSEL A.","The Court finds that Class Representative Juanita Wynne has claims typical of class 28 members and is an adequate representative of the class members.","The Court appoints her to 1 serve as Class Representatives of both the injunctive relief and monetary relief classes.","The Court finds that Altshuler Berzon LLP; Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann Bernstein, 3 LLP; the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area; Thomas A.","4 Warren Law Offices; Lewis, Feinberg, Lee, Renaker Jackson, P.C.; and Kingsley Kinsgsley 5 have extensive experience and expertise in prosecuting employment discrimination class action 6 cases.","The Court appoints these firms as Class Counsel for both the injunctive relief and 7 monetary relief classes.","8 III.","PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CONSENT DECREE A.","The Court has reviewed the terms of the [Proposed] Consent Decree attached as 10 Exhibit 1, including specifically the injunctive relief provisions and the plan of allocation.","The 11 Court also reviewed the Motion papers and the declaration of James M. Finberg, which describe 12 Class Counsel\u2019s legal and factual investigation, and the settlement mediation process.","Based on 13 review of those papers, and the Court\u2019s familiarity with this case, the Court concludes that the 14 settlement and Consent Decree are the result of extensive, arms\u2019 length negotiations between the 15 Parties after Class Counsel had investigated the class claims and became familiar with the 16 strengths and weakness of plaintiffs\u2019 case.","The assistance of an experienced mediator in the 17 settlement process confirms that the settlement is non-collusive.","Based on that review, and the 18 Court\u2019s familiarity with the issues in the case, the Court concludes that the proposed Consent 19 Decree has no obvious defects and is within the range of possible settlement approval, such that 20 notice to the Class is appropriate.","It is therefore ORDERED that: 1.","The [Proposed] Consent Decree and the settlement it embodies are hereby 23 PRELIMINARILY APPROVED.","Final approval and entry of the Consent Decree is subject to 24 the hearing of any objections of members of the Settlement Class to the proposed settlement 25 embodied in the Consent Decree.","Pending determination of the fairness of the Consent Decree, all further 27 litigation of this action is hereby STAYED.","1 IV.","APPROVAL OF THE FORM AND MANNER OF DISTRIBUTING CLASS NOTICE AND CLAIM FORM 2 A.","The Parties have also submitted for this Court\u2019s approval a proposed Class Notice and 3 a proposed Claim Form, which the Court has carefully reviewed.","The Court finds and concludes 4 as follows: 5 1.","The proposed Class Notice is the best notice practical under the 6 circumstances and allows Class Members a full and fair opportunity to consider the proposed 7 Settlement.","The proposed plan for distributing the Class Notice and Claim Form, which are 8 attached as Exhibits 2 and 3 hereto, likewise is a reasonable method calculated to reach all 9 members of the Class who would be bound by the Settlement.","Under this plan, the Claims 10 Administrator will distribute the Class Notice and Claim Form to Class Members, all of whom 11 are current or former employees of the Company, by first class U.S. Mail to their last known 12 addresses, as updated by the USPS NCOA service.","There is no additional method of distribution 13 that would be reasonably likely to notify Class Members who may not receive notice pursuant to 14 the proposed distribution plan.","The Class Notice fairly, plainly, accurately, and reasonably informs Class 16 Members of: (1) the nature of this litigation, the settlement class, the identity of Class Counsel, 17 and the essential terms of the Settlement and Decree, including injunctive relief and the plan of 18 allocation; .","(2) Class Counsel\u2019s forthcoming application for attorneys\u2019 fees, the proposed service 19 payments to the Class Representative, and other payments that will be deducted from the 20 settlement fund;

C.","The Court hereby provisionally FINDS and CONCLUDES that the injunctive relief 1 settlement class set forth above satisfies all of the requirements for certification under Rule 23(a) 2 and Rule 23(b)(2).","The class is sufficiently numerous (approximately 3,000 persons) that joinder 3 is impracticable.","The members of the class share common issues of fact and law regarding (1) 4 whether McCormick Schmick\u2019s employment policies and practices were intentionally 5 discriminatory and\/or had an adverse impact on African Americans; and (2) whether Title VII or 6 Section 1981 have been violated.","Juanita Wynne\u2019s claims are typical of those of the class she 7 represents because they arise out of the same policies, practices and course of conduct alleged on 8 behalf of all class members.","Juanita Wynne is an adequate representative of the class she 9 represents, because her interests are co-extensive with those of class members, and she has 10 retained experienced counsel to represent the class.","Plaintiffs are seeking meaningful 11 declaratory and injunctive relief applicable to the class as a whole.","Accordingly, the Court 12 hereby provisionally CERTIFIES the injunctive-relief settlement class under Rule 23(a) and 13 Rule 23(b)(2).","The Court also hereby provisionally FINDS and CONCLUDES that the monetary 15 relief settlement class described above satisfies all of the requirements for certification under 16 Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2).","As discussed in Paragraph 3, above, the requirements of Rule 17 23(a) numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy appear to be satisfied.","In addition, 18 the Court provisionally concludes that the monetary relief settlement class satisfies the 19 requirements for certification under Rule 23(b)(3).","Questions of law or fact common to the class 20 predominate over individualized issues, and a class action is superior to other available methods 21 for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.","Because certification of the monetary 22 relief settlement class is proposed in the context of a settlement, the Court need not inquire 23 whether the case, if tried as a class action, would present intractable management problems.","24 Accordingly, the Court provisionally CERTIFIES the monetary-relief settlement class as set 25 forth above, under Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3).","26 II.","APPOINTMENT OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVES AND CLASS COUNSEL A.","The Court finds that Class Representative Juanita Wynne has claims typical of class 28 members and is an adequate representative of the class members.","The Court appoints her to 1 serve as Class Representatives of both the injunctive relief and monetary relief classes.","The Court finds that Altshuler Berzon LLP; Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann Bernstein, 3 LLP; the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area; Thomas A.","4 Warren Law Offices; Lewis, Feinberg, Lee, Renaker Jackson, P.C.; and Kingsley 5 Kinsgsley have extensive experience and expertise in prosecuting employment discrimination 6 class action cases.","The Court appoints these firms as Class Counsel for both the injunctive relief 7 and monetary relief classes.","8 III.","PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF CONSENT DECREE A.","The Court has reviewed the terms of the [Proposed] Consent Decree attached as 10 Exhibit 1, including specifically the injunctive relief provisions and the plan of allocation.","The 11 Court also reviewed the Motion papers and the declaration of James M. Finberg, which describe 12 Class Counsel\u2019s legal and factual investigation, and the settlement mediation process.","Based on 13 review of those papers, and the Court\u2019s familiarity with this case, the Court concludes that the 14 settlement and Consent Decree are the result of extensive, arms\u2019 length negotiations between the 15 Parties after Class Counsel had investigated the class claims and became familiar with the 16 strengths and weakness of plaintiffs\u2019 case.","The assistance of an experienced mediator in the 17 settlement process confirms that the settlement is non-collusive.","Based on that review, and the 18 Court\u2019s familiarity with the issues in the case, the Court concludes that the proposed Consent 19 Decree has no obvious defects and is within the range of possible settlement approval, such that 20 notice to the Class is appropriate.","It is therefore ORDERED that: 1.","The [Proposed] Consent Decree and the settlement it embodies are hereby 23 PRELIMINARILY APPROVED.","Final approval and entry of the Consent Decree is subject to 24 the hearing of any objections of members of the Settlement Class to the proposed settlement 25 embodied in the Consent Decree.","Pending determination of the fairness of the Consent Decree, all further 27 litigation of this action is hereby STAYED.","1 IV.","APPROVAL OF THE FORM AND MANNER OF DISTRIBUTING CLASS NOTICE AND CLAIM FORM 2 A.","The Parties have also submitted for this Court\u2019s approval a proposed Class Notice and 3 a proposed Claim Form, which the Court has carefully reviewed.","The Court finds and concludes 4 as follows: 5 1.","The proposed Class Notice is the best notice practical under the 6 circumstances and allows Class Members a full and fair opportunity to consider the proposed 7 Settlement.","The proposed plan for distributing the Class Notice and Claim Form, which are 8 attached as Exhibits 2 and 3 hereto, likewise is a reasonable method calculated to reach all 9 members of the Class who would be bound by the Settlement.","Under this plan, the Claims 10 Administrator will distribute the Class Notice and Claim Form to Class Members, all of whom 11 are current or former employees of the Company, by first class U.S. Mail to their last known 12 addresses, as updated by the USPS NCOA service.","There is no additional method of distribution 13 that would be reasonably likely to notify Class Members who may not receive notice pursuant to 14 the proposed distribution plan.","The Class Notice fairly, plainly, accurately, and reasonably informs Class 16 Members of: (1) the nature of this litigation, the settlement class, the identity of Class Counsel, 17 and the essential terms of the Settlement and Decree, including injunctive relief and the plan of 18 allocation; .","(2) Class Counsel\u2019s forthcoming application for attorneys\u2019 fees, the proposed service 19 payments to the Class Representative, and other payments that will be deducted from the 20 settlement fund; .","(3) how to participate in the Settlement; .","(4) this Court\u2019s procedures for final 21 approval of the Settlement Agreement and Settlement, and about class members\u2019 right to appear 22 through counsel if they desire; .","(5) how to challenge or opt-out of the Settlement, if they wish to 23 do so; and (6) how to obtain additional information regarding this litigation, the Settlement, and 24 the Decree.","Similarly, the proposed Notice and Claim Form allow members of the 26 Settlement Classes a full and fair opportunity to submit a claim for proceeds in connection with 27 the Settlement.","The Notice and Claim Form fairly, accurately, and reasonably inform Settlement [Proposed] Preliminary Approval Order Case No. C-06-3153 CW 1 Class Members that failure to complete and submit a Claim Form, in the manner and time 2 specified, shall constitute a waiver of any right to obtain any share of the settlement payment.","The Court FINDS and CONCLUDES that the proposed plan for 4 distributing the Notice and Claim Form (\u201cNotice Materials\u201d) will provide the best notice 5 practicable, satisfies the notice requirements of Rule 23(e), and satisfies all other legal and due 6 process requirements.","Accordingly, the Court hereby ORDERS as follows: a.","The form of the Notice Materials is approved.","The manner of distributing the Notice Materials is approved.","Promptly following the entry of this Order, the Claims Administrator 11 shall prepare final versions of the Notice Materials, incorporating into the Notice the relevant 12 dates and deadlines set forth in this Order.","Within twenty days following entry of this order, McCormick 14 Schmick\u2019s shall provide the Claims Administrator with computer readable information, in a 15 format acceptable to the Claims Administrator, that contains the full names, social security 16 numbers, last known addresses, position(s) held during the class period, and start dates and any 17 applicable end dates of employment for each position held with McCormick Schmick\u2019s from 18 May 15, 2002 to the date of the entry of this order of all persons who are potential Settlement 19 Class members.","Prior to the mailing of the Notice Materials, the Claims 21 Administrator will update any new address information for potential class members as may be 22 available through the National Change of Address (\u201cNCOA\u201d) system.","Within ten (10) days of the date that the Claims Administrator 24 receives the data described in paragraph (d), above, the Claims Administrator shall mail the 25 Notice Materials, via first class mail, to all known potential settlement class members at their last 26 known address or the most recent address that may have been obtained through the NCOA.","The 27 Claims Administrator will trace all returned undeliverable notices and re-mail them to the most 28 recent address available.","The Claims Administrator shall take all reasonable steps to obtain 2 the correct address of any Class Members for whom the notice is returned by the post office as 3 undeliverable, and otherwise to provide the Notice Materials to such persons.","The Claims 4 Administrator shall notify Class Counsel of any mail sent to Class Members that is returned as 5 undeliverable after the first mailing as well as any such mail returned as undeliverable after any 6 subsequent mailing(s).","The Claims Administrator shall take all other actions in 8 furtherance of claims administration as are specified in the Decree.","9 V.","PROCEDURES FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT A. Fairness Hearing The Court hereby schedules a hearing to determine whether to grant final certification of 12 the Settlement Classes, and final approval of the Consent Decree (including the proposed plan of 13 allocation, injunctive relief, payment of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and service payments to the 14 Class Representatives) (the \u201cFairness Hearing\u201d), for August 7, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. B.","Deadline to Request Exclusion from the Settlement 1.","Class members may exclude themselves from, or opt-out of, of the 17 monetary relief provisions of the class settlement.","Any request for exclusion must be in the form 18 of a written \u201copt-out\u201d statement sent to the Claims Administrator.","A person wishing to opt-out 19 must sign a statement which includes the following language: I understand that I am requesting to be excluded from the class monetary settlement and that I will receive no money from the settlement fund created under the Consent Decree entered into by McCormick Schmick\u2019s.","I understand that if I am excluded from the class monetary settlement, I may bring a separate legal action seeking damages, but may receive nothing or less than what I would have received if I had filed a claim under the class monetary settlement procedure in this case.","I also understand that I may not seek exclusion from the class for injunctive relief and that I am bound by the injunctive provisions of the Consent Decree entered into by McCormick Schmick\u2019s.","To be effective, any opt-out statement must be sent to the Claims 26 Administrator postmarked no later than 60 days after the date that the Claims Administrator first 27 mails the Class Notice to the Class.","Only those class members who request exclusion in the time 28 and manner set forth herein shall be excluded from the class for monetary relief purposes.","1 Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) and (c)(2), the terms and provisions of the 2 Consent Decree concerning monetary relief shall have no binding effect on any person who 3 makes a timely request for exclusion in the manner required by this Order.","5 any opt-out statement and serve copies on Class Counsel and counsel for McCormick 6 Schmick\u2019s no later than two business days after receipt of such statement.","Class Counsel will 7 file the date-stamped originals with the Clerk of the Court no later than five (5) business days 8 prior to the date of the Fairness Hearing 4.","Class members shall be permitted to withdraw or rescind their opt-out 10 statements by submitting a \u201crescission of opt-out\u201d statement to the Claims Administrator.","The 11 rescission of opt-out statement shall include the following language: I previously submitted an Opt-out statement seeking exclusion from the class monetary settlement.","I have reconsidered and wish to withdraw my Opt-out statement.","I understand that by rescinding my Opt-out I may be eligible to receive an award from the claims settlement fund and may not bring a separate legal action against McCormick Schmick\u2019s seeking damages with respect to the Released Claims.","I further understand that in order to receive an award from the claims settlement fund, I must submit a complete and timely claim form.","16 To be effective, any opt-out recission statement must sent to the Claims Administrator 17 postmarked no later than the deadline for the claims filing period specified herein.","19 any rescission of opt-out statement and serve copies on Class Counsel and counsel for 20 McCormick Schmick\u2019s no later than two business days after receipt of such statement.","Class 21 Counsel will file the date-stamped originals with the Clerk of the Court no later than five (5) 22 business days prior to the date of the Fairness Hearing.","C.

Schmick\u2019s practices that 27 counsel gained through discovery as the basis for negotiations regarding the significant 28 affirmative relief described above Id.","During discovery, Class Counsel also received information from McCormick 1 Schmick\u2019s related to appropriate calculation of damages, including a detailed database of 2 employment and payroll information.","See id.","Using that data, Class Counsel\u2019s statistical 3 experts performed promotions and compensation analyses and then a damages analysis.","4 McCormick Schmick\u2019s experts did the same, and the parties\u2019 expert damages calculations 5 formed the basis for negotiations regarding the monetary terms of the settlement.","In sum, Class Counsel completed substantial investigation and discovery and negotiated 7 the proposed settlement with complete knowledge regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the 8 case and the amounts necessary to compensate class members for the harm suffered.","Liability, Damages, and the Propriety of Class Certification Are all Contested.","The Settlement Provides Reasonable Compensation for Class Members\u2019 Claims, in Light of the Delay and Risks Associated With Continued litigation.","Of particular relevance to the reasonableness of the proposed settlement is the fact that 13 McCormick Schmick\u2019s has and would continue to contest vigorously the merits of class 14 members\u2019 claims.","McCormick Schmick\u2019s denies that it engaged in any intentional 15 discrimination against African-American employees and denies that its employment practices 16 had a disparate impact on African Americans.","It is apparent from the proceedings to date and 17 the Parties\u2019 mediation process that, were the litigation to continue, McCormick Schmick\u2019s 18 would aggressively contest the propriety of class certification and would contest liability.","It 19 would also argue that if liability were found, damages would be minimal.","McCormick Schmick\u2019s arguments would include, without limitation, the following: 1.","Class certification would be inappropriate because its operations are decentralized, 22 and personnel decisions are made by individual managers at more than 60 restaurants 23 nationwide, which would make trial of this action unmanageable.","Statistical analyses show no racial disparities in hiring or job assignment when 25 compared to other restaurants in the appropriate local labor markets.","Although plaintiffs 26 disputed the validity of these analyses, and had their own analysis showing statistically 27 significant disparities with respect to the placement of African Americans in front of the house 28 positions, there was a substantial risk that a trier of fact would agree with the Company\u2019s 1 analyses.","McCormick Schmick\u2019s hotly contensted that it had engaged in intentional 3 discrimination, and plaintiffs bore a significant risk that they would not be able to persuade a 4 jury that McCormick Schmick\u2019s standard operating procedure was a pattern and practice of 5 intentional discrimination.","McCormick Schmick\u2019s maintains, and has statistical analyses supporting its view, 7 that there are no differences between compensation of African American and White employees 8 doing the same job.","Again, Plaintiffs had their own analysis showing disparities, but were at 9 risk that they could not persuade the trier of fact.","McCormick Schmick\u2019s also contended that, even if liability were established, any 11 damages were minimal.","Plaintiff bore significant risk on this issue as well.","Such arguments notwithstanding, McCormick Schmick\u2019s has concluded that it is in 13 the Company\u2019s interest to resolve and settle this litigation pursuant to the proposed Consent 14 Decree.","For their part, Class Counsel have analyzed and evaluated the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 15 claims made against McCormick Schmick\u2019s in the Litigation and the impact of the proposed 16 Consent Decree on Plaintiffs and the Settlement Class.","Finberg Dec., 35.","Specifically, while 17 Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel believes that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are meritorious and that Plaintiffs would 18 eventually prevail in certifying this case as a class action and would prevail on the merits, 19 Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel has also considered factors such as the substantial risks of continued 20 litigation and the possibility that the case, if not settled now, might not result in any recovery or 21 might result in a recovery several years from now that is less favorable to class members than 22 that offered by the proposed Consent Decree.","Finberg Dec., 35-36.","In light of such 23 considerations, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel is satisfied that the terms and conditions of the Settlement are 24 fair, reasonable and adequate and that the Settlement is in the best interests of the Class.","The Settlement Is the Product of Serious, Arms\u2019 Length, Informed Negotiations.","The Settlement resulted only after extensive, arms\u2019 length settlement negotiations that 28 were conducted after rigorous discovery regarding the merits and damages of the disputed 1 claims, and under the supervision of experienced mediator Hunter Hughes.","See id.","2 The negotiations were protracted, and the mediation itself required multiple lengthy sessions.","3 See id.","In sum, the proposed settlement is the non-collusive product of hard-fought litigation.","The Proposed Plan of Allocation is Fair and Reasonable.","As described above, the proposed plan of allocation takes into account two factors to 6 ensure that the ultimate division of the settlement proceeds among class members is fair and 7 accurate, while at the same time preserving the intended efficiencies of class action litigation: 8 length of service and type of job jeld, which takes into account the fact that those who served 9 the longest in back of the house jobs have stronger potential claims and larger potential 10 damages.","The Proposed Service Payment to the Class representative Is Reasonable.","The Settlement provides for a service payment of up to $5,000 for Class Representative 14 Juanita Wynne Ms. Wynne performed important services for the benefit of the Class.","She 15 provided information regarding the structure of the company and her job duties during lengthy 16 interviews; she submitted to deposition by McCormick Schmick\u2019s; she produced relevant 17 documents; and she worked with Class Counsel throughout the case.","See Finberg Dec., 20-  18

Ironworkers Local 86, 443 F.2d 544, 551 (9th Cir.1971)).","In their opposition, defendants repeatedly argue that plaintiffs have no evidence of discrimination at any restaurant other than at Berkeley.","In reply, plaintiffs have submitted declarations of nine (9) individuals who claim to have suffered or witnessed various types of discrimination in eleven (11) different restaurants operated by defendants in various states.","As to the second argument, defendants have cited no authority, and the court is aware of none, for the proposition that Wynne v. McCormick Schmicks\u2019s Seafood Restaurants, Inc., Not Reported in... defendants can dictate the means of discovery that the plaintiffs must use.","That proposition appears inconsistent with Rule 26(d).","I agree with the argument that the plaintiffs advanced during the telephonic hearing some weeks ago that it would not be efficient to require them first to depose defendants\u2019 management personnel since they might have to be re-deposed once the statistical discovery was produced.","While the defendants\u2019 witnesses might be willing to undergo multiple depositions, I see no reason to force plaintiffs to do so.","Finally, some of defendants\u2019 objections to the original discovery requested are well taken.","While plaintiffs assert that they are moving to compel production of only statistical data, plaintiffs have not rewritten their discovery requests.","In an effort to avoid confusion, I will rule on each request specifically and generally limit plaintiffs\u2019 requests to certain electronically stored information and government mandated compliance reports and other similar documents.","I have also denied those requests which are irrelevant to plaintiffs\u2019 current need for statistical data.","*2 Based on the foregoing, I HEREBY ORDER the following: (1) Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for production nos.","6 and 7 are GRANTED to the extent that they request electronically stored data showing the race, date of application, date of hire, job title(s), salary\/wage rates, gross pay, bonuses, fulltime\/part-time status, hours, shifts, restaurant location, and termination codes for all current and former restaurant employees and applicants and current and former restaurant-level managers and applicants from May 11, 2002 to the present.","Plaintiffs\u2019 requests nos.","6 and 7 are DENIED to the extent they request the names, addresses, gender, and national origin of defendants\u2019 employees and applicants.","Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the relevance of this information at this stage of litigation.","(2) Plaintiffs\u2019 request for production no. 8 is DENIED.","The request is over broad and irrelevant in that corporate employees are not members of the alleged putative classes.","(3) Plaintiffs\u2019 request for production no. 9 is DENIED.","As written, plaintiffs requests all conceivable documents pertaining to daily work assignments.","At this stage of litigation, the request is overly burdensome and irrelevant to plaintiffs\u2019 need to develop statistical data for class certification purposes.","(4) Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for production nos.","31 and 32 are DENIED.","These requests seek personal information about defendants\u2019 employees and applicants.","At this stage of litigation, the requests are overly burdensome and irrelevant.","(5) Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for production nos.","34, 35, 36 are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.","Defendants shall produce all EEO-1 reports and all comparable compliance reports submitted to any federal, state, or local agency on behalf of each of its restaurants between May 11, 2002 to the present.","Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for documents referring or relating to the described reports are, at this stage, overly burdensome.","(6) The denials recited above are made without prejudice to plaintiffs\u2019 ability to renew their requests at later stages of litigation.","(7) Defendants are ORDERED to provide further discovery consistent with this order no later than January 2, 2007.","Footnotes A party may obtain discovery as to \u201cany matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party.\u201d","Fed.R.Civ.P.","26(b)(1).","Courts broadly construe the scope of permissible discovery.","See, e.g., In re Advanced Interventional Systems Securities Litigation, 1993 WL 331006, at *1 (C.D.Cal.","May 17, 1993) (citing Oppenheimer Fund, Inc v.
