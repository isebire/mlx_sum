specifically, it prevents pregnancy for women who wish to do so by reversible means.","Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, brings this class action against AT&T for sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k) for offering and\/or providing health insurance that does not cover prescription contraceptives for women related to reproduction while covering sex-related prescription medication for men, such as Viagra.","AT&T's exclusion of prescription contraception has an adverse disparate impact on Ms. Stocking and other members of the proposed class.","Because prescription contraceptives are available for use only by women, AT&T's failure to provide coverage for prescription contraception forces its female employees to choose between paying their own out-of-pocket prescription costs, or bearing the physical, emotional and financial costs of an unplanned pregnancy.","As a result of AT&T decision to exclude contraceptives from its benefits plan, Ms. Stocking and other members of the proposed class are being discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment, which includes receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, because of their potential for pregnancy.","This violates Title VII.","Plaintiff Susan Stocking 9.","Plaintiff Susan Stocking has been employed by AT&T on a full-time basis since June 12, 1995.","As part of the terms and conditions of her employment, Ms. Stocking receives health insurance coverage, including coverage of prescription drugs and devices Ms. Stocking sues on her own behalf and as a representative of the proposed class of employees who are discriminated against by the exclusion of contraception from AT&T's benefit plan.","10 Ms. Stocking was, at all times relevant to this cause of action, a woman of childbearing age who was concerned with the prevention of an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy Ms. Stocking requested that her prescription health care benefit provide or reimburse her for the cost of birth control.","Her requests were denied.","Subsequently, Ms. Stocking learned that men were provided and received plan coverage of a full range of conditions that can be treated through prescription medication.","On August 26, 2002, Ms. Stocking filed a charge with the EEOC at its Kansas City Area Office in Kansas City, Kansas alleging that AT&T's failure to provide her with health insurance coverage for prescription contraceptives constitutes unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex.","As a result, Ms. Stocking received a decision and a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC (copies of which are attached hereto as \"Exhibit A\" and Exhibit B\").","On November 29, 2002, the EEOC issued a \"Determination\" to Plaintiff Susan Stocking, in which it considered AT&T's benefit plan and concluded that: \"...it is the Commission's position that the pre-July 2002 exclusion violates both Title VII and the PDA, since the statutes cover prescription contraceptives regardless of their intended purpose.","Prescription contraceptives are available only for women.","As a result, Respondent's pre-July 2002 policy is, by definition, a sex-based exclusion...It appears that Respondent's current plan uniquely classifies contraceptives used for birth control purposes by requiring their acquisition solely by mail.","This also represents a sex-based distinction and violates the statutes.","Coverage for prescription contraceptives must be afforded in the same manner as if the woman, or any employee, sought other preventive or health maintenance services.","AT&T's refusal to provide the same benefits to both men and women has caused an economic hardship on Ms. Stocking and other members of the proposed class that male employees are not required to endure.","AT&T's Health Plan 15.","As terms and conditions of their employment, AT&T offered Ms. Stocking the opportunity to enroll in one of three health plans (Plan).","The three options were: Post of Service (POS) option; Traditional Indemnity option (PPO); and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).","The POS offered the highest level of benefits.","The PPO option was only offered to those employees who lived outside the POS service area, but allowed selection of physicians and reimbursement after the deductible was met.","The HMO option generally had no deductibles to meet, a small co-payment but required participants to see a doctor in the HMO network.","Regular full-time occupational employees are eligible for coverage at the company's expense on the first day of the month in which the employee attains six months of Net Certified Service with AT&T.","Regular full-time employees are not required to contribute to receive Plan benefits, but with the HMO option, they may be required to do so.","17 Ms. Stocking elected to take advantage of the PPO option.","The Plan also provides for a Prescription Drug Benefit Plan which was administered by Merck-Medco (Drug Plan).","The Drug Plan provided drug benefits to participants in the POS and PPO options.","In general, the Drug Plan covered all drugs provided by a pharmacist at the physician's order unless specifically excluded.","The Drug Plan specifically excluded \"[a]ny drugs or medications used solely for birth control, including oral contraceptives, jellies, foams, devices, implants or injections.\"","Despite covering other preventative medical services and prescriptions, neither the Plan nor the Drug Plan provided for prescription drugs and\/or devices used by plaintiffs and other women similarly situated to prevent pregnancy.","If plaintiff became pregnant, however, the Plan would have covered the costs of either an abortion or continuing the pregnancy to term whichever she chose to do.","III.","Harm to Ms. Stocking and Other Class Members 21.","As a direct and proximate result of the AT&T Plan's failure to cover contraception to prevent pregnancy, Ms. Stocking and other proposed members of the class were required to pay for their monthly or periodic contraceptives on an out-of-pocket basis, or risk unintended pregnancy.","Like many healthy women of reproductive age, contraception is the only prescription drug Ms. Stocking used on a regular and consistent basis.","On information and belief, AT&T employs hundreds of women of reproductive age who use prescription contraception.","If contraception were treated on an equal basis with other prescriptions under the Plan and the Drug Plan, Ms. Stocking and other proposed class members would have paid a low co-pay, or no co-pay at all, for generic or brand-name, 34 day supply, of contraception.","Factual Framework 24.","For over thirty years of their lives, women have the biological potential for pregnancy.","Contraception is a drug or device that prevents pregnancy.","Without contraception, the average woman would be expected to have between 12 and 15 pregnancies in her lifetime.","In any given year, 85 out of 100 sexually active women of reproductive age who do not use contraception will become pregnant.","Most American women want only two children.","To achieve that goal, the typical American woman spends roughly three decades or about 75% of her reproductive life trying to avoid unintended pregnancy.","Of the 60.2 million women of reproductive age, 64% currently use contraception.","Ninety-four percent of American women use contraception at some point during their reproductive years.","Among all women aged 20-44 who have ever had sexual intercourse, 85% have used prescription oral contraceptives.","The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved five methods of reversible prescription contraception: oral contraception; Norplant; Depo-Provera; intra-uterine device (\"IUD\"); and the diaphragm.","Only women can use these methods of prescription contraception.","Other forms of contraception are sold over the counter (OTC) and thus generally are not covered by health insurance.","The OTC methods include the male condom and five female methods: spermicidal foam, jelly, film, suppositories and the female condom.","All methods work either by preventing fertilization of a woman's ovum or by preventing implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine wall.","Women bear all of the physical burdens of pregnancy, which are quite substantial.","Pregnancy itself can put a woman's life at risk.","Ectopic pregnancy is the deadliest complication in the early stages of pregnancy.","The three deadliest complications of full-term pregnancy are hemorrhage, hypertension and thrombosis.","In the United States today, for every 100,000 births, 8-22 women (depending on their county of residence) die as a result of pregnancy-related complications.","Pregnancy also poses non-life threatening health risks for women.","The morbidity rate during pregnancy is quite high.","Twenty-two percent of all pregnant women are hospitalized before delivery because of various complications.","Pre-term labor is one of the most common reasons women are hospitalized before delivery.","In such instances, the medical interventions a woman must undergo often include long-term bed rest and administration of various drugs, some of which have significant side effects for the woman.","The more pregnancies she bears, the greater the likelihood a woman will suffer one or more of the myriad life and\/or health-threatening complications of pregnancy.","Women who experience a large number of pregnancies are known to be at far greater risk for certain permanent health problems such as uterine prolapse (downward displacement of the uterus so that some or all of the uterus comes outside of the vagina), rectocele (hernial protrusion of the rectum into the vagina), cystocele (hernial protrusion of the urinary bladder through the vaginal wall), pelvic floor disorders and varicose veins.","For women with pre-existing medical conditions, even one pregnancy can pose grave health risks.","Preexisting medical conditions that are exacerbated by pregnancy include: certain blood diseases, including sickle-cell disease; heart disease; cancer; endocrine disorders such as diabetes; diseases of the nervous system such as epilepsy; kidney and liver diseases; connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis; chronic hypertension; respiratory disease including asthma and pneumonia; and HIV present in the blood stream.","Unintended pregnancy poses far greater health risks to women and children than does intended pregnancy.","The medical risks of unintended pregnancy are well documented.","In general, women who become pregnant unexpectedly are less likely to receive adequate pre-natal care and thus have less opportunity to manage pre-existing medical conditions and other risks during pregnancy.","For instance, unintended pregnancy is quite dangerous, and may even be deadly, for women with hypertension or diabetes.","These conditions are best managed when medical care is begun before conception.","In addition, women who become pregnant unexpectedly forego the opportunity to receive pre-conception counseling to improve the health of the fetus and are more likely to have low birth weight babies and experience a higher rate of neonatal mortality.","Unintended pregnancy is both frequent and widespread in the United States.","Forty-nine percent of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended.","Among Western Nations, the United States has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy.","Unintended pregnancy affects all segments of society.","Four out of ten pregnancies among married women are unintended.","Low-income women and unmarried women experience even higher rates of unintended pregnancy.","Contraception enables women to plan their pregnancies and time the spacing between pregnancies.","The shorter the interval between her pregnancies, the greater the likelihood a woman will experience pre-term labor, depression and other health problems.","Recognizing that contraception is central to the health and well-being of women and their children, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized that \"[s]maller families and longer birth intervals have contributed to the better health of infants, children, and women, and have improved the social and economic role of women.\"","Furthermore, even in an otherwise healthy woman, pregnancy poses medical risks that are significantly greater than the risks of using contraception.","In any given year, the average risk of death from pregnancy is 1 in 11,000 while the risk of death from contraception is much less: 1 in 63,000 for non-smoking oral contraceptive users; 1 in 100,000 for IUD users; and no risk of death for diaphragm users.","Due to the wide variation in effectiveness, cost, and medical appropriateness of available forms of contraception, choice of contraceptive method is essential to successful pregnancy prevention.","Other factors that contribute to what type of contraception a woman chooses to use are whether the woman intends to delay, space, or entirely prevent future childbearing.","Women with medical conditions that require pregnancy avoidance, in particular, require a full range of contraceptive options because their medical conditions often preclude the use of one or more contraceptive methods.","For example, birth control pills are medically contraindicated for smokers over age 35 and women who are at risk of cardiovascular problems, such as stroke, heart attack, blood clots, and hypertension, as well as women who have, or are at risk of, depression or hepatic adenomas.","For all of the above reasons, a recent study by the Institute of Medicine recommends improving contraceptive coverage in health plans in order to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and to improve health outcomes for women and children.","Similarly, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has adopted the goal of improving pregnancy planning and spacing and preventing unintended pregnancy.","Moreover, the Guidelines for Women's Health Care published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which represents 38,000 physicians in this country, advises that \"prevention of unwanted pregnancy\" and \"contraceptive options\" be discussed with all women over the age of 13 during routine primary care assessments.","In sum, contraception is basic to women's health and well-being.","The physical burdens of pregnancy increase the risk of interruption to a woman's education, career and professional development opportunities.","The ability to control her biological potential for pregnancy is central to a woman's ability to participate in the workplace on an equal basis with men.","Inadequate insurance coverage of contraception has substantial adverse economic consequences for the 67% of American women of reproductive age who rely on employer-sponsored health insurance coverage.","These women pay 68% more in out-of-pocket expenditures for health care services than men, and reproductive health services account for much of that difference.","Statutory Framework 39.","Title VII provides that: \"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to... discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's...","sex.\"","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(1).","In 1978, Congress enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (\"PDA\") which provides that the term \"because of sex\" in Title VII includes, but is not limited to, \"because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\"","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k).","The PDA further states that \"women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.\"","Thus, Title VII specifically mandates that employers may not single out employees for disadvantageous treatment based on \"pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\"","Contraception is \"pregnancy-related\" within the meaning of the PDA because it is medical treatment that provides women with the ability to control their biological potential for pregnancy.","Exclusion of contraception from a health plan is sex discrimination in violation of the PDA because it treats women differently on the basis of their potential to become pregnant.","The exclusion of contraception from the Health Plan is, therefore, sex discrimination on its face in violation of Title VII, as amended by the PDA.","The exclusion of contraception from the Health Plan also has an adverse disparate impact on women in violation of Title VII because it forces them either to pay for prescription contraceptives out of pocket, despite having prescription insurance coverage, or to bear the physical, emotional and financial burdens of unplanned pregnancy.","Defendant's policy of excluding contraceptive coverage cannot be justified as job-related and consistent with business necessity.","Class Action Allegations 43.","The proposed class of plaintiffs in this case consists of: All female employees of AT&T Corp. covered or offered to be covered by health insurance who used prescription contraceptives from August to the present (hereinafter, Plaintiff Class).","This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Fed R. Civ P. 23(a).","Plaintiff is informed and believes that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.","AT&T employs thousands of people across the nation, a large percentage of whom are women, who participate in the AT&T health and drug plans.","Given the number of qualifying employees and the well-documented utilization rates for prescription contraceptive drugs and devices, plaintiff is informed and believes that the class consists of at least 100 persons.","Commonality is met.","Plaintiff class members have common issues of law: (i) whether the failure to provide coverage for female prescription contraceptives a violation of Title VII and\/or the PDA by disparate treatment or disparate impact; .","(ii) whether AT&T violated Title VII and\/or PDA; .","(iii) whether Health Insurer violated Title VII and\/or PDA; .","(iv) the measure of damages for Plaintiffs who obtain contraceptives anyway; and (v) the measure of damages for Plaintiffs who did not obtain contraceptives.","The common factual issues are: (i) Did Defendants provide and\/or offer health insurance that did not provide coverage for prescription contraceptives for women; .","(ii) did Defendants cause damages to Plaintiff Class as a result; .","(iii) what amount of damages resulted from the discrimination to the Plaintiff Class; .","(iv) whether equitable relief, such as an injunction, should be awarded by the Court.","The claims of the representative party are typical of the claims of the class Ms. Stocking was enrolled in AT&T's health and drug plans during the class period.","Like every other member of the class, Ms. Stocking has been denied benefits of her employment based on a pregnancy-related medical condition.","Furthermore, the AT&T contraception exclusion has had an adverse disparate impact on her, as it has on other female employees of AT&T.","Plaintiff is an adequate class representative for the Plaintiff Class and Plaintiff's counsel are experienced in prosecuting nationwide class actions and in federal court litigation Ms. Stocking has exhausted administrative remedies on behalf of herself and the class.","The common questions of fact or law will predominate over any individual issues as every class member would have the same law applicable to its claims for liability and for damages and the same common questions of fact would have to be presented each time a class member brought suit against Defendants.","A nationwide class action is superior to any other method to adjudicate the claims of all members of the Plaintiff Class.","This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(2) because AT&T has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making compensation, declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief appropriate for the class as a whole.","VII.","Claims A.","Violation of Title VII 51.","By providing or offering discriminatory health insurance to its employees, AT&T violates Title VII by disparate treatment since the benefit plan for health insurance is discriminatory on its face and by disparate impact because the health insurance excludes coverage for benefits that are uniquely designed for women.","As a direct and proximate result of Defendant's violation of Title VII, Plaintiff and other AT&T female employees have suffered damages by paying for prescription contraceptives and are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent further discrimination.","Violation of Pregnancy Discrimination Act 52.","In addition to violating Title VII, Defendants have also violated the PDA by disparate treatment and\/or disparate impact, causing proximate damages to Plaintiff and entitling her to injunctive relief.","VIII.","Prayer for Relief 53.","On behalf of herself and all other persons similarly situated, Plaintiff Susan Stocking seeks the following relief: (a) That an order be entered certifying the Class pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(2) and\/or (b)(3).","(b) That a declaratory judgment be entered declaring that AT&T has violated the civil rights of Ms. Stocking and the Class she represents as guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e.","(c) That a permanent injunction be entered prohibiting AT&T from engaging in the illegal and discriminatory conduct alleged herein.","(d) That the Court award equitable relief to Ms. Stocking and the Class in the form of damages and incidental monetary relief.","(e) That the Court award Ms. Stocking and the Class their attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k).","(f) That the Court award such other and further relief as it deems just and proper under the circumstances.","WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays that the Court certify this case as a class action, approve an appropriate class notice, require Defendants to provide the class notice in accordance with their regular distribution of paychecks or health insurance information, and upon the trial of this case award the Plaintiff Class damages, attorneys' fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, equitable relief such as an injunction, and costs.","ATTORNEYS' LIEN CLAIMED.","JURY TRIAL DEMANDED.","Respectfully submitted, \/s Sylvester \"Sly\" James, Jr. MO 33617 Michael J.

City of Kansas City, 442 F.3d 661 (8th Cir.2006).","City of Kansas City, 442 F.3d 661 (8th Cir.2006).","Wedow accepts guidance from National Railroad Passenger Corp v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct.","2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), which greatly modifies pre-existing law regarding so-called continuing violations.","The concept was severely restricted, being now only clearly available in hostile work environment cases.","Morgan effectively preserves many claims previously rejected on timeliness grounds, but at the same time greatly restricts the period for which damages are available.","See Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct.","3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986), reaffirmed in Morgan and relied on in Wedow.","It is clear, under Wedow, that timely claims can be filed where there are specifically discriminatory working conditions, benefits, wages and the like that may have had a long history but continue into the 300-day period for filing charges.","Defendant's principal argument to the contrary in this case is that it took no direct action during the immediate pre-charge period, such as issuing a discriminatory payroll check.","But there was no requirement of recent direct action in Wedow.","Other situations of discrimination occur that do not require current employer action.","Continued inaction suffices in situations like this.","One might also suggest that issuance of a discriminatory 1018 paycheck is not the wrong complained of, but rather the failure to *1018 make greater payments.","That is essentially what occurred here.","Plaintiff bought and paid for prescription contraceptives on at least one occasion for which a timely charge could be filed.","She sought no reimbursement from defendant or the insurance company in question.","That would clearly have been a futile act, as defendant acknowledges.","A claimant is generally not required to engage in a futile act to preserve a right.","Failure to exhaust available remedies is not presented as a defense this case.","The analogy to Wedow seems unmistakable, and I will deny defendant's motion for summary judgment, except as to the damage period.","III.","The parties in their motions ask for different rulings on the period open to plaintiff (and her class, if certified).","Defendant contends that plaintiff is time-barred from claiming expenses of prescription drugs incurred before the 300-day period allowed in Missouri for making charges of discrimination.","Thus, she would have no claim for the time after she stopped using contraceptives and no claim for any uncompensated expenditures before October 31, 2001.","Plaintiff argues that there was a continuing wrong during the entire period of the collective bargaining agreement.","I agree with defendant in its contention that remediable wrongs occurred from time to time when plaintiff made purchases under the discriminatory agreement, but only to the extent such purchases occurred within 300 days of filing the charge.","A recent application of the principle involved occurred in Wedow v. City of Kansas City, Mo., supra.","City of Kansas City, Mo., supra.","In that case a jury found that women firefighters had been forced to use ill-fitting, cumbersome, and somewhat disabling and potentially dangerous clothing of the type suitable for and supplied to male firefighters.","Plaintiffs had also been supplied discriminatory rest-room facilities.","Although the discriminatory policies long pre-dated the filing of charges, the complainants were confined to damages occurring during the 300-day limitations period.","The Court of Appeals found the claims \"akin to the line of cases stemming from Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 395, 106 S.Ct.","3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986)(holding that each week's paycheck that delivers less on a discriminatory basis is a separate Title VII violation).\"","442 F.3d at 671.","This has sometimes been referred to as a \"serial violation.\"","The Court also relied on the most recent Supreme Court handling of the issue of \"continuing violations\".","National Railroad Passenger Corp v. Morgan, supra.","In using hostile work environment claims as rare examples of continuing violations the Supreme Court emphasized how rarely the concept could be used to avoid the short limitation period created by Congress.","Absent the narrow range of cases that fall within a \"continuing violation\" concept, the Supreme Court emphasized that a \"discrete... discriminatory act `occurred' on the day that it `happened'.","A party, therefore, must file a charge within either 180 or 300 days of the date of the act or lose the ability to recover for it.\"","536 U.S. at 110, 122 S.Ct.","(emphasis added).","In rejecting further frequent use of the \"continuing violation\" theory, the Court referred to the EEOC's advocacy of the concept of \"certain serial violations and systemic violations\" that would allow a longer period of recovery.","The Court stated that such interpretive guidelines must yield to the Supreme Court's role as a final authority.","536 U.S. at 110-1, n.","6, 122 S.Ct.","Advocacy by plaintiff of these concepts after the Morgan decision is thus unsound.","1019 Plaintiff now acknowledges (Doc.","122) that Morgan eliminated the possibility *1019 of using serial violations to avoid the 300 day limitation on recoveries.","She claims however, that \"systemic violations\" can still be used.","In the previously quoted footnote, the Morgan opinion put both categories in the same basket.","Moreover, the violation here, as in Wedow, was clearly of a serial nature, dependent on repeated purchases, even though \"systemic\" in the sense that employer policies of general application originated the discriminatory conduct.","Where, as here, the violation of rights can be broken down into a series of discrete acts, a common source, through company-wide or \"systemic policy\", does not preserve old claims.","See Davidson v. America Online, Inc., 337 F.3d 1179, 1184-6 (10th Cir.2003).","Plaintiff contends the continuing violation theory is still usable in post-Morgan cases involving discriminatory salary contentions and cites Tademe v. Saint Cloud State University, 328 F.3d 982, 989 (8th Cir.2003).","That case uses Bazemore language, however, and notes that the claim of discrimination was timely because the charge was filed within 300 days of the last discriminatory pay-checks.","There was no occasion to rule or comment on the question of a 300-day cutoff for damages because the Circuit sustained summary judgment for defendant on the merits.","Thus Tademe cannot be cited as contrary to the result in Wedow.","[3] Being unable to cite cases decided after Morgan in support of a contention that recovery can be had for events earlier than the 300 days allowed for filing charges, plaintiff falls back on a different statute of limitations than the one governing the filing of charges.","Civil actions by a person aggrieved by employment discrimination may be filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f), which contains no periodic cutoff language for remedies.","Another subsection relating to injunctions and equitable relief does contain the following: \"Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission\".","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(1).","Plaintiff contends the statutory language in itself frees her from the restrictions advocated by defendant.","As stated by the First Circuit some years before Morgan, \"By allowing for the possibility of recovering back pay for over a year prior to the 300 day filing period, `Congress must have envisioned continuing remediable violations that existed prior to the running of the period.'\"","Sabree v. United Bhd.","Of Carpenters and Joiners, 921 F.2d 396, 401 (1st Cir.1990).","Even more compelling, as a pre-Morgan citation, is an opinion by Judge Loken for our Circuit.","Ashley v. Boyle's Famous Corned Beef Co., 66 F.3d 164 (8th Cir.","en banc 1995).","In that case, on allegations that gender discrimination tainted the plaintiff's rate of pay, the Court ruled that \"relief back to the beginning of the limitations period strikes a reasonable balance between permitting redress of an ongoing wrong and imposing liability for conduct long past\" 66 F.3d at 168.","A charge was filed in November, 1992 concerning a continuing pay discrimination practice dating back to 1986.","It is my understanding of the opinion that it would allow back pay recovery to November, 1990.","1020 If there is conflicting language in Title VII, it seems clear that Morgan resolves *1020 the conflict in favor of the shortened recovery period, despite the oddity in drafting that affects remedial relief in injunction cases.","While the parties and I do not find substantial appellate court discussion of the issue, the plain language of Justice Thomas in Morgan effectively \"eviscerates the continuing violation doctrine outside of hostile environment claims\", as contended by the successful defendant in Lewis v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 271 F.Supp.2d 807, 813 (E.D.Va.2003).","If the Ashley \"reasonable balance\" is to be reinstated it will require legislation.","Therefore partial summary judgment will be entered in favor of defendant, limiting plaintiff's remedy to uncompensated expenditures for prescription contraceptives subsequent to October 31, 2001.","Having given up her earlier claim for injunctive relief, plaintiff now seek designation of a class of female employees of defendant seeking damages under Rule 23(b)(3), F.R.Civ.Proc.","She needs a finding that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for adjudication of the controversy.","As in all class actions there must be satisfaction of the elements of Rule 23(a), which include numerosity making joinder impracticable, questions of law or fact in common, typicality of the claims of the plaintiff as proposed representative, and assurance to the court that plaintiff as a representative would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.","Plaintiff's deposition has been taken, with excerpts supplied to the court by counsel.","During the course of litigation I have become somewhat familiar with the performance of counsel in this variety of litigation.","Defendant basically questions the thoroughness of the record on the class action elements and seeks denial of a class action because members of the class would have so many individualized histories that it would allegedly be very burdensome to develop damage claims with any precision or uniformity.","Starting with plaintiff, her motivation is asserted to be the establishment of the rights of women employees of AT T to nondiscrimination in health care benefits.","While arguably much of this interest has become satisfied, as of July, 2002, I am not charged with appraising a claim of overzealous prosecution of litigation which might currently be categorized as an effort to obtain rather nominal damages for a previous violation of rights.","The main thing for me to guard against is personal venality or an effort to use the class for personal benefit.","That is not inferable and is not claimed by defendant.","Counsel are deemed to be skillful and experienced enough to serve as class counsel, and that is also not a subject of challenge by defendant.","In light of the small damage claim available to each member of the class, it is realistically certain that only a class action could feasibly result in an adjudication of the rights here at stake.","The superiority of a class action proceeding is the dominant factor in my determination.","Defendant challenges the showing of numerosity, but I can almost take judicial notice that this is not a serious issue.","The basic question to be decided is whether I should require joinder rather than create a class, and that would only be a close question if we were dealing with several dozen or fewer prospective members of that class.","That is the significance of numerosity.","A distinction needs to be made between prospective class members and 1021 likely class members.","I cannot predict with any confidence that more than several dozen *1021 individuals would choose to remain in the class, given the small stakes and the nuisance involved in reconstructing or remembering medical history enough to specify it under oath.","But the question is whether an unmanageable number of persons are prospective members of the class.","Compare Cox v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F.2d 1546 (11th Cir.1986).","With a very large company like AT T I must assume a very considerable number of women of child-bearing age would be in non-management positions and would be using birth control, either by relying on a male partner or by themselves.","The need for prescription contraceptives for many women would be a matter I can accept as a matter of judicial notice.","Even if a large number of employees elected HMOs, where prescription contraceptives were available, it is fair to assume there are a significant number of individuals similarly situated with plaintiff.","If the number throughout the country is at least 100-500 that would, in my judgment, be vastly more than would satisfy the numerosity requirement and it seems almost frivolous to question that such figures exist.","While the burden is on plaintiff, defendant could doubtless make a good estimate and perhaps has done so.","The question is less technical, and more susceptible to ruling as a matter of common knowledge, than the numerical issue in Yong Soon Oh v. AT T Corp. 224 F.R.D.","AT T Corp. 224 F.R.D.","357 (D.N.J.2004).","For present purposes I accept numerosity.","Common questions exist, and will define the class that would be created.","Plaintiffs claims are clearly typical, except for her discontinuance of contraceptives mid-point in the 300 day period.","This would create a problem of fairness in using this representative if the members of the class were thereby denied the right to claim damages through the month of June, 2002.","Defendant suggests no authorities that would terminate the rights of members simply because plaintiff changed her practice.","Members of the class, for better or worse, use their own experiences to establish damages.","Members of the class, although personally dilatory in pursuing their $1 a day entitlement, are of course able to use plaintiffs charge to get them into court.","Albemarle Paper Co v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct.","2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975).","Although that may have given defendant the idea that claimants would be dependent on plaintiffs rights to damages I am satisfied this concept relates only to filing procedure.","Because Albemarle allows class members to benefit from plaintiffs standing, plaintiff contends they should not be limited by residing in a state with a 180-day filing requirement.","The weight of authority, however, seems to limit damages for class members living in non-deferral States to injury incurred during the 180 day period prior to filing of a charge on which those claimants can rely.","See, e.g., Church v. Consolidated Freightways, Inc., 137 F.R.D.","Consolidated Freightways, Inc., 137 F.R.D.","294, 309-10 (N.D.Cal.1991) Although I am thus presently inclined to accept defendant's contention as to the controlling time periods, that does not affect class certification or class description.","The class description should be inclusive, in my judgment, for the sake of simplicity, with damage limitations for individual claimants to be determined later (if the parties consider that worth the trouble).","Just as claimants who, like plaintiff, may have discontinued use of prescription contraceptives during the time-frame established by the charge, and may thus be restricted to a limitation on recoveries, those claimants living in the handful of non-deferral States would simply have a damage limitation imposed.","In any event, defendant's contention about non-deferral States would not affect class certification but would at most, favor use of a subclass.","1022 *1022 None of the issues mentioned in Rule 23(b)(3) or 23(a) create problems for creation of a class other than the one defendant emphasizes; that is, the many different histories that individuals in the class are likely to present.","Even that issue is, in my judgment, nearly frivolous, in light of the very small sum of money anyone can claim, and the practical strictures that both sides will feel in pursuing and debating such differences.","I cannot imagine defendant spending half a day of time in specific discovery or in challenging some individual claim.","This might result in some vulnerability to false claims, which is also not an issue before me, but would probably be dealt with through sworn documents relating to claims.","[4] The experience in the Union Pacific case, as evidenced in the opinions, confirms my view that the parties, in the interest of practicality, could probably agree on a settlement alternative for individuals that would likely dispose of the bulk of claims.","Administrative proceedings have been devised in the railroad case that could simplify things here.","Defendant does not adequately respond to that experience, except to say that it was initiated \"under a completely different class action standard.\"","This has no bearing on the processing of damage claims.","In other words, management of the class action should not predictably be very burden-some-unless one simply resents the expense of litigation.","A class will therefore be certified, with Susan Stocking as representative of the class.","It is therefore ORDERED that plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to liability is GRANTED, defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED, except that it is GRANTED in limiting damages to the period from October 31, 2001 to July 2, 2002, and plaintiff's renewed motion for class certification is GRANTED.","The parties are directed to negotiate a plan for further proceedings pursuant to these rulings and to propose an agreed order or series of specific orders within thirty days of this date.","[5] If unable to agree plaintiff shall file her proposed order(s) on that day and defendant shall file objections and counter proposals within seven days there after.","SO ORDERED.","[1] Years ago it was customary to disregard or devalue unpublished trial court decisions because almost anything can be out there, and there is suspicion that counsel will skew their disclosures to favor their clients-although suppression of adverse authority would be unethical.","Published decisions continue to have more weight, in general, because they reflect the significance attached to them by the author.","[2] I acknowledge that conceptually the Title VII claims seems more obviously appropriate than the PDA claim, because the avoidance of pregnancy was somewhat outside the target area of the PDA.","Union Pacific makes a persuasive showing, however, that the language of the Pregnancy Act can fairly be read to reach the current subject.","The sufficiency of Title VII without the PDA amendment is accepted in Wright, but the problem there is with earlier Supreme Court cases.","Unless and until the Circuit speaks differently, I accept Union Pacific on the PDA and Wright on Title VII.","We likely will have an appellate ruling before this case is in final judgment.","[3] See another post-Morgan case where a claimant abandoned at oral argument her contention that she could recover in a discriminatory compensation case for a period outside the 300-day charge filing period.","Hildebrandt v.

BARBRI, INC. aka BARBRI BAR  REVIEW, Defendant.","Civil Action No. JURY TRIAL DEMANDED  COMPLAINT Plaintiffs Claire Stanley, Derek Manners, and Christopher Stewart respectfully file this Complaint on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated blind law students against Defendant BarBri, Inc., which enrolled them in bar review courses to study for the bar examination, but refused to remove several accessibility barriers to its mobile application, website, and course materials, thereby leaving them with inferior preparation services and preventing them from effectively preparing for their bar exams, and state as follows: STATEMENT OF CLAIMS 1.","Defendant BarBri, Inc., aka BarBri Bar Review (\u201cBarBri\u201d), by far the largest bar preparation course in the country, violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12182, et seq. (\u201cADA\u201d), and Chapter 121 of the Texas Human Resources Code., Tex Hum.","Res.","Code \u00a7 121.001, et seq. (\u201cChapter 121\u201d) by maintaining barriers to the accessibility of its services for blind students who use talking screen reading software and failing to make reasonable accommodations or provide auxiliary aids or services, and thus unnecessarily hinders blind students from entering the legal field by preventing them from fully, equally, and adequately preparing for the bar exam.","In this putative class action lawsuit, Plaintiffs seek an order requiring BarBri to provide bar examination preparation services that are accessible to blind students, so that they can enjoy full and equal access to BarBri\u2019s bar review services, including the website and mobile application that BarBri uses to prepare students for the bar exam.","This action also seeks compensation for blind students who signed up for and relied on BarBri\u2019s review services to study for their bar exams, but found these services to be inaccessible to them and other blind students.","All three named Plaintiffs are blind individuals who either used, or who already paid BarBri and plan to use, BarBri\u2019s bar review course to study for a past or future bar exam, but encountered, or are aware that they will encounter, significant accessibility barriers to BarBri\u2019s website, http:\/\/www.barbri.com, and mobile application (BarBri App (v1.5.1)).","In this action, Plaintiffs seek to redress the injuries they have suffered or will suffer if BarBri is allowed to continue to discriminate against blind students in violation of federal and state law.","JURISDICTION 4.","This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(a)(4), because Plaintiffs assert a federal civil rights claim under the federal ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182.","This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 Texas state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1367.","This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant, including general jurisdiction, as Defendants\u2019 corporate headquarters are located in this District.","Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b)(1), as both Defendants reside in this district, where their corporate headquarters are located.","Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b)(2), as a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the federal and state claims occurred in this district.","In addition, the terms and conditions on BarBri\u2019s website state that students who wish to assert legal claims against BarBri should bring those claims in this federal district.","PARTIES 7.","Plaintiff Claire Stanley is a resident of Silver Spring, Maryland and took the Pennsylvania bar exam in July 2015.","As she did not pass, she plans to take the bar exam again in July 2016.","Claire is blind and uses the Job Access With Speech (\u201cJAWS\u201d) screen reader on her computer to access and review materials on the Internet.","She also uses an iPhone with VoiceOver (a talking screen reader for all Apple Products) to access all of the menus and applications on her phone.","Claire became interested in advocacy for herself and others beginning in high school, when she became involved with the National Youth Leadership Network, a youth-led and youth-driven national non-profit organization to promote youth leadership and education.","It is a national voice for young leaders with disabilities.","Claire was even selected to travel to attend a NYLN conference.","From then on, Claire knew that she wanted to be a lawyer, and majored in political science in college.","She applied to attend law school during college and was delighted to begin law school after her graduation.","Claire realized that she wanted to practice disability rights law or general civil rights law, and never strayed from this goal during law school.","She held internships at various civil rights and disability rights organizations and federal agencies, including at the Department of Justice, Disability Rights Section.","Claire is now a fellow at the federally mandated protection and advocacy agency for the rights of people with disabilities in Washington DC, University Legal Services.","Once she is able to pass the bar, she will finally be able to fully represent her clients and achieve her goal of being a civil rights attorney.","Plaintiff Derek Manners is a third year law student at Harvard Law School and plans to take the bar exam in July 2016.","Manners is blind and uses JAWS on his computer to access and review materials on the Internet.","He also uses an iPhone with VoiceOver to access all of the menus and applications on his phone.","Derek was curious about being an attorney from a young age.","His interest in the connection between policy and the law inspired him to join the debate team in high school.","In college at the University of Texas, he majored in political science and economics, and knew he wanted to practice political law.","During law school, Derek interned at the Office of the Connecticut Attorney General, where he investigated a Wall Street bank that was heavily involved in the mortgage security crisis.","Derek also served as the Legislative Director for the National Federation of the Blind (a civil rights advocacy group lead by and consisting of blind individuals from around the country) of Massachusetts, where he monitored legislation at the state level that affected persons with disabilities, was the point person for coordinating meetings with members of Congress in Massachusetts, and mobilized NFB of Massachusetts membership for social media campaigns.","Derek just began working part-time at the National Federation of the Blind in their Governmental Affairs Office, and will be starting a job at the firm of Allen Overy (practicing political law) in the fall.","He will need to pass the bar in order to achieve his goal of practicing political law.","Plaintiff Christopher Stewart is a third year law student at the University of Kentucky College of Law and plans to take the bar exam in July 2016.","He is blind and uses JAWS on his computer to access and review materials on the Internet.","He also uses an iPhone with VoiceOver to access all of the menus and applications on his phone.","Christopher always had an interest in government and political science, as well as the law.","His passion for social justice dates back to elementary school, when he first read To Kill a Mockingbird.","It remains one of his favorite novels.","As an undergraduate, he majored in violin performance and worked as a professional violinist for a few years.","But his passion for law drove him to attend law school.","During law school, Christopher worked for the Kentucky attorney general, where he was involved in researching how new EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act impact the state.","This issue is now being litigated by attorneys general from over a dozen states.","Christopher also worked for one of Kentucky's leading trial lawyers, where he prepared pleadings, motions, and briefs for cases involving issues as diverse as medical malpractice, qui tam, and aircraft mechanical negligence.","In addition, he served as president of his law school's Election Law Society and American Constitution Society, and was an editor of his school's flagship law review for two years.","Christopher served as Legislative Director for the National Federation of the Blind of Kentucky, as well.","His duties included meeting with representatives of Kentucky's entire congressional delegation, advocating for specific issues important to blind individuals in Kentucky and nationally, participating in face-to-face meetings, making phone calls, and coordinating letter writing campaigns.","Christopher will serve as a federal law clerk after graduation.","Following his term, he hopes to practice employment law, and would like to work on the defense side, helping companies create an ADA accessibility plan and favorably resolve claims of discrimination.","Christopher recently got married and will soon graduate from law school.","He hopes to pass the bar before beginning his clerkship.","Defendant Barbri, Inc., aka BarBri Bar Review, is a company that sells and provides to students a bar exam preparation course, which includes online and in-person lectures.","FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 27.","For sighted and blind people, the Internet is a significant source of information and education, and offers a wealth of information, services, and products with instant availability and without the need to travel.","For students, the Internet has become a critical and necessary tool for learning, studying, and preparing for examinations, especially for students who study for the bar exam in jurisdictions across America.","In many places of higher education in America, the Internet is the exclusive or primary means by which students learn and interact with their teachers and classmates.","Like other educational institutions and exam preparation courses that have increased their reliance on the Internet to teach, inform, and evaluate students, BarBri has significantly increased its use of Internet-based resources in its bar exam preparation courses.","For example, BarBri offers an online live chat feature to connect students with tutors, an online planner, online practice questions and study outlines, online lecture notes, and online lecture videos.","Upon information and belief, by harnessing the power of the Internet to teach its bar examination courses, BarBri has reduced its costs per student and increased its ability to earn revenue and profit from its bar review courses.","Blind individuals access the Internet from computers by using screen access software, which vocalizes visual information on a computer screen or displays the content on a refreshable Braille display.","This software represents the only method by which blind Americans can independently access the Internet and related computer screen software programs.","Without Internet software and applications that can be used in conjunction with screen access software, blind persons cannot fully access the information, services, and products that companies like BarBri provide through the Internet.","Several screen access software programs are available to blind users of Windows and Apple operating system-enabled computers and devices.","The most popular screen access software for a Windows computer is Job Access With Speech (\u201cJAWS\u201d), which must be purchased and installed separately.","For Apple users, the only screen access software is VoiceOver, which is built into all Apple products.","While each software program may have differences in how the user operates the software, each program requires information on the Internet to be capable of being rendered into text so that blind computer users may access it.","Claire Stanley graduated from law school in the Spring of 2015.","Derek Manners and Christopher Stewart will graduate from law school in the Spring of 2016.","Like most law students, Claire knew she would have to take a bar prep course to pass the bar.","So, before graduating from law school, Claire entered into an agreement to take BarBri\u2019s bar exam course and relied on BarBri\u2019s resources to prepare her to take and pass the bar examination.","Derek and Christopher are third year law students who also want to become lawyers and must also take the bar exam to do so.","They have already entered into similar agreements and will rely upon BarBri\u2019s resources to prepare them to take and pass bar examinations.","Both Derek and Christopher have requested reasonable accommodations from BarBri, and BarBri has assured both of them that its bar review courses will be fully accessible to them and will provide them with an equivalent preparation to take the bar exam.","Defendant\u2019s website and mobile application provide practice questions to help students to prepare for the Multistate Bar Exam (\u201cMBE\u201d), which is a one-day multiple choice test that all students must take to pass the bar exam in any state (with the exception of Louisiana).","BarBri\u2019s website and mobile application provide feedback to students on essay topics, and offer many other features to help students to study for and prepare for taking the bar examination in July or February of each year.","BarBri\u2019s website and mobile application are used extensively and regularly nationwide, including in the state of Texas.","According to its website, www.thebarbrigroup.com\/the-new-barbri\/bar-review, it is the \u201conly course available to students in all fifty states... With significant cost of law school education and so much at stake, it makes sense for law students to choose a proven partner and support system they can count on to teach what they need to know to pass the bar exam, the first time.","BarBri has become synonymous with bar prep success,\u201d and has become the \u201c#1 most trusted\u201d bar review course in the United States.","On the front page of BarBri\u2019s website, www.barbri.com, there is a link to a web page entitled \u201cADA ACCOMMODATION,\u201d which states that \u201cBarBri complies with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and provides appropriate auxiliary aids and services to students with disabilities to ensure effective communication.\u201d","BarBri was displaying the same statement on its website during the time that each of the Plaintiffs enrolled in BarBri\u2019s bar review course and at the time that Claire was preparing to take the bar exam.","BarBri\u2019s enrollment form is used nationwide and also states that, \u201cBarBri complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and provides appropriate auxiliary aids and services to students with disabilities.\u201d","When Claire was studying for the bar exam, BarBri\u2019s website identified an ADA Manager to whom students with disabilities should direct inquiries about BarBri\u2019s compliance with the ADA and\/or requests for reasonable accommodations: ADA Director, BARBRI Bar Review, 200 W. Adams, Suite 250, Chicago, IL 60606, Fax: (312) 288-4607, ADARequests@BARBRI.com.","On the same page that BarBri promises that it complies with the ADA, BarBri states that \u201cpractice testing\u201d is one of the \u201cthree main components of the BARBRI course,\u201d in addition to \u201clectures\u201d and \u201csubstantive law outlines.\u201d","BarBri\u2019s website further states that \u201cThe BARBRI course is different from law school courses.","It is extremely condensed and requires you to blend the three components above to bring you to peak performance for your bar exam.\u201d","BarBri\u2019s practice testing primarily occurs on the BARBRI website, www.barbri.com.","Accordingly, BarBri is and has been fully aware that students with disabilities, including blind students, need to be able to fully access BarBri\u2019s website to engage in the practice testing that is a critical and necessary part of preparing for the bar exam.","BarBri prepares students to take the bar examination in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.","Every jurisdiction except for Louisiana administers and relies upon the results of the MBE, which is a 200-question multiple-choice examination that the National Conference of Bar Examiners developed.","In addition to requiring students to take the MBE, jurisdictions require students to answer a variety of essay questions in narrative form and statespecific multiple choice questions to evaluate their legal analysis and writing skills.","BarBri\u2019s courses and materials prepare students to master all portions of the relevant state bar exam, score as high as possible on the exam, and pass the exam.","In the jurisdictions where students take the MBE, BarBri uses \u201cMPQ Question Sets\u201d for students to review and answer questions that are the same or similar to the questions that will be asked in the MBE during the bar exam.","It is very important for students to score as high as possible on the MBE, because in most jurisdictions the MBE provides students with the largest \u2013 or one of the largest \u2013 opportunities to earn points that are needed to meet the minimum point threshold for passing the bar exam in the relevant jurisdiction.","In addition, some jurisdictions will only allow lawyers who have already been admitted to another jurisdiction to waive into their state bars if they previously obtained a specific MBE score during a prior bar exam.","Thus, even if a student has passed the bar exam in a jurisdiction, such as Texas, he or she may not automatically be able to become a member of another jurisdiction, such as the District of Columbia, if his or her MBE score on the prior bar exam did not meet a certain threshold.","Instead, he or she would have to take a new bar exam, and would likely incur further expenses and time to prepare to take the bar exam again.","Prior to commencing her bar review course in 2015, Claire contacted BarBri\u2019s former National ADA Director, Kate Levine, and requested that her textbooks, lecture notes, and handouts be provided to her in an electronic format so that she could access them.","Defendant\u2019s employee assured Claire that it would provide these materials in an accessible format.","Christopher has also contacted Defendant\u2019s current national ADA manager to request materials for the July 2016 bar review course in an alternate format, and Defendant has assured him that they will be made accessible to him.","Derek has submitted his request to BarBri\u2019s current national ADA manager for similar accommodations for the July 2016 bar.","While studying for the July 2015 bar exam, BarBri\u2019s website began creating difficulties and preventing Claire from accessing it, including the \u201cMPQ Question Sets\u201d in the StudySmart section that allows students to engage in practice testing for the MBE.","While Defendant\u2019s website allowed Claire to read the text of the questions, it prevented her from reading the answer choices, as they appeared in an inaccessible flash window.","Defendant\u2019s barriers persisted when Claire was studying for the February 2016 exam, as Defendant failed to make the answer choices readable line-by-line.","BarBri instructs students to first read the \u201ccall of the question\u201d before reading the question itself, yet it was preventing her from doing so by keeping her from first reading the answer choices before scrolling back up and reading the question itself.","Because Defendant forced Claire to read the question and answer choices in chronological order without pause, she could not take the practice in the manner BarBri advised its customers to properly take the tests.","BarBri proclaims the \u201cEssay Architect\u201d feature of its website will help students write better essays for bar exams.","Students using Essay Architect must rearrange phrases in a pre-written essay to organize them in the proper format, and this is done by dragging and dropping the phrases.","They receive feedback in the margins about their formatting.","Defendant did not provide this feature to Claire, though, because it would not make the drag-and-drop function accessible to her screen reader.","BarBri also failed to allow her to detect that certain phrases relating to the area of law covered by the essay were highlighted with her screen reader, thereby preventing Claire from receiving the vital feedback on essay construction that she needed and that all of her sighted peers were receiving.","Defendant also failed to make the same features on its website accessible to Claire when she used BarBri\u2019s iOS mobile application.","Thus, Defendant effectively denied the use of this significant feature of the bar review course to Claire.","Defendant also failed to remove accessibility barriers to BarBri\u2019s electronic versions of the books and lecture handouts.","The PDF versions of books and handouts did not contain page numbers detectable by JAWS, and the Microsoft Word versions of the same documents did not provide indicia of the page numbers corresponding to the PDF and hard copy versions.","BarBri unnecessarily made it difficult for Claire to locate certain sections of the textbooks specified in lectures or in the online planner.","Furthermore, Defendant printed the Braille version of its Conviser \u201cmini review\u201d with inaccurate use of Braille italics indicators.","This is an important book that provides an outline of the materials students are supposed to study for the bar exam.","BarBri placed Dots 4-6 Braille italics symbols in front of each word in an italicized portion, instead of proper brailling, which would have these symbols at the beginning and end of an entire portion of the text, not in front of each word.","In doing so, Defendant made it extremely and unnecessarily difficult for Claire to read the mini review.","Claire complained to BarBri\u2019s National ADA Director about these accessibility barriers and requested that they be removed, but BarBri did not take any action to modify or fix the inaccessible features on its website or app, and did not take any action to address the accessibility issues with BarBri\u2019s books and lectures, even though removing these barriers is a reasonable request that would accommodate the many people with visual disabilities who pay BarBri to help them prepare for bar exams, and would not be an undue burden for Defendant or alter the nature of its services.","BarBri has ample resources to provide these relatively simple auxiliary aids and services.","In the end, BarBri\u2019s unequal and inferior test preparation services caused Claire to score below her sighted peers and be unable to pass the bar exam.","On July 29, 2015, the Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs emailed and sent a letter on Claire\u2019s behalf to BarBri informing the company about these accessibility issues and asking BarBri to respond by August 10, 2015.","But BarBri ignored the letter and has still refused to respond.","Plaintiffs and many other blind law students will be taking Defendant\u2019s bar review course for the July 2016 bar exam, and they will encounter the same accessibility barriers that BarBri has refused to address or remove.","CLASS ALLEGATIONS 51.","Plaintiffs seek certification of the following Class pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 23(a), 23(b)(2) and\/or 23(b)(3): \u201call legally blind individuals who, on or after April 25, 2014, have taken or will take a BarBri bar review course at a time when BarBri\u2019s website, mobile application, or other course materials was or is not fully accessible to legally blind students.\u201d","Impracticability of Joinder 52.","The persons in the class are so numerous that joinder of all such persons is impractical and the disposition of their claims in a class action is a benefit to the parties and to the Court.","Upon information and belief, dozens to hundreds of legally blind individuals are part of the proposed class, and the members of the class are geographically dispersed throughout the United States.","Commonality 53.","This case arises out of Defendants\u2019 common policy and\/or practice of denying blind persons full and equal access to the goods and services of BarBri\u2019s bar review course, since parts of its website, mobile application, and course materials are inaccessible to blind persons.","The central question in this case concerns whether BarBri\u2019s bar review course violated the ADA and Chapter 121 by failing to provide proper auxiliary aids and services, make reasonable accommodations, and maintaining a policy and practice of failing to make its course materials accessible to blind students.","Because the same type of course materials are used in all jurisdictions, the answer to these legal questions will produce common answers for all class members.","Plaintiffs\u2019 claims raise subsidiary common questions that will also have common answers for each class member, including whether BarBri maintains a place of public accommodation under the ADA or a public facility under Chapter 121, and whether BarBri\u2019s course materials were inaccessible to blind students.","Typicality 56.","The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of those of the proposed Class.","Plaintiffs challenge a single policy by which BarBri provided inaccessible course materials to students throughout the United States.","Plaintiff Stanley experienced the type of accessibility under BarBri\u2019s uniform course materials that other legally blind students experienced, and Plaintiffs Manners and Stewart will experience the same type of accessibility under BarBri\u2019s uniform course materials that other legally blind students will experience in applying for the July 2016 bar exam, as well as future bar exams.","The relief sought in this action primarily consists of a declaration that BarBri violated the rights of Plaintiffs Stanley, Manners, and Stewart, and all of the other members of the class under the ADA and the Texas Human Resources Code, an order requiring BarBri to make its course materials accessible to legally blind students, and an order requiring BarBri to uniformly compensate students who have been subjected to BarBri\u2019s inaccessible course materials.","Adequacy 58.","Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the members of the Class.","Plaintiffs are aware of no conflict with any other member of the Class.","Plaintiffs understand their obligations as class representatives, and have already undertaken steps to fulfil them, and are prepared to continue to fulfill their duties as class representatives.","Plaintiffs have retained and are represented by counsel competent and experienced in complex class action litigation, including class actions brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Texas state law requiring full and equal access for people with disabilities.","Rule 23(b)(2) 60.","This action is maintainable as a class action under Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(2) because Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, making appropriate both declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to Plaintiffs and the Class as a whole.","Barbri has violated the ADA and the Texas Human Resources Code in the same manner as to all members of the Class by failing to provide legally blind students with a fully accessible web site, mobile application, and course materials.","As such, BarBri has acted or refused to act on ground generally applicable to the Class.","Plaintiffs seek monetary relief that is incidental to the declaratory relief that Plaintiffs seek in this action.","Specifically, Plaintiffs seek a refund of their Bar Bri registration fees, which can easily be determined, and $300 of monetary relief for each class member, the presumptive figure of monetary relief that is provided for under the Texas Human Resources Code.","Because Plaintiffs seek identical amounts of monetary damages for all class members, the monetary relief in this action may be calculated in a simple, objective, and mechanical manner.","Rule 23(b)(3) 63.","Alternatively, class certification is appropriate under Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(3) because questions of law and fact common to Class members predominate over questions affecting only individual class members, and because a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this litigation.","By resolving the common legal and factual questions identified above in a single class proceeding, each member of the class will receive a determination of whether BarBri violated his or her rights under the ADA and the Texas Human Resources Code.","These questions predominate over the few, if any, issues that may affect individual class members.","Upon information and belief, there are no other pending lawsuits in which similar members of the Class have raised similar allegations against BarBri.","It is desirable to concentrate the litigation of the claims in this particular forum, as BarBri\u2019s corporate headquarters are in this District, and as BarBri\u2019s website states that all claims against BarBri should be brought in this District.","There are no difficulties in managing this case as a class action.","References to Plaintiffs shall be deemed to include the named Plaintiffs and each member of the class, unless otherwise indicated.","CLAIMS FOR RELIEF Violations of the ADA 69.","Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as though fully set forth herein.","On July 12, 1990, Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act \u201cto provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1).","Title III of the ADA states that \u201c[n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any public place of accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\u201d","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(a).","Plaintiffs are all blind and therefore qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102, et seq. 73.","Defendant Barbri leases and\/or owns lecture halls and offices around the country in which it offers its in-person lectures, and owns and operates its web site and mobile application.","It further entered into contracts to provide services to Plaintiffs as customers.","Thus, it is a \u201cplace of public accommodation\u201d within the meaning of the ADA.","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181(7)(D).","Defendant BarBri is a \u201cprivate entity who owns, leases, (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation,\u201d and therefore has an obligation to comply with Title III of the ADA.","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(a).","The benefits provided by BarBri\u2019s website and mobile app, including the MPQ question sets, Essay Architect, and Conviser Mini Review, are goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and\/or accommodations of BarBri.","By refusing to provide an inaccessible website, mobile app, and course materials, BarBri denies blind students full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and\/or accommodations that BarBri makes available to its sighted customers.","Accordingly, BarBri is systematically violating the ADA by denying blind customers the benefits of access to or the full and equal enjoyment of its website, mobile app, course materials, and other bar review services.","BarBri\u2019s violations are ongoing and continue to deny accessibility to blind students who use or wish to use BarBri\u2019s bar review services to study for a bar exam.","Under Title III of the ADA, Defendant is committing discrimination by failing: to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities;

(\u201cChapter 121\u201d) by maintaining barriers to the accessibility of its services for blind students who use talking screen reading software and failing to make reasonable accommodations or provide auxiliary aids or services, and thus unnecessarily hindering blind students from entering the legal field by preventing them from fully, equally, and adequately preparing for the bar exam.","In this putative class action lawsuit, Plaintiffs seek an order requiring BarBri to provide bar examination preparation services that are accessible to blind students, so that they can enjoy full and equal access to BarBri\u2019s bar review services, which include the website and mobile application that BarBri uses to prepare students for the bar exam.","This action also seeks compensation for blind students who signed up for and relied on BarBri\u2019s review services to study for their bar exams, but found these services to be inaccessible to them and other blind students.","All three named Plaintiffs are blind individuals who used and\/or are currently using BarBri\u2019s bar review course to study for a bar exam, but encountered or are currently encountering significant accessibility barriers to BarBri\u2019s website, http:\/\/www.barbri.com, and mobile application (BarBri App (v1.5.1)).","In this action, Plaintiffs seek to redress the injuries they have suffered or will suffer if BarBri is allowed to continue to discriminate against blind students in violation of federal and state law.","JURISDICTION 4.","This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(a)(4), because Plaintiffs assert a federal civil rights claim under the federal ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182.","This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 Texas state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7  1367.","This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant, including general jurisdiction, as Defendants\u2019 corporate headquarters are located in this District.","Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b)(1), as both Defendants reside in this district, where their corporate headquarters are located.","Venue is also proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b)(2), as a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the federal and state claims occurred in this district.","In addition, the terms and conditions on BarBri\u2019s website state that students who wish to assert legal claims against BarBri should bring those claims in this federal district.","PARTIES 7.","Plaintiff Claire Stanley is a resident of Silver Spring, Maryland and took the Pennsylvania bar exam in July 2015.","As she did not pass, she plans to take the bar exam again in July 2016.","She is currently enrolled in the BarBri course.","Claire is blind and uses the Job Access With Speech (\u201cJAWS\u201d) screen reader on her computer to access and review materials on the Internet.","She also uses an iPhone with VoiceOver (a talking screen reader for all Apple Products) to access all of the menus and applications on her phone.","Claire became interested in advocacy for herself and others beginning in high school, when she became involved with the National Youth Leadership Network, a youth-led and youth-driven national non-profit organization to promote youth leadership and education.","It is a national voice for young leaders with disabilities.","Claire was even selected to travel to attend a NYLN conference.","From then on, Claire knew that she wanted to be a lawyer, and majored in political science in college.","She applied to attend law school during college and was delighted to begin law school after her graduation.","Claire realized that she wanted to practice disability rights law or general civil rights law, and never strayed from this goal during law school.","She held internships at various civil rights and disability rights organizations and federal agencies, including at the Department of Justice, Disability Rights Section.","Claire is now a fellow at the federally mandated protection and advocacy agency for the rights of people with disabilities in Washington DC, University Legal Services.","Once she is able to pass the bar, she will finally be able to fully represent her clients and achieve her goal of being a civil rights attorney.","Plaintiff Derek Manners recently graduated from Harvard Law School in May of 2016 and plans to take the bar exam in July 2016.","He is currently enrolled in the BarBri course.","Manners is blind and uses JAWS on his computer to access and review materials on the Internet.","He also uses an iPhone with VoiceOver to access all of the menus and applications on his phone.","Derek was curious about being an attorney from a young age.","His interest in the connection between policy and the law inspired him to join the debate team in high school.","In college at the University of Texas, he majored in political science and economics, and knew he wanted to practice political law.","During law school, Derek interned at the Office of the Connecticut Attorney General, where he investigated a Wall Street bank that was heavily involved in the mortgage security crisis.","Derek also served as the Legislative Director for the National Federation of the Blind (a civil rights advocacy group led by and consisting of blind individuals from around the country) of Massachusetts, where he monitored legislation at the state level that affected persons with disabilities, was the point person for coordinating meetings with members of Congress in Massachusetts, and mobilized NFB of Massachusetts membership for social media campaigns.","Derek is working part-time at the National Federation of the Blind in its Governmental Affairs Office, and will be starting a job at the firm of Allen Overy (practicing political law) in the fall.","He will need to pass the bar in order to achieve his goal of practicing political law.","Plaintiff Christopher Stewart recently graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law and plans to take the bar exam in July 2016.","He is currently enrolled in the BarBri course.","Stuart is blind and uses JAWS on his computer to access and review materials on the Internet.","He also uses an iPhone with VoiceOver to access all of the menus and applications on his phone.","Christopher always had an interest in government and political science, as well as the law.","His passion for social justice dates back to elementary school, when he first read To Kill a Mockingbird.","It remains one of his favorite novels.","As an undergraduate, he majored in violin performance and worked as a professional violinist for a few years.","But his passion for law drove him to attend law school.","During law school, Christopher worked for the Kentucky attorney general, where he was involved in researching how new EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act impact the state.","This issue is now being litigated by attorneys general from over a dozen states.","Christopher also worked for one of Kentucky's leading trial lawyers, where he prepared pleadings, motions, and briefs for cases involving issues as diverse as medical malpractice, qui tam\/False Claims Act actions, and aircraft mechanical negligence.","In addition, he served as president of his law school's Election Law Society and was an editor of his school's flagship law review for two years.","Christopher also served as Legislative Director for the National Federation of the Blind of Kentucky.","His duties included meeting with representatives of Kentucky\u2019s entire congressional delegation, advocating for specific issues important to blind individuals in Kentucky and nationally, participating in face-toface meetings, making phone calls, and coordinating letter writing campaigns.","Christopher will serve as a federal law clerk in the fall.","Following his term, he hopes to practice employment law, and would like to work on the defense side, helping companies create an ADA accessibility plan and favorably resolve claims of discrimination.","Christopher recently got married and hopes to pass the bar before beginning his clerkship.","Defendant Barbri, Inc., aka BarBri Bar Review, is a company that sells and provides to students a bar exam preparation course, which includes online and in-person lectures and course material.","FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 27.","For sighted and blind people, the Internet is a significant source of information and education, and offers a wealth of information, services, and products with instant availability and without the need to travel.","For students, the Internet has become a critical and necessary tool for learning, studying, and preparing for examinations, especially for students who study for the bar exam in jurisdictions across America.","In many places of higher education in America, the Internet is the exclusive or primary means by which students learn and interact with their teachers and classmates.","Like other educational institutions and exam preparation courses that have increased their reliance on the Internet to teach, inform, and evaluate students, BarBri has significantly increased its use of Internet-based resources to enhance and facilitate its traditional bar exam preparation courses.","For example, BarBri offers an online live chat feature to connect students with tutors, an online planner, online practice questions and study outlines, online lecture notes, and online lecture videos.","Upon information and belief, by harnessing the power of the Internet to teach its bar examination courses, BarBri has reduced its costs per student and increased its ability to earn revenue and profit from its bar review courses.","Blind individuals access the Internet from computers by using screen access software, which vocalizes visual information on a computer screen or displays the content on a refreshable Braille display.","This software represents the only method by which blind Americans can independently access the Internet and related computer programs.","Without screen reading software and proper coding of a web site and mobile application to function with this software, blind persons cannot fully access the information, services, and products that companies like BarBri provide through the Internet.","Several screen access software programs are available to blind users of Windows and Apple operating system-enabled computers and devices.","The most popular screen access software for a Windows computer is Job Access With Speech (\u201cJAWS\u201d), which must be purchased and installed separately.","For Apple users, the only screen access software is VoiceOver, which is built into all Apple products.","While each software program may have differences in how the user operates the software, each program requires information on the Internet to be capable of being rendered into text so that blind computer users may access it.","Like most law students, all three plaintiffs knew they would have to take a bar prep course to pass the bar.","So, before graduating from law school, they all entered into agreements to take BarBri\u2019s bar exam course and relied on BarBri\u2019s resources to prepare them to take and pass the bar examination.","All three plaintiffs requested reasonable accommodations from BarBri well before the course began, and BarBri assured them that its bar review courses would be fully accessible to them and would provide them with preparation equivalent to sighted students to take their bar exam.","Defendant\u2019s website and mobile application provide practice questions to help students prepare for the Multistate Bar Exam (\u201cMBE\u201d), which is a one-day multiple choice test that all students must take to pass the bar exam in any state (with the exception of Louisiana).","BarBri\u2019s website and mobile application provide real-time feedback to students on essay topics and MBEs, and offer many other features to help students study for and prepare for taking the bar examination in July or February of each year.","BarBri\u2019s website and mobile application are used extensively and regularly nationwide, including in the state of Texas.","BarBri uses its web site and app to grade and rank students against themselves, monitor their own progress, and to receive assignments tailored to their own level of progression.","According to its website, www.thebarbrigroup.com\/the-new-barbri\/bar-review, BarBri is the \u201conly course available to students in all fifty states... With significant cost of law school education and so much at stake, it makes sense for law students to choose a proven partner and support system they can count on to teach what they need to know to pass the bar exam, the first time.","BarBri has become synonymous with bar prep success,\u201d and has become the \u201c#1 most trusted\u201d bar review course in the United States.","Also on its website, www.barbri.com\/bar-review-course, BarBri specifically advertises its web site and mobile application as part of its innovative course which offers the best possible learning experience \u201cin class, online and mobile.\u201d","BarBri highlights its online personal study plan, noting that \u201cThe easy-to-use online Personal Study Plan is your daily to-do list during the BARBRI Bar Review course.","It continually monitors your progress and automatically recommends assignments aligned to your unique areas of need....","Your Personal Study Plan analyzes more than 1,000 points of data collected from your assignments, grades, practice exams and practice essays.","This helps you hone in and improve on areas of law that need the most attention.\u201d","BarBri highlights other online components as part of its innovative learning course, such as the online Essay Architect: \u201cThe online Essay Architect tool provides immediate feedback for higher scoring essays.","It enhances your ability to write the lawyer-like answers that the bar examiners are looking for on the bar exam.... Using drag-and-drop features, you build your practice essay following the standard IRAC format.","Immediate feedback reinforces organization and structure.\u201d","BarBri\u2019s Simulated MBE with Pass Predictor component is advertised on BarBri\u2019s web site as by far, the \u201cbest predictor of bar exam success.\u201d","\u201cOur realistic 200-question Simulated MBE compares your test results with other BARBRI students the largest, most statistically valid group of bar exam takers nationwide.","\u201cBarBri prepares students to take the bar examination in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.","Every jurisdiction except for Louisiana administers and relies upon the results of the MBE, which is a 200-question multiple-choice examination that the National Conference of Bar Examiners developed.","In addition to requiring students to take the MBE, jurisdictions require students to answer a variety of essay questions in narrative form and state-specific multiple choice questions to evaluate their legal analysis and writing skills.","BarBri\u2019s courses and materials prepare students to master all portions of the relevant state bar exam, score as high as possible on the exam, and pass the exam.","In the jurisdictions where students take the MBE, BarBri uses \u201cMPQ Question Sets\u201d for students to review and answer questions that are the same or similar to the questions that will be asked in the MBE during the bar exam.","It is very important for students to score as high as possible on the MBE, because in most jurisdictions the MBE provides students with the largest \u2013 or one of the largest \u2013 opportunities to earn points that are needed to meet the minimum point threshold for passing the bar exam in the relevant jurisdiction.","In addition, some jurisdictions will only allow lawyers who have already been admitted to another jurisdiction to waive into their state bars if they previously obtained a specific MBE score during a prior bar exam.","Thus, even if a student has passed the bar exam in a jurisdiction, such as Texas, he or she may not automatically be able to become a member of another jurisdiction, such as the District of Columbia, if his or her MBE score on the prior bar exam did not meet a certain threshold.","Instead, he or she would have to take a new bar exam, and would likely incur further expenses and time to prepare to take the bar exam again.","One key component of BarBri is \u201cBARBRI AMP.\u201d","BarBri states that \u201cBARBRI AMP is a highly effective way to master the black letter law and maximize your MBE score.","It's built right into your Personal Study Plan \u2014 only when you need it based on assessments of your bar study progress.","BARBRI AMP employs interactive software techniques used by video game developers to keep you engaged, motivated and focused.","It quickly assesses your level of knowledge and confidence in core areas of law, then focuses your attention where you need additional study.","BARBRI AMP monitors your aptitude in real time and instantly configures follow-up questions until you\u2019ve demonstrated a solid grasp of a concept.","No other legal study aid does this.\u201d","Blind students of BarBri cannot use this online component due to its inaccessibility, and thus cannot take advantage of BarBri\u2019s real-time grading, ranking, and individualized progression of study.","On BarBri\u2019s main page, www.barbri.com, there is a link to a web page entitled \u201cADA ACCOMMODATION,\u201d which states that \u201cBarBri complies with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and provides appropriate auxiliary aids and services to students with disabilities to ensure effective communication.\u201d","BarBri was displaying the same statement on its website during the time that each of the Plaintiffs enrolled in BarBri\u2019s bar review course and at the time that Claire was preparing to take the bar exam last year.","BarBri\u2019s enrollment form is used nationwide and also states that, \u201cBarBri complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and provides appropriate auxiliary aids and services to students with disabilities.\u201d","However, upon information and belief, the auxiliary aids and services that BarBri provides are not appropriate, as they do not ensure equivalent effective communication with its blind students and sighted students.","On the same page that BarBri promises that it complies with the ADA, BarBri states that \u201cpractice testing\u201d is one of the \u201cthree main components of the BARBRI course,\u201d in addition to \u201clectures\u201d and \u201csubstantive law outlines.\u201d","BarBri\u2019s website further states that \u201cThe BARBRI course is different from law school courses.","It is extremely condensed and requires you to blend the three components above to bring you to peak performance for your bar exam.\u201d","BarBri\u2019s practice testing primarily occurs on the BARBRI website, www.barbri.com.","Accordingly, BarBri is and has been fully aware that students with disabilities, including blind students, need to be able to fully access BarBri\u2019s website to engage in the practice testing that is a critical and necessary part of preparing for the bar exam.","When Claire was studying for the bar exam in the summer of 2015, BarBri\u2019s website identified an ADA Manager to whom students with disabilities should direct inquiries about BarBri\u2019s compliance with the ADA and\/or requests for reasonable accommodations: ADA Director, BARBRI Bar Review, 200 W. Adams, Suite 250, Chicago, IL 60606, Fax: (312) 2884607, ADARequests@BARBRI.com.","Prior to commencing her bar review course in 2015, Claire contacted BarBri\u2019s former National ADA Director, Kate Levine, and requested that her textbooks, lecture notes, and handouts be provided to her in an electronic format so that she could access them.","Defendant\u2019s employee, Ms. Levine, assured Claire that it would provide these materials in an accessible format.","Prior to commencing the 2016 bar review course, Derek and Christopher also contacted Defendant\u2019s current national ADA manager to request materials for the July 2016 bar review course in an alternate format, and Defendant assured them that they would be made accessible.","While Claire studied for the July 2015 bar exam, BarBri\u2019s website contained accessibility barriers preventing Claire from accessing it, including the \u201cMPQ Question Sets\u201d in the StudySmart section that allows students to engage in practice testing for the MBE.","While Defendant\u2019s website allowed Claire to read the text of the questions, it prevented her from reading the answer choices, as they appeared in an inaccessible flash window.","Claire attended the live lectures throughout her bar review course last summer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.","The lecturers often referred her to online components of the BarBri course, such as submitting practice test answers online, following the BarBri\u2019s online planner for daily assignments, and receiving personalized assignments online based on their individualized test results.","One lecturer who referenced this specifically was Dale Larrimore, one of the BarBri Regional Directors.","However, the online planner, practice tests with real-time scoring, and other components referenced by the lectures were and are not now fully accessible to blind students.","Claire also recalls that students were allowed to attend the BarBri in-person lectures anywhere in the country and at any time, so long as they showed their BarBri ID badge.","Chris also attended in-person BarBri lectures at his law school, and recalls that the handouts which the students are required to fill in during the lectures were provided on the BarBri mobile application.","Chris and the other two Plaintiffs are not fully able to access the application with their iPhones.","Derek listens to the lectures online, but is aware that for many who attend the lectures in person, BarBri simply plays a video of the live lecture in the classroom, and makes the same references described above to the online components of the BarBri course.","Defendant has also failed to make the answer choices of the MPQ question sets accessible.","BarBri instructs students to first read the \u201ccall of the question\u201d before reading the question itself.","Yet, the accessibility barriers prevent them from doing so by keeping them from first reading the answer choices before scrolling back up and reading the question itself.","Because Defendant is, in effect, forcing the plaintiffs to read the question and answer choices in chronological order without pause, they are not able to take the practice in the manner BarBri advises its customers.","BarBri further proclaims that the \u201cEssay Architect\u201d feature of its website will help students write better essays for bar exams.","Students using Essay Architect must rearrange phrases in a pre-written essay to organize them in the proper format, and this is done by dragging and dropping the phrases.","They receive feedback in the margins about their formatting.","Defendant does not provide this feature to Plaintiffs, as it does not make the drag-and-drop function accessible to their screen readers.","BarBri has also failed to allow Plaintiffs to detect that certain phrases relating to the area of law covered by the essay are highlighted with their screen readers, thereby preventing them from receiving the vital feedback on essay construction that they need and that all of their sighted peers were and are now receiving.","Defendant has also failed to make the same features on its website accessible to Plaintiffs when they used BarBri\u2019s iOS mobile application, thereby preventing them from studying anywhere and at any time.","Thus, Defendant has effectively denied the use of this significant feature of the bar review course which it advertises.","Defendant has also failed to remove accessibility barriers to BarBri\u2019s electronic versions of the books and lecture handouts.","The PDF versions of books and handouts do not contain page numbers detectable by JAWS, and the Microsoft Word versions of the same documents did not provide indicia of the page numbers corresponding to the PDF and hard copy versions.","BarBri unnecessarily makes it difficult for Plaintiffs to locate certain sections of the textbooks specified in lectures or in the planner.","Furthermore, in the summer of 2015, Defendant printed the Braille version of its Conviser \u201cmini review\u201d with inaccurate use of Braille italics indicators.","This \u201cmini review\u201d is an important book that provides an outline of the materials that students are required to use in preparing for the bar exam.","BarBri placed Dots 4-6 Braille italics symbols in front of each word in an italicized portion, instead of proper brailling, which would have these symbols at the beginning and end of an entire portion of the text, not in front of each word.","In doing so, Defendant made it extremely and unnecessarily difficult for Claire to read the mini review in 2015.","Claire complained to BarBri\u2019s National ADA Director in 2015 about these accessibility barriers and requested that they be removed, but BarBri did not take any action to modify or fix the inaccessible features on its website or app, and did not take any action to address the accessibility issues with BarBri\u2019s books and lectures, even though removing these barriers is a reasonable request that would accommodate the many people with visual disabilities who pay BarBri to help them prepare for bar exams, would not be an undue burden for Defendant, or alter the nature of its services.","BarBri has ample resources to provide these relatively simple auxiliary aids and services.","In the end, BarBri\u2019s unequal and inferior test preparation services caused Claire to score below her sighted peers and be unable to pass the 2015 bar exam.","On July 29, 2015, the Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs emailed and sent a letter on Claire\u2019s behalf to BarBri informing the company about these accessibility issues and asking BarBri to respond by August 10, 2015.","However, BarBri ignored the letter and has still refused to respond.","Plaintiffs and many other blind law students are taking Defendant\u2019s bar review course for the July 2016 bar exam, and they are encountering and will encounter the same accessibility barriers that BarBri has refused to address or remove.","Plaintiffs have had the following additional issues thus far while taking the 2016 course: \u2022 The radio buttons for the answer choices on the \u201cMPQ Question Sets\u201d in the StudySmart component are not accessible.","\u2022 Plaintiffs are not able to speed up, slow down, or jump around lectures on BarBri\u2019s web site or mobile application, as users not using screen readers are able to do.","\u2022 For general lectures, Plaintiffs are not able to exit from the online player and then re-open the player and begin the lecture where they left off.","Sighted students can easily pause, rewind, fast-forward, and exit lectures without losing their place.","\u2022 Plaintiff, Christopher Stewart, has had many lectures for which Defendant did not provide corresponding accessible handouts on time.","There were days when Christopher had to listen to lectures for which he did not receive the handouts, and this put him days behind where he should have been in his study.","Claire faced a similar situation last time she used Defendant\u2019s services.","BarBri still has not provided Christopher with a handout for his Transactions course lecture.","\u2022 BarBri also failed to provide Christopher with timely accessible outlines for his state-specific distinction lessons on time.","He needed these outlines as he progressed from one lesson to the next.","However, BarBri provided them late, and all at once, making him fall further behind in his studying for the bar.","\u2022 BarBri also provides students a percentile rank after every practice test.","BarBri tells students to monitor progress while studying for the bar exam by using the percentile rank graphs featured on BarBri\u2019s website.","However, the percentile rank feature is not accessible to Plaintiffs.","Furthermore, BarBri does not allow Plaintiffs to self-grade essays online, which is a feature it offers sighted individuals.","\u2022 BarBri\u2019s website contains combo boxes (which are the dropdown menus) for its online planner and other components that are not fully accessible.","\u2022 Plaintiffs are not able to access the pop-up notifications on BarBri\u2019s website, despite BarBri\u2019s warnings that the notifications are important for students to read.","\u2022 Plaintiffs cannot access dates beyond the current week on BarBri\u2019s online assignment calendar.","\u2022 Plaintiffs are not able to self-grade their essays, because they cannot submit them online, as the Essay Architect component remains inaccessible.","\u2022 Rather than being able to receive, submit, and do assignments online, Plaintiffs must access BarBri\u2019s materials through a One Drive folder, or on a flash drive sent via mail.","Yet, even BarBri\u2019s One Drive folder is inaccessible unless Plaintiffs use the Mozilla Firefox web browser.","One would not know to utilize Firefox to access the One Drive folder unless discovering this by trial and error.","BarBri\u2019s One Drive folder should be accessible with all web browsers that operate with screen readers.","Plaintiffs have fallen behind their class-mates due to these accessibility barriers and do not even know how they are performing relative to their sighted peers.","They fear that they will not be able to pass the bar exam this year.","Defendant\u2019s accessibility barriers still persist today, which Plaintiffs are experiencing while preparing for the July 2016 exam.","Due to BarBri\u2019s failure to remove these accessibility barriers, Claire has been forced to hire a tutor through BarBri, and was charged extra for the tutor.","CLASS ALLEGATIONS 65.","Plaintiffs seek certification of the following Class pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 23(a), 23(b)(2) and\/or 23(b)(3): \u201cAll legally blind individuals nationwide who, on or after April 25, 2014, took, plan to take or attempted to take a BarBri bar review course at a time when BarBri\u2019s website, mobile application, or other course materials was or is not fully accessible to legally blind students, or who have been discouraged from taking the BarBri bar review course due to such inaccessibility.\u201d","Impracticability of Joinder 66.","The persons in the class are so numerous that joinder of all such persons is impractical and the disposition of their claims in a class action is a benefit to the parties and to the Court.","Upon information and belief, dozens to hundreds of legally blind individuals are part of the proposed class, and the members of the class are geographically dispersed throughout the United States.","Commonality 67.","This case arises out of Defendants\u2019 common policy and\/or practice of denying blind persons full and equal access to the goods and services of BarBri\u2019s bar review course, since parts of its website, mobile application, and course materials are inaccessible to blind persons.","The central question in this case concerns whether BarBri\u2019s bar review course violated the ADA and Chapter 121 by failing to provide proper auxiliary aids and services, make reasonable accommodations, and maintaining a policy and practice of failing to make its course materials accessible to blind students.","Because the same type of course materials are used in all jurisdictions, the answer to these legal questions will produce common answers for all class members.","Plaintiffs\u2019 claims raise subsidiary common questions that will also have common answers for each class member, including whether BarBri maintains a place of public accommodation under the ADA or a public facility under Chapter 121, whether it constitutes a private entity which offers a course related to licensing for professional purposes and whether BarBri\u2019s course materials were inaccessible to blind students.","Typicality 70.","The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of those of the proposed Class.","Plaintiffs challenge a single policy by which BarBri provided inaccessible course materials to students throughout the United States.","Plaintiffs experienced the type of inaccessibility under BarBri\u2019s uniform course materials that other legally blind students experienced.","The relief sought in this action primarily consists of a declaration that BarBri violated the rights of Plaintiffs Stanley, Manners, and Stewart, and all of the other members of the class under the ADA and the Texas Human Resources Code, an order requiring BarBri to make its course materials accessible to legally blind students, and an order requiring BarBri to uniformly compensate students who have been subjected to BarBri\u2019s inaccessible course materials.","Adequacy 72.","Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the members of the Class.","Plaintiffs are aware of no conflict with any other member of the Class.","Plaintiffs understand their obligations as class representatives, and have already undertaken steps to fulfil them, and are prepared to continue to fulfill their duties as class representatives.","Plaintiffs have retained and are represented by counsel competent and experienced in complex class action litigation, including class actions brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Texas state law requiring full and equal access for people with disabilities.","Rule 23(b)(2) 74.","This action is maintainable as a class action under Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(2) because Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, making appropriate both declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to Plaintiffs and the Class as a whole.","Barbri has violated the ADA and the Texas Human Resources Code in the same manner as to all members of the Class by failing to provide legally blind students with a fully accessible web site, mobile application, and course materials.","As such, BarBri has acted or refused to act on ground generally applicable to the Class.","Plaintiffs seek monetary relief that is incidental to the declaratory relief that Plaintiffs seek in this action.","Specifically, Plaintiffs seek a refund of their Bar Bri registration fees, which can easily be determined, and $300 of monetary relief for each class member, the presumptive figure of monetary relief that is provided for under the Texas Human Resources Code.","Because Plaintiffs seek identical amounts of monetary damages for all class members, the monetary relief in this action may be calculated in a simple, objective, and mechanical manner.","Rule 23(b)(3) 77.","Alternatively, class certification is appropriate under Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(3) because questions of law and fact common to Class members predominate over questions affecting only individual class members, and because a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this litigation.","By resolving the common legal and factual questions identified above in a single class proceeding, each member of the class will receive a determination of whether BarBri violated his or her rights under the ADA and the Texas Human Resources Code.","These questions predominate over the few, if any, issues that may affect individual class members.","Upon information and belief, there are no other pending lawsuits in which similar members of the Class have raised similar allegations against BarBri.","It is desirable to concentrate the litigation of the claims in this particular forum, as BarBri\u2019s corporate headquarters are in this District, and as BarBri\u2019s website states that all claims against BarBri should be brought in this District.","There are no difficulties in managing this case as a class action.","References to Plaintiffs shall be deemed to include the named Plaintiffs and each member of the class, unless otherwise indicated.","CLAIMS FOR RELIEF Violations of the ADA 83.","Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the foregoing allegations as though fully set forth herein.","On July 12, 1990, Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act \u201cto provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1).","Title III of the ADA states that \u201c[n]o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\u201d","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(a).","Plaintiffs are all legally blind and therefore qualified individuals with disabilities within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102, et seq. 87.","Defendant Barbri leases and\/or owns lecture halls and offices around the country in which it offers its in-person lectures, either live or by video, and owns and operates its web site and mobile application.","It further entered into contracts to provide services to Plaintiffs as customers.","BarBri is a \u201cplace of education\u201d which is specifically included as a place of public accommodation in the twelve categories of Title III of the ADA.","28 C.F.R. 36.104(10) and operates \u201clecture halls\u201d, which are also included as places of public accommodation in the twelve categories of Title III of the ADA.","28 C.F.R. 36.104(4).","Thus, BarBri is a \u201cprivate entity which owns, leases, (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation,\u201d and therefore has an obligation to comply with Title III of the ADA.","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(a).","In order to receive the full benefit of the BarBri lectures, both in-person or online, students are required to, and are instructed to, use components of Barbri\u2019s online course material, including using course outlines, taking and submitting on-line practice tests, taking on-line MPQ question sets, submitting essays, following the online calendar for assignments, and receiving personalized assignments based on an individual\u2019s online practice test scores.","Access to Barbri\u2019s on-line course material is integral to full and equal enjoyment of its lecture halls and place of education.","The benefits provided by BarBri\u2019s website and mobile app, including the MPQ question sets, Essay Architect, and Conviser Mini Review, are goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and\/or accommodations of BarBri.","By refusing to provide an inaccessible website, mobile app, and course materials, BarBri denies blind students full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and\/or accommodations, including its in-peson and online lectures, that BarBri makes available to its sighted customers.","Accordingly, BarBri is systematically violating the ADA by denying blind customers the benefits of access to or the full and equal enjoyment of its website, mobile app, course materials, lectures, and other bar review services.","This refusal also denies Plaintiffs the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not separate or different from those without disabilities.","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(D).","BarBri\u2019s violations are ongoing and continue to deny accessibility to blind students who use or wish to use BarBri\u2019s full bar review services to study for a bar exam.","Under Title III of the ADA, Defendant is also committing discrimination by failing to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities; and failing to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services.","42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii).","By refusing to modify its website, mobile app, and course materials, even when Plaintiffs have made reasonable requests and have lodged complaints, and when such modifications would not be an undue burden for BarBri and would not alter the nature of BarBri\u2019s services, BarBri has denied Plaintiffs, and continues to deny Plaintiffs, on the basis of their disability, the same access to BarBri\u2019s goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and\/or accommodations as the access provided to individuals without disabilities.","A public accommodation is also required to furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities.","28 C.F.R. 36.303(c).","The term auxiliary aids and services includes screen reader software and accessible electronic and information technology, or other effective methods of making visually delivered materials available to individuals who are blind or have low vision.","28 C.F.R. 36.303(b)(2).","The auxiliary aid and service in this instance is screen reader software, and the coding and tagging on Barbri\u2019s website and mobile application that is necessary for screen reader software, such as talking screen readers, to read and access the content.","Such access is necessary to grant effective communication with BarBri\u2019s blind students throughout the bar review course.","By failing to provide materials in a timely manner, providing materials in inaccessible formats, and preventing blind students from accessing all the online components of the bar review course with their screen readers by refusing to eliminate accessibility barriers, BarBri is denying Plaintiffs and other blind students effective communication.","BarBri is also a private entity which offers a course related to licensing for professional purposes.","28 C.F.R. 36.102(a)(3).","Thus, it is covered by Title III of the ADA 100.","Any course covered by this section must be modified to ensure that the place and manner in which the course is given are accessible.","ADA Technical Assistance Manual, III.4.6200, available at www.ada.gov\/taman3.html 101.","This includes providing auxiliary aids or services, except where to do so would fundamentally alter the course or result in an undue burden.","BarBri has not shown that eliminating accessibility barriers to its web site or mobile application would constitute a fundamental alteration to its course or be an undue burden.","BarBri is therefore required to ensure that its course is fully accessible.","Violations of Chapter 121 103.","Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the foregoing
