I. This Court Should Grant Review and Confirm that Threshold Challenges to the Jurisdiction of a Military Commission Are Not Subject to Councilman AbstentionIn Schlesinger v. Councilman, the Supreme Court announced the principle that federal habeas review is generally not appropriate before a military proceeding reaches its conclusion. See 420 U.S. 738, 759 (1975). Councilman abstention does not apply, however, when the jurisdiction of the military commission is itself the subject of a bona fide unresolved dispute. In 2006, the Court in Hamdan confirmed the viability of the Councilman doctrine, but held that Councilman7abstention is inapplicable to habeas petitions of Guantanamo detainees who sought to challenge the legality of the military commission convened to try them. See Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 585-89 (2006). The Court of Appeals' decision in this case departs from this Court's clear pronouncements and their underlying principles.A government predicated on checks and balances "serves not only to make Government accountable but also to secure individual liberty." Boumediene v. Bush, 533 U.S. 723, 742 (2008). In this context, this Court has underscored the vital role of the writ of habeas corpus, supplying a means by which the judicial branch contributes to "this delicate balance of governance, serving as an important judicial check on the Executive's discretion in the realm of detentions." Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 (2004) (plurality opinion). And because it is "an essential mechanism in the separation-of-powers scheme," Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 743-44, "[t]he writ of habeas corpus has always been available to review the legality of executive detention." INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 304305 (2001).In fact, "[w]here a person is detained by executive order, rather than, say, after being tried and convicted in a court, the need for collateral review is most pressing. A criminal conviction in the usual course occurs after a judicial hearing before a tribunal disinterested in the outcome and committed to procedures designed to ensure its own independence. These dynamics are not inherent in executive detention orders or executive review procedures. In this context the need for habeas corpus is more urgent." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 783. See also St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 301 ("At its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of8reviewing the legality of Executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest.").At the same time, the Court has long been skeptical of the military's authority to try individuals other than active service personnel. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11 (1955) (trial by court martial of an ex-serviceman is unconstitutional); Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957) (in peacetime, the military cannot constitutionally subject civilian defendants accompanying service members overseas to trial by court martial); Kinsella v. Singleton, 361 U.S. 234 (1960) (same). More recently, the Court explained that "trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure." Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 567.Given that the urgency of federal habeas review is at its greatest in the case of executive detention, and deference to the executive is most diminished with respect to the prosecution of civilians by the military, abstention is inappropriate when a defendant "raise[s] substantial arguments that a military tribunal lacks personal jurisdiction over him." Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 589 & n.20 (2006). "The theory is that setting aside the judgment after trial and conviction insufficiently redresses the defendant's right not to be tried by a tribunal that has no jurisdiction." Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 415 F.3d 33, 36-37 (D.C. Cir. 2005).Addressing a challenge by a Guantanamo detainee to the legality of a military commission, this Court refused to abstain from hearing the case, finding that none of the comity considerations that justified abstention in Councilman applied to commission trials of putative enemy combatants. Hamdan, 548 U.S. at9585-89. Furthermore, the Court noted that the detainee and the government had "a compelling interest in knowing in advance whether [the petitioner] may be tried by a military commission that arguably is without any basis in law and operates free from many of the procedural rules prescribed by Congress for courts-martial." Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 589-90. The Hamdan Court acknowledged that abstention with regard to such challenges might occasionally be permissible, but suggested that it would only be appropriate in circumstances akin to "military commissions convened on the battlefield." Id. at 590.Al-Nashiri seeks to argue that the crimes of which he is accused allegedly took place before the United States went to war.13 Because military commissions may try an individual only for crimes "committed in the context of and associated with hostilities," 10 U.S.C. § 950p(c), Petitioner's claim, if valid, would likely deprive the commission of its statutory jurisdiction to try him. Similarly, he contends that "the military commission has jurisdiction under Article I to try only war crimes, which by definition must have a nexus to hostilities." In re Al-Nashiri, 835 F.3d 110, 132 (D.C. Cir. 2016). In essence, Al-Nashiri's position is that the military commission lacks a statutory or constitutional basis for asserting jurisdiction over him. See In re Al-Nashiri, 835 F.3d at 116. This is precisely the kind of threshold allegation that this13 He is accused of conspiring to bomb the USS The Sullivans, and of organizing the bombings of the USS Cole and a French oil tanker off the coast of Yemen, in 2000 and 2002 respectively. See In re Al-Nashiri, 835 F.3d 110, 133-14 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Petitioner claims that "the first recognition of any hostilities in Yemen [was] in September 2003." Unclassified Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 16.10Court has expected lower courts to address, without resort to Councilman abstention. See Hamdan, 548 U.S. at 589 & n.20, 590.The Court of Appeals, however, took the view that neither Hamdan nor any other precedent required "an Article III court to determine in the first instance whether the military system has jurisdiction to try his offenses." In re Al-Nashiri, 835 F.3d at 133. This ruling, which will impact all Guantanamo detainees seeking to challenge executive determinations that they are enemy combatants subject to a military commission's jurisdiction,14 warrants prompt review. In granting broad deference to the military, the Court of Appeals has undermined this Court's clear precedent, as well as the indispensable role federal habeas review has performed to prevent executive overreach.II. This Court's Review is Required Because the Court of Appeals has Departed from the "Exceptional Circumstances" Doctrine Articulated by this Court.A. The Court of Appeals' Decision Has Materially Altered Exceptions to Abstention.The Court of Appeals not only erroneously applied Councilman abstention in an area to which it does not apply, but the court also fundamentally rewrote the Councilman abstention doctrine by excising important, longstanding exceptions to it. The importance of14 All habeas corpus petitions from Guantanamo detainees are consolidated in the United States Court for the District of Columbia. See Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 796.11clarifying the scope of habeas review and abstention doctrine now requires this Court's review.This Court has previously explained that Councilman abstention is inappropriate when "the harm sought to be averted is both great and immediate, of a kind that cannot be eliminated by . . . defense against a single criminal prosecution." Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U.S. 738, 756 (1975) (internal quotations omitted). Thus, petitioners must show something more than the usual "cost, anxiety, and inconvenience" incidental to criminal proceedings. Id. at 755. Beyond that guidance, however, the Councilman Court declined to "define those circumstances, if any, in which equitable intervention into pending court-martial proceedings might be justified." Id. at 761.Moreover, in other abstention cases, the Court has "left room for federal equitable intervention" through habeas relief "where there is a showing of bad faith or harassment by . . . officials responsible for the prosecution, where the . . . law to be applied in the criminal proceeding is flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions, or where there exist other extraordinary circumstances in which the necessary irreparable injury can be shown even in the absence of the usual prerequisites of bad faith and harassment." Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117, 124 (1975) (emphasis in the original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). These "extraordinary circumstances" are dependent on the facts of individual cases, such that it is "impossible to anticipate and define every situation that might create a sufficient threat of such great, immediate, and irreparable injury as to warrant intervention. . . " Id. at 124-25. In Younger v. Harris, which gave rise to abstention doctrine and its "exceptional circumstances" exception, the Court expressly12stated that, "[o]ther unusual situations calling for federal intervention might also arise, but there is no point in our attempting now to specify what they might be." 401 U.S. 37, 54 (1971).Despite this Court's guidance, the Court of Appeals narrowed when extraordinary circumstances would counsel against abstention. Under the Court of Appeals' newly minted position, the situation must now "both present the threat of great and immediate injury and render the alternative tribunal incapable of fairly and fully adjudicating the federal issues before it." In re Al-Nashiri, 835 F.3d 110, 128 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (emphasis in the original). On the basis of this revised test, the Court of Appeals refused to apply the exceptional circumstances exception to Al-Nashiri's petition. See id. at 128-130.The Court of Appeals purported to find support for its fresh approach in this Court's rulings in Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434 (1977); Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117 (1975); and Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592 (1975). See Al-Nashiri, 835 F.3d at 128, 129. Yet the Court of Appeals' test cannot be reconciled with the approach taken in any of those cases. In Trainor, the Court explained that federal restraint should be exercised "unless extraordinary circumstances were present warranting federal interference or unless [appellees'] state remedies were inadequate to litigate their federal . . . claim." Trainor, 431 U.S. at 446 (emphasis added). Under Trainor, extraordinary circumstances alone would permit review; the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has abandoned that disjunctive doctrine and replaced it with a test that requires a petitioner to establish both extraordinary circumstances and the unavailability of relief from the original tribunal. If left uncorrected, because13 of the D.C. Circuit's role in reviewing cases involving Guantanamo detainees, this departure from precedent will govern--and likely defeat--the pretrial habeas petition of every detainee. See Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 796 (2008) (permitting review of detainee habeas petitions to be consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia).15To be sure, triggering an exception to Councilman abstention requires a legitimate showing of extraordinary circumstances, which is no small feat. But nothing in this Court's prior rulings justifies transforming that stringent requirement into an impossible one. The traditional rule demanding extraordinary circumstances ensures by itself that federal courts do not disrupt ongoing proceedings in state or military tribunals while at the same time accommodating rare, fact-specific scenarios where habeas review is justified. See Boumediene, 553 U.S., at 780 ("Habeas is not a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose.").15 Nor is there support for the Court of Appeals' position in this Court's earlier cases. Kugler attempted to reconcile prior case law, but ultimately recognized that "[t]he scope of the exception . . . for `other extraordinary circumstances' has been left largely undefined by this Court." 421 U.S. at 125 & n.4. And the portion of Huffman cited by the Court of Appeals holds only that, in order to demonstrate exceptional circumstances, "a movant must show not merely the irreparable injury which is a normal prerequisite for an injunction, but also must show that the injury would be great and immediate." Huffman, 420 U.S. at 601 (internal quotation marks removed).14B. To Deny that Exceptional Delay Constitutes Extraordinary Circumstances Undermines the Rule of Law.To hold that judicial review is unavailable here, despite the extraordinary pretrial delay present in this case, undermines the Constitution's fundamental commitment to rendering justice in a timely manner. That outcome is contrary to vital principles reinforcing the rule of law that have been affirmed by this Court in a broad range of contexts.For fifteen years, Al-Nashiri has been held in captivity without a determination of whether the military commission that intends to preside over his trial has jurisdiction to do so. Because of Al-Nashiri's designation as a "high-value detainee," he is kept in Camp 7, a solitary confinement facility. See Department of Defense, JTF-GTMO Detainee Assessment: Al-Nashiri at 2 (December 8, 2006);16 Government Accountability Office, Guantanamo Bay Detainees: Facilities and Factors for Consideration if Detainees were Brought to the United States, at 15 (November 2012). Nevertheless, the military commission "will not fully determine its own jurisdiction, in the first instance, until trial." Al-Nashiri, 835 F.3d at 146. That trial is unlikely to take place until at least 2019. See AE 203Q Scheduling Order, United States v. Al-Nashiri (Military Comm'n April 11, 2017) (setting hearing dates for calendar year 2018 but not setting a trial date for that year).17 Thus, based on conservative estimates, if16 Available at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/ guantanamo/detainees/10015-abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri (last visited May 29, 2017).17 Available at http://www.mc.mil/Portals/0/pdfs/alNashiri2/ Al%20Nashiri%20II%20(AE203Q(SCHEDULING%20ORDER)). pdf (last visited May 26, 2017).15federal habeas review is unavailable to him now, Al-Nashiri will not be in a position to challenge adverse judgments against him until 2024. See Petition for Panel Rehearing at 3-6, In re Al-Nashiri, 835 F.3d 110 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 7, 2016) (No. 15-1023).18 At that point, he will have been in the custody of the United States-- largely in solitary confinement--for 22 years. If this Court refused to "impose a de facto suspension by abstaining" from hearing the Boumediene challengers after a six-year delay, see Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 771, the 22-year de facto suspension of the privilege of habeas corpus produced by the decision below is no less indefensible. Indeed, it would amount to the longest known suspension of the writ in American history.The staggering delay presented by this case naturally follows from a military commission regime established by statute that imposes no obligation on the executive branch to act promptly or efficiently in the prosecution of its cases and carries no legal consequences or risk of dismissal for idle or otherwise unwarranted delay. At the time when Councilman was decided, military case law provided that pretrial confinement of a member of the military in excess of three months resulted in a strong presumption that the charges should be dismissed. See United States v. Burton, 44 C.M.R. 166, 172 (C.M.A. 1971). At present, the Rules for Courts-Martial require that the "accused [] be brought to trial within 120 days after the earlier of" preferral of charges or confinement. MANUAL FOR COURTS-MARTIAL, UNITED STATES, R.C.M. 707(a) (2016)18 Although the Court of Appeals refused to credit this estimate (see Al-Nashiri, 835 F.3d at 135), it was not questioned by the government in the course of the proceedings. Petitioner has since explained the basis for the estimate. See Petition for Panel Rehearing.16("R.C.M."). And non-compliance with this requirement may still result in dismissal. See R.C.M. 707(d). These protections, however, are expressly withdrawn from trials by military commission by 10 U.S.C. 948b(d)(1)(A) (2012). If left undisturbed, the judgment of the Court of Appeals permits the military to achieve precisely what was denied by this Court in Boumediene: the authority to detain a person for a prolonged and potentially limitless period of time without fear of judicial scrutiny. The D.C. Circuit's decision essentially allows the executive branch to keep captive an individual for two decades in the harshest of conditions without providing them a trial and without judicial review of the executive's power to detain. That is anathema to the rule of law and our Nation's core values of separation of powers and due process.Delays of this magnitude are antithetical to constitutional guarantees significant to a wide range of contexts. In capital cases, awaiting execution can itself be "especially cruel because it subjects death row inmates to decades of especially severe, dehumanizing conditions of confinement." Glossip v. Gross, 135 S. Ct. 2726, 2765 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (internal quotations omitted).And solitary confinement, as Al-Nashiri endures, only compounds the impact of the delay. See Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. ___, 135 S. Ct. 2187, 2210 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring) ("Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price."); Glossip v. Gross, 135 S. Ct. 2726, 2765 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting) ("[I]t is well documented that . . . prolonged solitary confinement produces numerous deleterious harms."); Ruiz v. Texas, No. 16A841, 580 U.S. __, at 2-3 (2017) (Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of stay of execution) ("If17extended solitary confinement alone raises serious constitutional questions, then 20 years of solitary confinement, all the while under threat of execution, must raise similar questions, and to a rare degree, and with particular intensity.").But the corrosive effects of exceptional delay are not limited to cases carrying the gravest punishments. The ABA has emphasized the costs of delay in more routine criminal cases as well: "Unnecessary delay in the processing of criminal cases undermines defendants' rights to a speedy trial, prolongs periods of tension and anxiety for victims and witnesses, adversely affects public confidence in the justice system, and often causes unnecessary expense to taxpayers. . . . Protection of the right to a speedy trial is especially important for defendants who are detained prior to trial, since protracted delays mean de facto indeterminate imprisonment without a determination of guilt." Speedy Trial Standards at 28.As this Court has repeatedly acknowledged, statutory and constitutional commitments to prompt resolution of criminal charges operate, in part, "to limit the possibilities that long delay will impair the ability of an accused to defend himself." United States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. 116, 120 (1966). "[E]vidence and witnesses disappear, memories fade, and events lose their perspective. . . ." Smith v. Hooey, 393 U.S. 374, 380 (1969) (internal quotation market omitted). The prejudice is "markedly increased when the accused is incarcerated in another jurisdiction . . . perhaps far from the place where the offense . . . allegedly took place, [because] his ability to confer with potential defense witnesses, or even to keep track of their whereabouts, is obviously impaired." Smith, 393 U.S. at 379-80. Moreover, the effect of the passage of time18on the quality of evidence does not just harm the defendant--should prosecution witnesses become unavailable, "[the prosecution's] case will be weakened, sometimes seriously so." Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 521 (1972).The writ of habeas corpus has long stood as a bulwark against this kind of unwarranted delay. In fact, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 itself decried that "great delays ha[d] been used" to avoid habeas writs and accordingly imposed strict time limits on the jailer's response to a writ. See 31 Car. 2, ch. 2 (1679) 5 Statutes of the Realm 935. "This history was known to the Framers," Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 742, and, in adopting the Suspension Clause, it was understood by them that prompt judicial review was a fundamental feature of the writ. See, e.g., Resolution of the New York Ratifying Convention (July 26, 1788), in 1 DEBATES IN THE SEVERAL STATE CONVENTIONS ON THE ADOPTION OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION 328 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876) (noting that, absent the invocation of the Suspension Clause, "every person restrained of his liberty is entitled to an inquiry into the lawfulness of such restraint, and to a removal thereof if unlawful; and . . . such inquiry or removal ought not to be denied, or delayed. . . .") (emphasis added). See also Parisi v. Davidson, 405 U.S. 34, 41-42 (1972) (finding that a federal court should abstain from review where relief "would also be available . . . with reasonable promptness and certainty through the machinery of the military judicial system in its processing of the courtmartial charge").This Court has faithfully held that exceptional delay in judicial proceedings, in both common and capital cases, is incompatible with the Constitution's due process guarantees. Consonant with that tradition,19 this Court should review the Court of Appeals' decision to confirm that exceptional delay before trial remains of central concern on habeas review and is indeed one of the very dangers the writ of habeas corpus was designed to avoid.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant certiorari, review the decision on appeal, and reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.Respectfully submitted,May 31, 2017LINDA A.

Diversity in the legal profession is a compelling state interest, and race-conscious admissions policies are essential to increasing minority representation in the legal profession. Simply put, without the promotion of diversity in undergraduate colleges and universities, it would be impossible to achieve advancements in diversity in the profession.I. THERE IS A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IN A DIVERSE LEGAL PROFESSIONAs advisers, advocates, judges and arbitrators, lawyers are central to the implementation of the rule of law. Lawyers help individual, corporate and government clients abide by the law and achieve their goals within legal frameworks. They defend individual rights and liberties. As judges and11arbitrators, they resolve disputes and dispense justice.Lawyers owe duties not only to their clients, but also to the justice system and the public. To be a lawyer is to accept a charge to advance democratic ideals and institutions.15 Lawyers have historically had a "unique cultural position in American society, not only [of] administering but reflecting ideals of fairness and justice."16 As stated in the Preamble to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct:As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, access to the legal system, the administration of justice and the quality of service rendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond its use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law and work to strengthen legal education. In addition, a lawyer should further the public's understanding of and confidence in the rule of law and the justice15 See also Albert P. Blaustein & Charles O. Porter, The American Lawyer: A Summary of the Survey of the Legal Profession, vi (1954) ("Under a government of laws the lives, the fortunes, and the freedom of the people are wholly dependent upon the enforcement of their constitutional rights by an independent judiciary and an independent bar. The legal profession is a public profession. Lawyers are public servants.").16 Next Steps, supra note 11, at 25.12system because legal institutions in a constitutional democracy depend on popular participation and support to maintain their authority.American Bar Association, Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct Preamble (2010).17Lawyers often serve as our nation's political and civic leaders, "perform[ing] functions that go to the heart of representative government." Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 647 (1973). As legislators, government officials, and judges, lawyers craft and interpret our laws and our national, state and local governmental policies. Twenty-five of our nation's forty-four presidents have been lawyers; lawyers have long been the single largest occupational group in the U.S. Congress; and virtually every judge is a lawyer.1817 The Model Rules are developed by task forces composed of members of the ABA and national, state and local bar organizations; they are then reviewed by academicians, practicing lawyers and the judiciary before presentation to the ABA House of Delegates for adoption as ABA policy. The Model Rules have been adopted in all but a handful of jurisdictions, and are available at http://www.americanbar.org/ groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of _professional_conduct.html (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).18 See generally Kenneth M. Rosen, Lessons on Lawyers, Democracy, and Professional Responsibility, 19 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 155, 169-76 (2006) (discussing the historic role of lawyers in the development of American government and democracy); Blaustein et al., supra note 15, at 97-119 (discussing historic contributions of lawyers in public service).13Given the leadership role lawyers play throughout our democratic system, diversity in the legal profession is needed to generate and sustain trust in our government. "In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity." Grutter, 539 U.S. at 332. Indeed, "[e]ffective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation, indivisible, is to be realized." Id. at 332.Racial and ethnic diversity in the legal profession is necessary to demonstrate that our laws are being made and administered for the benefit of all persons. Because the public's perception of the legal profession often informs impressions of the legal system, a diverse bar and bench create greater trust in the rule of law. If the legal profession is not racially inclusive, the public may conclude that the justice system is unfairly controlled by one racial group and does not represent the interests of the population as a whole.19 Judge Edward M. Chen, the first Asian American appointed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, has observed:19 See Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996) ("Central both to the idea of the rule of law and to our own Constitution's guarantee of equal protection is the principle that government and each of its parts remain open on impartial terms to all who seek its assistance.").14The case for diversity is especially compelling for the judiciary. It is the business of the courts, after all, to dispense justice fairly and administer the laws equally. It is the branch of government ultimately charged with safeguarding constitutional rights, particularly protecting the rights of vulnerable and disadvantaged minorities against encroachment by the majority. How can the public have confidence and trust in such an institution if it is segregated--if the communities it is supposed to protect are excluded from its ranks?Judge Edward M. Chen, The Judiciary, Diversity, and Justice for All, 91 Cal. L. Rev. 1109, 1117 (2003).2020 See also Justice Ming W. Chin, Looking Ahead on the Journey for Diversity, Am. Bar Ass'n Judges' Journal, Vol. 48, No. 3, at 20 (Summer 2009) ("[T]he public's respect for judgments and the courts, and the importance of judicial integrity, are reasons why increasing diversity on the bench is so imperative. With diversity on the bench at all levels, we are seeking to improve the quality of our justice system and to enhance the public perception of courts as fair, impartial, and independent."); Judge Michael B. Hyman, What the Blindfold Hides, Am. Bar Ass'n Judges' Journal, Vol. 48, No. 4, at 33 (Fall 2009) ("Greater diversity demonstrates a commitment to equality in all areas of the law and provides assurance to litigants that the judicial system is attentive to issues of racial discrimination, language barriers, cultural norms, and economic factors that may have an effect on the legal issues in the case.").15Racial and ethnic diversity in the legal profession also improves the quality of legal services and judicial decisions. The ABA firmly believes, based on the experience of its members and on the research it has conducted, that "a diverse legal profession is more just, productive and intelligent because diversity, both cognitive and cultural, often leads to better questions, analyses, solutions, and processes."21 As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recognized: "A system of justice is the richer for the diversity of background and experience of its participants. It is the poorer, in terms of evaluating what is at stake and the impact of its judgments, if its members--its lawyers, jurors, and judges--are all cast from the same mold." Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Supreme Court: A Place for Women, 32 Sw. U. L. Rev. 189, 190 (2003).Lawyers who are members of racial minority groups often provide valuable perspectives to those who are not members of those groups by imparting their personal histories and unique experiences, challenging stereotypes, and breaking down cultural barriers. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said of former Justice Thurgood Marshall:Although all of us come to the Court with our own personal histories and experiences, Justice Marshall brought a special perspective . . . . At oral arguments and conference meetings, in opinions and dissents, Justice Marshall imparted not only21 Next Steps, supra note 11, at 5.16his legal acumen but also his life experiences, constantly pushing and prodding us to respond not only to the persuasiveness of legal argument but also to the power of moral truth.Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Thurgood Marshall: The Influence of a Raconteur, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 1217 (1992). Similarly, Judge Arthur L. Burnett Sr., who in 1969 became the first African American U.S. magistrate judge, attributed his judicial philosophy in part to his experience growing up in the segregated South of the 1940s and 1950s: "My life in a segregated society and my initial educational and professional experiences were the influences that led me to approach the law much as a scientist approaches the task of looking through a microscope." Judge Herbert B. Dixon Jr., An Interview with Judge Arthur L. Burnett Sr., Am. Bar Ass'n Judges' Journal, Vol. 48, No. 4, at 6 (Fall 2009).22Experience has taught that the protection and advancement of the interests of persons who experience racial and ethnic discrimination is enhanced through representation by lawyers who have shared such challenges and can more easily generate the trust of such clients. It is crucial that22 See also Judge Harry T. Edwards, Race and the Judiciary, 20 Yale L. & Pol'y Rev. 325, 329 (2002) ("[R]acial diversity on the bench can enhance judicial decision making by broadening the variety of voices and perspectives in the deliberative process. . . . A more diverse judiciary also reminds judges that all perspectives inescapably admit of partiality.").17clients of legal professionals have the ability to choose lawyers with whom they feel comfortable. Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 51 (1980) (lawyers must be able to satisfy "the imperative need for confidence and trust" of their clients). This is not to say that it is necessary for minority clients to be represented by minority attorneys. Rather, the ABA recognizes that many marginalized members of society understandably put their trust more readily in lawyers who possess a shared background because a shared background can improve communication, comfort level, trust, decision-making and advocacy in the attorney-client relationship.23The availability of minority lawyers may also help to determine whether certain clients seek legal assistance at all. "Effective access to legal representation not only must exist in fact, it must also be perceived by the minority law consumer as existent so that recourse to law for the redress of grievance and the settlement of disputes becomes a realistic alternative to him."24Not surprisingly, attorneys who are members of minority groups have historically taken on some of the most challenging legal issues in an effort to bring justice to their communities. From the Asian American lawyers who reopened the Japanese23 Next Steps, supra note 11, at 3.24 Erwin N. Griswold, Some Observations on the DeFunis Case, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 512, 517 (1975).18 internment case of Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944) to the African American attorneys who were at the forefront of the struggle for civil rights, attorneys from racial minority groups have contributed to some of the most important legal, social and political reforms in American history.25 One study of the career choices of University of Michigan Law school graduates reported that graduates who were African American, Latino, and Native American were more likely to begin their careers in public service, and those who entered private practice tended to do more pro bono work, than their white counterparts. Moreover, the study reported minority graduates provided "considerably more service to minority clients than white alumni d[id]."2625 Eric K.

Rev. 1011, 1016 (Summer 2009) ("Of course, addressing the justice gap should not solely be minority attorneys' responsibility, nor should they be saddled with repairing the consequences of historical injustice against people of color. Nevertheless, it appears that attorneys of color do more to address the justice gap than do white attorneys.").19 A diverse legal profession is also required for the United States to remain competitive in the global economy. As the Court observed in Grutter, the educational benefits of diversity are valued by "major American businesses [that] have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints." Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330. In the years since that case was decided, the amount of U.S. legal services that are provided to clients outside the U.S. each year has grown dramatically.27Finally, it is beyond doubt that diversity in educational environments encourages "more enlightening and interesting" classroom discussions, "promotes learning outcomes," and "better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society, and better prepares them as professionals." Id. As one law school dean recently put it: the concept that "diversity among the students in a law school generally contributes to a better legal education than that offered by a more homogeneous student body . . . has become the conventional wisdom that is warmly embraced by the vast27 The export of U.S. legal services generated $7.3 billion in receipts in 2010, a nearly 40 percent increase over 2006.

Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330.II. RACE-CONSCIOUS ADMISSIONS POLICIES ARE ESSENTIAL TO INCREASING MINORITY REPRESENTATION IN THE LEGAL PROFESSIONRacial and ethnic diversity in the legal profession cannot be produced without diversity in undergraduate institutions and law schools. Undergraduate institutions are the pipeline to law schools, and law schools are the portal to the legal profession. Public universities in particular are a primary source of law school applicants. For example, nine out of the top ten "feeder schools" for law school applicants for the 2009-10 school year were public universities.29Admissions policies in higher educational institutions that take race into account as only one28 Kevin R. Johnson, The Importance of Student and Faculty Diversity in Law School: One Dean's Perspective, 96 Iowa L. Rev. 1549, 1553 (2011); see Grutter, 539 U.S. at 32933.29 See Law School Admission Council, Top 40 ABA Applicant Feeder Schools for Fall Applicants, available at http://www.lsac.org/LSACResources/Data/PDFs/top-240feeder-schools.pdf (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).21of many factors remain essential to the achievement of diversity within the legal profession. To date, such policies have increased minority enrollment at law schools. From the time in 1965 when Dean Erwin Griswold of Harvard Law School called attention to the need for diversity at law schools until today, African American enrollment at law schools has grown from barely one percent to more than seven percent.30 Nevertheless, neither African American nor overall minority representation in the legal profession is keeping pace with the national demographic trends toward a more diverse population.During the decade from 2000 to 2010, the percentage of Americans who identified themselves as Latino, black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, or having multiple racial backgrounds increased from 30.9 to 36.3.31 This30 William G.

A substantialportion of this increase is attributable to a sharply risingLatino population, which experienced a 43 percent increase,from 12.5 percent of the total population in 2000, to 16.3percent in 2010, and accounted for more than half of thegrowth in the total population of the United States during thisperiod.

The Census Bureau recently announced that, during the 12-month period ending July 2011, racial and ethnic minority births represented a majority of births, 50.4 percent, for the first time in the country's history.32 It is projected that during the next three or four decades, racial and ethnic minorities will together make up a majority of the U.S. population.33Today, however, members of racial and ethnic minority groups remain vastly underrepresented in America's legal institutions. Last year, Asian, African American, and Latino lawyers made up only 20 percent of associates at law firms, and a drastically smaller portion--less than sevenhttp://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-04.pdf (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).32 Press Release, U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Most Children Younger Than Age 1 Are Minorities, Census Bureau Reports (May 17, 2012), available at http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/population/ cb12-90.html (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).33 See Press Release, U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Dep't of Commerce, An Older and More Diverse Nation by Midcentury (Aug. 14, 2008), available at http://www.census.gov/ newsroom/releases/archives/population/cb08-123.html (last visited Aug. 9, 2012); see also Jeffrey Passel & D'Vera Cohn, U.S. Population Projections 2005-2050, Pew Research Center (Feb. 11, 2008), available at http://www.pewhispanic.org/ 2008/02/11/us-population-projections-2005-2050/ (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).23 percent--of partners at law firms.34 Minorities are also underrepresented among lawyers who practice outside of law firms.

For example, the percentage of minority associates at law firms has increased by 50 percent since 2000, from almost 13 percent in 2000 to about 20 percent in 2011.40 The percentage of minorities serving as general counsels of corporations in 2010 represents a near 200 percent increase since 2000 when only37 Russell Wheeler, The Changing Face of the Federal Judiciary, Brooking Inst'n, 1 (2009), available at http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2009/ 8/federal%20judiciary%20wheeler/08_federal_judiciary_wheele r.pdf (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).38 Inst. for Inclusion in the Legal Profession, IILP Review: The State of Diversity and Inclusion in the Legal Profession 30 (2011), available at http://www.theiilp.com/resources/ Documents/IILP2011_Review_final.pdf (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).39 Id. at 32.40 Nat'l Ass'n for Law Placement, supra note 34; Press Release, Nat'l Ass'n for Law Placement, Presence of Women and Attorneys of Color in Large Law Firms Continues to Rise Slowly (Nov. 15, 2000), available at http://www.nalp.org/ 2000presenceofwomenattorneysofcolor (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).2515, or 3 percent, of such corporations had general counsels who were minorities.41 In addition, as of March 2012, 36 percent of the federal judges confirmed during the current presidential administration have been African American, Latino, or Asian American compared to 17 percent during President Bush's tenure in office and 24 percent during President Clinton's tenure.42Nevertheless, the ABA believes the current state of diversity within legal institutions demonstrates that there remains substantial work to do to ensure diversity in the profession, particularly in light of the current and projected national demographic changes. The ABA is also mindful of the Court's guidance in Grutter that race-conscious admissions programs are anticipated to have a termination point: "We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today." Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342-343. The ABA respectfully submits that this point has not yet been reached.***Race-conscious admissions policies are in widespread use throughout public and private colleges and universities. As one study reports,41 Threlkeld, supra note 36; Mitchell, supra note 36.42 White House, Quick Facts: President Obama's Judicial Nominees: Historic Successes and Historic Delays (Mar. 13, 2012), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/infographics/ judicial-nominees (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).26"[d]ata from more than 1,300 four-year colleges and universities in the United States" show that 45% of private institutions and 35% of public institutions consider minority status in admissions.43 Educators across the country have determined that such raceconscious admissions policies are necessary for the advancement of racial and ethnic diversity at their institutions, as demonstrated by the groundswell of support from the education community nine years ago for the University of Michigan's admissions policies considered in Grutter, and again today for the University of Texas's admissions policies.4443 William M. Chace, Affirmative Inaction, The American Scholar (Winter 2011), available at http://theamericanscholar. org/affirmative-inaction (last visited Aug. 9, 2012).44 In Grutter, over 90 public and private institutions of higher education filed such amicus curiae briefs supporting the University of Michigan Law School's consideration of race as a factor in admissions. See Grutter v. Bollinger, Docket No. 02241 (S. Ct.). One such institution, the American Law Deans Society (formerly the American Law Deans Association) ("ALDS") filed an amicus brief on behalf of 171 individual law schools emphasizing their support, not only for affirmative action, but for "the explicit consideration of race" in law school admissions.

Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 266 (1986).46 To the contrary, the need for raceconscious admissions policies in higher education is as compelling today, if not more so, given the rapidNorthwestern University School of Law in their individual capacities, as well as numerous other professional and academic organizations, filed amicus curiae briefs supporting affirmative action. The ABA understands that many of these same institutions and organizations will file amicus curiae briefs supporting Respondents in this case.45 See, e.g., supra pp. 4-5 (discussion of Standard 212 of the ABA Section on Legal Education and Admission to the Bar, which requires law schools to demonstrate commitment to diversity by concrete action).46 "[A]ny departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification." Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203, 212 (1984); see also Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 443 (2000); Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 231 (1995); Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 864 (1992). To determine the existence of special justifications, the Court looks to reliance on the established rule, the workability of that rule and whether the law or the understanding of society has so changed that the rule is plainly indefensible. See Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 443-44; Casey, 505 U.S. at 854-55. No such special justifications exist here.28demographic changes taking place in the nation and the trend toward globalization sweeping the legal community.The ABA therefore respectfully submits that this Court should once again affirm the constitutionality of admissions policies that use race as merely one of many factors. Adhering to the precedents set out in Bakke and Grutter, these admissions policies have been used throughout American institutions of higher education for more than three decades and reflect the experience and expertise of educators that such policies are necessary if diversity is to be fostered. Affirmance by this Court that such admissions policies satisfy the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause, moreover, would sustain the important progress that has been achieved in promoting diversity, not only in the nation's undergraduate colleges and universities, but also in its law schools and legal profession.29 CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth herein, the American Bar Association respectfully urges this Court to affirm the Fifth Circuit's ruling that the University of Texas at Austin's admissions policy is constitutional.Respectfully submitted,LAUREL G.

I. DIVERSE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NEEDED SO THAT ALL THE LAWYERS THEY PRODUCE ARE BETTER ABLE TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE AND PUBLIC POLICY WITHOUT BIASThis Court has long recognized that a principal benefit of admissions policies that consider race as one factor among others for admission to colleges and universities is the creation of diverse student bodies that help to break down racial biases and stereotypes. The continued use of such policies is particularly important to the legal profession. Substantial evidence indicates that racial bias and stereotypes adversely affect the justice system and other areas of public policy in which lawyers play pivotal roles. It is therefore vital that colleges and universities, which serve as a pipeline to the legal profession, have the flexibility to use such admissions policies to ensure that all of the lawyers that these educational institutions produce are less likely to be influenced by racial bias and stereotypes.A. There Is Substantial Evidence That Implicit Racial Bias and Stereotypes Impact the Administration of Justice and Public PolicyLawyers are central to the fair implementation of law and public policy. As advisers, advocates,10judges, and arbitrators, lawyers defend and advocate for individual rights and liberties, resolve disputes, and mete out justice. To be a lawyer is to accept a charge to advance democratic ideals and institutions.15 Lawyers also serve as our nation's political and civic leaders, "perform[ing] functions that go to the heart of representative government." Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 647 (1973). As legislators, government officials, judges, and prosecutors, lawyers craft, interpret, and defend our laws and our national, state, and local governmental policies.There is substantial and growing evidence that, in performing these pivotal roles, lawyers, like all members of society, may at times be influenced by implicit and unconscious racial bias. Implicit bias has been generally described by one researcher as follows:We naturally assign people into various social categories divided by salient and chronically accessible traits, such as age, gender, race, and role. And just as we might have implicit cognitions that help us walk and drive, we have15 See Albert P. Blaustein & Charles O. Porter, The American Lawyer: A Summary of the Survey of the Legal Profession vi (1954) ("Under a government of laws the lives, the fortunes, and the freedom of the people are wholly dependent upon the enforcement of their constitutional rights by an independent judiciary and an independent bar. The legal profession is a public profession. Lawyers are public servants.").11implicit social cognitions that guide our thinking about social categories. . . . If we unpack these schemas further, we see that some of the underlying cognitions include stereotypes, which are simply traits that we associate with a category. . . . Though our shorthand schemas of people may be helpful in some situations, they also can lead to discriminatory behaviors if we are not careful.Jerry Kang, Nat'l Ctr. for State Courts, Implicit Bias: A Primer for Courts 1­2 (2009).16 Implicit biases held by lawyers--in their various roles as prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges, public officials, and legislators--have the potential to influence their decision making in such a way as to adversely affect the fair administration of justice and public policy.Prosecutors, for example, exercise substantialdiscretion in deciding whether to file chargesagainst a potential defendant, change or reducecharges, plea bargain, and make sentencingrecommendations.17If these decisions are16 http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ migrated/sections/criminaljustice/PublicDocuments/unit_3_ka ng.authcheckdam.pdf.17 See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, United StatesAttorneys'Manual,Section9-27.110(B),http://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-27000-principles-federal-prosecution (last updated Dec. 2014) ("Under the Federalcriminal justice system, the prosecutor has wide latitude in12 influenced by implicit racial bias, individual defendants and their families may be negatively affected. Studies have shown, for example, that African American and Hispanic/Latino defendants are more likely to be held in custody after arraignment and to receive a custodial plea offer as opposed to a non-custodial sentence offer, less likely to receive a reduced charge offer, and more likely to be incarcerated than white defendants, even when controlling for factors such as arrest circumstances, seriousness of the charge, and prior record.18Defense lawyers, including public defenders and others who represent indigent defendants, also exercise discretion in "determining which clientsdetermining when, whom, how, and even whether to prosecute for apparent violations of Federal criminal law."); see also Robert J. Smith, The Impact of Implicit Racial Bias on the Exercise of Prosecutorial Discretion, 35 Seattle U.L. Rev. 795, 796­97 (2012) (discussing "the range of discretion-based decisions that prosecutors must make on a daily basis," including: "Should an arrested citizen be charged with a crime? At what level should bail be recommended? Should bail be opposed? What crime or crimes will be charged? Should charges be dropped? Should a plea bargain be offered or negotiated? . . . Will minority jurors be challenged for cause or with peremptory challenges? What sentence will be recommended?").18 See, e.g., Besiki Luka Kutateladze & Nancy R. Andiloro, Vera Inst. of Justice, Prosecution and Racial Justice in New York County ii­iii (2014); see generally Cynthia Jones, "Give Us Free": Addressing Racial Disparities in Bail Determinations, 16 Legislation and Pub. Pol'y 919 (2013).13merit attention and which do not."19 This Court has long recognized the "crucial role" played by defense counsel in the adversarial system. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 685 (1984).20 As with prosecutors, if these lawyers harbor implicit or unconscious racial biases, such biases will adversely affect the fair administration of justice.Judges preside over trials and legal disputes, and make numerous other decisions on a daily basis that directly affect all parties to litigation and their families. In performing these roles, judges are not immune from bias and stereotypes, and the potential effect of such bias can be significant. By way of example, the United States Department of Justice's recent investigation of the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri found that, in Ferguson, "[m]unicipal court practices . . . cause disproportionate harm to African Americans," reporting in particular:African Americans are 68% less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by the court, and are more likely to have their cases last longer and result in more required court encounters. African Americans are at19 L. Song Richardson & Phillip Atiba Goff, Implicit Racial Bias in Public Defender Triage, 122 Yale L.J. 2626, 2632 (2013).20 See also Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 342­44 (1963) (recognizing right to defense counsel as "fundamental and essential to a fair trial").14least 50% more likely to have their cases lead to an arrest warrant, and accounted for 92% of cases in which an arrest warrant was issued by the Ferguson Municipal Court in 2013.U.S. Dep't of Justice ("DOJ"), Civil Rights Division, Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department 5 (Mar. 4, 2015).21 Notably, the DOJ concluded that "these disparities occur, at least in part, because of unlawful bias against and stereotypes about African Americans."22Lawyers also play various roles in the jury selection process, which may be significantly affected by racial bias and stereotypes. Studies have shown, for example, that in some states prosecutors strike African American jurors at double or triple the rates of other jurors.23 Studies21 http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/pressreleases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_ report.pdf.22 Id. 23 See, e.g., Ursula Noye, Reprieve Australia, Blackstrikes: A Study of the Racially Disparate Use of Peremptory Challenges by the Caddo Parish District Attorney's Office (Aug. 2015), http://www.blackstrikes.com/ resources/Blackstrikes_Caddo_Parish_August_2015.pdf (examining felony jury trials in Caddo Parish, Louisiana between 2003 and 2012); Catherine M.

According to a 2012 study by the United States Sentencing Commission, African American male offenders received sentences that were nearly 20 percent longer than "similarly situated" white male offenders, and were 25 percent less likely to receive a sentence below the sentencing guidelines.25 ThisContinuing Legacy (Aug. 2010), http://www.eji.org/files/ EJI%20Race%20and%20Jury%20Report.pdf.24 See, e.g., Noye, supra note 23 at 11 (reporting that "rate of acquittal appears to increase with the number of black jurors"); Shamena Anwar, Patrick Bayer, Randi Hjalmarsson, The Impact of Jury Race in Criminal Trials, Q.

If they are influenced by implicit bias and stereotypes, lawyers playing these roles may exacerbate racially disparate outcomes. For example, lawyers sitting on local school or zoning boards may make decisions that perpetuate residential segregation and racial disparities in public education. Conversely, lawyers also may play a role in identifying and correcting such disparate outcomes. In considering a lawsuit alleging that a Texas state agency's approach to distributing low-income housing tax credits perpetuated racially segregated housing patterns, this Court recently recognized the important role of disparate impact claims in "counteract[ing] unconscious prejudices and disguised animus" that might otherwise exacerbate residential segregation. Texas Dep't of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2522 (2015).This Court recognized in that decision that while "[d]e jure residential segregation by race was27 Jones, supra note 18, at 938; see also Kutateladze, supra note 18 (concluding that "defendants' race can be used to predict the likelihood that they will be held in pretrial detention following their arraignment").18 declared unconstitutional almost a century ago, . . . its vestiges remain today, intertwined with the country's economic and social life." Id. at 2515.28 As discussed herein, the vestiges of de jure segregation and other forms of racial discrimination remain in many areas of our society, including in the form of implicit bias and racial stereotypes that affect the justice system and the legal profession. Although "[t]he enduring hope is that race should not matter; the reality is that too often it does." Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 787 (2006) (Kennedy, J., concurring).29 Considering the central role of lawyers in the administration of law and public policy, and the "critical importance of exercising fairness and equality" in these legal and political contexts, dismantling racially discriminatory biases and stereotypes that lawyers may hold is of paramount concern to the legal profession.3028 See also Texas Dep't of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, 135 S. Ct. at 2525 ("Much progress remains to be made in our Nation's continuing struggle against racial isolation.").29 See also Parents Involved in Cmty.

Admissions Policies That Consider Race as Only One of Many Factors Help Produce Lawyers Who Can Overcome Racial Bias and StereotypesAs Justice Powell stated in Bakke, and this Court reiterated more recently in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, 133 S. Ct. 2411 (2013) ("Fisher I"), the "educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body" constitute a "compelling interest that could justify the consideration of race" in university admissions policies. Fisher I, 133 S. Ct. at 2418 (citing Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307­09). The educational benefits of diversity are substantial. Students from different backgrounds within and among racial groups often have different everyday experiences and different perspectives on a range of issues including, but not limited to, race. Diverse educational environments that bring together students from different racial and other backgrounds encourage a "robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth out of a multitude of tongues." Bakke, 438 U.S. at 312 (quoting United States v. Associated Press, D.C., 52 F. Supp. 362, 372 (1943)). Such environments promote an "atmosphere of speculation, experiment and creation." Id. "`[C]lassroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting' when the students have `the greatest possible variety of backgrounds.'" Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330.Diverse educational environments resulting from admissions policies that consider race as one factor among others also play a critical role in breaking20down racial bias and stereotypes. As the Court recognized in Grutter, such diversity promotes "cross-racial understanding," helps to "break down racial stereotypes," and enables students "to better understand people of different races." Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330.31 The Court similarly noted in Fisher I that a diverse student body serves to "lessen[] racial isolation and stereotypes." Fisher I, 133 S. Ct. at 2418. Academic research on the impact of diversity on college and university communities also has documented positive effects of diverse student populations on student cognitive development and understanding among different racial and ethnic groups.32 Considering the central role that lawyers31 See also Edward M. Chen, The Judiciary, Diversity, and Justice for All, 91 Calif. L. Rev. 1109, 1116 (2003) ("A further harm of segregation and underrepresentation is the perpetuation of detrimental stereotypes, continuing the myth that certain groups are inherently incapable of attaining certain accomplishments or performing certain jobs. . . . The visibility of diversity contributes to dispelling long-held stereotypes.").32 See, e.g., Gary R. Pike et al., Evaluating the Rationale for Affirmative Action in College Admissions: Direct and Indirect Relationships Between Campus Diversity and Gains in Understanding Diverse Groups, 48 J.C. Student Dev. 166, 180 (2007) (finding that "a diverse student population is associated with interactions among diverse peers and that this interaction is related to increased understanding of different racial and ethnic groups"); see also Br. of the American Educational Research Association et al. as Amici Curiae in Supp. of Resp'ts 6, Fisher I, 133 S. Ct. 2411 (2012) (No. 11-345) ("Research continues to show that racially diverse educational settings are effective in reducing prejudice by promoting greater intergroup contact--both informally and in classroom settings--and encouraging friendships across group lines.").21play in law and public policy, and the ongoing impact of implicit bias in those contexts, exposure to racially diverse educational environments is especially crucial for educating and preparing future lawyers.Importantly, achieving the foregoing benefits of educational diversity requires more than just "simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, with the remaining percentage an undifferentiated aggregation of students." Fisher I, 133 S. Ct. at 2418 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 315 (separate opinion)). Rather, it requires diversity reflecting a "broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element." Id. Consideration of race as one factor among many in the admissions process helps to break down racial bias by exposing students to racially diverse students who do not fit stereotypes and have diverse viewpoints, qualities, and skills. "Diminishing the force of such stereotypes" is a crucial component of undergraduate and graduate education. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333.3333 Diversity in undergraduate education is all the more important for dismantling racial bias and stereotypes since many K­12 public schools suffer from de facto racial segregation or isolation. Nationwide, the average white, African American, and Latino public school student attends a school comprised of approximately half to three-fourths of students of the same race. Gary Orfield & Erica Frankenberg,22All lawyers are better equipped to serve their critical societal functions when they are educated in diverse environments that help foster a deeper and broader understanding of all members of our society. Lawyers educated in environments that provide meaningful diversity, which includes not only race but other qualities as well, are thus enabled to provide legal services and administer justice and public policy in a fair and proper manner less influenced by racial bias or stereotypes.II. DIVERSE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ENSURE FULL REPRESENTATION OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE LEGAL PROFESSIONPromoting full representation of racial and ethnic minorities in the legal profession is also important for the legitimacy of our legal and political systems. A diverse legal profession helps to demonstrate that the path to leadership is open to all citizens and that the justice system serves the public in a fair and inclusive manner. Undergraduate admissions programs like the one at issue here, which consider not just race but many other qualities as well, help to increase the number of qualified minority students who are in the pipeline to law school and the legal profession. By promoting diversity in law schools and the legal profession, such admissionsThe Civil Rights Project, Brown at 60: Great Progress, a Long Retreat and an Uncertain Future 12 (May 2014), http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/ integration-and-diversity/brown-at-60-great-progress-a-longretreat-and-an-uncertain-future/Brown-at-60-051814.pdf.23policies also help to break down racial biases and stereotypes, which continue to inhibit the retention and promotion of minority lawyers within the legal profession.A. Diversity in the Legal Profession Is Important for the Legitimacy of Our Legal and Democratic InstitutionsGiven the leadership role that lawyers play throughout our democracy, diversity in the legal profession is necessary to engender and sustain trust in our government. "In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity." Grutter, 539 U.S. at 332. Indeed, "[e]ffective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation, indivisible, is to be realized." Id.Racial and ethnic diversity in the legal profession is especially necessary to demonstrate that our laws are being made and administered for the benefit of all persons. If the legal profession is not racially inclusive, the public may conclude that the justice system is unfairly controlled by one racial group and does not adequately represent the interests of the population as a whole.34 A recent34 See Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996) ("Central both to the idea of the rule of law and to our own Constitution's guarantee of equal protection is the principle that government and each of its parts remain open on24poll revealed that more than three-quarters of African American respondents believe that the criminal justice system is biased against them compared to only 44 percent of white respondents who felt that such a bias exists.35A diverse bar and bench is also an important means of inspiring greater public faith in the rule of law. As to the role of a diverse judiciary, Judge Edward M. Chen, the first Asian American appointed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, has observed:The case for diversity is especially compelling for the judiciary. It is the business of the courts, after all, to dispense justice fairly and administer the laws equally. It is the branch of government ultimately charged with safeguarding constitutional rights,impartial terms to all who seek its assistance."); see also Judge Bernice Bouie Donald, Foreword to Landscape 1­2 ("[I]t is critical that the police, prosecutors, and judges who administer the system reflect the diversity of their communities. If they do not, they may lose legitimacy in the eyes of citizens, especially racial/ethnic minority communities.").35 The New York Times/CBS Poll on Race Relations in the U.S., N.Y.

As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said of Justice Thurgood Marshall:Although all of us come to the Court with our own personal histories and36 See also Judge Michael B. Hyman, What the Blindfold Hides, 48 ABA Judges' Journal 32, 33 (Fall 2009) ("Greater diversity demonstrates a commitment to equality in all areas of the law and provides assurance to litigants that the judicial system is attentive to issues of racial discrimination, language barriers, cultural norms, and economic factors that may have an effect on the legal issues in the case."); Justice Ming W. Chin, Looking Ahead on the Journey for Diversity, 48 ABA Judges' Journal 18, 20 (Summer 2009) ("[T]he public's respect for judgments and the courts, and the importance of judicial integrity, are reasons why increasing diversity on the bench is so imperative. With diversity on the bench at all levels, we are seeking to improve the quality of our justice system and to enhance the public perception of courts as fair, impartial, and independent.").26experiences, Justice Marshall brought a special perspective. . . . At oral arguments and conference meetings, in opinions and dissents, Justice Marshall imparted not only his legal acumen but also his life experiences, constantly pushing and prodding us to respond not only to the persuasiveness of legal argument but also to the power of moral truth.Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Thurgood Marshall: The Influence of a Raconteur, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 1217 (1992). Justice Samuel Alito has similarly acknowledged the value of bringing his personal history, as the son of immigrants, to bear in cases where the rights of immigrants and the experience of discrimination are involved: "[W]hen a case comes before me involving, let's say, someone who is an immigrant . . . I can't help but think of my own ancestors because it wasn't that long ago when they were in that position. . . . When I get a case about discrimination, I have to think about people in my own family who suffered discrimination because of their ethnic background or because of religion or because of gender, and I do take that into account."3737 Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of Samuel A.

The ABA firmly believes, based on the experience of its members and on the research it has conducted, that "a diverse legal profession is more just, productive and intelligent because diversity, both cognitive and cultural, often leads to better questions, analyses, solutions, and processes."38 As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recognized:A system of justice is the richer for the diversity of background and experience of its participants. It is the poorer, in terms of evaluating what is at stake and the impact of its judgments, if its members--its lawyers, jurors, and judges--are all cast from the same mold.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Supreme Court: A Place for Women, 32 Sw. U.L. Rev. 189, 190 (2003).It is also crucial that clients have the opportunity to choose lawyers with whom they feelJustice Samuel Alito). See also Judge Harry T. Edwards, Race and the Judiciary, 20 Yale L. & Pol'y Rev. 325, 329 (2002) ("[R]acial diversity on the bench can enhance judicial decision making by broadening the variety of voices and perspectives in the deliberative process. . . . A more diverse judiciary also reminds judges that all perspectives inescapably admit of partiality.").38 Next Steps, supra note 9, at 5.28comfortable.39 That level of comfort often manifests between attorneys and clients who have shared the experience of discrimination. This is not to say that minority clients must be represented by minority lawyers. However, many marginalized members of society may understandably put their trust more readily in lawyers who possess a shared background, or in lawyers who are members of firms that include and value minority lawyers, because a shared background can improve communication, comfort level, trust, decision-making, and advocacy in the attorney-client relationship. The lack of adequate diversity in the legal profession often means that the choice of a lawyer with that kind of shared experience, or of a law firm with minority members, is often unavailable to those marginalized members of society who are most in need of representation.40While the challenges of representing such individuals should not solely be the mantle of lawyers who are members of minority groups, it is worth noting that minority lawyers have historically taken on some of the most challenging legal issues in an effort to bring justice to their communities.4139 See Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 51 (1980) (recognizing "the imperative need for confidence and trust" between attorneys and their clients).40 See Next Steps, supra note 9, at 5. 41 From the Asian American lawyers who reopened the Japanese internment case of Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), to the African American attorneys who were at the forefront of the struggle for civil rights, attorneys from29Thus, a diverse legal profession has the potential to more effectively represent a diverse client base, and to enhance the availability of legal services to pro bono, indigent, and other clients with the greatest need for such services, in effect improving access to justice for the public at large.A diverse legal profession is also important for the United States to remain competitive in the global economy. As the Court observed in Grutter, the educational benefits of diversity are valued by "major American businesses [that] have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints." Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330. In the years since that case was decided, the volume of American legal services provided to clients outside the United States each year has grown dramatically.42 Remaining competitive in anracial minority groups have contributed to some of the most important legal, social, and political reforms in American history.

Admissions Policies That ConsiderRace as Only One of Many FactorsHelptoIncreaseMinorityRepresentation in the Legal ProfessionRacial and ethnic diversity in the legal profession cannot be produced without diversity in undergraduate institutions and law schools. Undergraduate institutions serve as a pipeline to law schools, and law schools are the portal to the legal profession.43 Public universities in particular are a primary source of law school applicants. For example, during the 2013­14 school year, the top ten "feeder schools" for law school applicants were all public universities.44Admissions policies such as those at issue here remain important tools for ensuring that our legal system can adequately serve an increasingly diverse population in an increasingly global economy.

A recent study found that 95 percent of elected prosecutors45 QuickFacts: United States, U.S. Census Bureau, http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html (last revised Sept. 30, 2015, 11:29 PM); U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010 Table 1 (2011), http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br02.pdf. African Americans made up 13.2 percent of the population (up from 12.3 percent in 2000); Asian Americans 5.4 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2000); and non-white Hispanics and Latinos 15.4 percent (up from 6.1 percent in 2000).

Partners who were told that the memo was written by a white associate gave the memo an average rating of 4.1 out of 5.0 while partners who were told that the memo was written by an African American associate gave the memo an average rating of 3.2.53 The partners also generally provided more positive qualitative comments on the white associate's memo than on the African American associate's memo.54The impact of implicit bias in the legal profession is further supported by anecdotal evidence.55 This perhaps should not be surprising, as courts have52 Arin N.

In 2014, the attrition rate of minority associates at law firms--23 percent--was 35 percent higher than the rate for non-minorities.57 Thus, more diverse educational institutions play at least two important roles in improving the diversity of the legal profession. First, they increase the pipeline of minority lawyers. Second, they help prepare all lawyers to move beyond implicit bias and stereotypes in their interactions with56 See, e.g., Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 61 (1st Cir. 1999) ("The concept of `stereotyping' includes not only simple beliefs . . . but also a host of more subtle cognitive phenomena which can skew perceptions and judgments. . . .

From the time in 1965 when Dean Erwin Griswold of Harvard Law School called attention to the need for diversity at law schools until today, African American enrollment at law schools has grown from barely one percent to more than 10 percent.59 The percentage of minority associates at law firms has increased by almost 50 percent since 2000, from almost 13 percent in 2000 to about 21.6 percent in 2015.60 The percentage of minorities58 Diversity in the legal profession may also help to ameliorate racial disparities in criminal sentencing. For example, a study of 40 urban United States counties from 1990 to 2002 reported that a higher concentration of African American attorneys in a given county was associated with a lower likelihood of incarceration for African American defendants and a reduction in the disparity in sentencing length between African American and white defendants.

Educators and administrators at these institutions have determined, based on their expert judgment, that such admissions policies are crucial for the advancement of racial and ethnic diversity at their institutions. This determination is reflected by the groundswell of support from the education community twelve years ago for the University of61 Deborah L.

See Grutter v. Bollinger, Docket No. 02241 (S. Ct.). One such institution, the American Law Deans Society (formerly the American Law Deans Association) ("ALDS") filed an amicus brief on behalf of 171 individual law schools emphasizing their support, not only for affirmative action, but for "the explicit consideration of race" in law school admissions.

Such policies are important for dismantling racial bias and stereotypes that lawyers may harbor, and that affect the many roles they play in the administration of justice and public policy. These policies are equally important to further diversify our legal profession and justice system in order to support the perception, and reality, that our legal and political institutions fully reflect and represent all members of our society.al. as Amici Curiae in Supp. of Resp'ts, Fisher I, 133 S.

 OUR CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED CRIMINAL DUE PROCESS RIGHTS, EVEN IN GRAVE TIMES, MAY NOT BE ABRO.GATED EXCEPT THROUGH CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE MEANS. For over two hundred years, whenever this nation has been confronted by war, our government has struggled to achieve a proper balance between the protection of the people and each person's individual rights. After the September 11, 2001 attack, Congress and the President were forced to take unprecedented steps to ensure the safety of this nation and ofinnocents worldwide. While recognizing the government's responsibility to work to prevent another attack on our nation, ABA asserts that this country must also be vigilant in defining those lines that cannot be crossed. As our national experience has taught us:[Wle must be on constant guard against excessive use of any power, military or otherwise, that results in the needless destruction of our rights and liberties.5 acweStlli*hqtlatauashtta*cselieslr*syc"ttuAhiheomnsefisdntmaaseCnwhwnociale,neearlsswdt.miauattfsnuootdrtfalilorepniuvtetlseaiercmreeos,spfk,reoaettanpheanedcndtdiipnoeUcnuononmpivdilteeenerar,dldslDuncan v.

This Task Force was charged with examining the constitutional, statutory, and international law and policy questions raised by the detention of "enemy combatants." In February 2003, the Task Force submitted its resolutions and report to the ABA House of Delegates, after having circulated them in preliminary form to ABA members, working groups from the ABA's Criminal Justice Section and the Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities, and the Congress and the Executive. The resolutions, which were adopted as ABA policy in February 20038, focused on the safeguards that shouldThe policy also urged the "Executive and Legislative branches, in establishing and implementing procedures and selecting venues for trial by military tribunals, to give full consideration to the impact of its choices as precedents in (a) the prosecution of the U.S. citizens in other nations and (b) the use of international legal norms in shaping other nations' responses to future acts of terrorism." id.° See, Report in support of Resolution 8C.

The Task Force concluded that these cases raised troublesome and profound issues, especially in light of the observation by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that the government had taken the position that "with no meaningful judicial review, any American citizen alleged to be an enemy combatant could be detained indefinitely without charges or counsel on the government's say-so.". Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 296 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir. 2002). The Task Force noted that the Executive had maintained that its power to detain "enemy combatants" indefinitely without bringing criminal charges derived from Supreme Court precedent, in particular, Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942), and from the laws of war. The Task Force noted, however, that the Quirin defendants were able to seek review and were represented by counsel. Further, the question for decision had been whether their detention for trial by Military Commission was "in conformity with the laws and Constitution of the United States." Quirin, 317 U.S. at 18. Since the Quirin Court had held that these enemy aliens--who were not lawfully within the United States--were entitled to judicial review, the Task Force concluded that the same entitlement could not be denied to United States citizens and other persons lawfully present in the United States, especially when held without charges.adopted by the United States may affect the response of other nations to further acts of terrorism. * Resolution and Report 109 (adopted Feb. 2003). Available from the ABA.11 Specifically as to the AUMF, the Task Force concluded that neither the AUMF nor any laws enacted in response to terrorist attacks expressly authorized detention of United States citizens as "enemy combatants." Further, 18 U.S.C. § 4001(a) raised serious questions about using the AUMF in support of such detentions." The Congressional House Report accompanying the legislation that became Section 4001(a) stated that the purpose of the bill was "to restrict the imprisonment or other detention of citizens by the United States to situations in which statutory authority for their incarceration exists" and to repeal the Emergency Detention Act of 1950 ("EDA"). See H.R. Rep. No. 92-116, at 1435 (1971). The EDA had been enacted at the beginning of the Korean War and had authorized the establishment of domestic detention camps to hold, during internal security emergencies, individuals deemed likely to engage in espionage or sabotage. Id. at 1435-36. The House Report noted that "the constitutional validity of the Detention Act was subject to grave challenge because it allowed for detention merely if there was reasonable ground to believe that such person probably will engage in, or probably will conspire with others to engage in, acts of espionage or of sabotage." Id. at 1438. The Task Force concluded that, if the AUMF is nevertheless interpreted as authorizing detentions of "enemy combatants" including United States citizens and others lawfully present in the United States, standards for detention must be established and judicial review must be required to determine, with ap-° 18 U.S.C. § 4001(a) states: "No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress."12 propriate deference to the President's determination, whether the detention meets those standards.However, the Task Force noted, appropriate deference does not mean that the courts may not review Executive determinations as to the scope of its authorization. See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952) (executive order taking possession of private property was not sustained as exercise of President's military power as Commander in Chief, even though "theater of war" was an expanding concept). Courts have preserved their role in reviewing Executive detentions even in times of war. See, e.g., Robel, 407 U.S. at 318-19 ("The standard of judicial inquiry must also recognize that the `concept' of `natienal defense' cannot be deemed an end in itself, justifying an exercise of [executive] power designed to promote such a goal"). See also, In re Yamashita, 327 U.S. 1, 8 (1946) ("The courts may inquire whether the detention complained of is within the authority of those detaining the petitioner").Based on this analysis, the Task Force concluded that "enemy combatants" who were citizens or lawfully within the United States, and who had not been charged with a crime or a violation of the law of war, must be afforded a prompt opportunity for meaningful judicial review of the legal basis for their detention. This review, further, must include the right te effective assistance of counsel, since the right to judicial review could well be meaningless if detainees were not afforded effective assistance of counsel in challenging their detention.The Task Force also noted that legislation was required that would establish constitutionally acceptable standards and procedures under which a court13could determine permissible. Thiswhether continued detention was necessary because, in thewas TaskForce's opinion, the AUMF and, accordingly, Section4001(a), were applicableStates citizens and others United States as "enemy Hamdi, 542 U.S. 507, 519to detentions of Unitedlawfully present in the combatants." Compare, (2004) (Congress "clearlyand unmistakably" authorized detention under the AUMF "in the narrow circumstances considered here"of an armed Taliban soldier captured in combat).Certainly Congressional ficient to authorize military seized while legally withinsilence has never been sufjurisdiction over civilians the United States. See,e.g., Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U.S. 304, 324(1946) (in authorizingOrganic Act, Congress"martialdid notlaw" under Hawaiianauthorize supplantingof courts by military tribunals); Milligan, 71 U.S. at 136-37 (Chase, C.J., concurring) (where provisions ofact contemplated no trial or sentence other than bycivil court, trial by military commission could not beasserted). If the Executive is to be authorized to as-sert military jurisdiction over citizens or persons law-fully present in the United States and to dispensewith their constitutionally guaranteed criminal dueprocess rights, then Congress must say so and fixedprocedures governing such jurisdiction must be inplace. As stated in the ABA policy:"FURTHER RESOLVED, That the American Bar Association urges Congress, in coordination with the Executive Branch, to establish clear standards and procedures governing the designation and treatment of U.S. citizens, residents and others who are detained within the United States as "enemy combatants."14Finally, the Task Force concluded that, in settingand other who gressexecuting national policy regarding citizens andpersons lawfully present in the Unitedare detained as "enemy combatants," and the Executive should considerboth howStates Conthatpolicy may affect the response of other ture acts of terrorism. The Task Forcenations to noted thatfuin-ternational agreements and principles recognized bythe United States,laration of Human Covenant on Civilwhich include the Universal Dec-Rights" and the International and Political Rights," support theprotection of individuals from arbitrary detention andguarantee a meaningful review of a detainee's status.These and other international human rights treaties,conventions and jurisprudence are the result, in sub-* Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A. Res. 217A (ID, U.N. Doc. A/810 (1948) available at http/Awww.un.org /Overview/rights.htm]. Article 8 declares that everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunal for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution of by law. Article 9 provides that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. For the role of the United States in the drafting and adoption of the Universal Declaration, see Mary Ann Glendon, A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (2001)."

Article 9 provides that "[alnyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful." Article 14 describes standards and procedures that should be used in all courts and tribunals. Article 15(1) provides, inter alia, that no person shall be held guilty of a criminal offense that does not constitute a criminal offense under national or international law.

Therefore, the inherently invasive and degrading nature of strip searches must be balanced carefully with the actual and likely security risks to which the searches are addressed.Recognizing the serious security concerns inprison facilities, the ABA Standard acknowledges that a strip search may be necessary whenever particularized circumstances create reasonable suspicion, even for detainees charged with very minor offenses. In addition, the ABA Standardconcludes that the balance tips in favor of allowing routine strip searches when detainees charged withserious, violent, or drug-related offenses areadmitted to a detention facility. Under these circumstances, the nature of the charged offenseincreases the risk to security such that it outweighsthe intrusiveness of the search.°There is little reason, however, to believe that a strip search of a detainee like Mr. Florence is necessary to protect prison security. Under ABA10 Moreover, consistent with this Court's conclusion in Bell, 441 U.S, at 559 & n.40, ABA Standard 23-7.9(d) recognizes that, inorder to preserve prison security, it may be necessary to strip search pretrial detainees who elect to engage in loosely supervised contact visits and therefore may have opportunityand possible motive to acquire contraband.9Standard 23-7.9(d), then, the balance tips againstallowing searches without individualized suspicion when these detainees are admitted to a prison.First, these arrestsThere is thus no motive opportunity during thetypicallyprior to arrest --come asarrest -- to plana surprise.and limited to smugglecontraband into a prison.

The ABA Standard on Strip Searches Reflects This Court's Fourth Amendment Precedents.This Court has recently reemphasized thatprisoners "retain the essence of human dignityinherent in all persons."

McDonnell,418 U.S. 539, 555-56 (1974) ("There is no iron curtaindrawn between the Constitution and the prisons ofthis country."); see also Bell, 441 U.S. at 558; Jonesv. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union Inc., 433U.S. 119, 129-30 (1977); Meachum vy. Fano, 427 U.S.215, 225 (1976). The ABA Standard on stripsearches reflects this Court's jurisprudence on theFourth Amendment and on prisoners' rights moregenerally.In Bell, this Court reiterated the overarchingconstitutional requirement that searches underFourth Amendment be reasonable. 441 U.S. atthe559.To meet this requirement, searches must bereasonable both in scope and in intrusiveness underall of the relevant circumstances. Terry v. Ohio, 392U.S. 1, 19 (1968) ("[T]he central inquiry under theFourth Amendment [is] the reasonableness in all thecircumstances of the particular governmentalinvasion of a citizen's personal security."); see alsoOhio v.

See, e.g., Atwater v.City of Lago Vista, 582 U.S. 318, 354 (2001)(upholding the arrest and detention of a woman for"driving without her seatbelt fastened, failing tosecure her children license, and failingin toseatbelts, driving without a provide proof of insurance");Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153 (5th Cir. 1985) (fine-only misdemeanors); Hil/ v. Bogans, 735F.2d 391 (10th Cir. 1984) (traffic violations); Jones v.Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985) (leash lawviolations). Were this Court to affirm the ThirdCircuit's decision as consistent with the FourthAmendment, virtually any of the 14 millionAmericans arrested each year could be subject to astrip search upon their admission to a detentionfacility, even when arrested for minor infractions,including alleged offenses like Mr. Florence's that donot involve violence or drugs, and regardless of thecircumstances surrounding arrest.Finally, the Third Circuit's concern that a reasonable suspicion policy will give undue discretion to officials, thus raising "equal protectionconcerns," is misplaced. See Pet. App. 27a. Law enforcement officers have been searching people based on reasonable suspicion for over forty years--since this Court decided Jerry v. Ohio in 1986. See 392 U.S. at 19. Moreover, any rule that this Court adopts will be implemented by correctional officersunder written policies that provide specific guidance,18and such implementation will not be subject to the decision-making pressure that officers in the fieldencounter.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons stated above, the judgment of theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit should be reversed.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: ELAINE J.

 I. A RULE GIVING LAW FIRMS A PROPERTY INTEREST INHOURLY-RATE MATTERS IS INCONSISTENT WITH RULES GOVERNING THE PRACTICE OF LAW IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The trustee argues that any time a client fires one firm and follows a former lawyer of that firm to another one, the terminated firm retains a right to profits earned on the matter. So, according to the trustee, if a firm goes bankrupt and dissolves, its estate can claim profits for these departed hourly matters, even for work it would have been unable to perform. In the trustee's telling, moreover, this rule applies both pre-dissolution--because the old firm has an unjust enrichment claim rooted in the partnership duty to account--and post-dissolution--because the old firm has a fraudulent transfer claim based in partnership law's unfinished business rule. That is wrong. Clients, not lawyers or law firms, own their matters, and they must be free to hire counsel of their choice. A client's former law firm ordinarily does not have the right to profits earned when another firm represents that client on hourly matters, whether or not a lawyer from the former firm has made a lateral move. And that rule should hold true regardless whether the old firm was discharged because the client simply prefers another firm, or because the old firm has entered bankruptcy and no longer can represent the client. By giving a discharged law firm a dead-hand property interest in a client matter, the trustee's7rule undermines client freedom of choice and conflicts with the ethical rules protecting that freedom.A. A Rule Giving Law Firms A Property Interest In Hourly-Rate Matters Restricts A Client's Right To Terminate Counsel At Will.The D.C. Rules protect client choice. They make clear that "[a] client has a right to discharge a lawyer at any time, with or without cause, subject to liability for payment for the lawyer's services." D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.16 cmt. 4 (emphasis added); accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.16 cmt. 4. And, once the lawyer has been fired, she is subject to various obligations. For instance, she must "surrender[] papers and property to which the client is entitled." D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.16(d). And, relevant here, she must "refund[] any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred." Id. (emphasis added); accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.16(d). In other words, she is entitled only to fees that are "earn[ed] ... by conferring a benefit on or performing a legal service for the client." In re Mance, 980 A.2d 1196, 1202 (D.C. 2009). All of this is crucial to "[p]reserving the client's unfettered right to discharge an attorney," which in turn "protects the fiduciary relationship between lawyer and client." Id. at 1203.These same principles hold true when a lawyer at one law firm leaves for another (whether because she was fired, because she chose to leave, or because the old firm declared bankruptcy). When that happens, a client who worked closely8with that lawyer must decide whether to continue on with the former firm (assuming it still exists), or instead to terminate the representation by the old firm, retain the firm where the attorney now works, or choose another firm entirely. The ABA and others have issued guidance to lawyers and firms on how to honor client choice in these everyday occurrences. While a departing lawyer should not "urge the client to sever its relationship with the firm," she "must make clear that the client has the ultimate right to decide who will complete or continue the matters." ABA Comm'n on Prof'l Ethics, Formal Op. 414 at 4 (1999) (Ethical Obligations When a Lawyer Changes Firms); accord Robert W. Hillman, Hillman on Lawyer Mobility: The Law and Ethics of Partner Withdrawals and Law Firm Breakups § 2.4.1 at 2:152-53 (2015 Supp.). As for the old firm, it "must not take actions that frustrate the departing lawyer's current clients' right to choose their counsel under Rule 1.16(a) and Comment [4] by denying access to the clients' files or otherwise." ABA Comm'n on Prof'l Ethics, Formal Op. 414 at 5 n.15.Similar rules apply when a law practice is sold. Then too, the client has a choice to make concerning its future representation, and then too, the rules protect the client's choice. The D.C. Rules emphasize that "[c]lients are not commodities." D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.17 cmt. 1; accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.17 cmt. 1. To honor the client's autonomy, the lawyer selling her practice must give "written notice ... regarding ... the client's right to retain other9counsel, [and] to take possession of the file or of any funds or property to whichthe client is entitled." D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.17(c)(2); accord ABA Model R.Prof'l Conduct 1.17(c)(2). And so, while the selling lawyer may "obtaincompensation for the reasonable value of the practice," D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct1.17 cmt. 1; accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.17 cmt. 1, the Rulesrecognize that this value takes into account how clients can choose to changelawyers.The same underlying principle that client choice is paramount applies whena firm is dissolving. The D.C. Ethics Committee confirmed as much just last year:A key principle governing the ethical obligations of a law firm and its members in connection with the process of dissolving the firm is that the clients do not belong to either the law firm or its members. It is axiomatic that a client has the right to retain and discharge a lawyer at will. When a law firm dissolves, therefore, the client may also discharge counsel and either hire new counsel or not. None of the individual members of the dissolving firm "own" the client. Nor does the dissolving law firm itself, as a separate legal entity, "own" the client. D.C. Ethics Comm., Ethics Op. 372 (2017) (footnotes omitted). The Committeeconcluded: "It follows, therefore, that as a general rule a client's right to choosecounsel may not be impaired by the dissolution of a law firm." Id.Indeed, any rule that tethers a client matter to a terminated firm, despite theclient's desire to transfer it to another firm, unacceptably inhibits client choice. "Itis a well-established principle of attorney-client relations that the client controls his10claim," King & King, Chartered v. Harbert Int'l, Inc., 436 F. Supp. 2d 3, 11 (D.D.C. 2006), aff'd, 503 F.3d 153 (D.C. Cir. 2007), and in the face of that rule, it would be incongruous to hold that the lawyer holds some property entitlement with respect to the claim. That is why an attorney must "refund[] any ... fee ... that has not been earned." D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.16(d); accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.16(d). An hourly fee arrangement in which a lawyer retains an interest in profiting from future work would, as this Court has put it, "substantially alter[] and economically chill[] the client's unbridled prerogative to walk away from the lawyer." In re Mance, 980 A.2d at 1204. This "strikes at the `core of the fiduciary relationship,'" and that is true even if the arrangement does not specifically restrict a client's ability to discharge the lawyer and hire someone new. Id. (quoting In re Cooperman, 83 N.Y.2d 465, 473 (1994)). "[T]hat the client can technically still terminate misses the reality of the economic coercion that pervades such matters." Id. (quoting In re Cooperman, 83 N.Y.2d at 473).The trustee's rule would have precisely this impermissible effect of "economic coercion." It would transfer profits earned by working on a client matter from the firm that actually does the work to the firm that no longer represents the client--and it would do so merely because the lawyer who had worked on the client matter at the discharged firm now is performing that work elsewhere. In short, this rule would impose a continuity tax on clients. Retain the11lawyer who heretofore represented you in the matter, and that lawyer's new firm (whether a pre-existing firm or a new, solo operation) will have to remit profits to someone else. Only a new lawyer, inexperienced in the matter, will be able to earn fees at a market rate.And from the perspective of law firms hiring lawyers, they may not be able to accept certain client matters, notwithstanding the client's preference. For even when the client wishes to terminate the old firm and continue its relationship with the departing lawyer, that lawyer's new firm--faced with paying a share of its profits to the old firm--may not be able to accept the representation. True, the client "can technically still terminate" the representation. Id. at 1204. But that right is devalued when the client's counsel of choice is penalized for representing it. A rule that gives a terminated firm a property interest in hourly-rate matters thus directly impinges on the ability of a client to hire and fire counsel, and is fundamentally at odds with rules governing the practice of law.The highest courts of California and New York have properly recognized as much in analogous cases. In Heller Ehrman LLP v. Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, 411 P.3d 548 (Cal. 2018), the court squarely held that "a dissolved firm has no property interests in legal matters handled on an hourly basis." Id. at 550.4 In4 Notably, the bankruptcy trustee there conceded that its theory could not extend to client matters that depart a firm pre-dissolution. See id. at 551. As the12doing so, the court recognized that "[t]he limited nature of the interest accorded to the dissolved law firm protects clients' choice of counsel. It allows the clients to choose new law firms unburdened by the reach of the dissolved firm that has been paid in full and discharged." Id. at 552; see id. at 555-56 ("Recognizing a property interest ... in hourly matters would ... risk impinging on the client's right to discharge an attorney at will ... ."). In In re Thelen LLP, 20 N.E.3d 264 (N.Y. 2014), similarly, the Court of Appeals of New York held that a discharged law firm retains no property interest in clients' hourly-rate matters where the trustee's contrary position would conflict with the "strong public policy encouraging client choice." Id. at 273. This Court likewise should reject a rule that could force clients to "opt for second-choice counsel." Heller Ehrman LLP, 411 P.3d at 556.district court in this case noted, the trustee here has "taken a different path and has sued to seize profits associated with client matters that former Howrey partners worked on at other firms even before Howrey collapsed." Hogan Lovells US LLP v. Howrey LLP, 531 B.R. 814, 826 (N.D. Cal. 2015). While narrower, the Heller trustee's position was also wrong because it too improperly treated clients' hourlyrate matters as property. See Br. of Amicus Curiae American Bar Ass'n, Heller Ehrman LLP v. Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, No. 14-16314, Dkt. 27 (9th Cir. Feb. 24, 2015); see also In re Heller Ehrman LLP, 716 F. App'x 693 (9th Cir. 2018) (affirming judgment against trustee in light of decision of Supreme Court of California).13B. The Trustee's Rule Operates As An Impermissible Restrictive Covenant.Another D.C. Rule founded on the importance of client choice is the prohibition on employment agreements that restrict the "right[] of a lawyer to practice." D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 5.6(a); accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 5.6(a). "An agreement restricting the right of partners or associates to practice after leaving a firm not only limits their professional autonomy but also limits the freedom of clients to choose a lawyer." D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 5.6 cmt. 1; accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 5.6(a) cmt. 1; Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. & W. William Hodes, The Law of Lawyering § 50.03 (4th ed. Supp. 2015) (Rule 5.6(a) "protects clients against having a restricted pool of attorneys from which to choose"); D.C. Ethics Comm., Ethics Op. 241 (1993) (the "general hostility" toward restrictive covenants is necessary "to protect the ability of clients to obtain lawyers of their own choosing and to enable lawyers to advance their careers"); see Heller Ehrman LLP, 411 P.3d at 555 ("Reduced compensation creates incentives that are perverse to the mobility of lawyers ... .").This Court addressed Rule 5.6 of the D.C. Rules in Neuman v. Akman, 715 A.2d 127 (D.C. 1998). It explained the rule's bar on restrictive covenants "as a protection for both clients and lawyers," citing an ABA ethics committee decision to illustrate the rationale underpinning the rule: "Clients are not merchandise. Lawyers are not tradesman. ... An attempt, therefore, to barter in clients would14appear to be inconsistent with the best concepts of our professional status." Id. at 131 (quoting ABA Comm'n on Prof'l Ethics, Formal Op. 300 (1961)). A law firm therefore cannot chain a lawyer to the firm to keep its client matters from leaving, too. As Neuman went on to explain, the D.C. Ethics Committee shares the ABA's concerns:While a law firm undoubtedly has a legitimate interest in maintaining its clients, [the Committee is] hesitant to announce views that unduly restrict the ability of lawyers to change relationships in order to advance their careers, or that prevent or unduly hinder clients from obtaining legal representation from attorneys of their own choosing who may have formed new associations. Id. (quoting D.C. Ethics Comm., Ethics Op. 181 (1987)) (emphasis added). A recent ethics opinion emphasizes the point. See D.C. Ethics Comm., Ethics Op. 368 (2015). Ethics Opinion 368 concerns whether "a law firm may provide for or impose liquidated damages on a lawyer who, after departure, competes with the firm." Id. It may not. At most, "[a] firm and a departing lawyer may have liability to one another ... for work done before the lawyer's departure." Id. (emphasis added). But "an agreement imposing substantial damages--actual or liquidated--attributable to or because of work done by the departing lawyer (or her new firm) in competition with the former firm after she relocates would violate Rule 5.6(a)." Id. (emphasis added). Importantly, the Committee made clear that the prohibition against restrictive covenants applies to "provisions in partnership, employment, and other15agreements that expressly or impliedly restrict a lawyer's practice." Id. (emphasis added). Thus, "[t]he prohibition extends not only to absolute bars upon competition with the former firm but also, at least in some circumstances, to restrictions that impose a substantial financial penalty on a lawyer who competes after leaving the firm." Id. (quotation marks omitted). The Committee noted that it had previously identified one such circumstance--a liquidated damages provision that required a departing lawyer to pay his former firm a percentage of his billings for clients that followed the departing lawyer to his next firm. Id. (citing D.C. Ethics Comm., Ethics Op. 65 (1979)). The Committee reaffirmed that such an arrangement violates the District's ethical rules prohibiting restrictive covenants. Id.; see also D.C. Ethics Op. 372 (explaining that notice to clients provided by a dissolving firm "may not restrict any lawyer's right to practice" and that "[a]s a general rule, any agreement restricting the right of lawyers in a law firm to practice after the firm dissolves is unethical").The trustee's rule is fundamentally similar to the one the Committee rejected, and equally problematic. It effectively punishes a departing lawyer by forcing her and her next firm to forfeit fees earned on matters that a client wishes to transfer to that firm. In so doing, it functions very much like the liquidateddamages provision the D.C. Ethics Committee has condemned. Indeed, the trustee's position is even more far-reaching--it would require a departing lawyer16or the lawyer's new firm to remit profits to the estate of a defunct firm, one that cannot even employ lawyers or provide client services. A restrictive covenant in these circumstances is an even greater threat to the interests in lawyer autonomy and client choice embodied in Rule 5.6(a).C. The Trustee's Rule Also Is At Odds With Restrictions On Fee Splitting.Like the rules in most other jurisdictions, the D.C. Rules require clear communication with clients about fee arrangements. "When the lawyer has not regularly represented the client, the basis or rate of the fee, the scope of the lawyer's representation, and the expenses for which the client will be responsible shall be communicated to the client, in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation." D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.5(b); accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.5(b). These requirements ensure that a client is equipped to make an informed decision in selecting her counsel, deciding which claims or defenses to pursue, and assessing how aggressively to pursue her matter.When fee-sharing is at issue, still further requirements are imposed, which ensure that fees reasonably reflect the work being performed. In particular, fees may only be split if "[t]he division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation." D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.5(e)(1); accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.5(e)(1). These additional rules governing fee-sharing cement trust between a client and her17attorney by ensuring that the lawyers representing her are the same ones she is paying. After all, a client may question the enthusiasm or loyalty of lawyers who are receiving only a portion of the fees being paid for a representation and thus "will not be as incentivized to work on their matters." Heller Ehrman LLP, 411 P.3d at 556; cf. D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.5 cmt. 5 ("An agreement may not be made whose terms might induce the lawyer improperly to curtail services for the client or perform them in a way contrary to the client's interest."); ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.5 cmt. 5 (same). Conversely, the requirement of explicit consent for a fee-shifting arrangement promotes essential trust and client control by ensuring that a client is in a position to make informed decisions about her representation. D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.5(e)(1); accord ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.5(e)(1).The trustee's rule is fundamentally at odds with these rules and the values underlying them. It would require profits to be paid to a discharged law firm without consideration of the work actually being performed, and it would do so without client consent. As troubling as this is as a general matter, it is worse still in the post-dissolution context--at issue here--because it would require that fees be shared with a defunct firm that cannot even assume ethical responsibility for the representation. The trustee's rule thus threatens to disrupt the trust that forms the foundation of the attorney-client relationship with respect to the only lawyers who18are continuing with the representation. See King & King, Chartered, 436 F. Supp. 2d at 11-12 ("[T]rust and confidence are essential elements of any attorney-client relationship, and therefore ... a client should not be forced to continue to employ an attorney with whom he no longer retains this rapport ... ."). II. THE TRUSTEE'S RULE WILL CREATE PERVERSE EFFECTS,AND IS UNWORKABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF MODERN LEGAL PRACTICE. The trustee's rule also should be rejected because it would create disturbing effects and substantial uncertainty in the context of modern legal practice. It is a simple reality that lawyers often do not stay with a single firm for their entire career. See Lateral Hiring Little Changed in 2017, NALP Bulletin (Mar. 2018), https://www.nalp.org/0318research?s=lateralhiring ("In 2017 aggregate lateral hiring was up by 1.6% compared with 2016 in these same offices/firms, with a median of 7 and an average of 15.1 lateral hires per office/firm."). A lawyer might consider a lateral move for a host of reasons. Perhaps she has become a specialist in a particular area of law, and wants to become part of a group at a leading firm that specializes in that area. Perhaps she has clients whose matters require services beyond the resources or expertise of her current firm, or another firm will pose fewer ethical conflicts involving other firm clients. Perhaps a group of partners decides to form a new firm. Or perhaps her firm has dissolved. These are just a few examples, and regardless whether one views increased lawyer19mobility as favorable, the point is the same: The current legal marketplace is a dynamic one in which clients shop for the best representation, and lawyers search for the best professional circumstances in which to serve those clients.The trustee's interpretation of partnership law fails to take account of this reality. According to the trustee, its rule applies to lawyers who choose to leave before a firm's dissolution, Trustee Br. 4, as well as to those who have no choice but to leave after a firm dissolves, Trustee Br. 5. The trustee's rule thus threatens to create a convoluted web of payment obligations between law firms, spinning new strands any time a lawyer leaves one firm for another for any reason--and none of these payments would be based on the delivery of legal services. (How much must be paid, or how that would be measured, the trustee does not say; more on that below.)This unprecedented expansion of partnership law would create serious limitations on client choice, and "numerous perverse effects" would arise from its acceptance. In re Thelen LLP, 20 N.E.3d at 273; accord Heller Ehrman LLP, 411 P.3d at 555; Hogan Lovells US LLP, 531 B.R. at 826. By virtue of the lawyer's duty to protect client interests and notify the client of alternatives, "many a departing lawyer would be compelled to inform clients who wish to follow her that she can't afford to continue representing them." D.C. Ethics Comm., Ethics Op.20368.5 This would be "a major inconvenience to clients and a practical restriction on a client's right to choose counsel." Id. (quoting In re Thelen LLP, 20 N.E.3d at 273). The result could well be that the client loses the lawyer most intimately familiar with its matter--a bad result both pre- and post-dissolution, but especially detrimental in the post-dissolution setting where the old law firm cannot handle the matter (because it has ceased to exist), a gap in representation at a critical moment could result, and in any event a new firm would have to come up to speed, resulting in unnecessary costs to the client.Meanwhile, departing attorneys "would simply find it difficult to secure a position in a new law firm because any profits from their work for existing clients would be due their old law firms, not their new employers." In re Thelen LLP, 20 N.E.3d at 273; see Heller Ehrman LLP, 411 P.3d at 555. And even if the departing lawyer could overcome this difficulty, that would not solve the basic unfairness that the remaining partners in the old firm will "profit from work they do not perform, all at the expense of a former partner and his new firm." In re Thelen LLP, 20 N.E.3d at 273. Even worse, "clients might worry that their hourly fee5 See D.C. R. Prof'l Conduct 1.16(d) ("In connection with any termination of representation, a lawyer shall take timely steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests ... ."); ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 1.16(d) (same); see also D.C. Ethics Comm., Ethics Op. 372 (discussing notice and other ethical obligations to clients during process of dissolving firm); ABA Comm'n on Prof'l Ethics, Formal Op. 414 at 5 (departing lawyer must notify client of alternatives).21matters are not getting as much attention as they deserve if the law firm is prevented from profiting from its work on them." Id.; see Heller Ehrman LLP, 411 P.3d at 556.The trustee's rule is impracticable, too. As the district court explained in this case, "[c]larity and simplicity are vital" in this context "because a vague rule would condemn the courts and litigants to endless speculation about when a client matter is new and when it is a carry-over of a prior engagement." Hogan Lovells US LLP, 531 B.R. at 822. Suppose a matter calls only for advisory work by a single partner at the old firm, but matures into a massive lawsuit staffed by several partners and an army of associates at another. Which profits belong to the old firm? Or suppose a partner plays a minor role in a matter at the old firm but takes on a leading role at the new firm--how are fees divided in that scenario?Even when it is clear that a lawyer's work has continued unchanged after her transition, it remains entirely unclear how the trustee would account for profits. Who measures overhead, and determines how it is allocated within the firm? Will the court calculate which real estate and secretarial costs are attributable to the lawyers handling a matter? What about the cost of depreciating assets? Will the court be called on to revisit the firm's own internal calculations, if any exist (and will there be discovery into the new firm's proprietary business information)? And what if the new firm itself goes out of business, and then the ones after that--will22every firm that the matter passed through be entitled to a share of profits that somehow will have to be calculated?Worse still, what is "reasonable compensation" under the trustee's theory, Trustee Br. 28, and how is a court to determine this? The client and the attorney, after all, already have determined what compensation is reasonable--it is the amount that the client agreed to pay for the representation. What metric will the court use to second-guess that agreement, in determining what compensation the new firm will be permitted to keep? And what if the client falls on hard times and the new firm wishes to lower its rate--would the trustee demand profits even then?It is simply impossible to account for the innumerable permutations that would arise under the trustee's rule. Applied to the modern legal industry, that rule would generate enormous dispute between law firms over their respective property interests in clients' hourly fee matters, drawing resources and attention away from client representation--and discouraging new firms from transitioning paid hourly matters to pro bono or "low bono" representation for fear that old firms would continue to seek profits for every hour the new firm works, even at cost.The better rule is one that follows the time-honored principle that clients-- not lawyers or law firms--own their matters and are free to hire or fire counsel of their choice for any reason at any time.23CONCLUSION For these reasons, the American Bar Association respectfully requests that the Court accept appellees' proposed answer to the certified questions of law.Date: July 12, 2018Respectfully submitted,HILARIE BASS President American Bar Association 321 North Clark St. Chicago, IL 60654 (312) 988-5000 abapresident@americanbar.org/s/ Todd S.

Page 1 of 2Ethics Opinion 241Financial Penalty Imposed on Departing Lawyer Who Engages in Legal Practice in D.C. AreaA partnership agreement imposes a delay of up to five years in paying out funds from a partner's capital financial account where the partner leaves the partnership and engages in the practice of law in the Washington area. Such an agreement violates Rule 5.6(a) in imposing a penalty for opening a potentially competing practice.Applicable Rule· Rule 5.6(a) (Restrictions on Right to Practice Law)Inquiry Inquirer seeks an opinion concerning the propriety of delay in paying funds from a partner's capital financial account where the partner leaves the partnership and engages in the practice of law in the District of Columbia metropolitan area.The partnership agreement provides that a withdrawn partner is entitled to payments from his capital financial account over a five year period without interest beginning on the last day of the first fiscal quarter of the year following the date of withdrawal. It limits payments, however, in the following circumstances:If a Withdrawn Partner who is otherwise entitled to receive payments prior to age 65 pursuant to the section of this Agreement captioned "Payments for Withdrawn Partners" engages in the private practice of law in the metropolitan District of Columbia area, such payments shall be delayed until the earlier of (i) the date such Terminated Partner attains age 65, (ii) the date such Terminated Partner ceases to engage in the private practice of law as aforesaid or (iii) five years after the date such payments were otherwise scheduled to commence pursuant to the section of this Agreement captioned "Payments for Withdrawn Partners."Inquirer seeks an opinion whether this provision violates Rule 5.6(a).Discussion Rule 5.6 provides:A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making (a) A partnership or employment agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement; . . .The operative language of Rule 5.6--"restricts the right of a lawyer to practice"--is identical to the language of the predecessor Code provision, DR 2-108(A).The Committee has frequently been asked to define the scope of firms' authority to limit, through partnership or employment agreements, competition by lawyers who depart the firm. In Opinion 181, the Committee engaged in a thorough review of the purposes of the former Code provision, analyzing the case law, ABA opinions and prior Committee decisions. It concluded that these decisions "demonstrate a general hostility toward restrictive [employment] agreements and persuade this Committee that it should carefully examine any such agreements that come before it." The reasons are twofold: to protect the ability of clients to obtain lawyers of their own choosing and to enable lawyers to advance their careers. The changing nature of the bar and the practice of law in the District of Columbia, which is characterized by significant growth in the size of the bar, the opening of branches of out-of-town firms and relaxation of rules concerning solicitation and advertising, all reinforce the need for limiting restrictions on lawyer mobility.The Committee has twice before held that employment and partnership agreements imposing direct financial penalties for practicing in a competing or potentially competing firm amount to forbidden restrictions on the right to practice. In Opinion 65, the Committee held that former DR 2-108(A) prohibited an employment agreement requiring that, for two years after departure, the departed lawyer pay to the former firm 40% of net billings deriving from clients previouslyA7 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/opinion241.cfm7/11/2018Ethics Opinion 241: Financial Penalty Imposed on Departing Lawyer Who Engages in Le... Page 2 of 2represented by the firm. And in Opinion 194, the Committee found impermissible a provision that reduced by half the payment of unrealized accounts receivable if the departing partner opened any competitive practice within twelve months. These decisions are consistent with Gray v. Martin, 663 P.2d 1285 (Or. 1983), twice cited by the Committee (Opinions 181 and 194), where the court refused to enforce a clause in the partnership agreement eliminating the payments a partner was otherwise entitled to receive if the lawyer practiced in any of three designated counties.By contrast, financial arrangements that do not penalize a lawyer for competing do not run afoul of Rule 5.6. In Opinion 221, the Committee considered an agreement used by a firm engaged in plaintiff personal injury litigation that specified the division of potential contingent fees in cases unresolved at the time of an attorney's departure from the firm.1 (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/opinion241.cfm#footnote1) The Committee held that to the extent the arrangement was simply an effort to establish a fair split based on work performed, the agreement was permissible; an excessive share to the firm would, however, amount to a restriction on the right to practice.The Committee has upheld only one sort of restriction on the right to practice. These are reasonable--not absolute--limitations on the departing lawyer's solicitation of clients of the departing firm. In Opinions 77 and 97, the Committee upheld employment agreements prohibiting an associate leaving a firm from seeking to solicit business from clients of the firm, where the associate was free to mail announcements short of direct solicitation. The Committee recognized that the rule in each instance did constitute a restriction on the former associate's ability to obtain clients, but believed that solicitation of current clients raises special concerns that warranted at least regulation of the manner of such solicitations. As the Committee has often determined, however (see, e.g., Opinions 181 and 221), even in the case of direct solicitation of a firm's clients, where problems of interference in ongoing relationships are most sensitive, a firm may impose only the most narrow of restrictions.The agreement here violates Rule 5.6. The financial penalties imposed on a departing lawyer serve no other purpose than restricting practice and insulating the firm from potential competition. The agreement plainly discourages a partner from competing against the former firm, or even representing clients at all, by forcing the partner to forego the payments otherwise payable for up to five years if the partner practices law in the Washington area.One might argue that here the agreement provides for delay in payment rather than its elimination or diminution, so is not nearly so onerous as in other cases. Even putting aside the possibly significant sums at stake and the cost to the lawyer of the delay, the provision's broad application undoubtedly serves as a deterrent to opening a competing practice. It thus represents a restriction on the right to practice to limit competition even as to potential future clients of the firm. The fact that the restriction ends automatically if the terminated partner ceases the private practice of law reinforces this conclusion.The Committee concludes that a partnership agreement that delays for five years payments otherwise due a departing partner from the partner's capital financial account if the partner engages in the practice of law in the Washington area is prohibited by Rule 5.6.September 19931. For example, the agreement provided that if the client had retained the firm two years before the lawyer's departure and resolved within a year of departure, the firm would receive 75% of the fee. If the firm had been retained only a year before the lawyer's departure and the case was not resolved for two to three years thereafter, the firm would receive 55% of the fee.A8 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/opinion241.cfm7/11/2018Ethics Opinion 368: Lawyer Employment Agreements--Restrictions on Departing Lawye... Page 1 of 8Ethics Opinion 368Lawyer Employment Agreements--Restrictions on Departing Lawyer Who Competes with Former FirmA law firm may not provide for or impose liquidated damages on a lawyer who, after departure, competes with the firm. A firm and a departing lawyer may have liability to one another, though, for work done before the lawyer's departure. Also, a firm may not restrict a departed lawyer's subsequent professional association or affiliation with partners or employees of the firm, except insofar as such activity is subject to legal limitations outside the Rules of Professional Conduct. Whether a choice of law provision in a partnership or employment agreement can avoid application of the D.C. Rule governing lawyer departures usually will depend on the location where the departing lawyer principally practiced.Applicable Rules· Rule 5.6(a) (Restrictions on Right to Practice) · Rule 8.5(b)(2) (Disciplinary Authority; Choice of Law) · Rule 8.4 (Misconduct)InquiryThe committee has received a number of inquiries along the following lines and has concluded that a discussion of these issues will be of interest to the Bar.1. Whether a law firm may provide for or impose liquidated damages on a lawyer who, after departure, competes with the firm. 2. Whether a law firm may provide for or impose a financial penalty on a departing lawyer who associates professionally with anyone who was a partner or employee (lawyer or nonlawyer) at the firm. 3. Whether, where at least one lawyer at a law firm is admitted to practice in both the District of Columbia and another jurisdiction, the firm may insert a choice of law provision in a partnership, employment, or other agreement in order to avoid applying Rule 5.6(a) of the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct in favor of a rule of the other jurisdiction that addresses the same subject matter but yields a different result.AnalysisFor the reasons set out below, the committee answers the first two inquiries in the negative. Our answer to the third inquiry is somewhat more complex.The D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct ("D.C. Rules") provide:"A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making:(a) A partnership, shareholders, operating, employment, or other similar type of agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement."[1] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn1)D.C. Rule 5.6.[2] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn2)A9 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm7/11/2018Ethics Opinion 368: Lawyer Employment Agreements--Restrictions on Departing Lawye... Page 2 of 8Because they limit a client's freedom in choosing a lawyer and a lawyer's professional autonomy, provisions in partnership, employment, and other agreements that expressly or impliedly restrict a lawyer's practice are prohibited. Neuman v. Akman, 715 A.2d 127, 130-31 (D.C. 1998) (citing D.C. Rule 5.6, cmt. [1]); accord Cohen v. Lord, Day & Lord, 550 N.E.2d 410, 411 (N.Y. 1989);[3] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn3) Stevens v. Rooks Pitts and Poust, 682 N.E.2d 1125, 1132 (Ill.

D.C. Rule 5.6 cmt. [2];[6] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn6) accord Cohen, 550 N.E.2d at 411; Stevens, 682 N.E.2d 1125; D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 325 (2004); D.C.

Legal Ethics Op. 65 (1979).[7] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn7)Liquidated damagesThe first inquiry addresses whether a law firm may provide for or impose liquidated damages on a lawyer who, after departure, competes with that firm. Liquidated damages, unlike actual damages, are fixed in advance of a breach rather than afterward. They are viewed by the D.C. Court of Appeals "with a gimlet eye" and will be sustained only if "'not . . . disproportionate to the level of [actual] damages reasonably foreseeable at the time of the making of the contract.'"[8] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn8) District Cablevision Limited Partnership v. Bassin, 828 A.2d 714, 723 (D.C. 2003) (quoting Council v. Hogan, 566 A.2d 1070, 1092 (D.C. 1989)); accord Ashcraft & Gerel v. Coady, 244 F.3d 948, 954-55 (D.C. Cir. 2001).[9] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn9) Moreover--"when a contract specifies a single sum in damages for any and all breaches even though it is apparent that all are not of the same gravity, the specification is not a reasonable effort to estimate damages; and when in addition the fixed sum greatly exceeds the actual damages likely to be inflicted by a minor breach, its character as [an impermissible] penalty becomes unmistakable."District Cablevision, 828 A.2d at 723 (quoting Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co., 769 F.2d 1284, 1290 (7th Cir. 1985)); accord Jacob v. Norris, McLaughlin & Marcus, 607 A.2d 142, 151 (N.J. 1992); cf. Ashcraft & Gerel, 244 F.3d at 955 (upholding liquidated damages clause where amount was not fixed but increased over time to reflect lawyer's increasing value to law firm).As we read D.C. Rule 5.6(a), Neuman and other case law, and our own previous opinions, a departing lawyer may not be subjected to liquidated damages because she subsequently competes with her former firm. She and the firm may be responsible to one another for the value of work completed before she leaves the firm. See D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 194 (1988) (disapproving agreement that deprived departing lawyer of part of unrealized accounts if lawyer competed within 12 months). This applies notably in the case of contingent fee cases. Compensation for such matters might not be received or even owed until long after her departure, and a portion of that compensation might be attributable to work done at the former firm prior to her departure. D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 221 (1991); accord In re Thelen LLP, 20 N.E.3d 264, 271 (N.Y. 2014) (stating that former firm is entitled to an accounting for value of contingent fee case as of the lawyer's departure date). A 1990 D.C. Court of Appeals decision held that contingent fee matters are part of the partnership property. Beckman v. Farmer, 579 A.2d 618 (D.C. 1990). Farmer was a law firm dissolution matter that did not involve a penalty for post-departure competition, so the opinion did not discuss the penalty-for-competition issue. Id.[10] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn10)A10 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm7/11/2018Ethics Opinion 368: Lawyer Employment Agreements--Restrictions on Departing Lawye... Page 3 of 8By contrast, we believe that an agreement imposing substantial damages--actual or liquidated--attributable to or because of work done by the departing lawyer (or her new firm) in competition with the former firm after she relocates would violate Rule 5.6(a). D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 65 (1979); see Stevens, 682 N.E.2d at 1131-32. But cf. Robinson v. Nussbaum, 11 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 1997) (holding that hourly matters are partnership property but not addressing postdeparture competition penalties).[11] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion368.cfm#ftn11)In 1979 this committee considered a liquidated damages provision that a lawyer's post-departure work "for a client of the firm during a two-year period following . . . termination" would render the departing lawyer liable to his former firm for "40% of his net billings to such clients . . . during the said two year period." D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 65 (1979). The committee concluded that the provision violated the predecessor of D.C. Rule 5.6(a). Id. A later opinion disapproved a clause that imposed liquidated damages of $150,000 for any breach of an agreement's suite of postemployment restrictions. D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 181 (1987).[12] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn12)In Thelen, the New York Court of Appeals decided that hourly fee matters are not law firm property. In re Thelen LLP, 20 N.E.3d 264. This opinion does not address that particular issue but the Thelen court pointed out several policy considerations that are relevant here. First and most important, many a departing lawyer would be compelled to inform clients who wish to follow her that she can't afford to continue representing them. That would constitute--a major inconvenience for the clients and a practical restriction on a client's right to choose counsel. Or, more likely, these attorneys would simply find it difficult to secure a position in a new law firm because any profits from their work for existing clients would be due their old law firm, not their new employers.* * *Additionally, clients might worry that their hourly fee matters are not getting as much attention as they deserve if the [new] law firm is prevented from profiting from its work on them.Id. at 273. Second, such a rule would allow the departed lawyer's former partners "to profit from work they do not perform, all at the expense of a [the departed lawyer and her] new firm," thus creating a windfall for the former firm. Id.Similar considerations underlie Rule 5.6(a). Thus, regardless of whether a liquidated damages provision passes muster under contract principles, it is grounds for professional discipline if it runs afoul of the limitations set out above.[13] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion368.cfm#ftn13)Restrictions upon post-departure association with personnel of former firmThe second inquiry is whether a law firm may penalize a lawyer financially for entering into an agreement or association with an individual who was a partner or employee (lawyer or non-lawyer) with the former firm.In 1987 this committee reviewed an agreement we described as "perpetually prohibiting any interference" by a departed lawyer "with the firm's relationships with its lawyer/employees." D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 181 (1987). The committee opined that by interfering with the right of association among attorneys, the provision indirectly restricted the departing attorney's right to practice law and hence violated the predecessor of Rule 5.6(a). Id. (citing ABA Informal Op. 1417 (1978)); accord Jacob, 607 A.2d at 152-54. We see no reason to alter this conclusion and accordinglyA11 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm7/11/2018Ethics Opinion 368: Lawyer Employment Agreements--Restrictions on Departing Lawye... Page 4 of 8reaffirm Opinion 181.[14] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn14) As is the case in respect of damages for post-departure competition, any penalty must be substantial to trigger the prohibition of Rule 5.6(a). D.C. Rule 5.6, cmt. [2].This is not to say that a departing lawyer has an unlimited right to solicit firm partners or employees, particularly before she departs. We have noted that although this issue is "primarily, if not entirely," a function of "law other than ethics law, such as the common law of interference with business relations and fiduciary obligations," there could be extreme instances where deception and dishonesty by the departing lawyer might constitute "dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation" in violation of Rule 8.4(c). D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 273 (1997).Choice of lawThe final inquiry is whether, where the departing lawyer also is admitted to practice in another jurisdiction,[15] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn15) a choice of law provision in a partnership or other agreement may avoid the application of D.C. Rule 5.6(a) in favor of a rule of the other jurisdiction that yields a different result. By way of example, a minority of jurisdictions permit the imposition of a financial penalty on a competing former lawyer, so long as the penalty reasonably reflects the loss in the value of the law firm occasioned by the departure. See supra n. 7 and authorities cited therein.A lawyer admitted to practice here is subject to the District's disciplinary authority regardless of where the questioned conduct occurs. D.C. Rule 8.5(a). Moreover, "[a] lawyer may be subject to the disciplinary authority of both this jurisdiction and another jurisdiction where the lawyer is admitted for the same conduct." Id.[16] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion368.cfm#ftn16) Where multiple jurisdictions are involved, however, and the conduct is not in connection with a matter pending before a tribunal--the rules to be applied [by the D.C. disciplinary authorities] shall be the rules of the admitting jurisdiction in which the lawyer principally practices; provided, however, that if particular conduct clearly has its predominant effect in another jurisdiction in which the lawyer is licensed to practice, the rules of that jurisdiction shall be applied to that conduct.D.C. Rule 8.5(b)(2) (emphasis added). The intent of this rule is that "any particular conduct of an attorney shall be subject to only one set of rules of professional conduct" and that the process of determining which set applies be "as straightforward as possible." D.C. Rule 8.5 cmt. [3].Although they antedate choice-of-law provisions in the Model Rules[17] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn17) and state ethics codes, several rulings from outside the District of Columbia are instructive. A 1991 ABA opinion, for example, addressed the fact that the District permits ownership and management of law firms by non-lawyers, while every other American jurisdiction prohibits such arrangements. ABA Formal Op. 91-360 (1991) ("ABA Opinion"). "[W]hat ethical rule should govern," the ABA committee asked, "when lawyers are partners in a law firm that, as permitted by the D.C. rule, includes nonlawyer partners, but are also members of the bar of another jurisdiction [State X] whose rules forbid such partnerships"? Id. The ABA committee concluded that if the lawyer admitted in D.C. and in State X is practicing in a D.C.-located firm with non-lawyer partners, State X should not discipline her for such conduct. Id. On the other hand, State X should be able to discipline the lawyer if she were to practice in State X as a partner of the D.C.-located firm. Id.;[18] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn18) accord Mich. Op. RI-225 (1995); see In re Overboe, 745 N.W.2d 852, 861-62 (Minn. 2008) (applying South Dakota rules to conduct of lawyer admitted there and in Minnesota where lawyer's office and trust account were in South Dakota and funds involved were those of South Dakota clients).A12 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm7/11/2018Ethics Opinion 368: Lawyer Employment Agreements--Restrictions on Departing Lawye... Page 5 of 8The ABA Opinion cited several state ethics opinions in support of its conclusions. ABA Opinion n. 13. A 1984 Michigan opinion had responded to a Michigan Bar member, also admitted in California, who practiced in the latter jurisdiction but not the former. Mich. Ethics Op. CI-929 (1984). The inquirer asked whether he could employ a foreign lawyer in his California law office. Id. The opinion stated that "[t]o the extent that California would permit the contemplated conduct, the attorney would not be in violation of the Michigan Code of Professional Responsibility." Id.The ABA Opinion also cited a 1986 Maryland opinion that addressed a situation where a lawyer licensed in Maryland and specially admitted to appear in a District of Columbia litigation learned that he had introduced the client's forged documents into evidence in connection with the litigation. Md. State Bar Ass'n, Comm. on Ethics, Op. 86-28 (1986). Maryland's rules required disclosure; D.C.'s prohibited it. Id. The Maryland opinion stated that--[w]here a Maryland attorney is acting in a foreign jurisdiction in accordance with that jurisdiction's Code of Professional Responsibility, it is the opinion of this committee that his conduct is ethical per se. While the Maryland Code of Professional Responsibility may impose different or more stringent requirements on its attorneys, it does not require its attorneys to behave in a manner that is inconsistent or at variance with the code of conduct prescribed by another jurisdiction when practicing there.Id. Although the Maryland opinion addressed conduct in connection with a proceeding before a tribunal, see Model Rule 8.5(b)(1), the ABA Opinion nonetheless found Maryland's rationale instructive in a Rule 8.5(b)(2) setting like that presented in this opinion.More recently, a New York State Bar Association opinion has set out useful criteria for determining where a lawyer "principally practices" and where the "predominant effect" of a lawyer's conduct is felt. N.Y.S. Bar Ass'n Ethics Op. 1027 (2014) ("New York Opinion").[19] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn19) On the former point, the factors cited in the New York Opinion are--(a) the number of calendar days the lawyer spends working in each jurisdiction, (b) the number of hours the lawyer bills in each jurisdiction, (c) the location of the clients the lawyer serves, (d) the activities the lawyer performs in each jurisdiction (e.g., legal work for clients vs. administrative work for the law firm), and (e) special circumstances (such as a recent move, an extended illness, or a natural disaster).Id. (citing Roy D. Simon, Simon's New York Rules of Professional Conduct Annotated 1915-17 (2014)). The New York Opinion adds that "[g]iven the increase in law practice over the Internet, and the corresponding decrease in the importance of a lawyer's physical location, the jurisdiction in which a lawyer 'principally practices' . . . is becoming less certain." Id."[N]o simple formula is available to determine where the 'predominant effect' will occur," either. Id. "Factors to consider include such things as (a) where the clients reside, and where they work; (b) where any payments will be deposited; (c) where any contract will be performed; and (d) where any new or expanded business will operate." Id.We conclude that D.C. Rule 8.5(b)(2) supplies the answer to this inquiry and does so consistently with the ABA Opinion. For the departing lawyer and lawyers in her former firm who are located in the District of Columbia, it makes no difference whether the "principally practices" or the "predominant effect" prong of the rule applies. As to the first prong, they principally practice here. As for the second prong--predominant effect--recall that Rule 5.6(a) seeks to protect lawyers' autonomy and clients' right to choose a lawyer . D.C. Rule 5.6 cmt. [1]. The predominant effect of a provision penalizing such a lawyer for post-departure competition falls upon a lawyer who is located in D.C. For that reason, the predominant effect prong renders members of the D.C.A13 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm7/11/2018Ethics Opinion 368: Lawyer Employment Agreements--Restrictions on Departing Lawye... Page 6 of 8Bar in the firm subject to the D.C. version of Rule 5.6(a) regardless of where they principally practice.[20] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftn20)Where the departing lawyer is admitted in D.C. but located in a jurisdiction that permits a penalty for post-departure competition, it also doesn't matter which prong of D.C. Rule 8.5(b)(2) applies. The departing lawyer principally practices in the other jurisdiction, and the predominant effect of the penalty provision falls upon that lawyer. Hence in that case, the other jurisdiction's version of Rule 5.6(a) would apply to the departing D.C. Bar member and the D.C. Bar members in her former firm. In such a case, D.C. should not penalize those lawyers for acting in accordance with the other jurisdiction's rule.ConclusionsWe conclude, then, that a law firm may not provide for or impose liquidated damages on a lawyer who, after departure, competes with the firm. The firm and the lawyer may have liability to one another, though, for work done before the lawyer's departure. Also, a firm may not restrict a departed lawyer's subsequent professional association or affiliation with partners or employees of the firm, except insofar as such activity is subject to legal limitations outside the Rules of Professional Conduct. Finally, whether a choice of law provision in a partnership or employment agreement can avoid application of the D.C. Rule governing lawyer departures usually will depend on the location where the departing lawyer principally practiced.Published: February 2015[1] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref1) This opinion does not address the rule's exception for "benefits upon retirement."[2] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref2) This rule, promulgated in 1991, is substantively indistinguishable from DR 2-108(A) of the former D.C. Code of Professional Responsibility. See Neuman, 715 A.2d at 130 n. 5.[3] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref3) Although Cohen was decided under New York law, the New York rule is similar to ours and the D.C. Court of Appeals has characterized Cohen as "perhaps the leading case interpreting Rule 5.6(a) or its equivalent." Neuman, 715 A.2d at 132.[4] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref4) Stevens applied Illinois law. The D.C. Court of Appeals noted in Neumann, however, that given the similarity of D.C. Rule 5.6 to Model Rule 5.6 and analogous rules of other jurisdictions, it had "freely consulted the various sources we have found that construe those codes." Neuman, 715 A.2d at 130 n. 5. For this reason, it is appropriate to take note of decisions elsewhere that interpret similar rules.[5] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref5) D.C. Legal Ethics Opinions 1 through 209 were issued under the former D.C. Code of Professional Responsibility. Because the prohibition in D.C. Rule 5.6(a) substantively is the same as former D.C. DR 2-108(A), see note 2, supra, and none of this committee's earlier opinions interpreting DR 2-108(A) has been expressly or impliedly overruled, we consider those opinions as well as those decided under the D.C. Rules.[6] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref6) Comment 2, which was added to the D.C. Rules in 2006, does not have a counterpart in the comments to Model Rule 5.6. The D.C. Rules define "substantial" as denoting "a material matter of clear and weighty importance." D.C. Rule 1.0(m).A14 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm7/11/2018Ethics Opinion 368: Lawyer Employment Agreements--Restrictions on Departing Lawye... Page 7 of 8[7] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref7) Some jurisdictions permit "reasonable" financial assessments against former partners who compete with the firm if such assessments accurately reflect the reduction in the firm's value due to the departure. E.g., Howard v. Babcock, 863 P.2d 150 (Calif. 1993); Jacob v. Norris, McLaughlin & Marcus, 607 A.2d 142, 151-52 (N.J. 1992). This is distinctly the minority rule, however. Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers § 13 rptr. n. b. (2000); Ellen J. Bennett, Elizabeth J. Cohen & Martin Whittaker, Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct 489 (7th ed. 2011).[8] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref8) This committee does not opine on legal questions outside the D.C. Rules but often must discuss its understanding of such issues in order to provide context for its views on the D.C. Rules.[9] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref9) In a different context, the sales article of the D.C. Commercial Code permits liquidated damages "only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty." D.C. Code § 28:2-718 (2014).[10] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref10) We know of no D.C. appellate rulings on the issue of post-departure compensation for hourly fee matters, and this opinion does not address that issue.[11] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref11) This committee cannot opine on whether an agreement that violates D.C. Rule 5.6(a) can be enforced as a matter of contract law. Rule C-4, Rules of the District of Columbia Bar Legal Ethics Committee (1995); accord D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 65 (1979) (declining to address enforceability of agreement that violated predecessor of Rule 5.6(a)); see also N.Y.C. Bar Ass'n Formal Op. 1999-03 (1999) (same). The D.C. Court of Appeals does not appear to have ruled on the enforceability issue. A 1994 U.S. District Court ruling in D.C. held such a provision unenforceable. Shainis v. Baraff, Koerner, Olender & Hochberg, P.C., 1994 U.S. Dist. Lexis 21971 (Civil Action No. 93-2253 (NHJ)) (July 18, 1994). Case law elsewhere is divided. Compare Feldman v. Minars, 658 N.Y.S.2d 614, 617 (App. Div. 1997) (enforcing agreement even though it violated Rule 5.6(b)), with Denburg v. Parker Chapin Flattau & Klimpl, 624 N.E.2d 995 (N.Y. 1993) (holding unenforceable a provision that violated Rule 5.6(a)), Stevens, 682 N.E.2d at 1131-32 (same), Jacob, 607 A.2d at 155 (same), and Cohen, 550 N.E.2d 410 (same).[12] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref12) Ashcraft & Gerel, which upheld a departing lawyer's contractual liability for liquidated damages, is not to the contrary. D.C. Rule 5.6 "is inapplicable," said the court, "because the liquidated damages were not linked to [the departing lawyer's] decision to compete with the firm" and hence were "readily distinguishable from a contract not to compete." Ashcraft & Gerel, 244 F.3d at 955. Moreover, Ashcraft & Gerel, which applied District of Columbia law, was decided in 2001. In 2006, the D.C. Court of Appeals added comment 2, which expressly includes "substantial financial penalt[ies]" in the prohibition of D.C. Rule 5.6(a). Given that subsequent change in D.C. law, it is conceivable that Ashcraft & Gerel would be decided differently were it to arise today.[13] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref13) Again, we express no view on whether such a clause may be enforceable in the context of the underlying contract dispute. See supra n. 11.[14] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref14) Opinion 181 also involved a liquidated damages clause--one that the committee described as "truly oppressive." The opinion added that "[t]he in terrorem effect of this sword of Damocles hangingA15 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm7/11/2018Ethics Opinion 368: Lawyer Employment Agreements--Restrictions on Departing Lawye... Page 8 of 8over the head of a departing lawyer is not to be underestimated." D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 181 (1987).[15] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref15) For the sake of simplicity, we assume that only one other jurisdiction is involved. The basic principles outlined here also apply if more than one other jurisdiction is involved.[16] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref16) Note that ABA Model Rule 8.5(b) differs from D.C. Rule 8.5(b) in several respects. Among them is the fact that under the Model Rule, a lawyer may be subject to rules of a jurisdiction where the lawyer is not admitted to practice. ABA Model Rule 8.5.[17] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref17) The 1983 initial version of the ABA Model Rules was silent on the issue. Its comments merely directed readers to "principles of conflict of laws" and "applicable rules of choice of law." ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 8.5 cmts. 2, 3 (1983). Current D.C. Rule 8.5(b)(2) follows the 1993 amendment to Model Rule 8.5(b). See id. Rule 8.5(b) (1993).[18] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref18) The ABA Opinion added that a lawyer admitted in D.C. and State X ethically could be a partner in both the D.C. firm and a State X firm, but only if the State X practice "was conducted through another firm that was both fiscally and managerially separate from and independent of the D.C. firm." ABA Opinion n. 12.[19] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref19) The New York version of Rule 8.5(b)(2) is substantively indistinguishable from D.C. Rule 8.5(b)(2).[20] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm#ftnref20) The "predominant effect" prong is to be applied narrowly, see D.C. Rule 8.5 cmt. [4]; N.Y.S. Bar Ass'n Ethics Op. 1027 (2014), but we conclude that this fact pattern triggers it.A16 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-368.cfm7/11/2018Ethical Considerations in Law Firm DissolutionsPage 1 of 8Ethics Opinion 372Ethical Considerations in Law Firm DissolutionsIntroduction and Scope Numerous ethical obligations attach to both a law firm and its members in connection with the process of the dissolution of the firm. These obligations include, without limitation, the obligation to continue to competently, zealously and diligently represent and communicate with clients during the dissolution process; the obligation of the members of the firm, after consultation, to notify clients of the dissolution and provide clients with options under such notice; the obligation to facilitate the choice of new counsel by clients of the dissolving firm; and, the obligation to properly dispose of client files, funds and other property. As used in this Opinion, the term "dissolution" means the process of terminating the law firm's existence as a legal entity. Since dissolution of a law firm is a process and not a single event, the term is not limited to the legal or technical action which is required to terminate the existence of the firm as a legal entity under corporate, partnership, bankruptcy or other applicable law. Certain ethical obligations may apply at various points during the dissolution process itself and other ethical obligations may continue to apply after the firm has been dissolved. These ethical obligations may attach either when dissolution of the firm has been agreed to by its members or, absent such agreement, is nonetheless reasonably foreseeable. This Opinion does not address the departure of members of the firm in and of itself, even in significant numbers, absent an expectation that the firm itself will at some reasonably foreseeable time in the future be dissolved.

Unlike jurisdictions which have a specific rule governing law firm dissolution, the D.C. ethical considerations that arise in connection with law firm dissolution are dispersed throughout the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct. We believe that it will be helpful to members of the Bar to aggregate the ethical principles of the various applicable D.C. Rules and Opinions in one comprehensive opinion. [2] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn2)Discussion The paramount principle governing the ethical obligations of a law firm and its members in connection with the process of dissolving the firm is that the law firm and its members must continue to competently, zealously and diligently represent and communicate with the clients during the dissolution process. The Rules of Professional Conduct protect the interests of clients by codifying the responsibilities of the legal profession to the public. Thus, despite the many competing responsibilities and potential difficulties of lawyers during the dissolution process, the ethical duties to clients are paramount. The individual lawyers in the firm have an ethical duty to ensure that the matters for which they are responsible are properly handled with diligence and zeal ­ including completion of their matters if possible ­ during the dissolution of the firm.[3] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn3) Moreover, since engagement letters are typically contracts between the clients and the dissolving firm, and not the individual lawyers,A17 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm7/11/2018Ethical Considerations in Law Firm DissolutionsPage 2 of 8the firm itself has a comparable ethical duty.[4] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn4)The Dissolution ProcessConsultation When does the process of dissolution of a law firm begin? This question is not susceptible of a bright line test. There are myriad scenarios that lead to the ultimate decision to dissolve a firm. Numerous members of a firm may leave before the remaining partners decide to dissolve the firm. In the Committee's view, the test is: when is there a reasonable expectation that the firm will at some foreseeable time in the future cease to exist as a legal entity? This test may be met by both subjective and objective standards; i.e., the members of the firm may agree to dissolve, or, absent such agreement, a reasonable lawyer considering all of the facts and the conduct of the firm may conclude that dissolution is reasonably foreseeable.The first step in the dissolution process might well be a decision by the members of the firm, after consultation in good faith, to dissolve the firm. However, we recognize that, in some dissolutions, such consensus and unanimity may be difficult or impossible. Thus, if good faith consultation is impossible or if the authorized members of the firm are unable to agree on dissolution, but there is a reasonable expectation that the firm will at some foreseeable time in the future cease to exist as a legal entity, then individual members of the firm should not be constrained from moving forward.Notice to Clients The next step in the dissolution process is to notify firm clients of the dissolution as soon as practicable.[5] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn5) Although the timing of notice of the firm's dissolution may not be susceptible of precise determination, the ethical mandate is that the notice to clients be timely. Specifically, if after the firm dissolves the lawyer will no longer represent the client, Rule 1.16 (d) requires the lawyer to "take timely steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect the client's interests, including giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for the client to employ other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fees or expenses that has not been earned or incurred."[6] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn6) Even if the lawyer's continued representation beyond dissolution is anticipated or unknown, under Rule 1.4, the notice should be sent early enough so that, upon receipt by the client, the client has sufficient time to make an informed decision regarding the impact of the firm's dissolution on the client's matter(s) and the client's representation generally.[7] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion372.cfm#ftn7)ABA Formal Opinion 99-14 (1999) concludes that, once the members of a firm agree to dissolve, notification to the clients "can be accomplished by the [responsible] lawyer herself, the responsible members of the firm, or the lawyer and those members jointly." ABA Opinion 99-14 does, however, state that "far the better course to protect clients' interests is for the departing lawyer and her law firm to give joint notice of the lawyer's impending departure to all clients for whom the lawyer has performed significant professional services while at the firm, or at least notice to the current clients."Florida Rule 4-5.8 and Virginia Rule 5.8 specifically govern the dissolution of a law firm in those jurisdictions. Under both jurisdictions' Rules, the lawyers of the dissolving firm may not unilaterally contact clients of the firm unless authorized members of the firm have conferred or attempted to confer and have been unable to agree on a method to provide notice to clients. If no method to provide notice to clients can be agreed upon, the unilateral notice from individual members of the dissolving firm must provide options to the clients that they may choose to be represented by any member of the dissolving firm, other lawyers, or other law firms. If a client of a dissolving law firm fails to advise the lawyers of the client's intention with respect to who is to provide future legal representation, the client is deemed to remain a client of the lawyer who is primarily responsible for representation of the client on behalf of the firm until the client advises otherwise.[8] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn8)In the absence of a specific governing rule in the District of Columbia, and after reviewing the Virginia and Florida Rules, ABA Formal Opinion 99-14, and applicable authority in other jurisdictions, this Opinion provides guidance to members of the D.C. Bar on the best practices for law firm dissolution, including notice to clients.[9] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn9)Joint notice by all members of the firm to the clients is preferred.[10] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/EthicsOpinion-372.cfm#ftn10) However, if members of the firm cannot agree to provide notice to the clients, or the terms thereof, then in our view an individual lawyer or group of lawyers in the firm may give unilateral notice to the clients. The lawyer in the firm who had the most significant contact with the particular client, if practicable, should give suchA18 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm7/11/2018Ethical Considerations in Law Firm DissolutionsPage 3 of 8unilateral notice. Only if this is not practicable should unilateral notice by other lawyers in the firm be given. This resolution addresses the tension between joint notice by members of the firm to clients about the firm's dissolution and solicitation of the clients by individual lawyers of the dissolving firm for their new firm(s) and also enables lawyers to fulfill their ethical obligations to timely communicate information necessary to allow clients to make informed decisions about their legal representations.Whether the notice is given jointly by all of the authorized members of the dissolving law firm or unilaterally by individual lawyers in the dissolving law firm, it cannot contain false or misleading statements.[11] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn11) It should provide the options to the clients to choose representation by any member of the dissolving firm, representation by any other lawyer, or representation by any other law firm. The notice may not restrict any lawyer's right to practice.[12] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/EthicsOpinion-372.cfm#ftn12)In the Committee's view, the notice should further provide that, if the client does not respond to the notice and choose any of these three options, the client shall be deemed to remain a client of the lawyer who has been primarily responsible for providing legal services to the client until the client advises otherwise. We appreciate that identifying the lawyer in the firm who is "primarily responsible" for providing legal services to the client is not always an easy endeavor and should be determined on a case-by-case basis depending upon the particular facts and circumstances of the representation. For example, a client's overall relationship partner may not be the lead litigation counsel in a particular litigation matter for the client; nonetheless, the lead litigation counsel may well be the lawyer "primarily responsible" for providing legal services to the client in that litigation matter.Which Clients Receive Notice All clients affected by the firm's dissolution should be notified. This always includes current clients with active matters. In our view, as a general rule notice need not be given to all former clients whose matters have been closed. However, notice should be given to former clients even if their matters are inactive and their files are closed if the firm is holding files and other property for the presumptive five year period after a matter is closed or if the firm is holding files or other property of intrinsic value, such as an original will or stock certificates.[13] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn13) Such clients are clearly affected by the firm's dissolution and should be notified. (See "Client Files" and "Client Trust Funds and Other Property," below, with respect to the ethical requirements for the return of the clients' files, funds and other property.) Moreover, notice to former clients is certainly permissible, although not required.[14] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn14)Options for Client to Choose Counsel under Notice A key principle governing the ethical obligations of a law firm and its members in connection with the process of dissolving the firm is that the clients do not belong to either the law firm or its members. It is axiomatic that a client has the right to retain and discharge a lawyer at will.[15] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion372.cfm#ftn15) When a law firm dissolves, therefore, the client may also discharge counsel and either hire new counsel or not. None of the individual members of the dissolving firm "own" the client. Nor does the dissolving law firm itself, as a separate legal entity, "own" the client.[16] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn16) It follows, therefore, that as a general rule a client's right to choose counsel may not be impaired by the dissolution of a law firm. The client may choose to continue to be represented by a member of the dissolving firm at her new firm or to be represented by another lawyer or by another firm.There may be other facts and circumstances, however, which give rise to exceptions to the general rule that the client has the right to choose counsel, and require the consideration of alternatives. For example, a lawyer's former law firm is dissolving and she is joining another law firm. She represents a client at the former law firm who wishes her to continue the representation at the new law firm. However, the new law firm represents another client whose interests are adverse to those of her client, which creates a conflict of interest under Rule 1.7. The conflict of interest cannot be resolved by client consent or otherwise. The lawyer cannot continue to represent the client at the new firm if such representation will result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.[17] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn17) Thus, other ethical obligations may preclude the lawyer's ability to continue to represent her client, even if she and the client wish her to continue the representation.[18] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn18)As another example, a lawyer's former law firm is dissolving and she is joining another law firm that does not have the support and resources with respect to the client's matters as were available at the dissolving firm. This could limit the lawyer's ability to adequately represent her client at the new law firm. This could raise an issue of competent representation under Rule 1.1.A19 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm7/11/2018Ethical Considerations in Law Firm DissolutionsPage 4 of 8Conversely, there may be situations where the lawyer from the dissolving firm wishes to withdraw from representation of her client, but there are limitations on her right to do so. As a general rule, a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client after her firm dissolves if the withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client.[19] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn19) However, the lawyer may be compelled to represent the client at her new firm. For example, the lawyer may notify a court, administrative agency or other tribunal that, upon dissolution of her law firm, she wishes to terminate representation of her client at her new firm, but that tribunal may order the lawyer to continue to represent her client.[20] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn20)Thus, depending upon the specifics of the lawyer-client relationship and the particular facts and circumstances of each case, a lawyer in a dissolving firm should carefully consider whether she has an ethical obligation which precludes or limits her ability to continue to represent her client diligently, zealously and competently at her new firm.A corollary to the client's right to choose counsel is the lawyer's right, after dissolution of her former law firm, to form, or move to, a new law firm. As a general rule, any agreement restricting the right of lawyers in a law firm to practice after the firm dissolves is unethical.[21] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn21) Such an agreement not only limits the lawyer's professional autonomy but also limits the freedom of clients to choose a lawyer.[22] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn22) A long line of Opinions of this Committee (most recently Opinion 368, Lawyer Employment Agreements ­ Restrictions on Departing Lawyer Who Competes with Former Firm (2015)) has disapproved various restrictions on the mobility of lawyers as a matter of public policy. Underlying each of these Opinions is the intent to preserve clients' access to lawyers who, because of their background and experience, might be the best available talent to represent them.[23] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn23) Of course, the ethical obligations discussed above which may limit the client's ability to choose counsel may also limit the lawyer's ability to choose a new law firm.Notice to Third Parties In addition to the client, notice must be given to certain third parties. Opposing counsel and the tribunal must be notified.[24] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn24) In addition, governmental agencies and other non-adjudicative administrative entities before which lawyers of the dissolving firm are appearing may require notification under their own rules and procedures, which are beyond the scope of this Opinion.[25] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn25)Client Files As an ethical matter, at the termination of a representation, upon request of the client, the lawyer must timely surrender the entire file.[26] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn26) Such files may be made available for the client to pick up, delivered to the client, delivered to the client's new (or continuing) counsel, destroyed, or delivered to some other person designated by the client. If the files are not necessary to protect the client's interests or otherwise needed for continued representation, the costs of delivery, storage and review of the files may be charged to the client.[27] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn27) The lawyer may make a copy of the files at his own cost. [28] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn28)The question often arises as to whether such files may be withheld if the client has not fulfilled his obligation to pay the firm's earned fees and expenses. The District of Columbia permits lawyers to assert and enforce retaining liens against the property of clients for unpaid fees, as a matter of substantive law on which the ethics rules take no position.[29] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn29) Rule 1.8(i) provides a narrow exception to Rule 1.16(d): as to files, the lawyer may retain only that portion of the file which constitutes the lawyer's own work product if the client has not paid for the work. Even this narrow exception does not apply if the client has become unable to pay or if withholding the work product might irreparably harm the client's interest. Opinion 250 (1994) states that "retaining liens on client files are now strongly disfavored in the District of Columbia, that the work product exception permitting such liens should be construed narrowly, and that a lawyer should assert a retaining lien only where the exception is clearly applicable and where the lawyer's financial interests clearly outweigh the adversely affected interests of his former client." We stress that a lawyer who relies on the narrow exception of Rule 1.8(i) to withhold any part of a client file does so at his own peril.For client files maintained solely in electronic form, see Opinion 357 (2010). Absent an agreement to the contrary, a lawyer must comply with a reasonable request by a client to convert electronic records into paper form. In most cases, the client should bear the cost of such conversion, but in certain circumstances the lawyer may be required to bear the cost.A20 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm7/11/2018Ethical Considerations in Law Firm DissolutionsPage 5 of 8As discussed above, client files are considered "other property" of the client under Rule 1.15(a). Under that Rule and Opinion 283, such files shall be retained for a period of five years after termination of the representation, and under Rule 1.15(c) shall be "promptly delivered" to the client upon direction.Client Trust Funds and Other Property Under Rule 1.15(a), client trust funds, including retainers, are to be held in separate trust accounts maintained in accordance with Rule 1.15(b), absent other agreement with the client.[30] (/bar-resources/legalethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn30) Other client property is also to be held separately from the lawyer's own property. Under Rule 1.15(c), upon request by the client, the lawyer shall promptly "deliver" to the client any funds or other property that the client is entitled to receive. Under Rule 1.15(e), Rule 1.16(d) applies to require the return to the client of any unearned portion of advanced legal fees and unincurred costs upon termination of the lawyer's representation.If, after reasonable but unsuccessful attempts to locate a missing client or a former client for whom a dissolving firm is holding trust funds or other property, the client cannot be located, the firm should consider the funds or other property abandoned and, if the circumstances fall within the District of Columbia's Unclaimed Property Act, dispose of the funds or property as directed by that statute.[31] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn31)Information about the Firm The dissolving law firm should review its website, firm listings and directories to ensure compliance with Rule 7.1. In light of the pending dissolution, no information can be contained therein which is false or misleading. A communication is false or misleading if either it contains a material misrepresentation of fact, or omission of a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading, or it contains an assertion about the firm or its services that cannot be substantiated.[32] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn32) For example, the website should be updated for a transitional period to disclose the firm's dissolution, to provide contact information for the dissolved firm's former lawyers, and to inform clients how to obtain their files.If the firm is going to use its firm name and letterhead during the transition period, the letterhead must be updated to accurately reflect the dissolution of the firm and the departure of the firm's lawyers.Sole Practitioners The Rules recognize the heightened risk to clients upon the dissolution of a solo practice, where such dissolution is due to the death, disappearance or disability of the sole practitioner. In order to protect the interests of a sole practitioner, and ensure continuity of representation of such clients, each sole practitioner should prepare a plan, in conformity with applicable rules, that designates another competent lawyer to review client files, notify each client that the lawyer is no longer engaged in the practice of law, and determine whether there is a need for immediate protective action.[33] (/barresources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn33) The D.C. Bar Practice Management Advisory Service provides confidential consultation services and a checklist for closing a law office which may be particularly helpful to sole practitioners.[34] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftn34)If such a succession plan has not been prepared by a sole practitioner, there is a procedure for appointment of counsel by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, on motion of the Board on Professional Responsibility, if a sole practitioner dies, disappears, or is suspended for incapacity or disability and no partner, associate or other responsible attorney is capable of conducting the attorney's affairs.[35] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion372.cfm#ftn35)Dissolution of a Section 5.4(b) Law Firm A unique issue in the District of Columbia arises upon the dissolution of a law firm that includes both lawyer partners and non-lawyer partners under Rule 5.4(b).The partnership or other organizational document of the firm may specify the methodology to be followed when such a firm dissolves. In any event, the non-lawyer partners of the firm have ethical duties coextensive with those of the lawyer partners of the firm with respect to clients. Thus, the ethical duties of lawyers of dissolving firms discussed above would apply equally to non-lawyer partners of a Rule 5.4(b) firm.[36] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/EthicsOpinion-372.cfm#ftn36)The non-lawyer partners of the firm and the lawyer partners of the firm have an initial duty to provide notice of the firm's dissolution to the other lawyers in the firm and thereafter to the clients. If good faith efforts to agree upon such a notice to the clients are unsuccessful, the individual lawyers and non-lawyers in the firm may unilaterally notify clients of the firm of the firm's dissolution, subject to the constraints discussed earlier in this Opinion.A21 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm7/11/2018Ethical Considerations in Law Firm DissolutionsPage 6 of 8If a Rule 5.4(b) firm dissolves and the lawyer partner who was providing legal services to the client in tandem with the non-lawyer partner's provision of non-legal services no longer wishes to provide legal services to the client, and there is no other lawyer who is capable of providing legal services to the client, the lawyer partner may have an ethical duty to continue to provide legal services to the client consistent with Rule 1.16 because the non-lawyer partner cannot provide legal services to the client.Death, Incompetence or Disability of Lawyer Where dissolution of a firm is incident to the death, disability or incompetence of a partner in the firm, so that the partner cannot give notice of dissolution to the clients, one of the surviving, competent lawyers should, in addition to any other ethical duties she may have, provide such notice to clients. This could include a partner, co-counsel, associate or otherwise affiliated lawyer.Conclusion A lawyer has numerous ethical obligations in connection with the dissolution of his law practice or a law firm of which he is a member. A lawyer must consider the obligations to continue to diligently represent and communicate with clients during the dissolution period, to notify clients of the dissolution, to facilitate the clients' choice of counsel, and to properly dispose of client files, funds or other property. There are additional considerations for the dissolution of Rule 5.4(b) firms and solo practices.[1] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref1) Although the ethical considerations which arise in connection with the lateral movement of lawyers between law firms, as well as law firm mergers and acquisitions, overlap with the ethical considerations which arise in connection with law firm dissolution, this Opinion is limited to the latter. See D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 273 (1997).[2] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref2) This Committee does not opine on questions of law outside of the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct. The ethical questions presented in this inquiry, however, may require consideration of the substantive law that may arise and apply in the context of law firm dissolution, including without limitation the law governing bankruptcy, partnerships, corporations and other business entities, contracts, agency, fiduciary duty, real or personal property, tort, trade secrets and unfair competition. Members of the dissolving firm, and the dissolving firm itself, should consider these as appropriate. Nor, for the most part, does this Opinion address the myriad practical, financial and business considerations related to law firm dissolution.[3] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref3) Rules 1.1 and 1.3.[4] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref4) Id.; see also Rule 5.1.[5] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref5) See Opinion 273, in which we lay out in some detail the specifics of the required notice to clients with respect to lateral moves. The same principles should generally govern notice to clients with respect to law firm dissolution.[6] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref6) Rule 1.16(d).[7] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref7) Rule 1.4(a) and 1.4(b).[8] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref8) See Florida Rule of Prof. Conduct 4-5.8 and Virginia Rule of Prof. Conduct 5.8. For purposes of the notice required by the Virginia Rule, "client" refers to clients for whose active matters the lawyer has primary responsibility. This excludes closed matters and includes associates as well as partners.[9] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref9) This builds on the guidance provided in Opinion 273. However, we caution lawyers in dissolving firms that every notice should be tailored to the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the firm's dissolution, which can be quite varied. There is no "one size fits all" formula for notice to clients when a law firm dissolves.[10] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref10) The ethics opinions of other jurisdictions vary as to whether joint notice, individual notice, or both, is required. See, e.g., Cal. Bar Ethics Op. No. 1985-86, (interpreting the California Rule to require both the departing lawyer and the law firm to provide notice to the client).A22 https://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm7/11/2018Ethical Considerations in Law Firm DissolutionsPage 7 of 8[11] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref11) Rules 7.1(a) and 8.4(c).[12] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref12) Rule 5.6(a).[13] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref13) See Rule 1.15(a), Rule 1.15(c), Rule 1.16(d), D.C. Legal Ethics Op. 283(1998).[14] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref14) For example, a lawyer who has had a long and deep relationship with a client, but who has no active matters and is currently holding no client files or other property, may nevertheless consider notifying the former client of her firm's dissolution, as the client may nonetheless view her as its lawyer.[15] (/bar-resources/legal-ethics/opinions/Ethics-Opinion-372.cfm#ftnref15) A client has the right to discharge the lawyer at any time, with or without cause, subject to liability for payment for the lawyer's services.

The dissolving firm may also be required to file notice of dissolution with the D.C.

The departing lawyer and the responsible members of her firm who remain must take reasonable measures to assure that the withdrawal is accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of clients with active matters upon which the lawyer currently is working. The departing lawyer and responsible members of the law firm who remain have an ethical obligation to assure that prompt notice is given to clients on whose active matters she currently is working. The departing lawyer and responsible members of the law firm who remain also have ethical obligations to protect client information, files, and other client property. The departing lawyer is prohibited by ethical rules, and may be prohibited by other law, from making in-person contact prior to her departure with clients with whom she has no family or client-lawyer relationship. After she has left the firm, she may contact any firm client by letter.When a lawyer ceases to practice at a law firm, both the departing lawyer and the responsible members of the firm who remain have ethical responsibilities to clients on whose active matters the lawyer currently is working to assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that their representation is not adversely affected by the lawyer's departure. In this Opinion, the Committee addresses obligations under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct that a lawyer has when she leaves one law firm for another, including the following: (1) disclosing her pending departure in a timely fashion to clients for whose active matters she currently is responsible or plays a principal role in the current delivery of legal services (sometimes referred to in this Opinion as "current clients"); (2) assuring that client matters to be transferred with the lawyer to her new law firm do not create conflicts of interest in the new firm and can be competently managed there; (3) protecting client files and property and assuring that, to the extent reasonably practicable, no client matters are adversely affected as a result of her withdrawal; (4) avoiding conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in connection with her planned withdrawal; and (5) maintaining confidentiality and avoiding conflicts of interest in her new affiliation respecting client matters remaining in the lawyer's former firm.1------------------------------------------------------------1 This Opinion addresses mainly the obligations of the departing lawyer. Nevertheless, the firm members remaining, and especially those with supervisory responsibility, have an obligation under the Rules of Professional Conduct, and may have obligations as well under other law, to assure to the extent reasonable practicable that the withdrawal from the firm is accomplished without material adverse effect on any clients' interests, especially clients on whose active matters the departing lawyer currently is working. Cf. ABA Informal Opinion 1428 (1979), decided under the former Model Code of Professional Responsibility, and California Bar Ethics Op. No. 1985-86, 1985 WL 57193 *2 (Cal. St. Bar. Comm. Prof. Resp. 1985), both of which place the responsibility of notifying clients upon the departing lawyer and her firm. Among remaining firm members'ethical obligations are to make reasonable efforts to ensure that there are in effect measures: (1) to keep clients informed pursuant to Rule 1.4(b) of the impending departure of a lawyer having substantial responsibility for the clients' active matters; (2) to make clear to those clients and others for whom the departing lawyer has worked and who inquire that the clients may choose to be represented by the departing lawyer, the firm or neither(see Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers § 26 cmt. h (Proposed Official Draft 1998);(3) to assure that active matters on which the departing lawyer has been working continue to be managed by remaining lawyers with competence and diligence pursuant to Rules 1.1 and 1.3; and (4) to assure that, upon the firm's withdrawal from representation of any client, the firm takes reasonable steps to protect the client's interests pursuant to Rule 1.16(d). See infra, n.4 and accompanying text. This Opinion does not address the issue of a division of fees between the departing lawyer and her law firm.------------------------------------------------------------Formal Opinion 99-414 © Copyright 2009 by the American Bar Association.

Copies of ABA Formal Ethic Opinions are available from Service Center, American Bar Association, 321 North Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60654, 1-800-285-2221.A25The departing lawyer also must consider legal obligations other than ethics rules that apply to her conduct when changing firms, as well as her fiduciary duties owed the former firm. The law of agency, partnership, property, contracts, and unfair competition impose obligations that are not addressed directly by the Model Rules. These obligations may affect the permissible timing, recipients, and content of communications with clients and which files, documents, and other property the departing lawyer lawfully may copy or take with her from the firm. Although the Committee does not advise upon issues of law beyond the Model Rules, we must take account of other law in construing the Rules;so must the departing lawyer before determining an appropriate course of action.Notification to Current Clients Is RequiredThe impending departure of a lawyer who is responsible for the client's representation or who plays a principal role in the law firm's delivery of legal services currently in a matter (i.e., the lawyer's current clients), is information that may affect the status of a client's matter as contemplated by Rule 1.4.2 A lawyer who is departing one law firm for another has an ethical obligation, along with responsible members of the law firm who remain, to assure that those clients are informed that she is leaving the firm. This can be accomplished by the lawyer herself, the responsible members of the firm, or the lawyer and those members jointly. Because a client has the ultimate right to select counsel of his choice,3 information that the lawyer is leaving and where she will be practicing will assist the client in determining whether his legal work should remain with the law firm, be transferred with the lawyer to her new firm, or be transferred elsewhere. Accordingly, informing the client of the lawyer's departure in a timely manner is critical to allowing the client to decide who will represent him.4------------------------------------------------------------2 Rule 1.4 (Communication) states:(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.Comment[1] to Rule 1.4 provides that "the client should have sufficient information to participate intelligently in decisions concerning ... the means by which they [the objectives of the representation] are to be pursued...."3 Rule 1.16 (Declining Or Terminating Representation) in paragraph (a)(3) states in pertinent part that a lawyer "shall withdraw from the representation of a client if ... the lawyer is discharged." See also Comment [4]; Restatement § 26 cmt h, supra n.1.4 State ethics opinions also have determined that, under the Model Rules, a departing lawyer has an ethical duty to inform current clients that she is leaving the firm. See, e.g., District of Columbia Bar Legal Ethics Committee Op. No. 273 (1997); State Bar of Michigan Std. Com. on Prof. and Jud. Ethics Op. No. RI-224, 1995 WL 68957 (Mich. Prof. Jud. Eth. 1995). See also Rule 1.16(d), infra n.8. The ABA Committee gave approval under the former Model Code of Professional Responsibility for a partner or associate who is leaving one firm for another to send an announcement soon after departure to those clients for whose active, open, and pending matters the lawyer had been directly responsible immediately before resignation. Informal Opinions 1457 (1980) and 1466 (1981). These opinions did not, however, address the question whether the departing lawyer might send notices to any clients before resigning.------------------------------------------------------------Notification of Current Clients is Not Impermissible SolicitationBecause she has a present professional relationship with her current clients, a departing lawyer does not22Formal Opinion 99-414 © Copyright 2009 by the American Bar Association.

Under Rule 7.3(a), the departing lawyer is, however, prohibited from making in-person contact with firm clients with whom she does not have a prior professional or family relationship. A lawyer does not have a prior professional relationship with a client sufficient to permit in-person or live telephone solicitation solely by having worked on a matter for the client along with other lawyers in a way that afforded little or no direct contact with the client.6 The departing lawyer nevertheless may contact the client through written or oral recorded communication pursuant to Rule 7.2(a), subject to the limitations in Rules 7.1, 7.3(b), and 7.3(c), at least after the lawyer has departed the firm and joined the new firm.7------------------------------------------------------------5 Model Rule 7.3(a) states:A lawyer shall not by in-person or live telephone contact solicit professional employment from a prospective client with whom the lawyer has no family or prior professional relationship when a significant motive for the lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain.6 The rationale for the prohibition is that "there is a potential for abuse inherent in direct in-person or live telephone contact by a lawyer with a prospective client known to be in need of legal services." Rule 7.3, Comment [1]. The rationale for the exception is that "[t]here is far less likelihood that a lawyer would engage in abusive practices against an individual with whom the lawyer has a prior personal (sic)or professional relationship...." Rule 7.3, Comment [4]. The Committee views the exception under Rule 7.3(a) to permit in-person solicitation only of those current clients of the firm with whom the lawyer personally has had sufficient professional conduct to afford the client an opportunity to judge the professional qualifications of the lawyer and as not extending beyond the text of the Rule to apply to firm clients with whom her relationship is solely personal and not professional. See, e.g., N.C. Bar Opinion 200, 1994 WL 899607 (N.C. St. Bar 1994)(lawyer after departure may contact clients of firm for whom he has been responsible);Arizona Comm. on Rules of Professional Conduct Op. No. 91-17 (June 10, 1991)(permissible before departure to notify clients with whom he had a personal, professional relationship); Kentucky Bar Opinion E-317 (1987) (permissible before departure to notify clients whom he personally represented of his impending departure).7 Lawyers are permitted, subject to certain limitations, "to make known their services not only through reputation but also through organized information campaigns. Rule 7.2, Comment [1]. Rule 7.2 permits not only general advertising, but also targeted "written or recorded communication."------------------------------------------------------------The Committee also is of the opinion that a departing lawyer must, under Rule 1.16(d),8 take steps to the extent practicable to protect her current clients' interests. Moreover, the responsible members of the former firm must themselves comply with Rule 1.16(d) respecting all clients who select the departing lawyer to represent them, whether or not they are current clients of the departing lawyer.9------------------------------------------------------------8 Model Rule 1.16(d) states:Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.9 If a current client chooses to remain with the firm or to move with the departing lawyer to her new firm, the lawyer(s) selected must continue the representation unless withdrawal is necessary under Rule 1.16(a) or permissible under Rule 1.16(b). In the Committee's opinion, "other good cause for withdrawal"does not exist under Rule 1.16(b)(6) solely because the client's matter is difficult or time consuming or has little chance of success, so long as no other enumerated predicate for withdrawal exists.33Formal Opinion 99-414 © Copyright 2009 by the American Bar Association.

Passanante v. Yormack, 138 N.J.Super. 233, 238, 350 A.2d 497, 500 (N.J. 1975), cert. denied, 704 N.J. 144, 358 A.2d 199 (N.J. 1976) (lawyer has implicit obligation to inform clients of failure to act for whatever cause to permit clients to engage another lawyer).------------------------------------------------------------The Initial Notice Must Fairly Describe the Client's AlternativesAny initial in-person or written notice informing clients of the departing lawyer's new affiliation that is sent before the lawyer's resigning from the firm generally should conform to the following:1) the notice should be limited to clients whose active matters the lawyer has direct professional responsibility at the time of the notice (i.e., the current clients);2) the departing lawyer should not urge the client to sever its relationship with the firm, but may indicate the lawyer's willingness and ability to continue her responsibility for the matters upon which she currently is working;3) the departing lawyer must make clear that the client has the ultimate right to decide who will complete or continue the matters;and4) the departing lawyer must not disparage the lawyer's former firm.11 ------------------------------------------------------------11 ABA Informal Opinion 1457 (1980) found consistent with the Model Code of Professional Responsibility the timing, content, and choice of recipients of a form letter announcement by a lawyer that he had resigned from a law firm to become a member of another firm sent "soon after making the change to clients(and only those clients) for whose active, open, and pending matters he was directly responsible as a member of the ABC law firm immediately before his resignation." The form letter stated that the client had a right to decide how and by whom the pending matters would be handled and did not urge the client to choose the departing lawyer over the firm. In ABA Informal Opinion 1466 (1981), Opinion 1457 was extended to include associates, assuming the same fact pattern. The Committee there noted it "does not determine or advise upon issues of law," but then distinguished the facts presented to the Committee from the facts shown in Adler v. Epstein, 393 A.2d 1175 (Pa. 1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 907 (1979) (departing group of associates enjoined from actively soliciting clients of old firm as part of pre-departure efforts to borrow money on the basis of the clients). Today we reject any implication of Informal Opinions 1457 or 1466 that the notices to current clients and discussions as a matter of ethics must await departure from the firm.------------------------------------------------------------The Departing Lawyer Should Provide Additional Information44Formal Opinion 99-414 © Copyright 2009 by the American Bar Association. Reprinted with permission. Copies of ABA Formal Ethic Opinions are available from Service Center, American Bar Association, 321 North Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60654, 1-800-285-2221.A28In order to provide each current client with information he needs to make a choice of counsel, the departing lawyer also may inform the client whether she will be able to continue the representation at her new law firm.12 If the client requests further information about the departing lawyer's new firm, the lawyer should provide whatever is reasonably necessary to assist the client in making an informed decision about future representation, including, for example, billing rates and a description of the resources available at the new firm to handle the client matter.13 The departing lawyer nevertheless must continue to make clear in these discussions that the client has the right to choose whether the firm, the departing lawyer and her new firm, or some other lawyer will continue the representation.------------------------------------------------------------12 The departing lawyer must ensure that her new firm would have no disqualifying conflict of interest in representing the client in a matter under Rule 1.7, or other Rules, and has the competence to undertake the representation. In order to do so, she may need to disclose to the new firm certain limited information relating to this representation. When discussing an association with another firm, the departing lawyer also must be mindful of potentially disqualifying conflicts of interest in her old firm if the new firm currently represents any client with interests adverse to a client of the old firm. Should such a client be identified, the departing lawyer may need to be screened within the old firm no later than the commencement of serious discussions with the new firm. See ABA Formal Opinion 96-400. Lastly, the departing lawyer also might find that her work in her former firm would, upon her arrival at the new firm, create a conflict of interest under Rule 1.9 with one of her new firm's clients requiring the creation of a screen that, subject to the affected clients' consents in most jurisdictions, would avoid imputation of her individual conflict of interest to her new firm under Model Rule 1.10(a).13 In this respect, we agree with D.C. Bar Legal Ethics Opinion 273 (1997), "Ethical Considerations of Lawyers Moving From One Private Firm to Another."------------------------------------------------------------Joint Notification By the Lawyer and the Firm is PreferredFar the better course to protect clients' interests is for the departing lawyer and her law firm to give joint notice of the lawyer's impending departure to all clients for whom the lawyer has performed significant professional services while at the firm, or at least notice to the current clients.14 Unfortunately, this is not always feasible when the departure is not amicable. In some instances, the lawyer's mere notice to the firm might prompt her immediate termination. When the departing lawyer reasonably anticipates that the firm will not cooperate on providing such a joint notice, she herself must provide notice to those clients for whose active matters she currently is responsible or plays a principal role in the delivery of legal services, in the manner described above, and preferably should confirm the conversations in writing so as to memorialize the details of the communication and her compliance with Model Rules 7.3 and 7.1.15------------------------------------------------------------14 Cal. Bar Ethics Op. No. 1985-86, 1985 WL 57193 at *2, supra, n.1, interprets the California Rule to require both the departing lawyer and the law firm to provide fair and adequate notice of the withdrawal to the client sufficient to allow a client an opportunity to make an informed choice of counsel, and states that, where practical, the notice should be made jointly. ABA Informal Opinion 1428 (1979) suggested that, under the Model Code, both the departing lawyer and the law firm had an obligation to give the client "the choice as to whether or not the client wishes the firm to continue handling the matter or whether the client wishes to choose another lawyer or legal services firm." See also Cleveland Bar Opinion 89-5 (under the Model Code, either the departing lawyer or the law firm must give due notice to those clients of the former firm for whose active, open, and pending matters the lawyer is directly responsible).15 The responsible members of the law firm must not take actions that frustrate the departing lawyer's current clients' right to choose their counsel under Rule 1.16(a) and Comment [4] by denying access to the clients'files or otherwise. To do so may violate the responsible members' ethical obligations under Rules1.16(d) and 5.1.55Formal Opinion 99-414 © Copyright 2009 by the American Bar Association. Reprinted with permission.

For example, the departing lawyer may avoid charges of engaging in unfair competition and appropriation of trade secrets if she does not use any client lists or other proprietary information to assist her in advising clients of her new association, but uses instead only publicly available information and what she personally knows about the clients' matters.16------------------------------------------------------------16 See, e.g., Siegel v. Arter & Hadden, 85 Ohio St. 3d 171, 707 N.E.2d 853 (Ohio Sup. Ct. 1999) (unresolved fact issues precluded summary judgment on unfair competition and trade secret counts because of departing lawyer's use of client list with names, addresses, telephone numbers and matters and fee information, despite notice to firm before notice to clients). See also Shein v. Myers, 394 Pa. Super. 549, 552, 576 A.2d 985, 986 (Pa. 1990), appeal denied, 533 Pa. 600, 617 A.2d 1274 (Pa. 1991) ("breakaway" lawyers tortiously interfered with contract between their former firm and its clients by taking 400 client files, making scurrilous statements about the firm, and sending misleading letters to firm clients). In a joint opinion, the Pennsylvania and Philadelphia Bars warned that notice to clients before advising the firm of her intended departure "may be construed as an attempt to lure clients away in violation of the lawyer's fiduciary duties to the firm, or as tortious interference with the firm's relationships with its clients." Pa. Bar Ass'n Comm. on Legal Ethics and Prof. Resp. Joint Op. No. 99-100, 1999 WL 239079*2. (Pa. Bar. Assn. Comm. Leg. Eth. Prof. Resp. 1999). The Committee also noted that the "prudent approach" is for the departing lawyer not to notify her clients before advising the firm of her intention to leave to join another firm. Id.------------------------------------------------------------Charges of breach of fiduciary and other duties owed the former firm also might be avoided if the departing lawyer and her new firm go no further than the permissible conduct noted in Graubard Mollen v. Moskovitz17 and avoid the conduct the court found actionable, such as secretly attempting to lure firm clients to the new firm (even when the departing lawyer originated and had principal responsibility for the clients' matters) and lying to clients about their right to remain with the old firm and to partners about the lawyer's plans to leave. Although this case involved civil litigation, other courts have imposed discipline on lawyers for similar conduct because it involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c).18------------------------------------------------------------17 86 N.Y.2d 112, 653 N.E.2d 1179 (1995). The Court stated that a departing lawyer's efforts to locate alternative space and affiliations would not violate his fiduciary duties to his firm because those actions obviously require confidentiality. Also, informing firm clients with whom the departing lawyer has a prior professional relationship about his impending withdrawal and reminding them of their right to retain counsel of their choice is permissible. Id.at 1183. A departing lawyer should, of course, consult all case law applicable in the practice jurisdiction.18 See, e.g., In the Matter of Cupples, 979 S.W.2d 932, 935 (Mo. 1998); In re Cupples, 952 S.W.2d 226, 236-37 (Mo. 1997) (separate disciplinary proceedings against involving the same lawyer in connection with his departure from two different law firms, the court held that the lawyer's conduct, which included secreting client files as he prepared to withdraw from a firm, removing files without client consent, failing to inform client of change in nature of the representation, and other actions constituted conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Missouri's counterpart to Model Rule 8.4(c)). See also In re Smith, 853 P.2d 449, 453 (Or. 1992) (Before leaving law firm, lawyer met with new clients in his office, had them sign retainer agreements with him, and took files from the office.

To the extent that these documents were prepared by the lawyer and are considered the lawyer's property or are in the public domain, she may take copies with her. Otherwise, the lawyer may have to obtain the firm's consent to do so.The Committee is of the opinion that, absent special circumstances, the lawyer does not violate any Model Rule by taking with her copies of documents that she herself has created for general use in her practice. However, as with the use of client lists, the question of whether a lawyer may take with her continuing legal education materials, practice forms, or computer files she has created turns on principles of property law and trade secret law. For example, the outcome might depend on who prepared the material and the measures employed by the law firm to retain title or otherwise to protect it from external use or from taking by departing lawyers.Client files and client property must be retained or transferred in accordance with the client's direction.19 A departing lawyer who is not continuing the representation may, nevertheless, retain copies of client documents relating to her representation of former clients, but must reasonably ensure that the confidential client information they contain is protected in accordance with Model Rules 1.6 and 1.9.------------------------------------------------------------19 See Model Rule 1.16(d), supra, n.8. Pending client instructions, client property must be held in accordance with Model Rule 1.15.------------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSIONBoth the lawyer who is terminating her association with a law firm to join another and the responsible members of the firm who remain have ethical obligations to clients for whom the departing lawyer is providing legal services. These ethical obligations include promptly giving notice of the lawyer's impending departure to those current clients on whose matters she actively is working.The lawyer does not violate any Model Rule in notifying the current clients of her impending departure by in-person or live telephone contact before advising the firm of her intentions to resign, so long as the lawyer also advises the client of the client's right to choose counsel and does not disparage her law firm or engage in conduct that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. After her departure, she also may send written notice of her new affiliation to any firm clients regardless of whether she has a family or prior professional relationship with them.Before preparing to leave one firm for another, the departing lawyer should inform herself of applicable law other than the Model Rules, including the law of fiduciaries, property and unfair competition. She also should take care to act lawfully in taking or utilizing the firm's information or other property.ABA Formal Opinions77Formal Opinion 99-414 © Copyright 2009 by the American Bar Association.

Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943). The Michigan and Kentucky laws under review, and all similar laws that deny same-sex couples the ability to enjoy the rights, benefits, protections and obligations of marriage, violate the "equal protection of the laws" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.A. ABA Members' Experience Demonstrates That Legal Substitutes for Marriage Rights and Obligations Are Costly, Complex, and Unequal.The Michigan and Kentucky laws under review are just two of the thirteen state constitutional and statutory schemes currently in force that deny marriage equality to same-sex couples ("marriage bans"). Fourteen more state marriage bans have been enjoined over the objections of state officials.55 In addition to Michigan and Kentucky, as of this filing eleven other states (Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas) deny marriage to same-sex couples. An additional nine states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina) are actively defending their marriage bans in federal district court or on appeal, but enforcement of the laws has been enjoined. Another five states (Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin) unsuccessfully sought to reverse a final federal judgment finding their marriage bans unconstitutional and were denied review by this Court. In a recent decision, the District Court for the District of Nebraska preliminarily enjoined that state's marriage ban, effective March 9, 2015.9ABA lawyers have seen for decades the costs, in time, money, and suffering that such marriage bans inflict on same-sex couples, their children, and larger family and social circles. ABA members have counseled many thousands of clients in ways legally to re-create the rights and obligations that accrue automatically from marriage. But these efforts are at best incomplete solutions and only highlight the pervasive difficulties imposed by exclusionary laws like those in Michigan and Kentucky.This brief addresses some of the daily harms experienced by same-sex couples and highlights the legal difficulty, and sometimes impossibility, of working around those harms. In Table 1 of the Appendix, three of the issues presented by marriage bans are highlighted for the twenty-seven states in which marriage bans (A) are being contested in litigation or (B) had been contested through final judgment in the relevant federal court of appeals and where certiorari was denied. These issues are: (1) rights of inheritance; (2) rights to direct the burial of a partner's remains; and (3) rights to make medical decisions. The table also identifies the number of statutory and constitutional provisions in each state that reference terms such as "spouse," "husband," or "wife," demonstrating the importance of marriage and the status of being married in each of these states. For example, the Michigan statutory code and constitution contain 778 provisions that reference marriage or spouse or use similar marriage-related terms. Of those provisions, 453 contain a form of the word "spouse";10138 contain the word "husband"; and 122 contain the word "wife." In Kentucky, the total number is 508.6 As shown in Table 1, the total across all twenty-seven states is more than 17,000.Legal work-arounds and substitutes for the rights and benefits that are automatically granted through marriage, to the extent they are available, are potentially costly and require a same-sex couple proactively to recognize the issue and consult a lawyer. Some of these harms derive from federal law's reliance on state-law marital status,7 yet many are6 These numbers, and those for the other states studied, were obtained by performing an electronic database (Westlaw) search of the respective state's statutes and constitutions for any of the following keywords: marriage, married, marry, marrying, marries, husband, wife, spouse, spouses, spousal, widow, widower, widowed. Regulations and court rules were excluded. This methodology is necessarily imperfect and may capture provisions that are definitional, that mention the above terms in passing, or that do not actually affect an individual's rights or obligations. Cf. Letter from Barry R. Bedrick, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, to Rep. Henry J. Hyde (Jan. 31, 1997) (explaining statute-counting methodology in U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, GAO/OGC-97-16, Defense of Marriage Act (1997)); Letter from Dayna K. Shah, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, to Sen. Bill Frist (Jan. 23, 2004) (updating prior report).7 Among federal law benefits affected by state law marital status are the Social Security spousal and survivorship benefits, see 42 U.S.C. § 402 (2012) (offering spousal benefits during a spouse's life, as well as survivor benefits, and lump-sum death benefits), and the right to leave under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), see 5 U.S.C. § 6382(a)(1)(C), (a)(3) (2012); 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C), (a)(3) (2012) (granting eligible employees leave to care for a spouse who has a serious healthcare condition, or(Continued on following page)11unique to state law or rest on state law's incorporation of or coordination (particularly in the tax arena) with federal law.1. Parental RightsAttorneys who advise same-sex couples with children face profound obstacles in assisting those couples in establishing legal bonds with their children when those couples live in states that deny them the protections of marriage. Indeed, the most basicinjury from military service). The Social Security Act limits spousal benefits to persons who are found to be "validly married" by a court of the state where they were "domiciled" at the time of application or death. 42 U.S.C. § 416(h)(1). Similarly, FMLA benefits for same-sex spouses are limited to states that recognize their marriages. See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wage & Hour Div., Fact Sheet No. 28F (Aug. 2013). Same-sex couples who cannot marry in their state are excluded from these benefits.The executive branch has recently sought to extend benefits to same-sex married couples. See Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2016, at 38 (2015), http://www.whitehouse.gov/ sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/budget.pdf (President's proposed budget for 2016 would extend Social Security spousal benefits to same-sex married couples whose state does not recognize their marriage); Definition of Spouse Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 80 Fed. Reg. 9989, 9989-10,001 (Feb. 25, 2015) (to be codified at 29 C.F.R. pt. 825 and effective starting March 27, 2015) (revising for FMLA purposes the definition of spouse to recognize marriages based on "place of celebration" instead of "state of residence"). Yet such measures would not extend benefits to same-sex couples barred from marrying in their own states and who cannot leave their states to be married due to financial burdens or illness.12aspects of family life, such as being legally recognized as the parent of one's child, are beyond the reach of many same-sex couples in such states, even those who can afford legal counsel. For example, in many states, the presumption that a child born to a married couple is the child of both spouses is considered to be "one of the strongest presumptions in the law." In re K.H., 677 N.W.2d 800, 806 (Mich. 2004) (quoting People v. Case, 137 N.W. 55, 56 (Mich. 1912)); see also Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110 (1989) (allowing presumption of legitimacy even where husband was not the biological father); Susan Frelich Appleton, Presuming Women: Revisiting the Presumption of Legitimacy in the Same-Sex Couples Era, 86 B.U. L. Rev. 227, 232 (2006) (discussing history of the presumption). By contrast, lawyers advising same-sex couples who cannot marry must provide counsel that takes into account the fact that the couple cannot invoke the benefit of this marital presumption of parenthood.The inability to rely on the marital presumption can have acute legal consequences for parents and their children. If one partner is a biological parent of a child, the other partner may be treated as a legal stranger with no parental rights if the relationship ends or the biological-parent partner dies. See, e.g., Harmon v. Davis, No. 297968 (Mich. Ct. App. July 8, 2010), available at http://publicdocs.courts.mi.gov:81/ COA/PUBLIC/ORDERS/2010/297968(22)_order.PDF (holding that an adult who is neither a biological parent nor related through marriage or adoption is13not a parent for purposes of Michigan Child Custody Act), leave to appeal denied, 800 N.W.2d 63 (Mich. 2011); see also 800 N.W.2d at 64 (Kelly, J., dissenting) (observing how lower appellate court's decision effectively barred plaintiff from having child visitation rights after end of a nineteen-year same-sex relationship).Such inequities cannot be fully remedied through the assistance of legal counsel, particularly where, as in Michigan, joint or second-parent adoption by samesex couples is not available or fully recognized by the state. See, e.g., DeBoer v. Snyder, 772 F.3d 388, 424 (6th Cir. 2014) (Daughtrey, J., dissenting); Adar v. Smith, 639 F.3d 146 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (upholding state practice excluding same-sex couple from listing both parents' names on adopted child's birth certificate because they are unmarried under the law of the child's birth state). In such states, nonbiological parents' connection to their children remains at the discretion of their former partners or a family court judge. See, e.g., Truman v. Lillard, 404 S.W.3d 863, 869-70 (Ky. Ct. App. 2013) (affirming decision that former same-sex partner lacked legal basis for custody or visitation as she did not qualify as a "de facto custodian"); Ross T. Ewing, Gay and Lesbian Parents in Kentucky, Ky. Bench & B. Mag., Jan. 2014, at 8, 9, available at http://www.kybar.org/documents/ benchbar_searchable/benchbar_0114.pdf (Kentucky's "marriage prohibitions[,] . . . lack of second-parent adoption, and the out-moded provisions of [the] 1964 Uniform Paternity Act ensure that one partner will14legally be a non-parent to any children raised by [a same-sex couple]") (footnotes omitted).Likewise, the unavailability of marriage to samesex couples punishes their children by depriving them not only of access to a parent but also the benefit of child-support and alimony payments. Whereas a married different-sex spouse may not simply walk away from his or her financial obligations to a family, a non-biological parent from a same-sex relationship who has been denied marriage and adoption rights has no such legal obligation. See, e.g., Ewing, supra, at 10 (in Kentucky, "[n]o statutory or common-law authority requires a non-parent to financially support the legal children of another, absent perhaps an enforceable contract to do so"). Such policies cannot further the best interests of the children involved.2. Death and InheritanceIn most matters of death and inheritance, the law typically grants surviving spouses automatic rights. For instance, all states grant surviving spouses rights in inheritance, see infra app. Table 1, following the policy that the deceased would have wanted rights and property to pass to the surviving spouse. Same-sex couples who cannot marry are denied these automatic rights and must seek legal counsel to craft substitute arrangements.Another of these rights is the right to determine the disposition of the physical remains of a deceased partner. Under Michigan law, for example, the right15to make decisions about funeral arrangements and the disposition of a decedent's body presumptively belongs to the decedent's spouse. If there is no surviving spouse, the right belongs to persons "related to the decedent in the closest degree of consanguinity." Mich. Comp. Laws § 700.3206 (2014); cf. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 367.97501 (West 2014) (right to make decisions regarding remains goes to the surviving spouse, then adult children, then parents); see also infra app. Table 1 (showing automatic spousal right in all twenty-seven states).The default rules in these statutory schemes recognize a deep emotional investment in the disposition of a spouse's remains. This Court has recognized marriage to have "spiritual significance" to many people, Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 96 (1987), and spiritual choices affect not only ceremonial aspects of the marriage but the fundamental framework in which a married couple chooses to live their lives, raise children, and be laid to rest. The same considerations hold true for committed same-sex partners who cannot marry. Petitioner Love, for example, holds a commonly shared fear that in the event of his or his partner's death, the surviving partner could be excluded entirely from planning or attending a funeral. Affidavit of Timothy Love and Lawrence Ysunza in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment para. 13, Love v. Beshear, No. 3:13-CV-750-JGH (W.D. Ky. Apr. 18, 2014).Same-sex couples are also denied automatic inheritance rights granted to surviving spouses when16their spouse dies intestate. Michigan law, for example, provides that a spouse inherits the entire estate if no descendant or parent survives; where there are additional surviving relations, the spouse inherits the first $100,000 of an intestate estate plus one-half of the remaining balance. Mich. Comp. Laws § 700.2102; cf. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 391.030 (exempting first $15,000 of estate for surviving spouse whether or not will in place). Under intestacy regimes such as Michigan's, a committed same-sex partner and sometimes the couple's children (absent a biological relationship or a valid adoption) will receive nothing.Because intestacy rules apply as a default if a decedent lacks a will, it is possible through careful estate planning to navigate some of the legal risks surrounding the death of one member of an unmarried same-sex couple.8 However, even if an estate plan is put in place successfully, the process is likely to be a greater burden on the finances and time of same-sex couples than for different-sex spouses. Lawyers must be careful to account for the fact that laws, rules, and forms may assume the ability to marry, and develop a nuanced understanding of the8 For property intended to be jointly owned, unmarried same-sex couples may be able to establish joint trusts and include pour-over provisions to fund the trust in a will. However, these must account for scenarios in which the relationship ends, may incur gift taxes, and may subject the parties to one another's creditors' claims and malpractice claims. See Joan Burda, ABA, Gay, Lesbian and Transgender Clients: A Lawyer's Guide 226-27 (2008).17differences in state regimes and complex family arrangements that same-sex couples must negotiate. In addition, wills of individuals in same-sex relationships are particularly vulnerable to challenge, both because of the lack of certainty concerning the legal status of the couple's relationship and because of the risk of hostility toward same-sex partners from family members and the judiciary. See, e.g., Camille M. Quinn & Shawna S. Baker, Essential Estate Planning for the Constitutionally Unrecognized Families in Oklahoma, 40 Tulsa L. Rev. 479, 502-04 (2004) (collecting examples of will challenges over property shared by same-sex couples).Same-sex partners may also be precluded from filing wrongful death actions. Such suits account for probable loss of financial support caused by a wrongful death, and may compensate for the loss of advice, assistance, and companionship. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 925 & cmts. (a)-(b) (1979). The right to file and benefit from such a suit is usually granted automatically to spouses. See, e.g., Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.2922(3)(a) (surviving spouse entitled to damages under a wrongful death action); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 411.130 (surviving spouse entitled to at least onehalf of damages). The same option, however, is generally not provided to unmarried, same-sex partners, who face the same concerns following the wrongful death of a partner. Some states provide limited allowances for nonrelatives. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.2922 (allowing beneficiaries of an enforceable will to benefit from a wrongful death suit). Others do18not. Cf. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 411.130 (allowing only "kindred" to benefit from a suit).Same-sex partners are also frequently ineligible to receive survivorship benefits for spouses of public safety officers. Kentucky provides a lump-sum payment of $80,000 to a spouse of any police officer, corrections officer or member of the National Guard who dies as a direct result of an act in the line of duty. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 61.315. Kentucky law also provides free tuition at a state-supported school for children and spouses of firefighters or police officers who die from duty-related injuries. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 164.2841; cf. Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 390.1241.1243 (providing state college grants under the same circumstances). These benefits provide comfort for individuals with dangerous jobs serving their communities, by extending financial security to their families in case of their death. However, the surviving same-sex partner of a public safety officer may be excluded from these employment-based death benefits. See, e.g., Glossip v. Mo. Dep't of Transp. & Highway Patrol Emps. Ret. Sys., 411 S.W.3d 796 (Mo. 2013) (en banc) (upholding denial of survivor benefits to samesex partner of highway patrol employee killed in the line of duty).3. Health and Well-beingBy excluding same-sex couples from marriage, Michigan and Kentucky also deny them the legal means readily available to different-sex couples to19ensure their families' health and well-being. For example, same-sex couples face obstacles at times when critical healthcare decisions are needed ­ when one member of a couple unexpectedly falls ill or is injured in an accident and is unable to communicate. All states provide for an orderly determination of persons authorized to make medical decisions for such an individual in the event that they have not completed legal documentation designating someone to do so. The default order generally prefers a spouse over other family members. See Samuel H. Grier & Tad D. Ransopher, Tax Compliance & Estate Planning for Same-Sex Couples, 5 Est. Plan. & Community Prop. L.J. 323, 365-66 (2013); see also, e.g., Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 311.631 (absent judicially appointed guardian or attorney-in-fact, spouse has priority to make healthcare decisions on behalf of patient, followed by other relatives); infra app. Table 1 (twenty-five of twenty-seven states with challenged marriage bans grant spouse some form of medical decision-making power automatically). Because they are not legal spouses, same-sex partners may be excluded from medical decision-making for a partner.While lawyers can assist individuals in drafting powers-of-attorney and other legal designations to work around the default order, clients who are members of same-sex couples often have trouble exercising the rights granted to them by such instruments. Same-sex partners are sometimes prevented by hospital staff from even seeing their partners, despite having the legal designations granting them the right20to make healthcare decisions. For example, when Bill Flanigan's partner Robert Daniel fell ill and was admitted to a trauma center in Maryland ­ prior to Maryland's adoption of marriage equality in 2013 ­ Flanigan had power of attorney for healthcare decisions but was not permitted to consult with doctors or to see Daniel until biological family members arrived. See Complaint, Flanigan v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., No. 24-c-02-001289 (Md. Cir. Ct. Balt. Feb. 27, 2002). By then Daniel was on life support ­ against his wishes previously articulated to Flanigan ­ and unconscious; he died three days later.9Same-sex couples also face obstacles in obtaining the health insurance coverage that different-sex married couples often receive through an employer's healthcare plan. An employee's spouse and children may often be enrolled in the employer's plan and are thus given the peace of mind that comes with such coverage. Unmarried same-sex partners, on the other hand, often do not qualify as spouses for such coverage, preventing them from accessing benefits available to their different-sex married co-workers. Thus, same-sex couples are forced to turn to other, usually9 The case of Janice Langbehn and her partner, Lisa Pond, brought this issue to national attention in 2007. Pond collapsed while on a trip to Florida and was sent to the hospital, where Langbehn, despite having faxed a power-of-attorney to the hospital, was not permitted to be by Pond's side until after she had died. See Tara Parker-Pope, Kept from a Dying Partner's Bedside, N.Y. Times, May 19, 2009, at D5, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/ health/19well.html.21more costly, health insurance alternatives. See Tara Siegel Bernard & Ron Lieber, The High Price of Being a Gay Couple, N.Y. Times, Oct. 3, 2009, at A1, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/03/yourmoney/03 money.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0. Or they have to go without health insurance at all. Some private employers, recognizing the inequity, extend benefits to same-sex couples. While providing some relief, these extensions are not treated like the coverage available to different-sex spouses for federal tax purposes. This is because the federal tax code exempts employer contributions to a spouse's health plan. See 26 U.S.C. § 106(a) (2012); Treas. Reg. § 1.106-1. But for same-sex couples prohibited from marrying, the value of the insurance coverage is treated as federally taxable income. See Grier & Ransopher, Tax Compliance, supra, at 333. In states that follow this result, lawyers have no means of avoiding this unequal consequence. See James Angelini, The Federal and State Taxation of Domestic Partner Benefits, Tax Analysts (Nov. 8, 2011), http://www.taxanalysts.com/ www/features.nsf/Articles/03CEC7C26C62E94A85257 9420059DC81?OpenDocument.4. Economic ProtectionsProviding tax advice for same-sex couples is particularly complex, as the simple example of buying and selling a home illustrates. Among other issues arising in this context, same-sex couples may be unable to transfer property without application of real estate transfer taxes. For example, Michigan law22entirely exempts transfers of real estate between spouses. Mich. Comp. Laws § 207.526(i). A home or property can be jointly owned, and that arrangement can be ended, without a tax penalty. Similarly, transfers of title between spouses, and between former spouses as part of a divorce, are exempted from real estate transfer taxes in Kentucky. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 142.050(7)(e).Unmarried same-sex couples, however, are deprived of these tax exemptions. Jointly owned property or property held with survivorship rights, unlike property transferred under the marital deduction, will incur a standard estate tax upon the death of each partner. For example, Plaintiff Love and his partner face the prospect of inheritance taxes upon either of their deaths. Affidavit of Timothy Love and Lawrence Ysunza in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment para. 11, Love v. Beshear, No. 3:13-CV-750-JGH (W.D. Ky. Apr. 18, 2014). Without careful estate planning by a lawyer ­ often requiring collaboration with a tax attorney ­ an estate tax on jointly held property may render a surviving partner solely responsible for the tax, often resulting in financial difficulties and sometimes the forced sale of a home. See, e.g., Burda, supra, at 242 (describing difficulties caused by inability to take advantage of the federal unified estate and gift tax credit).The legal work-arounds available for this and other estate planning challenges ­ just to achieve the protections granted married different-sex couples by default ­ are complex. Some same-sex couples resort23to establishing tenancies-in-common or "Transfer on Death" deeds for their home. See, e.g., Affidavit of Timothy Love and Lawrence Ysunza in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment paras. 9-10, Love v. Beshear, No. 3:13-CV-750-JGH (W.D. Ky. Apr. 18, 2014). Other alternatives require same-sex couples to apply the law in ways it was never intended to function. For example, some same-sex couples have turned to adult adoption, in which one member of the couple adopts the other, in order to secure inheritance rights for the other. See Arthur S. Leonard, Lesbian and Gay Families and the Law: A Progress Report, 21 Fordham Urb. L.J. 927, 948-51 (1994). The awkwardness of this solution demonstrates the harmfulness of the current de jure discrimination against same-sex couples inflicted by the marriage bans. Moreover, these options often require the repeated (and costly) attention of attorneys, who must have a specialized understanding of how the law affects same-sex couples in ways that the couples themselves may not fully appreciate, which many same-sex couples cannot afford. Oftentimes same-sex couples do not understand the obscure negative tax consequences of the legal treatment of their relationship until too late, when lawyers can offer no assistance.Income taxes are similarly difficult for same-sex couples. Unmarried same-sex couples may not file joint state tax returns in Kentucky or Michigan and are therefore excluded from beneficial tax treatment granted to similarly situated married couples. These benefits often reduce tax burdens on married couples,24who share incomes and certain expenses relating to child care and a joint household. Filing jointly as a married couple in Kentucky, for example, allows a couple to use their joint income as the basis for calculating the "Family Size Tax Credit," which offers a 100% tax credit if their combined modified gross income is at or below federal poverty level for their family size. In 2014, for instance, an individual filer could receive the credit only if his or her income was under $11,670, regardless of whether he or she was supporting a partner. A married couple in the same situation would be eligible if their combined income was $15,730. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 141.066(4); Ky. Dep't of Revenue, 2014 Individual Income Tax Updates & Tips, Ky. Tax Alert, Jan. 2015, at 1, 1. This credit provides married couples with greater flexibility to juggle responsibilities, and is largely responsible for the low tax burden on the lowest-income households in Kentucky. Blue Ribbon Comm'n on Tax Reform, Report by the Blue Ribbon Commission on Tax Reform to Governor Steve Beshear app. L, at 76 (2012).In addition, under state and federal law, families are ineligible for certain benefits if the parents cannot marry or establish a legal relationship to one another's children. Michigan's Earned Income Tax Credit, for example, is calculated based on a family's eligibility under the federal Earned Income Tax Credit ("EITC"). Mich. Comp. Laws § 206.272 (amended pending conditions by 2014 Mich. Pub. Acts 469). The amount of the EITC increases for families25with lower incomes and a higher number of children. However, the calculation accounts only for a "qualifying child," a definition that does not encompass children of an unmarried partner who do not share a legal relationship with the filer. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 32, 152(c) (2012 & Supp. I 2013). The effect of these rules, together with the laws under review, is to reduce the eligibility of same-sex partners and their families for tax credits that are routinely relied upon by different-sex married couples and their children.5. PrivilegeThe laws under review also interfere with the "confidence which should subsist between those who are connected by the nearest and dearest relations of life." Stein v. Bowman, 38 U.S. 209, 223 (1839). In all states, including in Michigan and Kentucky, rules of evidence protect spousal communications from disclosure because courts and legislators have recognized the "wise public policy . . . . to preserve with sacredness the confidences of the marriage state." Carter v. Hill, 45 N.W. 988, 989 (Mich. 1890). See, e.g., Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.2162(4) ("[A] married person or a person who has been married previously shall not be examined in a civil action or administrative proceeding as to any communication made between that person and his or her spouse or former spouse during the marriage."); Ky. R. Evid. 504(b) ("An individual has a privilege to refuse to testify and to prevent another from testifying to any confidential communication made by the individual to his or her spouse26during their marriage."). In addition, many states prevent spouses from being forced to testify against the other. For example, under Kentucky's Rules of Evidence, a spouse "has a privilege to refuse to testify against [his or her spouse] as to events occurring after the date of their marriage." Id. R. 504(a); cf. Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.2162(7) ("[A] married person . . . shall not be examined in a criminal prosecution as to any communication made between that person and his or her spouse . . . without the consent of the person to be examined."). This privilege "furthers the important public interest in marital harmony." Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 53 (1980).Same-sex couples in Michigan and Kentucky are not entitled to invoke these privileges. As a result, individuals in same-sex relationships may be compelled to testify against their partners in cases implicating profound liberty interests. Cf. Commonwealth v. Clary, No. 11-CR-3329 (Ky. Cir. Ct. Sept. 23, 2013), available at http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wdrb/news/ bobbijo.pdf (ordering same-sex partner of defendant charged with murder to testify against her partner because the couple, although having entered into a civil union in Vermont in 2004, was not married and therefore not entitled to spousal privilege). No amount of legal counseling can create a substitute for this protection.1010 Relatedly, same-sex couples often come to a lawyer seeking advice together, but this can present ethical concerns(Continued on following page)27Notably, if permitted to stand, the current state-by-state patchwork of laws related to marriage, with some states allowing same-sex couples to marry and other states prohibiting them from doing so, also means the judiciary will likely face vexing choice-oflaw applications in cases involving couples from a state that recognizes marriages of same-sex couples and activities in a state where the marriage is not recognized but the privilege is. See Katherine T. Schaffzin, Beyond Bobby Jo Clary: The Unavailability of Same-Sex Marital Privileges Infringes the Rights of So Many More Than Criminal Defendants, 63 U. Kan. L. Rev. 103, 127-28 (2014) (discussing complexities inherent in competing legal regimes where marriages of same-sex couples are recognized only in certain states).related to potential conflicts. See Burda, supra, at 6-7 (noting that, among other challenges, an attorney may not be able to keep one partner's confidences when adverse to the other's interest). Because the laws of Kentucky and Michigan treat same-sex couples as "legal strangers," lawyers must "take extra steps to ensure that clients understand they are entitled to separate counsel, the advantages of individual counsel, and the disadvantages of both using the same lawyer." Id.; see also Model Rules of Prof 'l Conduct R. 1.7(b)(4) (2013) (allowing joint representation with informed consent); Mich. Rules of Prof 'l Conduct R. 1.7(a) (same); Ky. Sup. Ct. R. 1.7(b) (same). If the lawyer concludes that joint representation is not ethically permissible or otherwise advisable, same-sex couples must bear the additional cost of engaging a second lawyer.286. Ethical ObligationsThe laws under review also have the unintended effect of withdrawing certain obligations from samesex couples that are crucial to government integrity, as the Court recognized in Windsor. See 133 S. Ct. at 2695. State legislators in Kentucky, for example, must file a statement disclosing certain financial information for themselves and their spouses. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 6.787; see also id. § 11A.050 (requiring similar for certain executive officers, candidates, public servants, and their spouses). In addition, a legislator or his or her spouse can be criminally liable for soliciting or accepting "anything of value" from a lobbyist. Id. § 6.751; see also id. § 11A.045 ("No public servant, his spouse, or dependent child knowingly shall accept any gifts or gratuities, including travel expenses, meals, alcoholic beverages, and honoraria, totaling a value greater than twenty-five dollars ($25) in a single calendar year from any person or business . . . .").Similarly, Michigan's Regulatory Boards and Commissions Ethics Act requires members of state regulatory boards to disclose any association or interest ­ including their own and those of a spouse ­ in matters that appear before their board and refrain from voting on the matter. Mich. Comp. Laws § 15.483(1)(a) ("Disclosure is also required if a spouse, child, or stepchild of a board member is a director, officer, direct or indirect shareholder, or employee of an entity under consideration . . . before the board.").29Such strictures do not apply to same-sex couples under Kentucky or Michigan law. See Ky. Const. § 233A; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 402.005, .020(1)(d), .040(2), .045; cf. Mich. Const. art. I, § 25; Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 551.1-.4. In addition to undermining the dignity of same-sex couples, this undermines the good-governance purposes of these laws.11B. Legal Substitutes Cannot Cure the Discriminatory Effects of the Marriage Bans.As the discussion above illustrates, attorneys can sometimes help same-sex couples create through legal means an approximation of the particular rights and benefits that flow automatically from marriage. But even when these work-arounds are not complex or costly, and even where they can usually obtain the desired result, they are necessary only because marriage bans create obstacles that different-sex couples, through marriage, do not have to navigate. And, regardless of their effectiveness, these partial solutions cannot cure the discriminatory effects of the marriage bans on same-sex couples and their families11 Federal ethics statutes, enforceable against same-sex married couples in light of Windsor, have no effect on same-sex couples who cannot marry. See U.S. Office of Gov't Ethics, LA13-10, Effect of the Supreme Court's Decision in United States v. Windsor on the Executive Branch Ethics Program 2 (2013) (the terms "marriage," "spouse," and "relative" will not incorporate "a federal employee in a civil union, domestic partnership, or other legally recognized relationship other than a marriage").30that result from society's denial of its formal recognition of a couple's commitment.Civil marriage is more than a gateway to a vast array of benefits and obligations. As this Court stated in Windsor, civil marriage fundamentally alters an individual's relationship to society. 133 S. Ct. at 269293. The interests asserted by the states as supporting marriage bans, i.e., in promoting responsible procreation and in democratic decision-making, DeBoer, 772 F.3d at 404-08, are insufficient to justify excluding same-sex couples from civil marriage and the societal recognition of their relationship that it brings. This exclusion results in the creation of two classes of citizens: those who can avail themselves of the right to marry and receive its attendant rights and responsibilities, and those who are deemed unfit because of their sexual orientation and therefore are denied the equal protection of the law.As ABA attorneys have experienced, and as the Court observed in Windsor, this unequal treatment of same-sex couples "demeans the couple, . . . . [a]nd it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples." 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2694 (2013). Cf. Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 494 (1954) (noting separation of students by race "generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community").Former ABA President and soon-to-be Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., stated at his confirmation hearings nearly forty-five years ago that the31Equal Protection Clause is one of the great "freedom clauses" of the Constitution, and this Court, "as the final authority, has the greatest responsibility to uphold the rule of law and to protect and safeguard the liberties guaranteed all of our people by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment." Nominations of William H. Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell, Jr.: Hearings Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 92d Cong. 219, 223 (1971) (statement of Lewis F. Powell, Jr.). The cases presented here call upon this Court once again to exercise this important and historic responsibility.---------------------------------  ---------------------------------CONCLUSIONAmicus curiae American Bar Association respectfully urges that the judgments of the Sixth Circuit be reversed.Of Counsel: DAVID A. O'NEIL STEVEN S. MICHAELS DAVID SARRATT HARRIET M. ANTCZAK RYAN M. KUSMIN BENJAMIN D. MARGOWILLIAM C. HUBBARD 
I. Categorical Disqualification of Isolated DNA Compounds, Human or Otherwise, from Patent-Eligibility Would Be a Material Change in this Court's Approach to Determining Patent Eligibility and Would Undercut Reasonable Investment-Backed Expectations and Needs.Isolated DNA Compounds, corresponding to genes from humans or any other organisms that do not occur in nature in their isolated form, should remain patent-eligible subject matter. A per se or categorical disqualification of such claims would be a material change in this Court's traditional approach to determining patent-eligibility and would unjustifiably undercut significant investment-backed expectations and needs of the biotechnology industry, which has reasonably relied on longstanding precedents of this Court and others. The ABA therefore endorses the Court's continued application of its traditional incremental, common-law approach to determining the patent-eligibility of claimed subject matter.Section 101 makes eligible for patent "any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof." 35 U.S.C. § 101. This Court has repeatedly recognized the "extremely broad" scope of eligible subject matter under § 101. J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int'l, Inc., 534 U.S. 124, 130 (2001) (citing Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 308 (1980)). "In choosing such expansive terms * * * modified by the comprehensive `any,' Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws6would be given wide scope." Bilski v. Kappos, 130 S. Ct. 3218, 3225 (2010) (quoting Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 308). Because "[t]he subject-matter provisions of the patent law have been cast in broad terms," Congress need not "expressly authorize protection for new patentable subject matter," J.E.M. Ag Supply, 534 U.S. at 130-131 (citing Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 315), and the Court has recognized only "three specific exceptions" to the otherwise expansive language of § 101: "laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas." Bilski, 130 S. Ct. at 3225 (quoting Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 309).This Court has uniformly applied these principles incrementally to determine the patent eligibility of compositions and other subject matter; it has scrupulously avoided adopting "categorical rule[s] denying patent protection" in new, unforeseen, areas that "would frustrate the purposes of the patent law." Bilski, 130 S. Ct. at 3227 (quoting Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 315). For example, upon the advent of genetic engineering, the Court rejected efforts to categorically exclude living things from patent-eligibility and instead determined that claims directed to a genetically engineered bacterium were patent-eligible as directed to a "nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter." Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 309; see also J.E.M. Ag Supply, 534 U.S. at 133 (declining to exclude plants from patent-eligibility). More recently, in Bilski, the Court declined to adopt a categorical exclusion of "business methods" from § 101 "that might have wide-ranging and unforeseen impacts" on yet-to-be developed technology. Bilksi, 130 S. Ct. at 3227-3230. Instead, the Court resolved the case "narrowly" in view of its precedent prohibiting the patenting of abstract ideas. Id. at 3229. Likewise, the standards used to determine the7patent-eligibility of the Isolated DNA Compounds at issue here should be the same as those used to determine the patent-eligibility of other compositions derived from or related to natural materials. See Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 309-310. There is no basis in the language of § 101, or in the case law construing that provision, for treating Isolated DNA Compounds differently. Indeed, a departure from this Court's previously uniform approach to determining patenteligibility would frustrate practitioners' ability to reliably advise clients on the patent-eligibility of new technologies. The ABA thus endorses this Court's continued reluctance to categorically exclude subject matter from patent-eligibility in favor of the determination of patent-eligibility under § 101 in an incremental manner.The Court's traditional incremental approach to addressing patent-eligibility has the further benefit of retaining for Congress its role in determining the boundaries of patent law as new, unforeseen technologies emerge. "Congress employed broad general language in drafting § 101 precisely because such inventions are often unforeseeable." Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 316. Against that backdrop, this Court has recognized that the categorical exclusion of unforeseen, but otherwise patent-eligible, subject matter from § 101, is "a matter of high policy" best left to "the political branches of the Government." Id. at 317, see also Bilski, 130 S. Ct. at 3228, J.E.M. Ag Supply, 534 U.S. at 145-146; Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1305.To date, those branches of the government have not excluded Isolated DNA Compounds from patenteligibility. Indeed, a categorical rule excluding Isolated DNA Compounds from patent-eligibility8would reverse well over a decade of policy of the Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") expressly allowing such claims. The PTO first issued claims relating to human genes in the early 1980s. Eric J. Rogers, Can You Patent Genes? Yes and No, 93 J. Pat. & Trademark Off. Soc'y 19 (2011). In 2001, relying in part on this Court's longstanding precedent, the PTO issued guidance reaffirming that claims directed to such compounds are eligible for patenting. See Utility Examination Guidelines, 66 Fed. Reg. 1092, 1093 (Jan. 5, 2001) (stating that isolated genes are eligible subject matter as compositions of matter not found in nature).In the 30 years since the PTO began issuing claims directed to human genes, Congress has not expressed any disagreement with the PTO's policy of allowing claims to Isolated DNA Compounds. Congress is aware of these subject matter eligibility issues: While it has failed to pass legislation that would have excluded human genes or gene sequences from patent-eligibility, it recently enacted provisions excluding claims directed to or encompassing a "human organism" and directing the PTO to study ways to provide genetic testing where patents on genes and genetic testing exist. Compare Life Patenting Moratorium Act of 1993, S. 387, 103d Cong. § 3 (1993), with Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. No. 112-29, §§ 27, 33, 125 Stat. 284, 338-340 (2011). Consequently, the Court should "decline to narrow the reach of § 101 where Congress has given no indication that it intends this result." J.E.M. Ag Supply, 534 U.S. at 144-146 (declining to exclude plants from patent eligibility where, among other things the PTO had issued utility patents for plants for 16 years without action from Congress); cf. Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P'ship, 131 S. Ct. 2238,92252 (2011) (where Congress has "allowed the Federal Circuit's * * * interpretation of § 282 [of the Patent Act] to stand," "[a]ny re-calibration of the standard of proof remains in its hands").Moreover, the biotechnology industry has substantially relied on this Court's precedent--and more directly the PTO's policy--to seek and obtain patent claims to Isolated DNA Compounds. As of 2006, there were approximately 33,000 issued patents claiming nucleic acids. National Research Council, Reaping the Benefits of Genomic and Proteomic Research: Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health 101 (Stephen A. Merrill & Ann-Marie Mazza eds., National Academies Press, 2006). There are many more such patents today. Those patents help protect the significant investment needed to develop and obtain regulatory approval for new products in the biotechnology industry. See, e.g., Federal Trade Commission Report, Emerging Health Care Issues: Follow-on Biologic Drug Competition, 30, 47 (June 2009) (concluding that "[p]atent protection fuels the biotechnology industry's R&D engine" and is "necessary to attract the capital to fund high-risk investment"); Joseph A. DiMasi & Henry G. Grabowski, The Cost of Biopharmaceutical R&D: Is Biotech Different?, 28 Managerial and Decision Econ. 469, 475 (2007) (estimating that the development costs for new biologic-based therapeutics to be in excess of one billion dollars for each approved molecule). Dramatic shifts in the scope of patentable subject matter would unfairly undercut these investments and upset the reasonable expectations and needs of inventors who have acted against the backdrop of long-standing precedent interpreting § 101 broadly and incrementally. See Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U.S. 722,10739 (2002) ("[C]ourts must be cautious before adopting changes that disrupt the settled expectations of the investing community").For these reasons, the ABA endorses this Court's traditional practice of incrementally developing its jurisprudence for determining patent-eligible subject matter on a claim-by-claim basis. That consistent approach allows practitioners to reliably advise clients on the patent-eligibility of new technologies in the context of a stable regulatory framework and avoids dramatic shifts in the definition of patenteligible subject matter, such as a per se disqualification of Isolated DNA Compounds, which would upset reasonable investment-backed expectations and undercut innovation in the important field of biotechnology.II. Under the Applicable Precedent, Isolated DNA Compounds Are Patent-Eligible Subject Matter Because They Are Not Products of Nature.This Court granted the Association for Molecular Pathology's earlier petition and remanded for further consideration in light of the intervening decision in Mayo. See Ass'n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 132 S. Ct. 1794 (2012). On remand, the Federal Circuit correctly determined that Chakrabarty, not Mayo, controls the question of patent-eligibility for the composition claims at issue here. Ass'n for Molecular Pathology v. U.S. Patent & Trademark Off., 689 F.3d 1303, 1325-1327 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("Myriad II " ). Under Chakrabarty, Isolated DNA Compounds are patent-eligible subject matter because they are not products of nature.11A. Chakrabarty, Not Mayo, Controls the Patent-Eligibility of Isolated DNA Compounds.This Court's decision in Mayo requires no change to its earlier precedents governing the analysis of the patent-eligibility of compositions. The claims at issue in Mayo were process claims reciting a law of nature, namely the relationship between the concentration of a drug metabolite in the blood and the efficacy of the drug. Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1296. Consequently, the sole question there was whether the challenged claims "add[ed] enough" to their statement of this natural relationship "to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws." Id. at 1297 (emphasis in original).In contrast, the composition of matter claims at issue here do not recite a law of nature, nor do they claim the application of one. Indeed, they are drawn to a different class of statutory subject matter, "composition of matter," than were the process claims in Mayo. 35 U.S.C. § 101. The relevant question for the patent-eligibility of these composition claims is whether the claimed Isolated DNA Compounds are "nature's handiwork" or rather a patent-eligible, human-made invention. See Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 309-310; id. at 313 (noting from the legislative history of § 101 that "the relevant distinction was * * * between products of nature * * * and humanmade inventions"). Mayo did not address this question, much less purport to change how such claims are analyzed for eligibility under § 101.Nor does the analysis in Mayo inform the determination whether the claimed DNA compounds exist in nature or are human-made inventions.12Adding merely "conventional or obvious [pre]-solution activity" is ordinarily not "sufficient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law." Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1298 (quoting Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 590 (1978) (alterations in Mayo)). But that inquiry is irrelevant to whether a composition is a product of nature. There is no reason to treat the patent-eligibility of Isolated DNA Compounds differently from any other chemical compound derived from a natural material or source.B. Isolated DNA Compounds Are PatentEligible Because They Are Not Products of Nature.As the Federal Circuit recognized, the claimed Isolated DNA Compounds at issue in this case are human-made, "free-standing" molecules that are markedly different in character from anything found in nature. See Myriad II, 689 F.3d at 1328. Under this Court's applicable precedent, Isolated DNA Compounds--from humans or any other organisms-- are therefore patent-eligible subject matter. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 309-310.To be sure, some of the compositions claimed by Myriad correspond to portions of larger compounds that are found in nature--human chromosomes--but the claimed compositions meaningfully differ from those naturally occurring compounds. Most significantly, the Isolated DNA Compounds claimed by Myriad are distinct chemical structures that correspond to only a small fraction of a chromosome44 A chromosome might include lengths of over a hundred million base pairs of DNA, while the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes at issue here are only approximately 80,000 base pairs long.13and are created by human intervention, either by synthesis de novo or by cleavage from a chromosome. See Myriad II, 689 F.3d at 1328; Utility Examination Guidelines, 66 Fed. Reg. at 1093 ("The [human] body does not contain the patented, isolated and purified gene because genes in the body are not in the patented, isolated and purified form."). Although petitioners liken this to "isolating" a kidney from a human body or "isolating" leaves from trees, Pet'r Br. at 2, an intact organ or a leaf is not a distinct composition of matter or article of manufacture in the way molecules synthesized or cleaved from a chromosome are. The molecules, which are distinct chemical compositions that have been identified, located, and extracted (or synthesized) through human ingenuity, meaningfully differ from what occurs in nature in a way that an "isolated" intact organ or leaf simply does not.More specifically, as distinct chemical structures, Isolated DNA Compounds have utility beyond that of their related, naturally occurring molecules. Petitioners' brief describes the unique usefulness of Myriad's claimed Isolated DNA Compounds for, among other things, genetic testing, therapeutics, biomedical devices and sequencing technologies. See, e.g., Pet'r Br. at 44-45. This Court has relied on such acquired utility to distinguish between claims drawn merely to some patent-ineligible "handiwork of nature" and claims drawn to a patent-eligible manufacture or composition. Compare Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127, 131-132 (1948), with Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 309-310.Myriad II, 689 F.3d at 1328.14Other of Myriad's claimed compositions do not even correspond to any naturally occurring DNA molecule. cDNA molecules lack certain non-coding sequences, termed introns, that are found in the naturally occurring chromosome, and thus, relative to a chromosome, cDNA molecules have been further edited and recombined to create a molecule that does not exist in nature. See Myriad II, 689 F.3d at 1329. Accordingly, claims to such Isolated DNA Compounds do not implicate any naturally occurring DNA molecule found in any living organism, human or otherwise.Claims to Isolated DNA Compounds are thus "not to a hitherto unknown natural phenomenon, but to a nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter--a product of human ingenuity `having a distinctive name, character and use.' " Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 309-310 (quoting Hartranft v. Wiegmann, 121 U.S. 609, 615 (1887)). And under this Court's longstanding precedent, such subject matter is patent-eligible under § 101. Id.C. Claims to Isolated DNA Compounds Neither Claim Nor "Tie Up" Laws of Nature.Even if the biological information communicated by the sequence of nucleotides in an Isolated DNA Compound could be considered a "law of nature," that Isolated DNA Compound is nonetheless eligible for patent protection. "While a scientific truth * * * is not [a] patentable invention, a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be." Mackay Radio & Tel. Co. v. Radio Corp. of Am., 306 U.S. 86, 94 (1939). Unlike the process claimed in Mayo, which "amount[ed] to nothing15significantly more than an instruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws [of nature] when treating their patients," a claim to an Isolated DNA Compound does not monopolize or otherwise prohibit the use of the underlying biological sequence information. Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1297-1298. Instead, such composition claims prevent the use of only their physical embodiments, i.e., the non-naturally occurring, tangible compositions within the scope of the claims. 35 U.S.C. § 271 (precluding, among other things, making or using the "patented invention"); see also Microsoft Corp. v. AT & T Corp., 550 U.S. 437, 449 (2007) (distinguishing between abstract ideas and physical embodiments). The intangible sequence information is therefore not "tied up" by the composition claim. See Mahn v. Harwood, 112 U.S. 354, 361 (1884) ("The public has the undoubted right to use, and it is to be presumed does use, what is not specifically claimed in the patent."). Indeed, Myriad's claims to "comparing" or "analyzing" the underlying sequence information were held patent-ineligible by the Federal Circuit. Myriad II, 689 F.3d at 13341335.Thus, scientists are free to use the sequence information in Myriad's Isolated DNA Compounds, as well as the knowledge of a correlation between mutations in that sequence with the risk of developing breast cancer, to make further discoveries without making or using the claimed Isolated DNA Compounds. Indeed, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 cDNA sequences have been included in public biological sequence databases for nearly two decades. See GenBank Accession No. U14680 (BRCA1), available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/555931 and GenBank Accession No. U43746 (BRCA2), available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/U43746; see16also U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,282, col. 53, ll. 7-9. Those databases are used hundreds of thousands of times a day by scientists around the world to analyze and compare biological sequence information. See, e.g., Dennis A. Benson et al., GenBank, 41 Nucleic Acids Research D36 (2013); Database Resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, 41 Nucleic Acids Research D8 (2013); James Ostell, Databases of Discovery, 3 ACM Queue 40 (2005). Such computer-based analysis of biological sequence information has revolutionized life sciences research, underpinning a broad range of inquiry, from the study of the evolutionary relationships among organisms to the identification of the function of new genetic sequences. See, e.g., Minoru Kanehisa & Peer Bork, Bioinformatics in the Post-Sequence Era, 33 Nature Genetics 305 (2003); Kenneth H. Wolfe & Wen-Hsiung Li, Molecular Evolution Meets the Genomics Revolution, 33 Nature Genetics 255 (2003). And with respect to the diagnostic screening of the BRCA genes at issue here, once a BRCA sequence has been determined, that sequence information may be freely analyzed for mutations correlating with a risk for developing cancer. Myriad II, 689 F.3d at 1334-1335. Composition claims to Isolated DNA Compounds therefore do not "tie up" the use of biological sequence information in a way that would "inhibit future innovation premised upon" the biological sequence information in the patent. Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 13011302.That Myriad's composition claims might, given the current state of the art,5 effectively grant it exclusive5 Conventional sequencing approaches for a single gene typically involve making or using "isolated" versions of the gene, implicating patent claims to the corresponding Isolated DNA17rights to the determination of the particular sequence of an individual's BRCA genes--even when that information might have medical significance--reflects the normal operation of patent law, granting the inventor of a human-made molecule certain temporary rights in an effort to encourage the useful arts. Patents are routinely awarded for life-saving technologies such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Whether the practical implications of patent protection warrant making an exception to ordinary rules in an emerging area of technology presents a quintessential question of policy that this Court has traditionally left for Congress. And with respect to subject matter eligibility in particular, this Court has consistently refrained from categorically excluding subject matter from § 101 on the basis of such policy considerations. See supra at 6-7. Cf. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 72-73 (1972) (declining to alter the bounds of § 101 where "[t]he technological problems tendered in the many briefs before us indicate to us that considered action by the Congress is needed."); Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1304-1305.Compound. In the past several years, however, new sequencing approaches have been developed that avoid using Isolated DNA Compounds. Employing those approaches, one might be able to sequence a BRCA gene and analyze it without running afoul of any of Myriad's patent claims. See Christopher M. Holman, Debunking the Myth that Whole-Genome Sequencing Infringes Thousands of Gene Patents, 30 Nature Biotechnology 240, 241 (2012); W. Nicholson Price II, Unblocked Future: Why Gene Patents Won't Hinder Whole-Genome Sequencing and Personalized Medicine, 33 Cardozo L. Rev. 1601, 1606 (2012).18III. Subject Matter Eligibility under 35 U.S.C. § 101 Is Separate and Distinct from the Other Requirements for Patentability.Finally, the analysis of whether claimed subject matter is eligible for patent protection should not import any of the additional, separate requirements for the issuance of a patent. In Mayo, the Court remarked, in dicta, that the patent-eligibility inquiry of § 101 "might sometimes overlap" with the novelty inquiry of § 102. 132 S. Ct. at 1304. That commentary sparked concern among practitioners that the Court was departing from its longstanding precedent that the other requirements for patentability, e.g., novelty and obviousness, are not relevant to patent-eligibility analysis. See, e.g., Jeffrey Fox, Industry Reels as Prometheus Falls and Myriad Faces Further Reviews, 30 Nature Biotechnology 373 (2012); Tamsen Valoir, Mayo v. Prometheus: Natural Law or Mental Step, 24 Intell. Prop. & Tech. L. J. 3, 5 (2012).As noted above, Mayo dealt with whether the method claims there constituted a patent-eligible application of a law of nature. The Court consequently examined whether the claimed method added anything more than insignificant, "conventional or obvious" pre-solution activity "sufficient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law." Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1298. Mayo did not, therefore, import novelty into its patent-eligibility analysis generally.Indeed, this Court has previously explained that patent-eligibility under § 101 is separate and distinct from the successive requirements for patentability in19the Patent Statute. Section 101 "is only a threshold test" and patent-eligible subject matter "must also satisfy `the conditions and requirements of this title' * * * includ[ing] that the invention be novel, see § 102, nonobvious, see § 103, and fully and particularly described, see § 112." Bilski, 130 S. Ct. at 3225 (quoting 35 U.S.C. § 101); see also Flook, 437 U.S. at 593 ("The obligation to determine what type of discovery is sought to be patented must precede the determination of whether that discovery is, in fact, new or obvious."). Further, notwithstanding the words "new and useful" in § 101, novelty is not "an appropriate consideration under § 101" and "is of no relevance in determining whether the subject matter of a claim falls within the § 101 categories of possibly patentable subject matter." Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 188-189 (1981) (emphasis added); id. at 190 ("The question therefore of whether a particular invention is novel is wholly apart from whether the invention falls into a category of statutory subject matter.") (internal quotation marks omitted); Flook, 437 U.S. at 588 (explaining that subject matter eligibility under § 101 "does not involve the familiar issues of novelty and obviousness"); see also Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 483 (1974) ("no patent is available for a discovery, however useful, novel, and nonobvious, unless it falls within one of the express categories of patentable subject matter of 35 U.S.C. § 101" ).That subject matter eligibility is separate and distinct from novelty and non-obviousness follows from the fact that the requirements are set out as separate and distinct statutory provisions. This "statutory scheme" establishes, in the words of Judge Giles S. Rich, one of the drafters of the Patent Act of 1952, "three doors" that must be opened by inventors.20Section 101 is the "first door" and inquires "[w]hat kind of invention or discovery" the inventor seeks to patent. In re Bergy, 596 F.2d 952, 960 (C.C.P.A. 1979) (Rich, J.), aff'd, sub nom. Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980). Only if the invention "falls into any one of the named categories" in § 101, is the inventor "allowed to pass through to the second door," novelty, and then onto the "third door," nonobviousness. Id. at 960-961.The ABA thus endorses the principle that the inquiry into subject matter eligibility under § 101 is a separate and distinct requirement from, and should be resolved independently of, the additional conditions and requirements for obtaining a patent set out in §§ 102, 103 and 112. Consequently, with respect to Myriad's claims here, petitioners' assertion that the techniques Myriad used to create its claimed Isolated DNA Compounds were well-known, routine or conventional at the time of invention, Pet'r Br. at 37, is irrelevant to whether that subject matter is patent-eligible. Likewise irrelevant are petitioners' assertions that the scope of Myriad's claims encompass subject matter beyond what Myriad invented and described in its application, Pet'r Br. at 11-17, 37. Those concerns may implicate other statutory conditions and requirements for the issuance of a patent, specifically, that the invention be novel (§ 102); nonobvious (§ 103); and fully described and enabled (§ 112). But the only question here is whether Myriad's claimed compositions are "products of nature" or "humanmade inventions." J.E.M. Ag Supply, 534 U.S. at 134 (quoting Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. at 313).21CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set out above, the ABA respectfully requests that this Court hold that Isolated DNA Compounds, including those corresponding to genes from humans or other organisms, are patent-eligible subject matter. The judgment should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted.Of Counsel: JOHN P. ELWOOD STEPHEN C. STOUTLAUREL G. BELLOWS Counsel of RecordPRESIDENT AMERICAN BARASSOCIATION 321 N.

I.TO SURVIVE A MOTION TO DISMISS, ASECTION 1 SHERMAN ACT COMPLAINTMUST ALLEGE FACTS THAT PROVIDE AREASONABLE BASIS TO SHOW THAT THEREIS AN AGREEMENTA.Allegations of Parallel Conduct Alone DoNot Adequately Plead the Element ofConspiracyRule 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint and requires that it state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In all cases this requires a complaint to allege conduct in violation of law.6 No different rule applies to antitrust claims. Thus, Section 1 of the Sherman Act requires pleading facts sufficient to allege "conspiracy" in a manner that shows the complainant is entitled to relief. Conclusory invocation of the word "conspiracy" is not sufficient.' Nor, the ABA submits,6 A complaint, at a minimum, must contain enough information from which each element of a claim for relief can be identified. See 5 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1228, at 321] Gd ed. 2004); id. at § 1216; Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. Only in this manner does notice pleading meet the constitutional dictates of due process by providing adequate notice to enable a meaningful opportunity to be heard. See Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950). 7 See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, Pet. App. at 16a. Moreover, this Court noted, in upholding dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), that "[i]t is not ... proper to assume that the [plaintiff] can prove facts it has not alleged or that the defendants have violated the antitrust laws in ways that have5contrary to the articulated standard of the Second Circuit, . does adding allegations of parallel conduct state grounds forshowing that the complainant is entitled to relief.This Court's precedent recognizing the difficulty ofdistinguishing legal, unilateral conduct from illegal, collusiveaction informs the analysis of the factual predicate that mustbe alleged to state a claim. The distinction betweenunilateral conduct and conspiracy is of paramountsignificance to defining a claim under Section 1 of theSherman Act because this law does not proscribe conductthat is "wholly unilateral."Copperweld Corp. v.Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768 (1984) (quotingAlbrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 149 (1968)).Similarly, the Court has cautioned that the effects fromunilateral and collective conduct may be indistinguishable.See 467 U.S. at 775 ("because the Sherman Act .prohibit[s] . . . only restraints effected by a contract,combination or conspiracy -- it leaves untouched a singlefirm's anticompetitive conduct (short of threatenedmonopolization) that may be indistinguishable in economiceffect from the conduct of two firms subject to § 1 liability.")(emphasis added); Fisher v. City of Berkeley, 475 U.S. 260,266 (1986) ("[e]ven where a single firm's restraints directlyaffect prices and have the same economic effect as concertedaction might have, there can be no liability under § 1 in theabsence of an agreement.") (emphasis added).Thus, this Court long has held that proof of "parallel business behavior" does not establish the element of conspiracy for purposes of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See Thea-not been alleged." Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526 (1983). 8 As previously noted, the American Bar Association takes no view on the facts of the instant case.6 tre Enters., Inc. v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 541 (1954) ([T]his Court has never held that proof of parallel business behavior conclusively establishes agreement"), Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993) ("conscious parallelism, ... [is] not in itself unlawful."). See also ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments p. 10 (5TM ed. 2002) ("Based on these Supreme Court decisions, lower courts have consistently held that conscious parallelism, by itself, will not support a finding of concerted action.").The insufficiency of parallel conduct as a basis for an antitrust claim, even when such conduct is consciously interdependent, is premised on sound economic theory and business reality.? As the Court observed in Brooke Group Ltd., "conscious parallelism, ... [is] not in itself unlawful, [even though, the] firms in a concentrated market might in effect share monopoly power, setting their prices at a profitmaximizing, supra-competitive level by recognizing their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions." 509 U.S. at 227; c.f, Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 593 (1986); (the inference of conspiracy must be reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action or collusive action); Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 768 (1984) (to prove conspiracy requires facts that "tend[s] to exclude the possibility of independent action by the parties."'); Robert A. Milne and Jack E.

Blair and Jill Boylston Herndon, Inferring Collusion from Economic Evidence, Antitrust, Summer 2001 at 17 (`In the antitrust literature, tacit collusion is sometimes referred to as conscious parallelism. Since the case law indicates that proof of an actual agreement is a necessary predicate for a Section 1 violation and since there is no agreement, as that term is defined, there can be no successful antitrust prosecution of tacit collusion."); Jonathan B. Baker, Identifying Horizontal Price Fixing in the Electronic Marketplace, 65 Antitrust L.J. 41, 47-48 (1996) (noting that judicial practice has based findings of agreement "on the totality of circumstantial evidence that the parties have done more than merely watch each other's market behavior and respond to it independently, as leaders and - followers. . . . [A]greement does not describe a result or equilibrium, but one particular process of reaching supracompetitive marketplace outcomes -- what may be termed the `forbidden process' of negotiation and exchange of assurances. The forbidden process consists of behavior that can be enjoined. Thus, if oligopoly reaches a high price equilibrium through the forbidden process that the law calls an agreement, Sherman Act Section 1 has been violated. If the same result were reached through leader-follower behavior, no agreement on price will be found.")Parallel business behavior often is a sign of an efficient market and is extremely common. "Mere parallelism . . . is widely present, especially in perfectly competitive markets and is not itself a compelling subject for legal control." 6 Areeda & Hovenkamp § 1417(g), at 115. Parallel business behavior does not suggest collusion. Rather, "it is important to recognize that similar simultaneous actions merely reflect . independent responses to common business problems." Id. § 1425, at 172; see also Gregory J. Werden, Economic Evidence on the Existence of Collusion: Reconciling Antitrust Law With Oligopoly Theory, 71 Antitrust L.J. 719, 779 (2004) (`Something more than interdependence must be8shown before agreement can be inferred. Interdependence is normal and innocent in oligopoly. Rational oligopolists typically monitor rivals closely and react to theit price changes or other strategic moves. There is nothing even remotely suspicious about such actions."); Donald F. Turner, The Definition of Agreement Under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 655, 658 (1962) ("The point is that conscious parallelism is never meaningful by itself, but always assumes whatever significance it might have from additional facts.").B.Rule 12(b)(6) Provides a Valuable FilterFrom Which Antitrust Cases Merit NoExemptionThe ABA supports fully applying Rule 12(b)(6) to permit actions that present meritorious claims to proceed while speedily dismissing those that do not. The Rule strikes a balance between competing policy concerns. On the one hand, to survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs are not required to provide a detailed factual underpinning for their claims. This has particular salience when the best evidence of the validity of the claim likely lies in the hands of the defendants, as is often the case with antitrust conspiracy allegations. On the other hand, the allegations must identify a violation of law -- something that is illegal, which parallel conduct is not.Proper application of Rule 12(b)(6) in the antitrust context thus requires no more than in other cases. As an allegation of breach of contract must provide a factual predicate to identify the contract and breach,!° an allegation of antitrust10 See generally forms outlining the factual predicates to allege claimsfor damages for breach of contract set forth in Williston, A Treatise onthe Law of Contracts (4" ed. 2004) §§ 64F-71F. Absent references to awritten, executed agreement, the factual predicates outlined provide clearnotice of the alleged offer, acceptance and terms of the agreement. Forexample, "on or about, at the request of defendant, plaintiff9conspiracy must provide a factual predicate that provides a reasonable basis to believe there is an agreement. Cf 5 Federal Practice and Procedure, § 1228, at 317-18 ("Thus, it should now be settled that there is no heightened pleading standard in antitrust cases. On the other hand, the complexity of most antitrust cases inevitably leads to lengthier and more detailed pleadings"); 2 James Wm, Moore, et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 8.04[1][a], at 8-24.1 (3d ed. 2006) ("Whether a statement of claim is sufficient to give fair notice depends in part on the complexity of the case."). Rejecting the Second Circuit's permissive standard would not unduly deter meritorious cases. Substantive antitrust law makes clear that a conspiracy can be proven by direct or indirect evidence, and allegations based on either could provide the reasonable basis that the ABA believes should underlie a complaint.The courts, lawyers, and scholars have observed various aspects of antitrust litigation that reinforce the propriety of applying the principles of Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss antitrust claims that do not provide a reasonable basis to believe there is an agreement. Plaintiffs who bring claims for antitrust violations generally require substantial resources from courts and opposing parties, including obtaining broad discovery and presenting often complex issues for pretrial management.!! This discovery process is often unavoidable becauseagreed to[set forth acts or duties whose performance waspromised by plaintiff\." Id. at § 64F:1611 Antitrust claims that pass the filter of Rule 12(b)(6) typically proceed to scheduling and a discovery plan pursuant to Rule 26(f), which invariably involves reference to the complaint to determine "the subjects on which discovery may be needed." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f)(2). Discovery proceeds only after a party has pled that it is entitled to relief and the pleadings control the direction of the discovery plan. Rule 23 directives with regard to class action practice, which often apply in antitrust cases, similarly command a focused evaluation of the complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 looks to the complaint allegations on issues regarding whether10 it may furnish the proof needed to prevail. As noted in the Manual for Complex Litigation: "Antitrust litigation can ... involve voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence, extensive discovery, complicated legal, factual, and technical (particularly economic) questions, numerous parties and attorneys, and substantial sums of money, calling for the application of techniques and procedures for the management of complex litigation." Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, § 30, at 519 (2004); id. at n. 1730 (noting that many of the practices and procedures discussed in the manual were initially developed in antitrust litigation).Lawyers regularly find that antitrust cases cost millions of dollars simply to litigate to the summary judgment phase and require an enormous time commitment from counsel, clients, and the courts. Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 580 n. 34 (1984) (when a complex antitrust case proceeds past the pleading stage, a defendant must "bear [a] substantial `discovery and litigation' burden."); cf Deborah R. Hensler, Bonnie Dombey-Moore, Beth Giddens, Jennifer Gross, Erik K. Moller, Nicholas M. Pace, Class Action Dilemmas: Pursuing Public Goals for Private Gain, Rand Institute of Civil Justice 10, 31 (2000).12Because discovery can be so daunting and expensive in antitrust class actions, these cases can assume substantial set-questions of fact are common to the class, whether the claims and defenses of the representatives are typical, and whether common questions predominate, and in defining any claims, issues or defenses certified. "12 See also Rowe Entm't, Inc. v. William Morris Agency, Inc., 205 F.R.D. 421, 424-425 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (estimating that costs of producing electronic discovery -- just a sliver of the discovery pie would run nearly $10 million); Recommendations of the American College of Trial Lawyers on Major Issues Affecting Complex Litigation, 90 F.R.D. 207 (1981).11 tlement value as soon as they get past the 12(b)(6) stage! Linda Silberman, The Vicissitudes of the American Class Action -- With a Comparative Eye, 7 Tul. J. Int'1] & Comp. L. 201, 205 (1999). Lawyers experience great pressure to advise their clients to settle even flimsy antitrust cases that proceed past the pleading stage. Charles B. Casper, The Class Action Fairness Act's Impact on Settlements, ABA Antitrust, Fall 2005, Vol. 5, No. 1 at 26 ("the strong inducement to settle class actions -- even those presenting weak claims on the merits --- may give rise to some abuses"); Steven C. Salop and Lawrence J. White, Economic Analysis of Private Antitrust Litigation, 74 Geo. L.J. 1001, 1011 (1986). A lack of adequate threshold requirements for proceeding to summary judgment thus not only may waste substantial resources but may create unfortunate incentives for parties to bring speculative claims with the expectation of achieving a settlement prior to the summary judgment stage. Indeed, the Second Circuit also acknowledged how these factors boost the nuisance value of antitrust cases. See Pet. App. at 30a.This Court has recognized that the deterrence of nuisance suits is a legitimate concern at the pleading stage, Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723 (1975).14 In13 While important to deterring anticompetitive conduct, in antitrust cases under the Sherman Act the availability of treble damages heightens the potential for settlements that otherwise would be unjustified. Edward D. Cavanaugh, Detrebling Antitrust Damages: An Idea Whose Time Has Come?, 61 Tul. L. Rev. 777, 809 (1987) ("[t]he lure of treble damages may encourage the filing of baseless suits which otherwise might not have been filed."); see also Edward A. Snyder and Thomas E. Kauper, Misuse of the Antitrust Laws: The Competitor Plaintiff, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 551, 551-603 (1991) (private antitrust enforcement efforts currently encompass many claims that appear to be frivolous). 14 See also Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 1 (The rules are to "be construed and administered to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.")12Blue Chip Stamps, which involved a class action under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5, this Court noted that "[t]he potential for abuse of the liberal discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may . . . exist .. . to a greater extent than they do in other litigation. [In these cases], the mere existence of an unresolved lawsuit has settlement value to the plaintiff, not only because of the possibility that he may prevail on the merits, an entirely legitimate component of settlement value, but because of the threat of extensive discovery and disruption of normal business activities which may accompany a lawsuit which is groundless in any event, but cannot be proved so before trial." Id. at 742-43.The attributes of antitrust litigation under the Sherman Act reinforce the important role that Rule 12(b)(6) plays in weeding out unmeritorious antitrust claims. Reiter v. Sonotone, 442 U.S. 330, 345 (1979) (noting that courts need to "exercise sound discretion and use the tools available" to dismiss baseless antitrust claims.) The Second Circuit's pleading standard, however, undermines Rule 12(b)(6) in Section 1 Sherman Act cases -- a result that is inconsistent with the antitrust laws and not warranted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege facts that show that there is an agreement.13CONCLUSION For the reasons stated, the ABA respectfully requests that this Court reaffirm that allegations of parallel business behavior are not sufficient to set forth the element of conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act necessary to survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).Respectfully submitted,KAREN J.

I. EVEN WHEN IT WAS DECIDED, MEZEIRESTED ON WEAK AND UNFOUNDED REASONINGHISTORICALLYThe Mezei Court suggested that its decision fell within a long tradition of limiting constitutional rights to those noncitizens who had "passed through our gates" and entered the country. 345 U.S. at 212. But, the history of immigration law was far more nuanced than this and, if anything, Mezei, and its predecessor Knauff, supra, represented departures from past principles rather than the culmination of a jurisprudential evolution. Specifically, Knauff and Mezei overstated the limits on the judiciary's role in ensuring at least some due process protection even in exclusion proceedings. Before Mezei, the Supreme Court had not held that the political branches' power to regulate immigration included ' the power to detain even inadmissible noncitizens indefinitely, and lower courts had consistently limited the length of time excludable noncitizens could be detained pending their removal. Thus, Mezei was incorrect to the extent that it concluded that inadmissible noncitizens remain outside the basic protections secured by the Due Process Clause.°In Knauff, the Court excluded the noncitizen wife of an American serviceman based on secret evidence and without a hearing. In reaching this result, the Court stated that because she had no right to admission, she also lacked the right to a hearing as a matter of due process. 338 U.S. at 543-44,8 A. Before Mezei, Noncitizens Seeking AdmissionWere Entitled to Some Due Process. Prior to Knauff and Mezei, the distinction between noncitizens who had entered the United States and those whoremained outside it had not had been elevated to a bright-line constitutional rule, and "entry" had never been completely determinative of the fact or extent of protection under the Due Process Clause. For all noncitizens subject to removal, the government's "power to lay down general rules," even if "plenary," was not understood to include the "power to be arbitrary or to authorize administrative officials to be arbitrary," or to foreclose the federal courts from ensuring observance of the basic "constitutional guarantee of due process." See Henry M. Hart, "The Power of Congress to Limit theJurisdiction of Federal Courts: An Exercise in Dialectic," 66Harv. L. Rev. 1362, 1390-91 (1953). In Yamataya, supra, this Court first expressly recognizedthat noncitizens facing removal were entitled to due process, including notice of the charges against them and anOpportunity to be heard. 189 U.S. at 100-01. There, the petitioner, who had been in the United States for merely four days, had never been lawfully admitted to the country and had "entered" subject to conditions that could be revoked. Id.at 87. The government claimed she could be removed because she was likely to become a public charge. Id. Acknowledging the finality of executive or administrative officers' factual findings as to admissibility, this Court also stated that such officers could never `disregard the fundamental principles that inhere in due process of law" with respect to their power "to exclude or expel' noncitizens. Jd. at 100 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).Shortly after Yamataya, this Court began construing statutes in exclusion cases against the background of basic due process norms.

Yamataya, as noted, explicitly recognized that a noncitizen facing removal was entitled to due process (a principle later extended to exclusion cases); the cited passage of Fong Yue Ting, another preYamataya decision, merely establish- tehdat the power to exclude and to expel noncitizens rested upon the same general foundation, see 149 U.S. at 713-14; and Ludecke involved the deportation of an "`enemy alien" under the AlienEnemies Act of 1798, 1 Stat. 577, a context perhaps* Even in the earlier cases like Nishimura Ekiu, the Court had indicated its resolve to assure the lawful, constitutional application of immigration statutes to the exclusion of noncitizens. E.g., Nishimura Ekiu, 142 U.S. at 660 Gudicial review of exclusion of noncitizens to ensure "the restraint is lawful"); see also Yung Yo v. United States, 185 U.S. 296, 305 (1902) (courts will review decision to exclude noncitizen where "required by the Constitution . . . to intervene"). However, in a manner "typical of the period," the Court in those very first cases was more focused on the placement of power in the appropriate branch than on procedural issues surrounding its exercise. Neuman, supra, at 637-38.12sufficiently related to a national security exclusion case like Knauff's or Mezei's, but not to removal proceedings generally. Indeed, even Chae Chan Ping v. United States, 130 U.S. 581 (1889) ("The Chinese Exclusion Case"), which first described the political branches' "plenary power' overimmigration, did not contemplate the extreme statement ofthe law which the government derives from Mezei andKnauff. 130 U.S. at 604 (federal power over immigration islimited "only by the constitution itself and considera-tions of public policy and justice which control, more orless, the conduct of all civilized nations"), quoted inZadvydas, 533 U.S. at 695; see also id. (political branches'power over immigration "is subject to important constitutional limitations')..In short, MezeiEnot-support the sweeping propositionthe government asserts, that unadmitted noncitizens arenecessarily beyond all due process protections. Indeed,leading commentators at the time criticized Mezei'sunprecedented sweep. Professor Hart, for example, assertedthat Mezei, along with Knauff, had ignored "thousands" oflower court cases, including exclusion cases, which hadrequired basic due process guarantees. Hart, supra at 1390-91.2. And, only the year after Mezei, this Court again.° See also Developments in the Law, supra at 675 (stating, pre-Mezei, that Knauff "ignore[d] judicial developments of the last fifty years" and that "implicit in this history of judicial intervention [was] a theory of due process, of judicial supervision of administrative action arising out of our pervading constitutional concept of a rule of law"); Case Notes, 27 S. Cal. L. Rev. 315, 321 (1954) ("If the decision in the Mezei case is based on the ground that there exists supreme sovereign authority over aliens excluded from the United States, unrestricted by any limitations whatsoever, it clearly transcends fundamental notions of justice and human decency."); Comments, 34 B. Univ. L. Rev. 85, 88 (1954) (Knauff and Mezei "reversed th{e] trend" of granting increasing due process rights to noncitizens seeking admission). More contemporary commentators have concurred with Hart's basic critique of Knauff and Mezei. E.g., T.

Mezei, however, stretchedbecause of the practical difficulties associated with completing all immigration inspections on board. These statutes provided that this transfer would not be considered "a landing" for immigration law purposes. See Act of Feb. 5, 1917, ch. 29, § 15, 39 Stat. 874, 885; Act of Feb. 20, 1907, ch. 1134, § 16, 34 Stat. 898, 903; Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, § 8, 26 Stat. 1084, 1085-86. The "landing" provisions represented a pragmatic legislative response to the complexities of administering the nation's immigration laws during the early decades of federal immigration regulation. They helped shield shipping carriers from criminal liability for permitting noncitizens to disembark at the request of immigration officers, in contrast to their unquestioned liability for other, unauthorized `Jandings." E.g., Warren v. United States, 58 F. 559, 561 (1st Cir. 1893) (describing sanctions on carriers). The "landing" provisions also gave immigration officials the flexibility to examine arriving noncitizens in their own special facilities like the buildings on Ellis Island, without relieving shipping companies of their responsibility for the costs and transportation of those subsequently deemed ineligible for admission. See, e.g., United States v. Holland-America Line, 212 F. 116, 118-19 (2d Cir.) ("The legal fiction that the immigrants were not landed until they had been admitted .... only negatived any presumption that, because of. actual landing, they had been admitted or that the defendant's obligation to return them if ordered to be deported was at an end.") (discussing "landing" provision of the 1907 Act), aff d 235 US. 686 (1914).'! For example, the Mezei Court cited Kaplan v. Tod, 267 U.S. 228(1925), which had held that a noncitizen could still be excluded despite being temporarily released into the country as a minor nine years earlier. Id. at 230 (noncitizen never "dwelt" in United States within meaning of naturalization statute based on prior physical presence); see alsoNishimura Ekiu, 142 U.S. at 661-62 (noncitizen's transfer to shorepending determination of eligibility for admission "left her in the same position, so far as regarded her right to land in the United States, as if she had never been removed from the steam-ship," and did not alter power of government to exclude her as a person likely to become a public charge). Similarly, the Court subsequently determined that temporary parole into the United States does not entitle a noncitizen to seek the statutory benefit of withholding of deportation. See Leng May Ma, 357 U.S. at 188-89.

Jd. at 237. The specific facts of Wong Wing involved deportation, but the elementary principles of due process described by the Court encompassed exclusion as well. Jd. at 235 ("The question now presented is whether congress can promote its policy [embodied in the Chinese exclusion acts] by adding to its provisions for their exclusion and expulsion punishment by imprisonment at hard labor.) (emphasis added); see also id. (contrasting temporary detention pending "[p]roceedings to exclude or expel" with | unlawful sanction of imprisonment imposed on Wong Wing) (emphasis added). Thus, a noncitizen's violation of the immigration laws, subjecting him to removal from the country, did not deny him that most basic due process right against unlawful imprisonment. [d. at 237-38.Consistent with these fundamental norms, courts before Mezei had typically limited the length of a noncitizen's detention pending exclusion from the United States. See, e.g., Staniszewski v. Watkins, 80 F. Supp. 132, 135 (S.D.N.Y. 1948) (ordering release of noncitizen seaman detained at EllisIsland for almost seven months); Jn re Krajcirovic, 87 F.Supp. 379, 382 (D.

The Court's substantive due process jurispru-dence also recognizes that an individual may be subjected toregulatory detention only in narrow circumstances under acarefully drawn scheme. And, further eroding Mezei's ration-ale, this Court's procedural due process jurisprudence hasgrown and flourished through the development of a sensitivebalancing test which acknowledges that the nature of consti-tutionally required procedures varies depending on thestrength of the individual and governmental interests at stake,as well as the value of additional safeguards in producingmore accurate results. These developments provide further |reason to reject the interpretation of Mezei offered by thegovernment.|A. This Court's Substantive Due Process Jurisprudence Has Eroded the Foundations on which Mezei Purported to RestSince Mezei, this Court has repeatedly emphasized that the core purpose of the Due Process Clause is to protect against unlawful detention, whatever the context. See, e.g.,Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690 ("Freedom from imprisonment-- from government custody, detention or other forms of physical restraint--lies at the heart of the liberty that [the Due Process] Clause protects."); Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992) (`Freedom from bodily restraint has always. been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary governmental action."); see also United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987) ("In our society, liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.").This Court has also developed a more carefully calibrated framework to assess the constitutional implications of regulatory detention in particular. At the time Mezei was decided, the Court lacked a test that could make the necessary19coDnrd(trpwccpmfMACdanoiouieraeohouoleiihlonnrconesnsensinrzsyadcceafietspe.teereeidti"nihoihfliste)iPsndneniae,sisva:rceenrrds."tzt'teotidrmher(ehctiisienaenrseoeeLndnttsmoDon1sreligotf.tp4suisaCths3ohgbeisodwtduoCaahoeohhmiurrusWonsCtene,otenUpaeubiles.hwllAriaesanoajttcsputtrptsuuwo'tsPrhsirweestnfs"foeaieoeoeoaets.ucrrntlncdietroldnebcednaieimeceWesMehLtpfmstyadsre.uouirthuise)zgnhtnniennd,tea,iidRsgadoajhtritoeemnenerlue,Genvrori"rfwgea.htsnii"rualntWLttgsTlsohdeii3hapeosahmce8r9vn4fnrateth3aepge5undaoe3aslZM,rvcdri,mnUu'neaooteytn.opnsglzEdbiniUSgurloveexovslc.9o.foaneniucdySeen9Cpwtdsp.ld)m1.eaf,.rscEu.a-"nrualooCsssid9,lflnoitia,2etssuntt§oneoiTurcinlnpecthwcnf2pw5rh,(e1ooau0u3h1Konl2uen7n3ca9Winac3ldfi9ogtpwnaoea1dthisu5urdhd(untiU)nlni(oaufgv..dnle"i)rfSeecahmTDo(mme.xiawfhee6asvpcpvvfeWn)tTkillraieuietaheulnoeesiltnanulsdawsssgatisnite"wo;s6tts,icobdiwhdsene9tyoInateuom0etignthetuhio-nemtotoetdrlhnatn9enhnueuaahtsld2aliod-tetteeioz.ysltfsfIncreasingly sensitive to the dangers posed by regulatoryJtctItpdddohhanoueeueacdrttrmynkiaeetpmshanntoiettnoiwsttiiaionehltoon,,pelnneu,,droboptpff4heeoe0rtwcts6hoitchoeihoiCosmedoccmeuuhUmfrsCco.irtrtoSocteuo.ommarmdwmmahstyehpeoyinile7ntdtc1taahm5hseba,ellsntanymhstitattunths7icei3tnmono8cepmrnricoelptinbehymsemedesaeti(aisidren1vanfa9finrsool7dtr.yrs2ute)oaesldmtametoeesoepfSao(eiessber"nldrt,la[odaeeecTlnnata]ogdnesehmt.rofemgsulnm.titia,aritsumibnaritmnlleeteJaae.stdatyh.fcueow"rkrrIo)hedsenn..eloos;mtatnttohatasitrehenoeberaIednevdnt.also Kansas v. Hendricks, (sexually violent predators abnormality makes them a pacitated only for as long521 U.S. 346, 363-64 (1997) committed because their mentalthreat to others may be incaas that stated purpose remains);Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 314 (1993) (upholding INS_20policy of maintaining custody of noncitizen juveniles pending deportation proceedings where "period of custody [was] inherently limited by the pending deportation hearing" and was expected to last "an average of only 30 days"). And, in upholding the pretrial detention of a narrow class of individuals in Salerno, supra, this Court emphasized the "stringent time limitations" on that detention. 481 U.S. at 747; see also Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253, 269 (1984) (pretrial detention of alleged juvenile delinquents "strictly limited in time").At the same time, this Court has required that regulatory detention be limited to narrow classes of individuals. In Foucha, supra, it declared unconstitutional the continued detention of a person acquitted by reason of insanity under aregime that was neither "sharply focused" nor "carefully limited." 504 U.S. at 81. In contrast, the bail reform statute upheld in Salerno "carefully limit[ed]" pretrial detention to "the most serious of crimes," 481 U.S. at 747, and the Court underscored that the government bore the burden of proof in "a full-blown adversary hearing" to demonstrate by "`clear and convincing evidence" that an individual fell within that narrow class. fd. at 750. Similarly, the civil commitment _ scheme upheld in Hendricks, supra, strictly limited confinement to those with "a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond their control'' and required the government to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a particular individual fell within that narrowly defined category. 521 U.S. at 352, 358. Thus, the Court has substantially restricted the availability and duration of regulatory confinement in the | years since it decided Meze1.In Zadvydas, this Court established that its substantive due process jurisprudence provided the appropriate framework for evaluating the administrative detention of noncitizens pending removal from the United States. It concluded that a noncitizen's right to be present in the United States under the immigration statutes was distinct, as a matter of due process, from his right to be free of indefinite administrative detention.21°icmstUsibde(osstTtiruee.uharmqihateSxcradmlunp,mea.tunheleuogpthoyartselteal.wisgtyarsal"ahnptosiy"oigerinvnuzabennbd6oemesedcee9vnlrednifagi0ccinn,eisMpoa-oasiktnmspeal9utucveaiecozsec1ilsectlnieshn;nzieerottiioehtnam,ttbontemiipdo'bsilecoeetaedsteldontoenlhnn3h"ne"ueitm4ia)l`nssom'5imdvye.saftitsse,i'lidiottcs>ooetseoamrindUumtnvntu.ch"atseinSsahbeHrioto.tniatlyooegUsltfntnnunecd,hmd"odnospaetfscercetnohlrponiaerredmpeenpntce"usevoc2opt)qkcei2etrue.stant1efien,bthmlotnfrsoudeatlateeetihtyitcsnn(cet5atiAttprJr2eluvsaorteda1rlaeldhpiacaystmeastnrknoieypectosUgho,nehiodfoi.neeoctpufenn"Sitrawltt,dae.haleouseeelZvosrunfnfiaeisotlaidJdtctdtnioc.eot,ivanooiidhntngffninyr3iee,dcgondd5cdtiened7auZhitlrieebmssdaiiyi.vxsnassudo"cio(sertpvnfldpMeanaeluyuooCdettanrfsatodizipwsct5ieluoenaafohe3onsnrsgiusao"n,3-n,"tt),tanltSwMtssidgowm9dfasoieeumofe1ccieloeaolrr.ppcsttnEhtv:nliaoeiintseleeo'rsmsre,n°uomrutfisaiptcppSsrseniiosrnTikoeruceyamneeahotuerodclh,enscneenvvhedn;lsnciiibmtueoddsdbdyase.Cdpnlyeeee9ddctoersn1dvcehhaituo7teitennietrar",aasetgemttrslsir8uZrecseatirnmoFtolaatrr.mi,taiinendifMgioCphraontyuhmoana.aesntriravfnalgrFsSeaatnoytFst.skiuhlgdowiiRg.lepetrapaslp.oootrprslraorynv.sr.`ooseeeaqetccCpsno§xruaexeeotdaaednstgar2drsmrjss2amSi4erpumriupt;aetd13searriemtdeiil,swm2vnooacnpiooeei.nevtltlcendno,n1li'naiire5iy2d2ostrc3os(pe5nod3atnpttt1drchrethaahllraa)oi.teieltaeanatteUn,fcdxtecion.g(ksripcrzeeSt(JuSietveee.mvIdi2obn.gienv.nni0oetsgjuDoesss0ndhntufl.ntne'a1eedat§uabitsN;)rinnuttno...ctncusi2"ddwYd6iitdeo1coMyae9ah.eaeft2nhatl2melhr(sereeelnZNbnittmcyno)ahhateeor(1ttete-grdilr,ne"9h(aotoviev[s9dhnlgvyuiTb6ise)hW)Cedde]un)idst;c.taoruawhmrerehulni,ebsederrplria,tserevt(aioorTnenendihgrIaelgChgnrserheNeoetao5yetcSwin3asvoabastls3f.ldaeylhbicac'tspodernuv"dlooiroypm.grn)mnetfUotriornidmf.uahvronoSeiSnivteeHtitoinct..atiiaindfstih(liisueoeeattlqglpotJtnxl,ruaoarhnrosdaotabovoosahnesmittfervtmtnm6olaiii4riiieura9inmvnn7ttnndavs0toyeheg2yer--eevtty-ee.aU.S. 445, 450 constitutional(1985)); see requirementalso id. of due("`[U]nder process iscertain circumstances, the a requirement of judicial22 and the Court's post-Mezei substantive due process jurispru-dence, the determination that a noncitizen is "inadmissible"'under the immigration statutes does not remove his indefinite administrative confinement--in a federal prison on USS. soil--from the fundamental protections of the Due Process Clause.'® Accordingly, petitioner's detention raises preciselyprocess.""') (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 87 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).'® Mezei, as interpreted by the government, is also at odds with international human rights law prohibiting arbitrary detention. See, e.g., Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A. Res. 217A, U.N. Doc. A/810 (1948), art. 9 ("[nJo one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile"); Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (""ICCPR"), adopted Dec. 19, 1966, U.N. Doc. A/6316 (1966), 999 U.N.T.S. 171, ratified by the United States in 1992. Moreover, the Human Rights Committee, established to monitor compliance with the ICCPR, has interpreted "arbitrariness" as not to be equated exclusively with "against the law"; rather, it must be interpreted more broadly to include elements of "inappropriateness, justice, lack of predictability, or lack of due process." Womah Mukong v. Cameroon, Human Rights Committee, Communication No. 458/1991, CCPR/C/51/D/458/ 1991 at § 9.8 (1994); see also Ann Maria Garcia Lanza de Netto v. Uruguay, Communication No. 8/1977, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/OP/1 at 4 1415 (1984) (finding violation of Article 9(1) of the ICCPR where two individuals were detained for several months after their sentences of imprisonment had been fully served). The European Court of Human Rights has applied similar principles to limit the length of detention. See, e.g., Quinn v. France, 21 E.H.R.R. 529 (1996) (detention pending extradition cannot exceed a reasonable time; finding 18 months' detention to violate European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Norms and its prohibition against arbitrary detention). The United States has been specifically criticized by the Human Rights Committee for its treatment of excludable noncitizens. See Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee: United States of America 3/10/1995, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/79/Add.50A/50/40 at § 283 (1995) ("[The] Committee is concerned that excludable aliens are dealt with by lower standards of due process than other aliens and, in particular, that those who cannot be deported or extradited may be held in detention indefinitely."').23the same "seriouspetitioners' detention be prohibited.constitutional problem" asin Zadvydas.''

See, e.g., Gilbert v. Homar, 520 U.S. 924, 932-33 (1997); Smith v. Organization of Foster Families for Equality & Reform, 431 U.S. 816, 852 n.59 (1977); Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1979);Addington, 441 U.S. at 425; see also Martin, supra, at 167 ("The Supreme Court's approach to due process has undergone a virtual revolution since [Knauff and Mezei]."). Because the Due Process Clause requires a balancing test that accommodates governmental interests when determining whether particular procedures are needed, Eldridge, 424 U.S.at 335, courts can today consider and, when appropriate, defer to the unique national security interests that may arise in given situations during the course of the government's administration of the nation's immigration laws. Cf. Mezei, 345 U.S. at 214 (noting that Mezei "simply left the UnitedStates and remained behind the Iron Curtain for 19 months" without seeking security clearance or documentation before his departure).This Court has applied these principles in the immigration context even as to admission. Specifically, in Landon v. Plasencia, supra, the Court applied the Due Process Clause to a returning resident--precisely the type of noncitizen to whom Mezei refused any due process--subject to exclusion25 SaapwbbpbDftuueeryorutnlrgeoe3logsc2dsneeet-iecsrnap3laeittatscrl3dtteueeo.ihitrgcteenzatmeh,relghesiilaPnsnsnty'lt,egshaodtenoswhnsteveeorhmrneaeiiuecdrgonUghmitnrCntghiaemacoiesltenlurtsiutanreioernsttbdexnsg'iiapxfilsanrfdccicigelSmottoetsuinotydassisrchtnlissrelety,oeiraosuesnsfordinenedns",aasdaetpoenu,rnrndrxctroceschiotcitlndatwuteuitiarieedseeilanzdsdifnsiieifgoennninnontgcsgtMo"tti,ehheehzantrtatoieutehsrnr4eistn5p"iop"9ed[acrdwreMoooeinsntecttphomUrzeheoi.nmewgdS'riushh.ust]trtnceiraeloitetlsutahsipdtntfey.ioeohtodrc,nar2rtd"ymd8,nuIeto!--d--htaertt®.oseo mpwaciiudpnpanrieorppsspoonnotlacrcseneireieedadetsdemudduserdaer,er.iiet"tennht,ouadhginrta/snntdbg.hurtatttPehoudoaelmntinadattseb3nnhtheer4otaedhn-threc3eUi7taesth.atnM-uoeUipcentahztiprediTehttodeehmiesrtimdisseigESerbghtlshmotrtaSdsiiretatrmsedneattisdseewtide.reiolgtstfhenhapu,Jrsaede"n.vbsrcwdetpeabieanrslasatipotaesugevnlsetchtiuyecd3ttdhsb3i,jyeo-nes3u"wgcot4ghotnt.hahaetlthiemishbtsstRioCoehpsreroertuceosayerochdextgweomxcfansiuitllsnisleseudtzdxessneiitriidsbesnetooelrhisbnndle-eetl and yet precise framework by which the judiciary may continue to fulfill its traditional role with respect to the'* Prior to Plasencia, this Court between deportation and exclusionhad avoided the rigid distinction suggested by Knauff and Mezeithrough statutory interpretation. 461 (1963) (narrowly construing brief" trip abroad by petitioner,See Rosenberg v.

Acknowledging the traditional liberty interest in avoiding detention, particularly indefinite detention pending removal based on inadmissibility, can, under the flexible test that has evolved, co-exist with the government's interest in national security. Quite simply, Mezei is, today, a dangerous anachronism.Ill.

Pursuant to this authority, the Attorney General, acting for the President, could not only exclude noncitizens whose "entry would be prejudicial to the interest of the United States," but could do so without a hearing in the "special case" where that exclusion was based on "information of a confidential nature, the disclosure of which would [itself] be prejudicial to the public interest." Mezei, 345 U.S, at 210-11 & nn. 7 & 8 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).In denying Mezei relief, the Court expressly distinguished a noncitizen's temporary detention pending "expeditious consummation of deportation proceedings" from "[aJn exclusion proceeding grounded on danger to the national security," 345 U.S. at 215-16 (emphasis added), noting that "to admit an alien barred from entry on security grounds nullifies the very purpose of the exclusion proceeding."

Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952) (deportation of former Communist Party members under Internal Security Act), and Ludecke, supra (deportation of "enemy alien"), further underscores that Mezei turned on the special facts and circumstances of national security cases rather than some sweeping and inflexible principle meant to govern the prolonged detention of all*1 The Knauff Court emphasized similar concerns.

Mezei, by contrast, was an anomalywhen it was decided, and, at least as interpreted as broadly asthe government proposes, has been rendered obsolete by thisCourt's last half-century of due process jurisprudence. Atmost, Mezei should be understood to stand for the propositionthat the government may exclude and continue to detain aninadmissible noncitizen in carefully limited circumstances,based on the assertion of a specific national security interestand in accordance with procedures required by the DueProcess Clause. Cf. Zadvydas,consider terrorism or other533 U.S. at 696 ("[Wespecial circumstancesdo not]wherespecial arguments might be made for forms of preventativedetention and for heightened deference to the judgments ofthe political branches with respect to matters of nationalsecurity."). This Court should not transform Mezei's dictum,as the government urges, into a sweeping principle ofconstitutional law that places an individual's potentiallylifelong administrative detention beyond all guarantees of dueprocess simply because he has been found "inadmissible" forimmigration purposes.'CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, this Court should reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:ume JOHN J.

I. The Court Should Continue To Construe Section 101 Incrementally, By Excluding Certain Claims To Subject Matter As NonPatentable, Rather Than Adopting A Categorical Rule That May Inadvertently Inhibit Innovation.This case presents the question of what constitutes a patent-eligible "process" claim. 35 U.S.C. § 101 states that "[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefore], subject to the conditions and requirements of this title." A process, in turn, is defined as a "process, art, or method, and includes a5new use of a known process, machine, composition of matter, or material." 100(b).manufacture, 35 U.S.C. §A finding that a claim recites patent-eligible subject matter -- here, that it is a "process" within the meaning of Section 101 -- does not mean that the invention is ipso facto patentable. Section 101 raises only a threshold inquiry: to be patentable, inventions must also satisfy the other requirements of title 35, including novelty, 35 U.S.C § 102, and nonobviousness, 35 U.S.C. § 103.Section 101 jurisprudence, accordingly, need not seek to eliminate all objectionable patent claims. Rather, that provision determines whether a claim to an invention is outside the field of patent-eligible subject matter, so that the claim is not patentable even if it is novel and non-obvious.This Court's recent practice has been to enhance, rather than restrict, the power of the Patent and Trademark Office and the courts to flexibly apply the statutory standards governing the issuance of a patent. Thus, KSR v. Teleflex rejected the inflexible application of the Federal Circuit's so-called "teaching, suggestion, motivation" standard for proving an invention obvious. KSR Intl Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 415 (2007) ("Throughout this Court's engagement with the question of obviousness, our cases have set forth an expansive and flexible approach inconsistent with the way the Court of Appeals applied its TSM test.").The same flexibility is appropriately applied here. History teaches us to anticipate developments in fields that are presently undiscovered or undeveloped6-- such as in the areas of biotechnology and computersoftware. Developments in some fields -- such as inartificial intelligence and neural networks -- will raisequestions of patentability that are difficult toanticipate. Those developments will represent vitalareas of growth and competition for the Americaneconomy, and will likely require the spur of patentprotection.By contrast, adopting a_ single,encompassing standard to govern every processinvention arising under Section 101 threatens to beover- or under-inclusive. Such a standard is likely tobe poorly adapted to the many diverse types ofinventions deserving of patent protection that willarise over the coming decades, and may adverselyaffect those yet-to-be conceived inventions inemerging or unknown technologies.Patent law has always retained the flexibility to adapt to new developments, carrying society from the agrarian age (the cotton gin), through the industrial age (the electric light and innumerable machines), to the information age (computer-related inventions). Section 101 in particular is a "dynamic provision intended to encompass new and _ unforeseen inventions." J.E.M Ag Supply v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Intl, 534 U.S. 124, 135 (2001).Judge Newman, dissenting below, recognized that a rigid interpretation of Section 101 (such as the Federal Circuit's "machine-or-transformation") would exclude many useful inventions, such as "electronic and photonic technologies, as well as other processes that handle data and information in novel ways." In re Bilski, 545 F.8d 943, 976 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (Newman, J., dissenting). Indeed, many useful7process innovations in the electronic, laser, sonar, and microwave fields would not be patentable under the "machine-or-transformation" standard, such as a novel process for generating a laser beam.The ABA has thus formally adopted a policy, which is reproduced in full in the Appendix, infra, that opposes the application of Section 101 in a manner that articulates fixed and _ specific requirements that adversely affect yet-to-be conceived but deserving inventions in emerging or unknown technologies. Instead, the ABA endorses a flexible and incremental construction of Section 101.Incremental decisions by this Court have the further benefit of retaining for Congress its role under the Constitution in the definition of the patent law. Congress regularly examines and adapts the law prospectively to new technologies.By contrast, dramatic shifts in the definition ofpatentable subject matter adopted by the judiciarygenerally operate retrospectively and threaten tounfairly undercut significant investment-backedexpectations.Inventors have reasonably actedagainst the backdrop of a substantial body ofprecedent interpreting Section 101 broadly. TheFederal Circuit's ruling in this case has dramaticallydeparted from prior precedent in a manner thatadopts a sweeping, categorical rule. Such a rulecreates a significant and unwarranted degree ofuncertainty that inhibits innovation.The Court accordingly should resolve the application of Section 101 to this case and to the important body of similar patent applications, but there is no need to articulate, as the court of appeals8has attempted to do, an all-encompassing test for every process case that later may implicate Section 101. The ABA thus endorses the application of the common law tradition of incremental developments in determining the scope of patent eligibility under Section 101.In particular, the ABA requests that this Court apply its approach of exclusion -- deciding this case by announcing that a certain recurring type of claim (mental processes) falls under the category of abstract ideas and thus is not "patent-eligible." The Court's exclusionary approach provides inventors, the Patent and Trademark Office, and the judiciary with significant guidance, without inadvertently tying the hands of patent authorities and the courts with a rule that may prove to be unwise or unworkable. Consistent with its past practice, the Court should incrementally determine, over time and in the context of this and subsequent cases, what inventions do not fall within the category of so-called "patenteligible" subject matter.II. It Is Enough To Resolve This Case That Petitioners Claim An Abstract Idea.A. This Court's Precedents Correctly Settle That Abstract Ideas Are Not Patentable.This Court has identified types of subject matterthat are not "patent-eligible" under Section 101. Apatent is not available for laws of nature, physicalphenomena, and abstract ideas.Diamond uv.Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309 (1980). Theseexceptions include "mental processes and abstract9intellectual concepts." Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 67 (1972). The common element underlying these categories of exclusion is that they represent the basic tools of scientific and technological development and, as such, should remain beyond the control of any patent owner. Id. at 66.The uncertainty over the scope of patent-eligible"processes" in the wake of the Federal Circuit'sdecision illustrates the wisdom of limitingconsiderations under Section 101 to an elaboration ofthe scope of these categories of exclusion. In thiscase, specifically, claims in which a mental process iscentral, not ancillary, should be determined to fallwithin the category of abstract ideas and thus, shouldnot be patentable. Patent law should not interferewith the exercise of human intellect by granting amonopoly on processes in which thinking is central.Such processes "are not the kind of `discoveries' thatthe [patent] statute was enacted to protect." Parkerv. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 593 (1978). By reaffirming aninterpretation of Section 101 excluding claims inwhich mental processes are central, abstract businessmethods like tax planning (which the Patent andTrademark Office has to date generally regarded aspatentable, United States Patent Classification705/36T:TaxStrategies,http://www.uspto.gov/patft/class705_sub36t.html(last visited Sept. 29, 2009)) and retirement planningmay be unpatentable. If the exercise of humanintellect or judgment is central to a claim, then thepatentee's contribution of other incidental matter inthe claim should be insufficient to support a patent.10 The following is an example of abstract claimlanguage` that would ordinarily cause a patent claim to be excluded because it specifically requires judgment, reasoning or other abstract ideas:A method comprising: a) selecting options to include in taxstructured payments; b) performing a valuation of said options; c) advising a tax client based on said valuation; and d) preparing a tax return based on the advice. In this claim, human judgment is central, not ancillary, to the claim. In fact, human judgment is central to every element of the claim: a human selects the options to be valued, performs a valuation, advises a client, and then prepares a tax return that is based on the advice. Accordingly, this claim recites an abstract idea -- a mental process -- where human judgment is central. By contrast, a claim may constitute patentable subject matter if it is devoid of abstract ideas and does not require judgment or reasoning, though the claim may require the performance of specific functions such as counting, measuring, inspecting, observing, recognizing, or sensing, rather than abstract reasoning or judgment.4 The application of Section 101 turns on the claim language, because the claim defines the invention. It is the claim -- not the title, abstract, or summary of the invention -- that defines the relevant subject matter. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 373-74 (1996).11 B. Petitioners Claim Only An AbstractIdea.As Judge Rader correctly recognized in his dissent below, this case could have been resolved in a single sentence: "Because Bilski claims merely an abstract idea, this court affirms the Board's rejection." Brlski, 545 F.3d 948, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Rader, J., dissenting). Cf. Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 191 (1981) ("when a claim recites a mathematical formula (or scientific principle or phenomenon of nature), an inquiry must be made into whether the claim is seeking patent protection for that formula in the abstract"). Like Judge Rader, the Patent and Trademark Office also recognized that petitioners' claim merely manipulates an abstract idea. Petitioners attempt to preempt any method by which the public would engage in a very basic hedging of commodities risks.Claim 1 of the Bilski patent claims a series ofsteps.These include "initiating a series oftransactions ... wherein . . . consumers purchase [a]commodity at a fixed rate based upon historicalaverages, said fixed rate corresponding to a riskposition of [the] consumer." Bilski, 545 F.3d at 949.The patent does not specify a means for identifyingthe relevant transaction, the commodity, or thedegree of "correspond[ence]" to the appropriate "risk."Rather, the person employing the invention mustdecide which transaction to perform, the commodityto be used, the risk, and the degree of correspondenceto the risk. As a consequence, the claim is nothingmore than an abstract idea; it is a vague economicconcept. See id. at 1013 (Rader, J., dissenting). The12claim improperly attempts to assert a monopoly over an almost infinite number of methods of hedging commodity transactions.Claim 1 also claims "identifying market participants ... having a counter-risk position to said consumers." Bilski, 545 F.3d at 949. This element of the claim is abstract because it requires the exercise of significant reasoning. The individual employing the invention is left to determine how to "identify" the other market participants and to determine what constitutes an appropriate "counter-risk position."Nonetheless, care is required in rejecting a patentclaim as outside the field of patent-eligible subjectmatter based on the use of particular claim terms.For example, the Bilski patent recites "initiating"certain transactions. It may be possible to identifypatent-eligible claims to inventions that recite"initiating" a series of steps -- for example, where theterm "initiating" is employed in the context ofstarting a series of well-defined physical stepsrequiring little judgment.By contrast, whererecitation of the same term in the context of"initiating a series of transactions" calls for theexercise of human judgment, such as subjectivelydetermining the best candidates with whom totransact, it is too abstract to satisfy Section 101.Additionally, it would be possible to identify a patent-eligible claim to an invention that lists the step of "identifying" an object, as when the claim closely specifies the parameters for making the relevant choice. For example, an inventor may seek a patent on a process that permissibly requires138 "identifying" an electrical input signal according to a particular, specified measurement.For the foregoing reasons, this Court should elaborate on its prior holdings and conclude that claims to abstract ideas include mental processes such as those set out in Claim 1 of the Bilski patent, and that such claims are excluded from patentability under Section 101.Il. The Federal Circuit's Categorical "MachineOr-Transformation" Standard Is Contrary To The Statutory Text And This Court's Precedent.Rather than adopting an incremental approach of excluding non-patentable subject matter, the Federal Circuit adopted a rigid, categorical rule that an invention is patentable under Section 101 only if it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus or transforms a particular article into a different state or thing -- the "machine-or-transformation" test.The Federal Circuit need not have gone so far. Instead, it should have recognized that petitioners' invention is not patentable under this Court's prior precedent. The long-established exclusion of abstract ideas alone resolves this case.The Federal Circuit's ruling, further, is not supported by this Court's decisions. In Benson, the Court expressly declined the invitation to hold that for an invention to consist of patentable subject matter it "must either be tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must operate to change articles or materials to a `different state of thing." Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 71 (1972). Subsequently, in14Flook, the Court continued to "assume that a valid process patent may issue even if it does not meet one of these qualifications." Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 589 n.9 (1978).A "machine-or-transformation" test also is contrary to the structure of the constitutional and statutory grant of patent authority. The patent laws derive from the power to promote the progress of science and the "useful arts." U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8. In our "unitary" patent system, particular categories of "arts" -- such as method patents -- have never been subject to distinct and more demanding standards of patentability. Cf Benson, 409 U.S. at 67-68 ("We dealt there with a `product' claim, while the present case deals with a `process' claim. But we think the same principle applies.").Patentability under Section 101 governs everypossible form of invention. The text of Section 101,extending patent-eligible subject matter to"processes," should not be read to additionally imposetheFederal Circuit'srigid"machine-or-transformation" requirement. As Congress did notwrite Section 101 to tie patentability to anyparticular physical form, this Court should notimpose such a restriction.The grounds.15 CONCLUSION judgment should be affirmed on otherRespectfully submitted,Of Counsel: Thomas C.

 I. PLEA NEGOTIATIONS ARE A CRITICALSTAGE OF THE CRIMINAL PROCESS IN WHICH A DEFENDANT MUST HAVE COMPETENT COUNSEL. A. ABA Standards Emphasize the Importanceof Competent Counsel at the Plea Stage. A lawyer's duty to represent a client competently inthe pretrial stages of a criminal case, including in pleanegotiations, is recognized in the ABA MODEL RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT ("Model Rules" or "R.") and elaborated in the ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. Under the Model Rules -- and as this Courthas long recognized, see, e.g., Brookhart v. Janis, 384USS. 1, 7-8 (1966) -- the decision to plead guilty is considered so vital that it is specifically identified as one of the very few that cannot be made by the lawyer6 alone. See R. 1.2(a) (a lawyer "must abide by theclient's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify"); see also R. 1.4(a)(1) (a lawyer must "promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client's informed consent . . . is required by these rules");® R 1.4(b) (a lawyer must "explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions"); accord Standard 4-5.2(a) of the volume ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE, PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE FUNCTION (8d ed. 1993) (hereinafter "Defense Function Standards")' (the decision whether to plead and what plea agreement to accept are "ultimately for the accused . . . after fullconsultation with counsel.").8 Model Rule 1.2(a) and Defense Function Standard 4-5.2(a) give effect to an accused individual's right to make decisions regarding matters that are "fundamental" or "substantive" because they are highly personal and derive from constitutional guarantees. See Jones v. Barnes, 463U.S. 745, 751 (1983) (decisions about fundamental° The first example in the commentary to Rule 1.4 of this duty toinform the client is that "a lawyer who receives from opposingcounsel . promptly. . a proffered plea inform the client ofbargain in a its substance."criminal case must R. 1.4, cmt. 2.7 Of the volume ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE,PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE FUNCTION, only the Defense FunctionStandards are discussed in this brief.* The commentary to Defense Function Standard 4-5.2 explains that "because of the fundamental nature of decisions such as these, so crucial to the accused's fate, the accused must make the decisions himself or herself."7 matters, including decision to plead guilty, are reserved for the defendant).Defense counsel's failure to communicate a plea offer, and to fully and accurately explain the choices facing the client at this critical stage of the case,effectively deprives the client of the right to knowinglyand intelligently make a decision that will predictably have a dramatic effect on his or her future. See Standard 14-3.2(a) of the volume ABA STANDARDS FORCRIMINAL JUSTICE, PLEAS OF GUILTY (3d. ed. 1999)(hereinafter "Pleas of Guilty Standards") (defense counsel "should keep the defendant advised of developments arising out of plea discussions conducted with the prosecuting attorney, and should promptly communicate and explain to the defendant all pleaoffers made by the prosecuting attorney"); see alsoDefense Function Standard 4-6.2(b) (counsel should "promptly communicate and explain to the accused all significant plea proposals made by the prosecutor"). The ABA Criminal Justice Standards have contained° The commentary to Defense Function Standard 4-6.2 explains that:Because plea discussions are usually held without the accused being present, the lawyer has the duty to communicate fully to the client the substance of the discussions. It is important that the accused be informed of proposals made by the prosecutor; the accused, not the lawyer, has the right to decide on prosecution proposals, even when a proposal is one that the lawyer would not approve. Ifthe accused's choice on the question of a guilty plea is to be an informed one, the accused must act with full awareness of the alternatives, including any that arise from proposals made by the prosecutor. Defense Function Standard 4-6.2(b) emt.8these requirements for more than thirty years, andthey have been cited by numerous courts both before and after Strickland as establishing the norm ofeffective representation in the guilty plea context." ABA standards also require that a lawyer mustfully explain and advise about the choices available to the client considering a plea offer, after conducting anappropriate investigation and analysis of all pertinentSee Standard 4-6.2(a) of the ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINALJUSTICE, THE DEFENSE FUNCTION (2d ed. 1979); see also Standards14-3.2(a) and (b) of the ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL J USTICE,PLEAS OF GUILTY (2d ed. 1979). The ethical duty to convey and advise about a plea offer was also contained in the 1969 MODEL CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY that antedated the Model Rules. See, e.g., Ethical Consideration 7-7 ("A defense lawyer in a criminal case has the duty to advise his client fully on whether a particular plea to a charge appears to be desirable and as to the prospects of success on appeal, but it is for the client to decide what plea should be entered and whether an appeal should be taken"); see also State v.

See Kimel, 120 S. Ct. at 640; Semi-nole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55 (1996). The ABA submits that the ADA is within Congress' constitutional authority as an exercise of its powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which necessarily limits the Eleventh Amendment and grants Congress the authority to abrogate states' sovereign immunity. See Kimel, 120 S. Ct. at 644; Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 456 (1976).4Legislation is consistent with the Eleventh Amendment when there is "a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end." City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 520 (1997). In applying the "congruence and proportionality" test, this Court concluded that neither the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb to 2000bb-4 (1994), nor the Age Discrimina-3 A federal statute properly subjects states to suits by individuals if, as here, Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the states' immunity, and Congress "effectuated that abro- . gation pursuant to a valid exercise of constitutional authority." Kimel, 120 S. Ct. at 640. The ADA clearly satisfies the first prong. See 42 U.S.C. § 12202 ("A State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in Federal or State court-of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter."); 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b) ("Tt is the purpose of this Act. (4) to invoke the sweep of Congressional authority including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment. . . ."). Thus, the analysis turns to whether Congress' action was within its authority under the Constitution.4 The Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant part: Section 1.. . . No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any. person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.Section 5. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by: appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.6tion in Employment Act (`ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634(1994), was appropriate legislation under Section 5 of theFourteenth Amendment. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at536; Kimel, 120 S. Ct. at 645. In each case, the Courtfound that the legislative record failed to revealwidespread patterns of unconstitutional conduct. See Cityof Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530; Kimel, 120 S. Ct. at 648-49.In contrast, the ADA is based on a significant history ofstate discrimination against people with disabilities. Inpassing pelling,the ADA, lengthyCongress acted on the basis of and detailed factual predicate,a comdeter-mining that people with disabilities have been subjectedto invidious prejudice and discrimination, and have hadtheir rights abridged or denied. See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No.101-485, pt.U.S.C.C.A.N.2, at 29-32 (1990), reprinted in303, 310-13; H.R. Rep. No. 101-485,1990pt. 1,at 24-25 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267,268; H.R. Rep.

L.C., 527 U.S. 581(1999), the ADA incorporated "individuals with disabilitiesCongressional findings continually encounterthat var-ious hasforms tendedof discrimination" and "historically, society to isolate and segregate individuals withdisabilities. . . ." Id. at 588-89 (citing 42 U.S.C.§ 12101(a)(2), (5)). These findings are consistent with thisCourt's protection of the liberty interest disabilities reflected in opinions precedingof people Olmstead.with See,5Moreover, when determining whether Congress enacted astatute pursuant to its to consider evidencerecord."

Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 574-75 (1975) (observing that the state may not "fence in the harmless mentally ill solely to save its citizens from the exposure to those whose ways are different").The record before Congress in 1990 was replete with examples of egregious conduct by the states--segregatory practices, laws that categorically denied people with dis-abilities fundamental rights, and other forms of invidious and irrational discrimination.A. State Segregation and Mistreatment of People With Disabilities Within Institutions Have Been Particularly Egregious.By the time of the ADA's enactment, it was well known that throughout this country's history many people with disabilities were continually subjected to segregation andinstitutionalization.® The findings of fact supporting the ADA point to segregation and institutionalization as a "serious and pervasive social problem." 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).As Congress was aware, the deleterious consequences of state sponsored institutional segregation extended not only to the stigmatization of people with disabilities and limitations on access to community life, see Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 600 (segregation in institutions of people with disabilities "perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that people so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life"), but also to abuse and mistreatment found to be unconstitutional by several district6 The ADA was the latest in a series of steps Congress took to address overly restrictive placements of people with disabilities, including the enactment of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights, Pub. L. No. 88-164, 77 Stat. 282, (codified as amended 42 U.S.C. §§ 6000-6083 (1994)), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No, 93-112, 87 Stat. 355 (codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. §§701-796 (1994)). See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 599-600.L ec Ao edicourts.' See, e.g., New York State Ass'n for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Rockefeller, 357 F. Supp. 752, 765 (E.D.N-Y. 1973) (*NYSARC"). Congress also had before it this Court's decisions in O'Connor, 422 U.S. at 563, and Youngberg v. Romero, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), documenting the confinement of the harmless mentally ill and the states' failure to provide for basic health and safety needs of residents with mental retardation.One example of the judicial record before Congress involved the Willowbrook State School for the Mentally Retarded ("Willowbrook"). See NYSARC, 357 F. Supp. at 752. Beginning eighteen years before the enactment of the ADA, District Judge Orrin G. Judd issued several decisions detailing some of the abuses to which Willowbrook patients had been subjected.* In an early decision,7 Congress' attention to the problems of institutionalization stretches back at least to the enactment of the Rehabilitation Act. Senator Humphrey, the bill's sponsor, stated: "I am calling for public attention to three-fourths of the Nation's institutionalized mentally retarded who live in public and private residential facilities which are more than 50 years old, functionally inadequate and designed simply to isolate these persons from society. . . ." 118 Cong. Rec. 525 (1972).8 Willowbrook was one of the examples of the "problems with large-scale residential institutions for handicapped people" discussed in Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities, on which Congress relied in considering the ADA.

See id. at 755, 756. Even that most basic ofrights, the right to be free from physical harm, was denied the Willowbrook residents. See id. at 764-65.Physical conditions at Willowbrook were horrific. Thecourt found that residents were left unclothed or in filthyclothes; that all of the wards had non-functioning andoverflowing toilets and sinks; and that sanitation was mis-erable. See New York State Ass'n for Retarded Children,Inc. v. Carey, No. 72 Civ. 356/357, 10-12, 15 (E.D.N.Y.Apr. 28, 1982) (Order to Appoint Special Master) ("Wil-lowbrook Order").,Willowbrook residents were also deprived of other basic necessities. Many had "pipestem legs," a sign of inadequate nutrition, id. at 34, and lacked bedding, furniture, proper medical treatment, and programming that might have allowed them to maintain or learn skills. See id. at 13, 18. In 1982, more than ten years after the court's initial findings of fact and seven years after the entry of a consent decree, see New York State Association for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 393 F. Supp. 715 (E.D.N.Y. 1975), plaintiffs returned to court seeking the appointment of a special master to force compliance by state defendants. The court found that many of the problems identified earlier continued essentially unchanged. See Willowbrook Order, No. 72 Civ. 356/357, at 10, 15.Indeed, Willowbrook was not an aberration; many other federal district courts were forced to intervene to protect the rights of segregated mentally ill and retarded residents of state institutions.

Bass, 524 F. Supp. 1270 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (holding unconstitutional the disenfranchisement of people involuntarily committed to hospitals by court order but not declared incompetent). Yet because of the wide latitude frequently granted by the statutes, State agencies have often misused their power in disenfranchising people with disabilities. See, e.g., I/M/O Absentee Ballots Cast by Five Residents of Trenton Psychiatric Hospital, 331 N.J. Super. 31 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2000).Registration requirements have also served as a significant barrier to political participation. Before the passage of the ADA, most states did not allow accessible registration and instead required trips to the board of elections in order to register, thereby restricting access for people with mobility impairments. See Frances Fox Piven & Richard A. Cloward, Why Americans Don't Vote 178 (1988). Prior to 1917, no state provided for absentee balloting for the physically disabled, effectively disenfranchising the home or hospital bound. See George Fredrick Miller, Absentee Voters and Suffrage Laws 48 (1948). The use of absentee ballots remains limited in some states.!°As three recent actions in New York demonstrate, the problem of access continues today. See People v. County of Delaware, 82 F. Supp.2d 12,(N.D.N.Y. 2000) (failure of local officials to provide accessible polling places); People v. County of Schoharie, 82.F. Supp.2d 19 (N.D.N-Y. 2000) (same); People v. County of Otsego, 99 Civ. 2239 (N.D.N_Y. 1999) (same).Moreover, in nearly every state, blind voters are unable to cast secret ballots. Despite the availability of alterna-10 For example, West Virginia had allowed indirect voting bythe physically disabled only if they were going to be out of the state.See Miller, supra, at 30.:14tives such as tape recorders, specially designed ballots, orvoting machines with Braille, which would allow the blind to cast secret votes, these disabled voters must have a relative present to hear the vote, or worse, have an elec-tion official transcribe the vote given. Testimony of this particular plight was plainly before Congress. See Hearing before House Subcomm. on Select Educ., 101st Cong.48-49 (Oct. 24, 1988)."!C.

See, e.g., Alaska Stat. § 9.20.010 (Michie1973). In addition to these statutory prohibitions, courthouses andcourtrooms are frequently inaccessible to the disabled. See AndrewWeis, Peremptory Challenges: The Last Barrier to Jury Service forPeople with Disabilities, 33 Willamette L. Rev. 1, 4 (1997).15of people with disabilities. See Don F. Nicolai & William J.

[There is] outright intentional exclusion, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, and. . . relegation to lesser jobs and opportunities.42 U.S.C. § 12101. Indeed, statistical studies before Congress demonstrated that unemployment rates amongpeople with disabilities are drastically higher than rates of unemployment for non-disabled people, and only a small percentage of Americans with disabilities who could work if given the opportunity are actually employed. See Accommodating the Spectrum 29; H.R. Rep. 101-485, pt. 2, at 32 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 314; S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 9 (1989).Prior to the enactment of the ADA, certain people with disabilities were able to seek redress against state actors that received federal funding pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701-796 (1994). See, e.g., School Bd. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987). See also Chalk v. United States, 840 F.2d 701 (9th Cir. 1988) (injunction12 Indeed, throughout the 1980s, despite the enactment of the Education of the Handicapped Act of 1970, Pub. L.

No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 355 (codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. §§701-796 (1994)), the percentage of people with disabilities who were employed fell sharply. In addition, the disparity between the average income of employed people with disabilities and the average income of people with no disability increased greatly. See H.R. Rep.

When considering the ADA, Congress was aware of Arline and the types of invidious employment discrimination that cases similar to Arline represented. See H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at30, 65, 71-72 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N.303, 312, 347, 353-54 (citing Arline); S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 7, 27, 34 (1989) (same). See also Jackson v. State,544 A.2d 291 (Me. 1988) (state discriminated against person with diabetes by physical requirements in order tobecome a school bus driver).In fact, through the ADA, Congress consciously addressed an incongruity left by the Rehabilitation Act-- that a private right of action against the states for invidious discrimination was availabie only if the state received federal funds.!3 Congress found ample discrimination by the states and no evidence that the conduct was limited only to federally-funded state actors."Il.WHETHER CONGRESS ACTED WITHIN ITS ENFORCEMENT POWER UNDER SECTION 5ODSFCERTTUEHTREIMNIFYNOEUDARPTPEBLYEINETDTHHETOALMECVELENALDSMSOIEFFNITJCUADTIISICOINNAOSTLBASED ON DISABILITIES.The fact that-laws alleged to discriminate on the basis of disability are subject to rational basis review, rather than heightened scrutiny, should not be construed as lim-13°`The "resulting inconsistent treatment of people with dis-abilities by different State or local government agencies is bothinequitable and illogical for a society committed to full access forpeople with disabilities."

Indeed, the finding of discrimination in Cleburne supports the conclusion that Congress acted properly within its Section 5 powers in passing Titles I and II of the ADA.A. The Rational Basis Test is a Doctrine of Judicial Restraint, Not an Assessment of the Scope of Congressional Authority.The rational basis test was judicially created to give state legislatures wide latitude to address societal problems where courts have less competence, see Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 439-40, and is deferential in nature to prevent courts from over-reaching their judicial function. See FCC y. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993). Nonetheless, the test also serves to prohibit irrational classifications. Indeed, the decision to apply the rational basis test to classifications based on disability rested, in part, on this Court's stated concern, given the variation in the abilities and needs of people with disabilities, that "governmental bodies must have a certain amount of flexibility and freedom from judicial oversight in shaping and limiting their remedial efforts." Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 445.This deference to legislative flexibility, though, does not take discrimination on the basis of disability out of the ambit of the Equal Protection Clause. To the contrary, this Court applies the rational basis standard to afford the latitude necessary for legislators to pursue policies to assist individuals with disabilities in fully engaging in activities and enjoying their right to equal protection under the law. See Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 446-47. Absent some reason15 The recognition that individuals with disabilities may requiredifferent treatment in order to guarantee equal protection is at the heart of the "reasonable accommodation" requirement of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).18to infer antipathy, it is presumed that "even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely [the Court] may think a political branch has acted." Beach Communications, 508 U.S. at 314 (quoting Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979)). The rational basis standard is thus, "a paradigm of judicial restraint." Id. at 314 (emphasis added).The rational basis test, however, is not toothless. Indeed, the zoning ordinance at issue in Cleburne pro-vided an example of a governmental action that rested on "an irrational prejudice against the mentally retarded," and this Court unanimously found it invalid on that basis.Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 450. Thus, the more permissive standard of review does not preclude' a finding that irrational or invidious differential treatment on the basis of disability constitutes a violation of the Constitution.To rule otherwise would be to undermine the foundation of equal protection jurisprudence. The development of levels of scrutiny for different classifications was judicially created for the purpose of flushing out discriminatory behavior, not to confine the domain of the Equal Protection Clause. See John Hart Ely, Democracy and Distrust 146 (1980) (citing Larry G. Simon, Racially Prejudicial Governmental Actions: A Motivation Theory of the Constitutional Bar Against Racial Discrimination, 15 San Diego L. Rev. 1041 (1978)). The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits invidious and irrational discrimination by the states even if it is not based on a suspect classification. This Court expressly stated in Romer v. Evans, 517 US. 620 (1996), that "[b]y requiring that the classification bear a rational relationship to an independent and legitimate legislative end, [the Court] ensure[s] that classifications are not drawn for the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the law." Id. at 633.19Indeed, the categories of scrutiny this Court utilizes are not static, and absurd results would follow were the standard of judicial scrutiny the measure for determining the breadth of legislative authority. Nor could it be said that the level of review afforded a particular classification was a reliable indicator of whether unconstitutional discrimination against that group was prevalent. In fact, during certain periods in our nation's history, discrimination on the basis of race and gender was not subjected to a heightened level of scrutiny. See, e.g., Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 356 (race); Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971) (gender). The level of scrutiny applied was simply not tied to whether unconstitutional discrimination existed. In Reed, for example, this Court applied the rational basis test, but shortly thereafter classifications based upon gender were elevated to a heightened standard of review: See Reed, 404 U.S. at 71; Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976). Had Congress acted to prevent or remedy discrimination on the basis of sex in 1971, surely the abrogation of sovereign immunity would not have been invalid simply because the law was enacted during the time courts applied the rational basis test.B. Congress' Authority to Remediate Unconstitutional Discrimination Against People with Disabilities Includes the Power to Proscribe Some Conduct . That May Be Constitutional.The scope of Congressional authority to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment and, in partic-ular, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, is not controlled by the level of scrutiny applied by courts and not limited to classifications or government actions that trigger strict scrutiny. It is, instead, based on a constitutional role to protect individuals against invidious dis-crimination regardless of a person's disfavored status. This conclusion is consistent with the principle that20Ctii(C(sssA(snCcbhnrRCpco(euFo13tuacce1imrooiio1rvhnni8u9crnm9htatnug9eeueecf3i8grhguihe9enh9gnngtnto0-ntrten1s4tmctrtue)ncgiefde))syheeeea,ssUnallsapm,dwh,nr.strysccfensraeChteiS,ais-hdaoAylitah.oetnn'm(rercctdhluf5u"ntawyeetatmah2n[atetisjcained5A.Icn3tinetisscoo]icsodho0nlmooths,togsrfeCe1nfehnenMUnsieosgbCaS.soenBiitditnritdtelFSo1tinbozoshtad(ioogsfe.il.9eiteeiifyl1itrara6msdtisranl9udiw5netceuentnaog2e6othsl,cSaosrrtglqinent6e6eiefhnasii)su,ve6,pg)etoaloo)mie4CtioRnvFntn.i.2sohowoaeoagc(nal5nfemlGt(eabul1Golea2aBgaemhU.nayrr9siurt1sotoRuritsa.dlo9etlitloevtnehenS9loydgedschgrseeo.)lUntoSoevoeeiuySso,Ctm.r.vewnanrrnnos'Sp.hseoennitiytp,u.pfreteesUnmthotrlsteonerlnghyetofyhha§Knatviiaihfa§n,vic4seuidhe.tttneiAlbstt4ttmeaiseCctbiotiCh6mA.e.v5Cn1d,mtsirotoasl1e9oiie"gstulnrfarn8ht.7,usseniUganu)oSc1rvgict.d.stnnrdlr,eit.liohLySoa(hdoiecvoijmsnat.1toiWetftlneuoslFe2elnphohuea1rtdannasots0oegernintpb9o,itrd,c5aeetz7heLcoitau5cse3neeiavoarlcySt.lesa,4nl5anes.oattKx40lqds(thveart.6a1iulvtteii1aovneeCttfeeJtimyo9ttot.essnrotrtph,z8.MettFnhhUfeUeua1il0cseroerei.elt.onn9e)oc)alSfcnneSnirdga7,,-sdiow..tfrc.tfdtbcVi3,neneehteseoeoeatbqdoceaesbrtt6lrtctebr4uo1nutpnnocithh4area55ht-oaiert,ihetano4walt6h2tysl1deb-,hhtngsleeeC.

Jd. To.pass constitutional muster, states must be able to demonstrate a real relationship between the classification utilized and the asserted goal to be fostered by the legislation, and not simply rely upon an attenuated relationship, or the bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group. See Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55, 63 (1982); United States Dep't ofAgric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 535 (1973). Conse-quently, the Court found that the group home posed no special threat to any legitimate state interest, and presented no more of a threat than a host of other uses. Requiring the special use permit, therefore, violated the Constitution. While states have the latitude to assist people with disabilities to reach their full potential, when they actively engage in activities that burden individuals with disabilities, they may do so only in an "incidentalmanner." Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 446.II. STATE CLASSIFICATIONS BASED ON DISABILITY, LIKE THOSE BASED ON RACE, ETHNICITY AND GENDER, HAVE REFLECTED STEREOTYPES, STIGMA, AND PREJUDICE AND ARE RIGHTLY WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.A. Many of the Same Psychological and Sociological Factors That Underlie Discrimination Against People With Disabilities Also Underlie Discrimination Based on Race and Gender.In its equal protection jurisprudence, this Court has recognized that certain state actions classifying individuals are the product of illegitimate motivations. This Court has rejected state classifications and state actions based on22stereotyping, see, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515 (1996); stigmatization, see, e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954); and psychological discomfort with a minority's differences, see, e.g.,Watson v. Memphis, 373 U.S. 526 (1963); Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429 (1984). Significantly, the history of state treatment of people with disabilities has been marked by actions based on these same underlying motivations. See Timothy M. Cook, The Americans with Disabilities Act: The Move to Integration, 64 Temp. L. Rev. 393, 399-407 (1991).Classifications based on gender stereotypes, that is, onassumptions about what characteristics and capabilitiesattach to being male or female, have been held illegitimate both because they are often inaccurate as to indi-viduals disadvantaged by the classification and becausethey run the risk of perpetuating, the very assumptions_ they reflect. See, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S.at 533; J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel T.B.,511.U.S. 127, 139n.i1 (1994); Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 283 (1979). While this Court's opinion in Cleburne makes clear that classifications based on mental retardation that rely on judgments regarding the characteristics of people with mentalretardation may in some instancesCourt nonetheless refused to acceptbe sanctioned, thisa justification for agovernmental action that was based purely on stereotype.Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 432 ("[I]t is difficult to believe thatthe groups of mildly or moderately mentally retarded indi-viduals who would live at 201 Featherston would presentany different or special hazard.").People with disabilities have often been disadvantaged by the prevalence of stereotypes about their abilities and behavior. Like members of racial and ethnic groups, and women, they have been barred from public educational and employment opportunities as a result of generally erroneous assumptions about their skills and behavior.23See, e.g., Pennsylvania Ass'n for Retarded Children v. Pennsylvania, 343 F. Supp. 279 (E.D. Pa. 1972); Mills v. Board of Educ., 348 F. Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972). See also Nicolai & Risel, supra, at 1085 (employment). Finally, just as women were once barred from voting and from serving on juries, so too have many individuals with disabilities been denied. access to these civic rights and responsibilities, notwithstanding that they were quite capable of exercising them.As this Court pointed out in Brown, stigmatization, the marking of one group as less worthy than another, occurs -- when one group is set aside from society. Brown, 347 U.S. at 494 ("to separate [children]. . . solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community"). For racial groups and women, the judgment that certain groups are less worthy or have inferior capacities has often taken the form of laws excluding the disfavored group from public institutions, accommodations and opportunities, as in cases restricting the entry of blacks or women into state educational programs, jury duty, and access to certain professions. See, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 515 (gender); J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 131 n.2 (exclusion of women from jury duty); Reed, 404 U.S. at 71 (men preferred as administrators); Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 308 (1880) (denial of right to serve on a jury "is practically a brand . . . affixed by law, an assertion of their inferiority"); Bradwell v. Illinois, 16 Wall 130 (1873) (bar against `women in the legal profession); Geier v. University of Tennessee, 597 F.2d 1056 (6th Cir. 1979) (race). Similarly, people with disabilities have also. been excluded from many of-these same public services, institutions and opportunities, and have been stigmatized as a result. See supra, in Point I.B., C.This Court has recognized with regard to racial discrimination that psychological discomfort with or a desire24taUWtoipoo3aibttb.dhtafe4ponhtulSiior,eogtmeer.fsslpsrinsefee:eelteaespnIaysumev,ntraatid,oewaterfedhtthnoaseefCo4tirot4niro27l.mvtef3to4s3"e"aeoi35mebrcata-scxrauflitU3ieOanrrfaoUt.t4f'mtnenoih.Son;eadipeoCzrmeS.rinetl.o,f.snepnfrfttsWtaeoo,hneitfsr6halerttot0eoithe.fu4nrscisntrs4"cseiom,toit8o(.afeeeaon.m1astnn,9rCwhesstd4e1iaoho.Aneea27succ"oss2xal)3rinoitc.pl7oetanrhtAoyt3ttleeUciashyscr.oeTeoueccSnphhrrUr..oteopean.eoeCbnrdrrmiStoecmimon.Smauaedlfistltemgrrnoeofuseeepdtsed,dsg5saetirttriea7sapdreehebd4teseneodfgl-t,o.5tisaaag7em2pdecn.ttt56elit,toeg;e.infeoh"dsbw1eftrmPsa6ehaeaseaBriwlohtndrinepehliulsaneeesantmyecnvrtOhuothdalen'hSrfytianelaiCpowel.decencorloea,i"gacapdyncsasepemnatsftntovprbpe4rroClieeite6onlueralvl-a6emdlttm-v,-er-.-yeB.DTSoSfiheisegmaFirbleuHiagnilraisdtttaeiotmedro s,ey tnhtoeDDfaielsHmDicoisrnsticsRomritrigiryhnmatiatsnotefaestdDbiiyostAnchgaSrattAiiagnmtasiTeitnshn,aestytiianonPndHeaaovMBSpealtaesrneinBpdwepeieetrondhnRace and Gender.tAshtDeiIAtnuatcmioiopnnnltacerllausdtrveeidcotoloraddttiihesoncbsrel.fieogmiriIsennlaattCiiitoosvnengdrerreleisicsbsoienrgrdawthteioexonantsmheiintoelnedevnetalhicnetoeKfdAimDceoAtlnh,,-efuTosesSRofhtnstciraeoetcg1tct6rHiheoetimtasdW,mlasniimtzdhceoseaikSadtIdndtencne.eddratriluphitleanhlpFigWtSedi,zaeiieezasmtedratlcibetiahylaiotRryoniPsolnot1eiybsan9rePto6srAefr3oottlip,fnwvmteseeharoLe,unacmMs.tglyietiem,tmnBeon5tet0ustiDinathrcne1tlgg9aalTd8dl6yeco6s:l4mferty,opnef0rD.Rrt,B0ciuueau0elrktncdiJyLdaerkzp..raeQsdtpr.tiL&ievhns.e.odyJron.siMnB9tliesa9hilce5Prl8zla0aecahl6wrtialU,sia(sadyn.o1noni9dn8,t7bPs6dSe7ee5:ite)deashse.neeraencbR.SeilSE2eItintelnapdvedi.trB(,orzeou1il1sa9rlduw9,ab8ing3aune6zt0dsdct)aa,oeth.trrviiiinftevolo2n,nety8Si.s25Congress found that people with disabilities have been "subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment," in such critical areas as "housing, employment, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services." 42 U.S.C. § 12101. Congress further found that individuals with disabilities have been "relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals. ... ." Id." Although not identical to the history of discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender, the history of discrimination against people with disabilities shows that states have also subjected them to forms of segregation and discrimination, and deprived them of basic rights.This Court has long seen segregation, as well as the stigmatization that derives from it, as one of the great evils of both race and gender based discrimination. See Brown, 347 U.S. at 483, United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 515; Watson, 373 U.S. at 526. It rejected residential discrimination as long ago as 1917, when it invalidated a Kentucky law forbidding blacks to buy homes in white neighborhoods. See Buchanan, 245 U.S. at 60; Jones v. Mayer, 392 U.S. 409 (1968) (private refusal to sell); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948) (enforcement of `restrictive covenants). And, in 1954, this Court ruled, resoundingly, that "in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place." Brown, 347 U.S. at 493. It has also rejected state sponsored segregation on the basis17 Amicus is not arguing here that classifications based on disability should be accorded heightened scrutiny, an issue decided in Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 432. The ABA submits, however, that the history of state conduct, including warehousing individuals in state-run institutions--and the horrendous conditions that were allowed to exist for years--demonstrates that states have discriminated against people with disabilities and reflects some of the barriers faced by people with disabilities to seeking redress.26 oymViU6it.efii.nn7hxtrgSs7ePcb)g.t,sa;oliieitnrutnihauda6atctStce8,eeitad4rrors1a-,nea2c56sasu7e1fn8d8rd35eao3ia(rssm9nUg,dg.ej(aSenu1tU.rndh9sr.1yede7eeS0rex30.ac)rt)fdo;uugi5ntU6nn1by.(2idF5aSdh9tar.siiioamegso(nnehdc(gndtne1aueti9rtsne5vseado0ro3eixfl)eot0roc.di3)nltun,huacgve(s.sa.(ropitafraeRoihnaccinSdocaeteecen)rsex);h,m,h.cafalrrsousUefoddeCs.nmsoegriio,c.noeot,iemnfnevsu,¢midJ.uscgo.tce.foEhd,n4Sr.l1tBioa1fa.Smtpet,ow.guteeorbUspvalo.5eoti1Surattc1.-vlp-.l Nri(F(Csct.eeescaoigeaxhwtAusaSmoiscntuooeltinpls)Huoydi)p;sanm;i.imfisopaBlMcnadcaiPsaun.ilrtehsdlllnissiyf2n,retor9efdiseo7xheymc3asEll4v)sdS(vu8e.uucrspaTMpcheiunr.Floobba.i,eonel,ag.leiSancuA5tipD1Snsiipe8sossse.unPtc',bo.hnF,jio.aten¢oto.ctlf6gSt)o8.7ues,;r65Lpde6.ppATR.aF.Citer,.(oma2ateomdt4axpst7pecrtehabldo9ytuee5p(eas4ldlNnile.dWso.Da(n.C1nuwhsvvc.i.tnifttelArihRlqdTCoooairuanmrc.eal.dehnlilde,spas11audt99bbesee88i3ledrg19l4igu,a-))-3c-rEnSSwlUwusieiteedna.hnpaygfeutgsSe,t1eaii8c.c.tncliaCHia4Hae.tono5.1tlxntit8nR7hhcoi.5ee§lTnycgoeUhulfv.1iRA(adSi4sweccsoevi..0dptefsond0e.reddCD(nseiti1woobchfv7faueN)eeii6srr,oo(oe,drot.l4duHdm)bap4aw,1elha98nea7efsas44strdo8snsh-aer-ioee3nwae7dUcuc3di9m,.gaot2npSenhhp,Ceu."snbgpo"(imdllnoe1dstpaie3eni9godttc0ncse8.dre5at2yend,b)f2rtsAiso.uollcasucltopi3ytt(hitt01Ioyih29n9tooeeo0ao7hfslurfca5Htss(t)ko.Ue1hi)"1nn.vsn9e.9wpieSoy8p7erg.r8sHwe0hyr,C)ootdl,ee,;neumericmpedtdagPithsBge§tu,igeio§esdbihamda.tdolpr4ntC1ldt8oo4[yLt4htgu.dh0bhoerreiye0tfots`U-Nhua.pwo1ehnbgSE.aairio4lh.dssr,nte8uts"ided59coniah]atr.1tgcghoi-aeceuc(2ti3castv13t0eh.lhes9i09dieodny9,lfRsg4'sdsoi)(ttertwgch)geeh8ia2--.-te4nmit0-n27IV. THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE AND MANDATES OF THE ADA ARE WELL WITHIN CONSTITUTIONAL BOUNDS.Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment is an affirmative grant of power to Congress. "It is for Congress in the first instance to `determin[e] whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment,' and its conclusions are entitled to much deference." Kimel, 120 S. Ct. at 644 (quoting City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 520; Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 651 (1966)). In Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. 627 (1999), this Court defined valid efforts to exercise Congress' powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment: "[t]here must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end." Florida Prepaid, 527 US. at 638 (quoting City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519-20). As the Court reiterated in Kimel, Congress' power to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment is not confined to the precise prohibitions contained therein. Kimel, 120 S. Ct. at 644 (citing City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 518); supra in Point II.B.As both the United States Senate and House of Repre-sentatives recognized toward the end of the 1980s, then current laws were "inadequate" to combat "the pervasive problems of discrimination that people with disabilities [were] facing." S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 18 (1989); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 47 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 329. The Senate recognized the need for "omnibus civil rights legislation" for the disabled. S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 19 (1989). Similarly, the House addressed the need for legislation that "will finally set inplace the necessary civil rights protections for people with disabilities." H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 40-(1990),reprinted in 1990 U.S.C-C.A.N. 303, 322.28The remedy Congress crafted in the ADA, which considers the economic benefits and costs of the conduct at issue and which provides clear standards for identifying discrimination, is proportional with and congruent to the invidious and irrational state conduct documented over time and discussed in this brief. The congruence of the remedy is exemplified by the fact that the statute requires only reasonable accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 12111(9) (reasonable accommodation). Although comprehensive in coverage, the ADA also contains a number of other significant limits. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(2) (definition of disability), 12111(10) (undue hardship), 12113 (general defenses and qualification standards). Under the ADA's employment provisions, employers are not required to hire individuals who are not qualified for a particular job or to give preference to applicants with disabilities over equally qualified or more qualified nondisabled applicants. See EEOC Interpretive Guidance, Background, 29 C.ER. § 1630 (1998). There are also outright defenses to a charge of discrimination, including job-related exclusion and business necessity, see 42 U.S.C. § 12113(a), imposition of a threat to the health and safety of others in the work place, see id. § 12113(b), and dangers posed by certain communicable diseases among food service workers. See id. § 12113(d).!° Also, an employer is not required to make an accommodation . that would impose an "undue hardship" on the operation of business. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A). The statute pro-19 Indeed, the ABA's 1989 resolution called for federal legislation that takes into consideration the economic benefits and costs, and provides clear standards for identifying such discrimination, and the ADA more than meets these criteria. The ADA was a measured response, balancing the goal of integration of individuals with disabilities into society with competing state interests such as efficiency in the work force. See Roger C. Hartley, The New Federalism & the ADA: State Sovereign Immunity from Private Suits after Boerne, 24 N.Y.U. Rev. L. & Soc. Change 481 (1998).29gtmoassvyrfloiiilpaddgdepeeenafhrmsitiiafpnioctiflaoitcnonhoacoaylnnitposetaceeolarns"taadusitrinotiefhandtoftse.huinoeectuuohrSnelpiecatheenetyarfvsuaraorc4tdlei2oisvorlofheinotidUfey,tp.;hxS"etop.hfeCiaeten.mnstmdsehapeaefc§l"nitcoshsfc1oeyaa2meicln1rime"l1;afoimnf1ldteia(yacgt;k1thtah0etcei)utaooi(spfntooA,of;n)twtah-elsel(arutlBnehcndea)qhuuc.asmicogrbvoceieoemtornnh-r--e-g ettvareblhthtmieiecmueehdpeagercpussliPid,jadlorotuoeoliominrbnysymeamseamaxebtoubmeowtclieladspeineeenatdplt.dtmohtto.iaoosiyiruetmoSmteithmesoeSnneenp.eetnlettaiajtohhntSocceyialebidacneeed.nio.pdeAnramiticDa§m§dnbict.Adeociodt1ii,1sdeif2ds2§ancfaum§e11tenteena11asr,tis3d21leato.a(en2alnatbt1ca,nlesgm)1cydsa1,(ato,tih(5nhmna5)tenmtsmh)at(aetenh(oAAyredAdw)D)iip.al,eneAetlindmovnoiipeptIvo1nlplfpoi2eneorrd1drdyonum1imeovea2awsirtilr.yicthdtarrehttiecsWmodmtaahaehinsmdenyeatninuoyrhcsaosnaehatttatitbienhrbiedeillttdivambiehhto-eeie-en 6uatroa§ahaf34hgSeSiwlpgitere47ueqa6bnp8oe-uriii2eImi4stvbnt3anare8eeser(td(rse1.vletydaete2te9eih)ri0ere9dam(nut0dypfta9shU1gn0l,eal,p))qotio.tdd.unpiEfhietasaltafhmetmlethtfetmTTpetihpeihhpohe,lcsfeltaAeeluoeioloalvolBelrAytye2ydluArADrm4omyleounDreEeefrllsoAfeMAnnstiyroCsh'nett,mreoesneppamdrtrnalaraemeraaaadDalgleicmiatlcieceiyntoptssecetiitnecprfsiioscotrds&rafissfaalitofiuofllbiPsmraeeron.n4uhiaco0n'enynthtmsiismdaspoenSneyptoieterilsecpiKteaUssoiraohai,rrtnintemylspustKvidseehtdriaouelehieeimnob.boureDtlnseslsrsieAdl,tos.do,aTDtautarnhhhahdEnbqteaeeSbnudiiAtve1oiaelhaee2.tbpvairrAlA0aetretrDsDoy2ofiAtb9hSiBEwosdh.aianyiulesALbdfUny.igCoiif.TsdtAfRivteitS.vDteihri.paleefdaeroptACneiog-nnhoan.d..rrtea-ttI30aTdespgCeonnhetofcroemdeiafoosnpltIepsgnnlure"oprotAoxerrieompcnyDtofoslocieipnsAinsecroaotctp;lnrairratntaopilsdidbsitrsttaoueeot,rnramacepitdtasdoteocemleinrtoeiwnhnlstneettahsgytaoloeyscrlmtuAaiibiphprDttoaaecwoaseAennilosrd.'dtpaemdshlndutciecIirthnotseaaye,nitddbssdnwydtptiiicrhtohdttdeootenehhthersesrehrpsspeeeaoaeofacdstsdrorittci.sarbbasaatyoeotyamtta,nibmeuetIssoitmCtnuc'lenteolocieerndotd'aisrgfniisoarsnaesarflttfstveyetcieoorsariftoresenfunas"qlgtrctbgruiaiooslremeinomnenutiadrnhtgteseaweiironmliutnunitt.eltntgAhaoeesncDbdntolAacstunttenhe.,shht--deeoeeCONCLUSIONThe judgment of the Court Circuit should be affirmed.of Appealsfor theEleventhRespectfully Submitted,MARTHA W.

On remand, the CCA once again found that Moore is not intellectually disabled, adopting a mode of analysis that not only conflicts with prevailing medical standards, but also flouts this Court's decision in Moore I. If permitted to stand, the CCA's decision would undermine the guarantees of Atkins, Hall, and Moore I, and would raise rule of law concerns that only this Court can redress.9I. THE CCA'S DECISION ON REMANDCONFLICTS WITH THIS COURT'S MANDATEIN MOORE I, WHICH PROVIDED CLEARINSTRUCTIONS, BASED ON CLINICALSTANDARDS,FORDETERMININGINTELLECTUAL DISABILITY FOR EIGHTHAMENDMENT PURPOSES.A. This Court Provided The CCA With A Clear Mandate Regarding The Constitutional Standard For Diagnosing Intellectual Disability.This Court's first review of Moore's capital sentence gave the CCA clear instructions on how to reevaluate Moore's sentence on remand. These clear directives were necessary to safeguard the Eighth Amendment's absolute prohibition on the execution of intellectually disabled individuals.This Court explained in Atkins that "[e]xecuting intellectually disabled individuals * * * serves no penological purpose, runs up against a national consensus against the practice, and creates a risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty." Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1048 (citing Atkins, 536 U.S. at 313­320 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). To ensure that Atkins is properly implemented, this Court has stressed that state courts should examine "[t]he medical community's current [intellectual disability] standards." Id. at 1053; see id. at 1048­ 1049. Without clinically based standards, "States [would] have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished," "Atkins could become a10nullity, and the Eighth Amendment's protection of human dignity would not become a reality." Id. at 1053 (quoting Hall, 572 U.S. at 720­721).In Moore I, this Court held that the CCA's intellectual disability standard violated the Eighth Amendment. 5 First, the Court held that the CCA erred by refusing to use a "standard error of measurement" in Moore's IQ tests.6 Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1049­1050. Second, this Court found that the CCA's previous evaluation of Moore's adaptive functioning "deviated from prevailing clinical standards and from the older clinical standards the court claimed to apply." Id. at 1050. As the Court explained, the modern medical community "focuses the adaptive-functioning inquiry on adaptive deficits," as opposed to adaptive strengths. Ibid. (emphasis in original) (citing Am. Ass'n on Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities, Intellectual Disability: Definitions, Classification, and Systems of Supports (11th ed. 2010) (AAIDD­11)). This Court admonished5 In contrast, this Court lauded the state trial court's reliance on current medical criteria to support its conclusion Moore is intellectually disabled, as those sources offer "the best available description of how mental disorders are expressed and can be recognized by trained clinicians." Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1053 (citation omitted).6 This issue is not in dispute in the present appeal. On remand, the CCA found that Moore's IQ test score of 74 fell within the standard error of measurement for intellectual disability and concluded that an analysis of adaptive functioning was therefore required. Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 562 ("Because the score of 74 is within the test's standard error of measurement for intellectual disability (being within five points of 70), we must assess adaptive functioning before arriving at a conclusion regarding whether [Moore] is intellectually disabled.").11the CCA for marginalizing Moore's adaptive deficits by balancing them against his ostensible adaptive "strengths" and purported adaptive improvements while incarcerated ­ considerations discounted by clinicians. Ibid.The Court next turned to the CCA's conclusion that Moore's record of academic failure and his suffering of childhood abuse "detracted from a determination that his intellectual and adaptive deficits were related." Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1051. Again relying on modern medical standards as set forth by the clinical diagnostic manuals, the Court noted that "[t]hose traumatic experiences * * * count in the medical community as `risk factors ' for intellectual disability" and therefore do not "counter the case for a disability determination." Ibid. (emphasis in original) (quoting AAIDD­11, at 59­60). The Court further criticized the CCA for attributing Moore's adaptive deficits to a personality disorder and concluding that such a disorder precludes a finding of intellectual disability. As the Court noted, according to contemporary medical understanding, an intellectual disability and a personality disorder are not mutually exclusive diagnoses. Ibid. (citing Am. Psychological Ass'n Amicus Br. at 19, Moore I, 137 S. Ct. 1039 (No. 15-797)).Finally, this Court addressed the CCA's reliance on the multi-factor framework for intellectual disability that the CCA first employed in Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1. As this Court rightly noted, the Briseno framework "advances lay perceptions of intellectual disability." Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1051 (citing Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 8). It does so by, for example, basing a12finding of intellectual disability on lay stereotypes and perceptions of whether a subject was "mentally retarded" during the developmental stage. Id. at 1051­1052 (citation omitted). The Court deemed the CCA's use of the Briseno framework ­ and its embrace of lay opinion as opposed to informed medical opinion ­ an "outlier," and the Court thoroughly rejected the use of Briseno or anything approaching the antiquated Briseno-like analysis. Ibid. The dissent in Moore I agreed that use of the Briseno factors was an unconstitutional and "unacceptable method of enforcing the guarantee of Atkins " and that the CCA "erred in using [those factors] to analyze [Moore's] adaptive deficits." Id. at 1053 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).This Court's ruling in Moore I affirmed the importance of determining intellectual disability in a way that is "informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework" ­ as well as a categorical rejection of the use of lay stereotypes and perceptions regarding individuals with intellectual disability in capital cases. Id. at 1048 (quoting Hall, 572 U.S. at 721). Although States need not adhere "to everything stated in the latest medical guide," this Court emphasized that "neither does our precedent license disregard of current medical standards." Id. at 1049. This Court therefore made clear that the CCA on remand should not "reject[] * * * medical guidance and cling[] to the standard it laid out in Briseno, including the wholly nonclinical Briseno factors." Id. at 1053.13B. The CCA's Analysis On Remand Is Infected By The Same Risks Of Error And Nonclinical Considerations That Led This Court To Declare The Briseno Framework Unconstitutional.On remand, the CCA flouted this Court's instructions in Moore I by relying on the same nonclinical, constitutionally infirm considerations to conclude again that Moore is not intellectually disabled. Although the CCA's opinion on remand purported to announce a new standard for diagnosing intellectual disability, its analysis, reasoning, and ultimate conclusion show that the CCA failed to faithfully follow this Court's clear mandate in Moore I and instead simply repeated the substance of its Briseno analysis.As Judge Alcala aptly recognized in dissent, the CCA's "majority opinion essentially repeats the same errors as in the original opinion in this case" and "continues to apply a standard that fails to adequately incorporate current medical standards in conflict with the Supreme Court's holding in Moore [I]." Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 585, 590 (Alcala, J., dissenting). The CCA's analysis thus continues to "creat[e] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed" and therefore violates the Eighth Amendment. Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1044 (quoting Hall, 572 U.S. at 704 (brackets in original)).i. The CCA's analysis of intellectual disability continues to impermissibly rely on lay stereotypes.Contrary to this Court's instruction, the CCA once again permitted stereotypes and lay perceptions about14the intellectually disabled to infect its analysis on remand. See Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1051­1052 (observing that the "medical profession has endeavored to counter lay stereotypes of the intellectually disabled," and that judicial endorsement of such stereotypes "should spark skepticism"). As the ABA noted in its amicus brief in Moore I, this method "allows the opinions of those without training to displace those of medical professionals." See ABA Amicus Br. at 11; see also ABA Texas Assessment 396.In both of the CCA's decisions, for instance, the court stressed that before his incarceration, Moore had a menial restaurant job; played pool, dice, and dominoes with his friends; had a girlfriend; demonstrated "some ability to understand money concepts and work"; and could "conceptualize what was being" asked of him at trial and could respond with coherent answers. See Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 564, 569­571; see also Ex parte Moore, 470 S.W.3d 481, 507­508, 522­528 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015) (relying on these same considerations to conclude that Moore is not intellectually disabled before this Court's decision in Moore I). Similarly, the CCA found it significant that, while on death row, Moore had some literary and legal materials in his prison cell; responded to letters from a pen pal "in an emotionally appropriate way"; and was not an "impressionable" follower simply because he refused to sit down with other inmates once, mop the floor once, get a haircut once, and shave twice. Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 570­571 & n.149.Those considerations, however, do not foreclose a clinical diagnosis of intellectual disability. The CCA's15statements rested on the flawed assumption that all intellectually disabled persons are inherently unable to perform routine tasks, form appropriate emotions, stand up for themselves, develop and maintain meaningful relationships, and demonstrate a basic sense of curiosity. Worse still, reliance on such stereotypes runs an intolerable risk of improperly subjecting persons with mild intellectual disability to the death penalty. As this Court held in Moore I, "[m]ild levels of intellectual disability * * * nevertheless remain intellectual disabilities, * * * and States may not execute anyone in the entire category of [intellectually disabled] offenders." 137 S. Ct. at 1051­1052 (emphasis in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 600 (Alcala, J., dissenting) (noting that a "stereotyped view of the intellectually disabled as having to be entirely nonfunctional people has no place in the current medical diagnostic framework"). This Court therefore rejected those stereotypes, as have medical professionals. Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1051­1052.ii. The CCA's analysis continues to overemphasize adaptive strengths.The CCA's analysis on remand further fails to heed this Court's admonition that, because "the medical community focuses the adaptive-functioning inquiry on adaptive deficits," an assessment of intellectual disability must not "overemphasize[]" perceived adaptive strengths. Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1050 (emphasis in original); see also ABA Texas Assessment 396 ("[M]any of the Briseno factors depart from the AAIDD and other clinical definitions by16focusing on a defendant's adaptive strengths rather than his/her limitations."). Among the adaptive strengths the CCA had initially "overemphasized" were that "Moore lived on the streets, mowed lawns, and played pool for money." Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1050. Nevertheless, on remand, the CCA continued to rely on precisely the same adaptive strengths that this Court found irrelevant in Moore I. Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 569, 571 (finding Moore's "practice of playing pool for money," "mowing lawns before he went to prison," and "liv[ing] on the streets for most of his teenage years" were probative of intellectual disability).The CCA's repeated overemphasis of Moore's adaptive strengths reflects the testimony of Dr. Kristi Compton, the State's sole expert, who formed her opinion that Moore is not intellectually disabled by explicitly acknowledging the Briseno framework and by improperly balancing Moore's adaptive strengths against his adaptive deficits. See Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 562­563. Indeed, Dr. Compton opined that she did not believe that Moore is intellectually disabled because he exhibits "indications of adaptive skills." Id. at 563; see also id. at 577 (Alcala, J., dissenting) (noting "Dr. Compton's opinion that [Moore's] adaptive strengths outweighed his adaptive deficits"). The CCA's continued overemphasis of perceived adaptive strengths, as well as its endorsement of Dr. Compton's pre­Moore I opinion, cannot be reconciled with this Court's holding that Moore's perceived strengths were not "adequate to overcome the considerable objective evidence of Moore's adaptive deficits." Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1050.17iii. The CCA fails to focus on typical performance and improperly relies on Moore's "improvements" in behavior while incarcerated.In Moore I, this Court stressed the medical community's caution against "reliance on adaptive strengths developed in * * * prison." Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1050 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As the Court explained, clinical standards counsel against assessing adaptive strengths developed in a controlled setting, such as a prison, and instead require, wherever possible, corroborative information reflecting similar adaptive functioning outside of the prison setting. Ibid. (citing Am. Psychological Ass'n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 38 (5th ed. 2013)). To support its conclusion that Moore is not intellectually disabled, the CCA nevertheless again relied heavily on perceived conceptual improvements that Moore supposedly made while incarcerated. See, e.g., Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 565­568 (examining Moore's mathematical ability by looking to his prison commissary slips over time). As the ABA cautioned in Moore I, this approach contravenes the longstanding clinical recognition that adaptive functioning concerns "the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that have been learned and are performed by people in their everyday lives." ABA Amicus Br. at 14 (emphasis in original) (quoting AAIDD­11, at 43). Yet, despite this Court's admonition, the CCA continued to stress its view that there had been purported advances in Moore's adaptive functioning while he was confined on death row. See, e.g., Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 565­570.18Although the CCA said it "t[ook] into account the controlled nature of the [prison] setting," Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 569, the ostensible evidence of in-prison adaptive improvements on which the CCA relied shows precisely the opposite. For example, the CCA has never accounted for "the excessive amount of time [Moore] has to perform simple, repetitive tasks, and the large degree of uncertainty surrounding the amount of assistance or support he received in accomplishing various tasks." Id. at 601 (Alcala, J., dissenting). These unaccounted-for variables undermine the purported clinical significance of Moore's supposed improvements. Ibid.; see also ABA Texas Assessment 396 ("By focusing on a particular event in the defendant's life, the Briseno factors may diminish other life events that more accurately reflect the defendant's skill."). The CCA's continued reliance on adaptive strengths developed in the prison setting cannot be squared with prevailing clinical standards and contravenes this Court's decision in Moore I.iv. The CCA continues to improperly require Moore to show that his intellectual and adaptive deficits are related.Finally, the CCA continues to demand that Moore satisfy a "relatedness" requirement ­ i.e., that he show that his intellectual and adaptive deficits are related ­ despite this Court's concerns with that requirement in Moore I. Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 560, 569­ 571; see Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1051­1052. As this Court explained, that "relatedness" requirement essentially requires Moore to disprove alternative, potential causes for his adaptive deficits, such as his abusive upbringing, academic failures as a child, or19potential personality disorder. See Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1051­1052.According to clinical standards and as recognized by this Court, Moore's traumatic childhood experiences are in fact "`risk factors ' for intellectual disability," as opposed to proof that he is not intellectually disabled. See Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1051 (emphasis in original) (quoting AAIDD­11, at 59­60). Nor can the possibility that Moore has a personality disorder "counter the case for a disability determination"; to the contrary, the existence of a personality disorder is "not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability" because "[c]oexisting conditions" (so-called comorbidities) are "frequently encountered in intellectually disabled individuals." Ibid. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).Despite this Court's emphasis on these clinical considerations, on remand the CCA explicitly opted to retain the same onerous, nonclinical relatedness requirement. Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 560. Again faulting Moore for failing to show his "deficient social behavior was related to any deficits in general mental abilities," the CCA found that "emotional problems," which Moore first began experiencing as a young child, are "most likely" the cause of such deficiencies. Id. at 569­571. But this reliance on "emotional problems" is simply a disguised name for the childhood "risk factors" and personality disorder on which the CCA previously relied to reject Moore's claim. This Court has already held that neither of those risk factors nor the purported personality disorder outweighs Moore's case for intellectual20disability. Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1051. Moreover, instead of acknowledging that such risk factors may in fact make a finding of intellectual disability more likely, the CCA again perpetuates the nonclinical view that the two cannot exist together. Along with its other flawed standards, as set forth above, the CCA's insistence on satisfaction of the same "relatedness" requirement already rejected by this Court will continue to present the unacceptable risk that individuals with mild intellectual disability will be executed in violation of the Eighth Amendment.C. The CCA's Continued Reliance On The Testimony Of Dr. Compton Confirms That It Has Simply Repeated The Analysis That This Court Rejected.Throughout its decision on remand, the CCA credited and relied on the opinion of Dr. Compton, the State's only expert witness. Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 562­572. Tellingly, Dr. Compton provided her opinion that Moore is not intellectually disabled before this Court's decision in Moore I, and her opinion is based on the now-invalidated Briseno framework. See, e.g., id. at 602­603 (Alcala, J., dissenting). Dr. Compton did not re-evaluate Moore's intellectual disability in light of this Court's rejection of the Briseno framework in Moore I.Nonetheless, on remand, the CCA stressed Dr. Compton's original pre­Moore I testimony and analysis. For example, the CCA emphasized Dr. Compton's opinion that Moore's instant offense demonstrated "a level of planning and forethought," Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 572 -- a nod to the21second and seventh Briseno factors. See Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 8­9 ("Has the person formulated plans and carried them through or is his conduct impulsive?" and "[D]id the commission of that offense require forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose?"). The CCA further emphasized Dr. Compton's comments regarding Moore's ability to "stand up for himself and to influence others," Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 571­572 -- a consideration under the third Briseno factor. See Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 8­9 ("Does his conduct show leadership or does it show that he is led around by others?"). The CCA also highlighted Dr. Compton's testimony that Moore "responded in an emotionally appropriate way in letters" while incarcerated, Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 570 -- a reincarnation of the fourth Briseno factor. See Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 8­9 ("Is his conduct in response to external stimuli rational and appropriate, regardless of whether it is socially acceptable?"). And, reviving the fifth Briseno factor verbatim, the CCA noted that Moore "responded rationally and coherently to questions" posed to him in court. Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d at 564; see Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 8­9 ("Does he respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral or written questions or do his responses wander from subject to subject?").The CCA's continued reliance on an expert opinion that utilized the rejected Briseno framework confirms that its decision on remand has simply reinstated its prior flawed analysis. The CCA's determination therefore violates both established clinical standards and this Court's decision in Moore I.22II. THE CCA'S REFUSAL TO FOLLOW THE HOLDING IN MOORE I RAISES SERIOUS RULE OF LAW CONCERNS THAT CAN BE REMEDIED ONLY BY THIS COURT.Because the CCA's opinion on remand is directly contrary to the decision of this Court in Moore I, this Court should grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and summarily reverse to preserve the legitimacy of its judgments and to underscore the importance of the rule of law. In Moore I, this Court provided clear instructions to the CCA to avoid the constitutional errors that had infected its earlier decision regarding Moore's sentence. The CCA ignored those instructions and reprised precisely the analysis that this Court rejected as contrary to the Eighth Amendment. But the Eighth Amendment prohibition against execution of the intellectually disabled, as articulated and interpreted by this Court, is "binding upon the States and, under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution, it must be obeyed." Sims v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 538, 44 (1967); see Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is."); Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 506, 517­518 (1859).It is axiomatic both that this Court's constitutional decisions are binding on federal and state courts, and that it is not the province of any lower court to overrule or ignore those decisions. See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997) ("[C]ourts of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions." (citation and internal quotation marks23omitted)); United States v. Martinez-Cruz, 736 F.3d 999, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) ("As a lower court in a system of absolute vertical stare decisis headed by one Supreme Court, it is essential that we follow both the words and the music of Supreme Court opinions."). From "its earliest days this Court [has] consistently held that an inferior court has no power or authority to deviate from the mandate issued by an appellate court." Briggs v. Pa. R.R. Co., 334 U.S. 304, 306 (1948) (citing cases). This Court's decisions accordingly "remain binding precedent until [it] see[s] fit to reconsider them." Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236, 252­253 (1998).The CCA's decision below disregards that core rule of law principle. Summary reversal is accordingly the necessary and appropriate relief. This Court has not hesitated to reverse state-court decisions that fail, on remand, to faithfully follow the initial decisions of this Court. See, e.g., Stanton v. Stanton, 429 U.S. 501, 503­504 (1977) (summarily reversing where, on remand, a state supreme court failed to comply with this Court's mandate invalidating a law permitting differential treatment of males and females for childsupport purposes); Gen. Atomic Co. v. Felter, 436 U.S. 493, 496 (1978) (granting relief where the state court, on remand "did precisely what [this Court] held that it lacked the power to do"); Deen v. Hickman, 358 U.S. 57, 57­58 (1958) (per curiam) (granting relief where a state court decision on remand failed to comply with this Court's mandate).If this Court permits the CCA's decision to stand, it would place the CCA's rejection of this Court's decision in Moore I beyond review. Even worse, the24CCA's subversion of Moore I would give license to States simply to ignore this Court's judgments when they disagree with them. Summary reversal is the most appropriate relief when the legitimacy of the Court's judgments and the rule of law are threatened in this manner.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and summarily reverse. Alternatively, the Court should grant the petition and conduct plenary review.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: ILANA H. EISENSTEIN ETHAN H. TOWNSEND BEN C. FABENS-LASSEN PAUL D.

 I. MISCHARACTERIZING WHAT HAS BEEN UNDERSTOOD TO BE OPINION WORK PRODUCT AS FACT WORK PRODUCT WILL CAUSE A DETERIORATION IN THE QUALITY AND SCOPE OF LAWYERCLIENT COUNSELING AT A TIME WHEN THE NEED FOR SUCH ADVICE IS GREATER THAN EVER.Thirty-five years ago this Court observed, "la]n uncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results in widely varying applications by the courts, is little better than no privilege at all." Upjohn v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 393 (1981). Here, the uncertainty created by the approach of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will degrade client representation beyond just the immediate jurisdiction of that Court of Appeals. For this reason, although the decision created a circuit split, its effect is worse than a division in interpretations among the various courts. Rational lawyers and clients will be compelled to act in accordance with the standard of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit because they cannot be sure that construction will not be applied to any work product they generate. This is the same dilemma that led to the warning in Federalist 62 that prudent merchants would not undertake new commerce if they risked their work being declared unlawful. THE FEDERALIST No. 62 (James Madison). In both cases, the resultant stagnation and fear is unhealthy. The law should support the highest level of strategy -- and whatever work product is needed to support it -- not drive lawyers to conform to the lesser standard mandated by the decision of the Court of Appeals.9 Because the work-product doctrine limits the ability of adversaries to discover documents and other tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial, Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3), it of necessity extends beyond work product prepared by lawyers themselves to material prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by the client's "consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent." Id. In that way, the work-product doctrine is distinct from, and both broader and narrower than, the attorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege protects communications between a lawyer and a client, or the agents of either, for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice without regard to whether litigation is anticipated. The work-product doctrine, by contrast, protects investigations conducted and_ reports prepared by lawyers, interviews with third parties and witnesses, consultation with experts, factual and legal research, risk analyses, damage calculations, and many other activities that lawyers must engage in during the course of a representation -- but only when litigation is anticipated.When a party seeks the production of fact work product, the standard -- set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3) -- is more lenient than the standard for opinion work product. Here, however, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit mischaracterized opinion work product as fact and thereby reduced the standard for a class of material necessary to provide wise counsel. While fact work product "may encompass factual material including the result of a factual investigation. .. . opinion work product reveals the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative." In re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated July 6, 2005, 510 F.3d 180, 183 (2d Cir. 2007) Ginternal10 quotations omitted). Courts have recognized (a) that "opinion" work product includes the information needed to form an opinion and (b) that the other party must establish its substantial need for access to the information -- a burden that is higher than a showing of mere relevance or lack of access. See In re Sealed Case, 676 F.2d 793, 811 (D.C. Cir. 1982).A clear statement of this perspective is found in the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in United States v. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194 (2d Cir. 1988). That case rejected a test that would result in "an attorney's assessment of the likely outcome of litigation [being] freely available to his litigation adversary merely because the document was created for a business purpose rather than for litigation assistance." 134 F.3d at 1200.By contrast, in FTC v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 778 F.3d 142 (D.C. Cir. 2015) the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that financial analyses created at the direction of in-house counsel in connection with a settlement were merely fact work product because counsel's requests were "general and routine," were the kind of analysis "anyone familiar with such settlements would expect a competent negotiator to request," and a "lawyer's thoughts related to financial and business decisions are [not] opinion work product when she is simply parroting the thoughts of the business managers." 778 F.3d at 152-53.The ABA asks this Court to grant certiorari to ensure that lawyers understand what analysis they can undertake or request to be undertaken by others without fear that the results will be readily discoverable if they are sued in the District Court for the District of Columbia or in a jurisdiction that11 follows the lead of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit -- a fear that, as discussed above, causes lawyers to proceed as though they will be sued there. If this Court does not hear this case, both the litigation process and the development and presentation of cases to courts will be degraded in the face of an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment.The work-product doctrine is essential to allowing lawyers to analyze and weigh the many competing considerations at play when providing legal advice. As the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit observed:The complete lawyer may well promote and reinforce the legal advice given, weigh it, and lay out its ramifications by explaining: how the advice is feasible and can be implemented; the legal downsides, risks and costs of taking the advice or doing otherwise; what alternatives exist to present measures or the measures advised; what other persons are doing or thinking about the matter; or the collateral benefits, risks, or costs in terms of expense, politics, insurance, commerce, morals, and appearances.Pritchard v. County of Erie (In re County of Erie), 473 F.3d 4138, 420 (2d Cir. 2007).The Model Rules recognize that providing competent representation requires "legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation," ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1, and the comments to the Rule make clear that the "[c]ompetent handling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem." Jd. If clients cannot trust that analysis12 prepared for the possibility of litigation and during the course of litigation will be protected, they will be less likely to seek counsel from their lawyers, which will impair "the valuable efforts of . . . counsel to ensure their client's compliance with the law." Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 392 (discussing the attorney-client privilege).Lawyers do not render legal advice in a vacuum. Rather, they are required to "exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to the law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social and political factors that may be relevant to the client's situation." Model Rule of Professional Conduct 2.1. As the Comments to ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 2.1 explain, "[aldvice couched in narrow legal terms may be of little value to a client, especially where practical considerations, such as cost or effects on other people, are predominant. Purely technical legal advice, therefore, can sometimes be inadequate." In other words, legal advice and representation in only the rarest of occasions are limited to "the law." Factual inquiry and analysis are key to the success of the representation, and those two activities require explanation of a dizzying array of non-law subjects, from business to science to mathematics, and beyond.The ABA has consistently encouraged lawyers toserve their clients uncompromisingly. This Courtshould grant the petition so lawyers need not choosebetween fully-informed and cautious representation oftheir clients.|Even if the only concern here were the inconsistency between decisions of different circuits, this Court should still take this case because of the uncertainty it injects into the relatively straightforward analysis13 under Rule 26(b)(3) that was generally applied, not only by federal courts, but by all but a few states. Elizabeth Thornburg, Rethinking Work Product, 77 VA. L. REV. 1515, 1520-21 (1991). If the rule were to be amended, there would be a clear effective date and advance and widespread notice, important virtues that are absent from ad hoc rulemaking by individual courts of appeals.Il. THIS COURT SHOULD ACCEPT THISCASEANDESTABLISHTHAT"SUBSTANTIAL NEED" MEANS WHAT ITSAYS.Boehringer also created a circuit split regarding the "substantial need" standard that must be met to pierce the work-product protection under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3). According to the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the government, in the investigatory context, may overcome work product protection by showing that "the materials are relevant to the case, the materials have a unique value apart from those already in the movant's possession, and `special circumstances' excuse the movant's failure to obtain the requested materials itself." 778 F.3d at 155-57. The question presented regarding this standard, a standard which fails to require a showing of heightened relevance, would warrant the grant of certiorari even if it stood alone; it will otherwise jeopardize and erode the foundational requirement of substantial need necessary to overcome the protections of the work-product doctrine.Other courts of appeals have encouraged zeal and devotion by setting a high standard for "substantial need." See, e.g., Nevada v. J-M Mfg. Co., 555 F. App'x 782, 785 (10th Cir. 2014) ("A substantial need exists14 where `the information sought is essential to the party's defense, is crucial to the determination of whether the defendant could be held liable for the alleged acts, or carries great probative value on contested issues." (quoting Natl Cong. for Puerto Rican Rights v. City of New York, 194 F.R.D. 105, 110 (S.D.N.Y. 2000))); United Kingdom v. United States, 238 F.3d 1812, 1332 (11th Cir. 2001) (relevant information alone "does not overcome a valid claim of work product privilege"); Belcher v. Bassett Furniture Indus., Inc., 588 F.2d 904, 908 (4th Cir. 1978) (stating that the "substantial need" for discovery of materials prepared in anticipation of litigation requires more than a showing of relevancy).By contrast, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided that "a heightened relevance requirement ... would be misplaced in the investigatory context of an agency subpoena enforcement proceeding." Boehringer, 778 F.3d at 154, 157. This reasoning overlooks the essential nature of an agency's investigation. In that stage, the government seeks information to determine whether to bring criminal charges or a civil enforcement action. This is a critical juncture for all parties to have careful and fully-informed counsel. Indeed, because government subpoenas already provide an investigating agency with almost unfettered access to a witness's information, once a client becomes aware that it might become a target of or party of interest in an investigation, the client often will take additional protective measures. Outside counsel is often consulted; internal investigations are conducted; and information that is garnered from those investigations is analyzed and reports are produced so the clients can evaluate any matters of concern and the corresponding risks.15 Clients undertake these expensive measures because government investigations can lead to criminal prosecutions, civil enforcement actions, class actions, and shareholder derivative actions. To reduce the standard for accessing the analysis generated from marshaled information to no more than a showing of relevance and a desire by the agency to see it obliterates the work-product doctrine. In Boehringer, 778 F.3d at 154, 157, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted access to the information the government subpoenaed simply because it was relevant to the agency's investigation, and because "Boehringer's contemporaneous financial evaluations provide[d] unique information about Boehringer's reasons for settling in the manner that it did." At the same time, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed Boehringer's argument that the FTC could have conducted a similar analysis through documents already in its possession. See id. at 157-58. The only reason for the FTC to seek Boehringer's analysis was to understand the thought processes of the lawyer. If an agency can obtain work product whenever the agency says that it is relevant and unique, then what documents would not satisfy the standard? The approach of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit opens the floodgates for the disclosure of work product based on a greatly reduced showing.Moreover, the Boehringer court's decision has ramifications beyond the initial investigatory stage. The term "government" can apply to any number of litigants -- if there is one "governmental" standard and another "private" standard, in which category is a state agency? A turnpike authority? A local parking16 authority? A state-owned, or state-related university? Amtrak? A relator suing on the government's behalf? And what if that "government" is acting as a market participant or a contractor? Or what if a civil plaintiff asks -- as many do -- for all documents produced to the government?The argument that the government deserves more access than a civil litigant because it is protecting the public is especially troubling in its disregard for the power and vast resources of the government. Given the resources "government" -- in all of its forms -- can bring to bear in litigation, clients involved in such litigation have especial need for fully-informed counsel. But because the standard articulated in Boehringer weakens protection of work product when "government" asks questions, lawyers will think twice about conducting the analysis and research needed to provide competent, complete, and _ well-informed advice to a client at the very time the client most needs it, another instance when fully-informed representation will be threatened by the caution that this decision necessarily engenders.Just as blurring the line between opinion and fact threatens zeal and devotion, so does weakening the showing of need that the government must make. Granting certiorari will allow the Court to provide guidance on (a) the proper definition of substantial need, (b) the proper balance between cautious and fully-informed representation, and (c) the fact that all litigants must be subject to the same standards when seeking to invade another's work product.17 CONCLUSIONFor all of the foregoing reasons, the petition for writ of certiorari should be granted.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:|LAWRENCE J. FOXJED.AMMIAELLYSICITJ..A WBHIRILOCLAKICOAHKMSON IIPAULETTE BROWNAMECoRuInCsAeNlof Record BAR ASSOCIATION(3C31h12i9c)aNgoo9r,8t8h-I5l0lCi0ln0aorisk 6S0tr6e5e4t-7598abapresident@americanbar.org
I. Giving effect to the ICJ's authoritative interpretation of Article 36 in LaGrand and Avena in the context of state habeas proceedings is necessary to ensure compliance with the guarantee of consular access to which the United States committed by ratifying the Vienna Convention.By ratifying the Vienna Convention, the United States committed to the consular notification and access provisions of Article 36. The United States Department of State, realizing the importance of ensuring reciprocal compliance by other nations, recently confirmed the Executive Branch's commitment to securing the rights created by Article 36. See United States Department of State, Announcement: All Consular Notification Requirements Remain in Effect, available at http://travel.state. gov/news/news_2155.html ("The U.S. is fully committed to compliance with our international legal obligations under the [Vienna Convention], and actively works to improve compliance nationally."). Nevertheless, effective notification for detained foreign nationals of their Article 36 rights remains stubbornly elusive.5 For several reasons, this disparity between our5. Studies of consular notification practices have found that in capital cases, law enforcement officials complied with the requirement of Article 36 in less than five percent of cases. See Mark Warren, Human Rights Research, Foreign Nationals and the Death Penalty in the United States (May 28, 2005), http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did= 198&scid=31 (finding that notification occurred in 7 out of 160 capital cases). In non-capital cases, performance has been even more dismal-- notification took place in four cases out of an estimated 53,000 cases in New York City during 1997. Id.10international treaty obligations and the ineffectiveness of law enforcement officials in carrying out those legal commitments demands that this Court implement the ICJ's decisions in Avena and LaGrand by prohibiting state courts from applying procedural default rules to block Vienna Convention claims.First, the ICJ's decisions provide remedies for the failure to inform detained foreign nationals of their consular rights. Without these remedies, local law enforcement officials can ignore the international legal obligations of the United States without consequence. But see Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 (1803) ("The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. It will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right."). The requirement of notifying foreign nationals of their consular notification rights places a bureaucratic burden, albeit a slight one, on local law enforcement officials. These officials will continue to avoid this burden unless there are ramifications for failing to provide appropriate notice.Second, as this Court noted in Medellin v. Dretke, 125 S. Ct. 2088 (2005) (per curiam opinion accompanying order dismissing writ as improvidently granted), there are some potential problems with reconciling the ruling of the ICJ in Avena with the limitations AEDPA places on federal habeas proceedings. For example, the Court discussed in Medellin the possibility that a violation of consular access provisions is a "nonconstitutional lapse[] we have held not cognizable in a [federal] postconviction proceeding." Id. at 2090 (quoting Reed v. Farley, 512 U.S. 339 (1994)). The Court also noted that the non-constitutional nature of the treaty violation might impede the grant of a certificate of appealability, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c). Id. at 2091. The Court also suggested11that a federal habeas petitioner might encounter obstacles to showing that a violation of Article 36 is the type of "new rule" that can overcome the substantial showing articulated in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989).6 Medellin, 125 S. Ct. at 2091. While there are reasons to believe that a criminal defendant could overcome these obstacles, it would demand substantial effort and would present many difficult legal questions to attempt to fit Article 36 claims into federal habeas proceedings in the first instance. Id. (explaining potential difficulties with reconciling the Avena Judgment with the demands of federal law).The structural source of these difficulties is the "full parity" between treaties and federal statutes. Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 18 (1957) (plurality opinion). These types of laws have the same status under Art. VI of the Constitution-- they are both the "supreme Law of the Land." Reconciling countervailing commands from coequal sources of law can give rise to vexing problems of interpretation. See, e.g., United States v. Dion, 476 U.S. 734, 738-40 (1986) (discussing the wide variation in standards used to determine whether a statute conflicts with a treaty).This problem vanishes when a treaty and state law contain conflicting commands--the treaty trumps state law. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 212 (1962) ("Though a court will not undertake to construe a treaty in a manner inconsistent with a subsequent federal statute, no similar hesitancy obtains if the asserted clash is with state law.").6. There are two reasons to believe that Teague does not present any barriers to petitioner's case, which comes to this Court on direct review of state habeas proceedings. First, Teague is a rule of federal habeas review and this Court has never applied Teague to state habeas review. See Reply Br. of Pet'r at 3-6 (citing cases). Second, the respondent raised the Teague argument for the first time in its petition for certiorari, so it is accordingly waived. Id. at 6-7.12The Constitution imposes a clear, independent obligation on states to enforce federal law in their own courts absent an express exemption from Congress. See Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 469-70 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring) ("[T]he laws of the United States are laws in the several States, and just as much binding on the citizens and courts thereof as the State laws are. . . . The two together form one system of jurisprudence, which constitutes the law of the land for the State.") (quoting Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U.S. 130, 136-37 (1876)). Accordingly, states must recognize and implement treaties even if they are inconsistent with the laws of a state. United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 230-31 (1942) ("[S]tate law must yield when it is inconsistent with, or impairs . . . the superior Federal policy evidenced by a treaty or international compact or agreement.").Given the potential difficulties with using federal habeas proceedings to give effect to Vienna Convention rights and the cleaner option of delegating enforcement to state courts, this Court should ensure the availability of the remedies on state habeas for detained foreign nationals. Otherwise, the United States will continue to be out of compliance with the Vienna Convention. This would attenuate the reciprocal guarantee of consular notification rights and would endanger Americans detained abroad. As this Court has observed: "One of the most important and delicate of all international relationships, recognized immemorially as a responsibility of government, has to do with the protection of the . . . rights of a country's own nationals when those nationals are in another country." Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 64 (1941). The framers of the Vienna Convention designed the treaty to enable countries to help their own nationals when those nationals are abroad, in part by agreeing to allow other countries to take similar steps where their citizens are concerned. If the United States fails to meet its mutual13obligations under the Vienna Convention as they have been interpreted by the ICJ, it risks losing its ability to insist that other countries abide by their obligations to respect the consular rights of American citizens on their soil.The United States routinely demands that it receive notice when its citizens are detained by foreign authorities. The State Department in fact requires consular officials to lodge a protest if detaining authorities do not notify the consul within 72 hours. See 7 Foreign Affairs Manual § 426.2-1 (2004), available at http://foia.state.gov/masterdocs/07fam/07m0420.pdf. The United States cannot expect other countries to respect its citizens' consular rights, however, if the United States does not honor the reciprocal rights of those countries and their citizens in the face of state procedural impediments.II. The ICJ's authoritative interpretations of Article 36 in LaGrand and Avena should endure beyond the postjudgment decision to withdraw from the Optional Protocol.The Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention originated as a proposal by the United States to ensure faithful and consistent application of the Convention's protections. See Report of the United States Delegation to the Vienna Conference on Consular Relations, reprinted in Sen. Exec. E, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., May 8, 1969, at 72-73. The Optional Protocol gives the ICJ compulsory jurisdiction over all signatory nations to resolve disputes over the interpretation of the Vienna Convention. The United States Senate ratified the Vienna Convention and the Optional Protocol in 1969.The United States has relied upon the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ to protect its own citizens overseas. In fact, the United States was the first country to invoke the Optional Protocol, which it used to bring an application against Iran concerning U.S. diplomatic and consular personnel who were held hostage in 1979. United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (U.S. v. Iran), 197914I.C.J. 7 (Dec. 15), 1980 I.C.J. 3 (May 24). In bringing that application, the United States relied on the Optional Protocol's establishment of the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Vienna Convention. When the ICJ ruled in favor of the United States provisionally in 1979 and then finally in 1980, 1979 I.C.J. 7, 1980 I.C.J. 3, the United States insisted that Iran was bound to comply with the court's judgment.On March 7, 2005, President Bush issued a letter through the Secretary of State to the UN Secretary General purporting to withdraw from the Optional Protocol.7 See Letter from Condoleeza Rice, U.S. Sec'y of State, to Kofi Annan, United Nations Sec'y General. Even assuming that letter effected a withdrawal, the withdrawal does not obligate this Court to refrain from implementing the interpretations of Article 36 issued by the ICJ prior to the withdrawal.A. The decisions of the ICJ issued prior to the withdrawal from the Optional Protocol continue to define the United States' obligations under the Vienna Convention.When the United States signed the Optional Protocol, it promised to submit disputes over the meaning of Vienna Convention obligations to the ICJ and to treat the ICJ's rulings as binding. The United States then further submitted to the ICJ's jurisdiction by actively participating in the proceedings before the ICJ in Avena. See Pet. for Cert. at 6, Medellin v. Dretke, 125 S. Ct. 2088 (2005) (describing the7. It is an open question whether the President can withdraw from a treaty without the consent of the Senate. See Goldwater v. Carter, 444 U.S. 996, 999 (1979) (noting that there is no Constitutional provision that commits the authority to terminate treaties to the President) (Powell, J., concurring). Given that the Senate ratified the Optional Protocol, it is not clear whether Secretary Rice's letter has any legal effect. This question, however, is beyond the scope of this brief.1518-person United States team at the hearing before the ICJ in Avena, which was led by the Honorable William Howard Taft IV, Legal Advisor to the State Department, and which included lawyers from the Departments of State and Justice); see also Br. for Pet'r at 9, Medellin v. Dretke, 125 S. Ct. 2088 (2005) (noting that the United States filed a 219-page Counter-Memorial and 2500-page Annex of written testimony and documentary evidence with the ICJ in Avena).8 The United States must therefore be bound by the ICJ's interpretations of the Vienna Convention in Avena for as long as the United States continues to be a signatory to and so to be bound by the Vienna Convention.Withdrawal by the United States from the ICJ's jurisdiction over future disputes does not affect its obligation to implement ICJ rulings, such as LaGrand and Avena, that were issued when the United States was subject to the ICJ's jurisdiction.9 In Avena, the ICJ understood that it was issuing8. The substantial effort put forth to argue the merits in LaGrand and Avena differs starkly from the United States' actions in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), 1986 I.C.J. 14 (June 27), in which the United States did not recognize the subject matter jurisdiction of the ICJ. In that case, the United States took measures to avoid ultimately being deemed subject to any ICJ judgment, including refusing to participate at all in the proceedings before the ICJ. If the United States wished to revoke the ICJ`s authority to provide a binding interpretation of the Vienna Convention, then it could have attempted to avail itself of similar measures.9. The United States has attempted to argue that the doctrine of nonmutual collateral estoppel will not apply to future Article 36 litigation between parties that were not part of the Avena proceedings. See Br. for the United States as amicus curiae in Medellin v. Dretke at 47 (citing United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154 (1984)). However, the primary reason for the narrow ruling in Mendoza limiting the domestic use of nonmutual collateral estoppel against the government was the barrier it would create to the development(Cont'd)16a binding interpretation of the Vienna Convention that would provide prospective guidance for the United States. As the ICJ explained:[T]he Court has been addressing the issues of principle raised in the course of the present proceedings from the viewpoint of the general application of the Vienna Convention . . . . In other words, the fact that in this case the Court's ruling has concerned only Mexican nationals cannot be taken to imply that the conclusions reached by it in the present Judgment do not apply to other foreign nationals finding themselves in similar situations in the United States.Avena, ¶ 151. The United States, when it accepted the jurisdiction of the ICJ, committed to enforce "the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation" specified by the ICJ. Declaration by the President of the United States of America August 14, 1946 respecting recognition by the United States of America of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, 61 Stat. 128 (1946). The remedy issued in this case specifically includes a requirement that United States courts adapt their procedures to ensure that claims arising under the Vienna Convention be heard on the merits. Thus, regardless of whether the ICJ's jurisdiction over the United States' interpretation of the Vienna Convention may be limited in the future, that does not alter the United States'(Cont'd) of circuit splits for the Supreme Court to resolve. Mendoza, 464 U.S. at 160-61. That concern is not present here because the ICJ is a single tribunal--this feature has allowed the United States to carefully develop and argue its views in discrete cases before the ICJ. It would be tremendously wasteful not to accord comity or some estoppel value to ICJ decisions because, without these checks on litigation, the ICJ would have to issue an unending stream of nearly identical judgments on the interpretation of Article 36.17present and continuing obligation to implement the prospective reparation the ICJ specified in all cases where jurisdiction was proper.Examples from American and international contexts confirm the principle that binding legal interpretations endure beyond a subsequent elimination of jurisdiction. In domestic courts, this question arises when a federal circuit court is divided so that certain states are no longer within the jurisdiction of the appellate court that previously governed them. See, e.g., Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-452, 94 Stat. 1994 (creating the new Eleventh Circuit from States that were formerly part of the Fifth Circuit). When this occurs, the new circuit remains bound by precedents established by the former circuit before the new circuit was formed. See Bonner v. City of Pritchard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209-11 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). The rationale for this rule is straightforward--at the time the former circuit ruled, it had jurisdiction over the states in the new circuit. Other common law countries have applied similar reasoning when confronted with analogous questions. For example, when the Free Republic of Ireland ratified its constitution in 1922, the new legal apparatus had jurisdiction to create binding Irish law. However, Irish courts continued to be bound by pre-1922 decisions of the House of Lords because, at the time of those decisions, the House of Lords had jurisdiction over Ireland. See Corway v. Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Limited, [1999] 4 I.R. 484, ¶¶ 26-29 (explaining the operation of pre-1922 law in Ireland).These principles apply to the withdrawal from the Optional Protocol--at the time the ICJ ruled on the interpretation of Article 36, the United States had submitted to the compulsory jurisdiction. Accordingly, the ICJ's ruling that the United States must accord "review and reconsideration" to those foreign nationals who were denied a hearing on their Article 36 claims continues to be a binding18interpretation of the United States' obligations under the Vienna Convention.If the United States could eliminate any obligation to abide by the ICJ's interpretation of the Vienna Convention in Avena by withdrawing from the Optional Protocol, merely because the United States disagreed with the ICJ's ruling, treaty promises such as that the United States made when it signed the Optional Protocol would be meaningless. Allowing the United States to do so would severely undermine the rule of law internationally.B. At a minimum, Avena Controls this case because the withdrawal from the Optional Protocol does not have retroactive effect.Determining the precise operation of the ICJ rulings in the future, however, is not necessary to resolve the claims of criminal defendants like Mr. Bustillo. Even if the Court wishes to defer resolving the question of whether the ICJ's judgment in Avena is prospectively binding, the withdrawal from the Optional Protocol could not affect Mr. Bustillo's sentence because at the time of the failure to notify him of his Article 36 rights, the United States was a party to both the Vienna Convention and the Optional Protocol. It is an elementary legal principle that, if there is jurisdiction over a person or subject at the time of a transgression, a court has jurisdiction to resolve any disputes arising out of that transgression even if there is no longer jurisdiction over the person or subject. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws § 35(2) (1971), comment d (explaining that if jurisdiction over a foreign corporation existed at the time of a transgression a subsequent withdrawal from the state by a corporation does not affect jurisdiction over the transgression). It follows from this principle that the presence of ICJ jurisdiction at the time of the violation is sufficient to give force to an ICJ judgment that bears on the failure to provide consular notification. See Vienna Convention on the19Law of Treaties, Article 70(1)(b) ("Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwise agree, the termination of a treaty . . . does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination.");10 see also Society for the Propagation of Gospel in Foreign Parts v. Town of New Haven, 21 U.S. 464, 493 (1823) ("If [a right] be . . . secured under a treaty, it would be most mischievous to admit, that the extinguishment of the treaty extinguished the right.").Before any Virginia court denied the petitioner's state habeas petition, on June 27, 2001, the ICJ decided in LaGrand that procedural bars to Vienna Convention claims were not appropriate. See LaGrand, ¶ 125. The ICJ repeated this holding in Avena on March 31, 2004, before the Fairfax County Circuit Court or the Supreme Court of Virginia had entered final orders on the petitioner's state habeas petition. See Avena, ¶ 122. Thus, at the time the decision below was entered, there were two binding ICJ judgments that were in direct conflict with the Supreme Court of Virginia's decision.The Virginia Supreme Court violated federal law and treaty obligations in its unpublished decision, which failed to even mention the authoritative interpretation of the Vienna Convention. To allow withdrawal from the Optional Protocol to retroactively excuse such disregard of the "supreme Law of Land," would undermine the stable and consistent application of the decisions of international tribunals. Given the striking similarity of petitioner's claim to the claims at issue in Avena and LaGrand, there is no way to distinguish petitioner's claim in a manner that would justify Virginia's10. The United States has signed, but not ratified, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Nevertheless, federal courts have used this treaty as guide when there is no other legal authority to guide interpretation. See, e.g., Ehrlich v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 360 F.3d 366, 373 n.5 (2d Cir. 2004); United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 95 (2d Cir. 2003) (compiling examples).20use of a procedural bar. To excuse the Supreme Court of Virginia's refusal to adhere to the ICJ's authoritative interpretation on the basis of a later withdrawal of jurisdiction would erode our domestic and international commitment to the rule of law.C. This Court has expressed a willingness to defer to the expertise of the ICJ.This Court's per curiam opinion in Breard v. Greene, 523 U.S. 371 (1998), appropriately expressed a readiness to give comity to ICJ interpretations. In Breard, the Court rejected the argument that the Vienna Convention trumps the procedural default doctrine, an argument made by Petitioner Breard in a petition for an original writ of habeas corpus on the eve of his execution. Id. at 375. The Court expressed the view that, at that time, the procedural default doctrine was not inconsistent with the Vienna Convention. Id. The Court explained that it would have "give[n] respectful consideration to the interpretation of an international treaty rendered by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret such" if there were such an interpretation. Id. But "absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State." Id. The ICJ has since provided precisely such "a clear and express statement to the contrary." Id. at 371. See Avena, ¶ 113. This subsequent authoritative interpretation of the Convention by the ICJ eliminates the primary rationale upon which the Breard decision was based.Accordingly, even if the withdrawal from the Optional Protocol effectively eliminates compulsory jurisdiction for the ICJ, this Court should extend comity to the ICJ's interpretations of Article 36 in LaGrand and Avena. The ICJ's sole function is the interpretation of treaties and other agreements between states. See Statute of the International Court of Justice, June 26, 1945, art. 36, 59 Stat. 105521(confining the jurisdiction of the court to matters included in the United Nations Charter or treaties, cases where states consent to jurisdiction to resolve disputes over interpretations of treaties, and other questions of international law). The careful and deliberative approach of the ICJ's fifteen judges, who decide only a handful of cases every year and draw upon their knowledge and experience as persons familiar with application of multilateral treaties in numerous fora, justifies deference to the ICJ's efforts to facilitate the uniform interpretation and implementation of treaties throughout signatory nations. See Robert Y. Jennings, The International Court of Justice After Fifty Years, 89 AM. J. INT'L L. 493, 497 (1995); see also Antonin Scalia, Foreign Legal Authority in the Federal Courts, 98 AM. SOC'Y INT'L L. PROC. 305, 305 (2004) ("[t]he whole object of [a] treaty . . . is to establish a single, agreed-upon regime governing the actions of all the signatories. . . ."). Treating LaGrand and Avena as authoritative interpretations of the Vienna Convention would comport with this Court's previous practice of using ICJ judgments as definitive statements of the meaning of international agreements. See United States v. Maine, 475 U.S. 89, 99 (1986); United States v. Louisiana, 470 U.S. 93, 110 (1985) (citing Fisheries Case (U.K. v. Norway), 1951 I.C.J. 116 (Dec. 18), as an authoritative interpretation in a maritime boundary dispute).III. State habeas provides an appropriate forum for giving effect to the ICJ's ruling that the use of procedural bars to dispose of consular notification claims violates the Vienna Convention.Given the potential difficulties with federal habeas proceedings as a forum for "review and reconsideration" of Article 36 claims, state habeas proceedings provide a natural alternative for ensuring that the United States meets its treaty obligations. Indeed, the President has already recognized the unique suitability of state collateral proceedings to22implement the ICJ's interpretation of the Vienna Convention. See discussion infra pp. 26-27. This Court should, like the Executive Branch, determine that the vital international interests at stake in our implementation of Article 36 far outweigh the minimal burden created by a restriction on the use of procedural bar rules to dispose of consular notification defects. See Br. for the United States as amicus curiae in Medellin v. Dretke at 41-43; see also discussion infra pp. 27-28.A. The balance of interests underlying procedural default rules weighs against their application when treaty rights are at stake.State procedural default rules are typically judge-made rules that endeavor to balance the need for administrative efficiency with the substantive rights of criminal defendants. Given the longstanding practices underlying the purpose of the procedural default doctrine, state and federal courts are often reticent to create exceptions on a case by case basis. However, when rights secured by the Vienna Convention bump up against procedural rules, the balance of policy interests is significantly different than it is when just the individual defendant's substantive rights are at stake. When a state arrests or prosecutes a citizen of a country that is a signatory to the Vienna Convention and fails to comply with the Convention's requirements, that failure violates not only the defendant's rights, but also the rights of the defendant's home country. See, e.g., LaGrand Case (F.R.G. v. U.S.), 2001 I.C.J. 466 (June 27) ("LaGrand") ¶ 74 ("[W]hen the sending State is unaware of the detention of its nationals due to the failure of the receiving State to provide the requisite consular notification without delay, . . . the sending State has been prevented for all practical purposes from exercising its rights under Article 36."); Avena, ¶ 102 (describing the United States as precluding Mexico "from exercising its right" under one provision of the Convention). Those rights include the23rights "to visit a national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation." Vienna Convention, art. 36 ¶ 1(c).When a state fails to honor a treaty-partner's Vienna Convention rights, the federal government must deal with the consequences. The resulting tensions in international relations can be substantial. See, e.g., Brian Knowlton, Execution Pits Mexico Against U.S. ­ Fox Echoes World On Death Penalty, INT'L HERALD TRIB., Aug. 16, 2002, at 1 (reporting that Mexican President Vicente Fox canceled a trip to visit President George W. Bush's Texas ranch to protest Texas's execution of a Mexican national who had not been told of his Vienna Convention rights). The inability of other nations to bring prosecutions before the ICJ as a result of the United States' withdrawal from the Optional Protocol will only exacerbate these tensions if domestic courts are unable to implement the remedies specified in the LaGrand and Avena judgments.The impact on international relations distinguishes Vienna Convention rights from most other rights that have been subjected to procedural default rules. Generally, if an American defendant violates a state procedural rule in attempting to assert an individual right, only that individual's rights are affected. In such situations, this Court has determined that the need for judicial efficiency generally requires that any claim to that right be considered procedurally defaulted. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90-91 (1977). The balance of interests tips much more heavily toward the enforcement of the substantive right, however, when the right at issue belongs not just to the defendant, but also to his home country. Indeed, it would intrude on the federal government's constitutionally protected, exclusive, and paramount right to maintain international relations if individual states could freely enforce procedural default24doctrines in a manner that deprives a sovereign treaty-partner ­ which was never informed of the arrest and detention of one of its citizens ­ of commitments made to it by the United States. Indeed, in this case, Virginia would place the entire scope of a treaty-partner's sovereign rights in the hands of an individual attorney, who, through ignorance or mistake alone, could "waive" international obligations to those treaty partners.The fact that the ICJ has issued the Avena Judgment also affects the policy considerations that necessarily bear on the question of whether some Vienna Convention claims should be exempt from the procedural default doctrines. The foreign relations stakes, and thus the national interest in the relationship between the Vienna Convention and the procedural default doctrines, are quite high. They are, in fact, dramatically higher now that the ICJ has issued the Avena Judgment, which requires reconsideration of otherwise defaulted Article 36 claims, than they were at the time this Court considered the effect of the Vienna Convention on federal procedural default rules in Breard. See Breard, 523 U.S. at 375 (noting the lack of any international court ruling at the time). The implications of such a decision for international relations are grave and are entirely different now than they were at the time Breard was before the Court.B. State collateral proceedings are an appropriate forum for resolving the unique problems presented by consular notification defects.Consular notification claims are ill-suited to direct review. In almost all cases on direct review, procedural rules confine the evidentiary record to information presented at the trial level. This feature of criminal proceedings imposes a barrier for the adequate and effective review of consular notification claims on direct appellate review. Documenting the occurrence and effect of consular notification is an intensive evidentiary task--counsel must: establish that25consular notification did not take place, obtain documentation from consular officials attesting to the assistance they could have provided, and develop evidence to demonstrate the effect of consular assistance. If this evidence is not in the trial record, appellate courts will be hesitant, and perhaps ill-equipped, to address consular notification claims effectively.This Court has recognized that when claims are not suited to direct review, courts may not use procedural bars to resolve those claims on collateral review. In Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500 (2003), this Court refused to allow the use of procedural bars for ineffective assistance claims on collateral review even if the criminal defendant could have brought the claim on direct review. The Court explained that it would be problematic to require criminal defendants to bring ineffective assistance claims on direct review because "evidence introduced at trial, . . . will be devoted to issues of guilt or innocence, and the resulting record in many cases will not disclose the facts necessary [to determine whether counsel has been ineffective]." Id. at 505. In contrast, collateral proceedings provide a criminal with "a full opportunity to prove facts establishing ineffectiveness of counsel, the government has a full opportunity to present evidence to the contrary, the district court hears spoken words we can see only in print and sees expressions we will never see, and a factual record bearing precisely on the issue is created." Id. at 505-06 (quoting United States v. Griffin, 699 F.2d 1102, 1109 (11th Cir. 1983)).Like ineffective assistance of counsel, the failure to provide the right to consular notification can taint criminal trials in ways that are not apparent from the trial record itself. For example, that record will not reflect the evidence that would have been obtained through factual investigation that the consulate has had no opportunity to conduct. As in this case, such evidence could include information about26witnesses or suspects who returned to the defendant's home country, information to which the consulate would have had ready access. The trial record will also likely fail to reflect any failure by the defendant to assist his attorney in his defense that may have resulted from the defendant's lack of understanding of the American justice system, a lack of understanding that the consulate could have helped ameliorate.C. The President has determined that state collateral proceedings are well-suited for implementing the Avena Judgment.The Executive Branch has itself recognized that state collateral proceedings are the appropriate forum to remedy consular notification defects. Indeed, the President has made the policy judgment that Texas courts should extend comity to the ICJ's decision in Avena by prohibiting the use of state procedural default rules to block Vienna Convention claims. See Br. for the United States as amicus curiae in Medellin v. Dretke at 41-43 ("To the extent that state procedural default rules would prevent giving effect to the . . . Avena decision . . . those rules must give way."). Id. at 43. The President highlighted the unique "suitability of judicial review as a means of compliance" with the Avena decision. Id. at 41. Thus, there is no conflict between the conclusion that the Supremacy Clause compels state courts to lift their procedural bars to accommodate our federal obligations under the Vienna Convention and the President's desired means for implementing Avena.That the President has attempted to limit state courts' implementation of Avena to the individual cases directly considered by the ICJ in Avena has no significance. While the President has "a degree of independent authority to act" in "foreign affairs," American Ins. Ass'n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 414 (2003), this authority does not permit the Executive to pick and choose the relevant legal rules based27on the identity of a domestic criminal defendant. Contrast Br. for the United States as amicus curiae in Medellin v. Dretke at 48-49 (expressing the desire to retain Executive prerogative over which criminal defendants will benefit from the Avena Judgment). The application of law in an individual case is at the heart of the judicial power. To allow the President to exercise this authority (or to allow the Executive to employ the legislative power to determine the jurisdiction of the courts), would violate the first principles of separation of powers. As this Court explained in United States v. Nixon:[The] judicial Power . . . can no more be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief Executive, for example, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the Congress share with the Judiciary the power to override a Presidential veto. Any other conclusion would be contrary to the basic concept of separation of powers and the checks and balances that flow from the scheme of a tripartite government.418 U.S. 683, 704 (1974).D. Easing restrictions on the use of procedural bars in collateral proceedings would not place a significant burden on state courts.Providing the circumscribed relief from state procedural bar rules required under the Vienna Convention would not open the floodgates to Article 36 claims on state habeas for at least two reasons. First, the existence of limited relief for foreign nationals detained in violation of the Vienna Convention would, at long last, provide an incentive for law enforcement officials to develop systematic methods to inform detainees of their right to consular notification. The development of a standardized means to convey the required information to detainees would prevent Article 36 violations from occurring in the first instance. A state's effective elimination of Article 36 violations would be an appropriate prophylactic means of avoiding federal limits on its procedural bar rules.28Second, as the ICJ directed in Avena, criminal defendants who receive relief from procedural bar rules on review and reconsideration will have to demonstrate that "the violation of Article 36 committed by the competent authorities caused actual prejudice to the defendant in the process of administration of criminal justice." Avena, ¶ 121. This Court has also suggested that to obtain relief from the failure to supply consular notification a criminal defendant would have to show that the "[Article 36] violation had an effect on the trial." Breard, 523 U.S. at 377 (citing Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279 (1991)). Indeed, this Court based its refusal to provide relief to Mr. Breard, in part, on the grounds that "no . . . showing [of prejudice] could even arguably be made." Id.Not all foreign detainees will be able to demonstrate at the state habeas phase that an Article 36 violation prejudiced their trial. In these cases, the burden placed on state courts will be minimal because it will not be necessary to order a new trial or a new sentencing hearing. The sole restriction the Vienna Convention places on state courts is that they may not "interpose procedural default to prevent review and reconsideration." Br. for the United States as amicus curiae in Medellin v. Dretke at 48. Accordingly, any concerns that a limited restriction on the use of procedural bar rules in state collateral proceedings would pose anything beyond a minimal obligation are misplaced.Nevertheless, there are criminal defendants, like Mr. Bustillo, who can demonstrate that the failure of law enforcement authorities to provide the notification required by the Vienna Convention made a material difference to the outcome of their trial. As this Court has long held, the ability of the treaty power to alter the operation of state law in state courts goes beyond the ability of federal legislation to do so. See Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 433 (1920) ("It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency29for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could. . . ."). Accordingly, in cases where criminal defendants have a right under the ICJ's binding interpretation of Article 36 to review and reconsideration of their sentences, the ABA respectfully submits that states may not use procedural bars to evade our federal obligation to provide relief.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above the ABA respectfully submits that the Court should reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:JEFFREY L.

Petitioners in this action seek a judicial forum in which to challenge the validity of a: Board of Immigration Appeals ("BIA") removal order. A companion case, INS v. St. Cyr, presents the type of claim' Petitioners intend to raise: whether Petitioners are entitled to consideration by the Attorney General for discretionary relief from removal under former INA section 212(c)." In Petitioners' case, the Second Circuit determined: that, although Petitioners were not entitled to direct review in the Court of Appeals of the BIA's removal orders, they. were entitled to examination of those orders on habeas petition in the district court. The court relied upon and applied Judge Calabresi's careful opinion in Henderson v. INS, 157 F.3d 106 (2d Cir. 1998), cert. denied sub nom. Reno vy: Navas, 526.U.S. 1004 (1999), which had reached a similar conclusion. under the transitional rules of IIRIRA § 309(c) (4).This case raises important questions of constitutional law, and has. significant consequences both for ensuring the integrity of this Court's long-standing jurisprudence in the area of habeas inquiry, and for protecting the rights of hundreds of individuals who each year would otherwise be removed from the United States because of legal errors committed by Executive Branch officials. As James Madison recognized, banishing a long-term permanent resident such as these Petitioners "from a country into which he has been invited . .. where he may have formed the most2In St. Cyr, the Second Circuit affirmed a district court determination that the replacement of INA section 212(c) by cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) does not apply retrospectively.4tender of connections, where he may. have. vested his entire property". is among the most severe actions that the executive may take against an individual. See Madison's Report on the Virginia Resolutions (1800) (noting that it is "difficult to imagine a doom" greater than this)." The Great Writ of Habeas Corpus, guaranteed by the Constitution, provides a crucial safeguard against unlawful exercises of this grave power. Indeed, over the past decdde, judicial inquiry has spared hundreds of people from being wrongfully removed from this country.

Yearbook (1999), Table 74.In this brief, Amicus will confine itself to the jurisdic-tional issue raised by the Government: whether a judicialforum remains available for Petitioners' claims challengingan order of removal under the INA as permanentlyamended by IIRIRA. As Amicus will argue-- and as theFirst, Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits have found -- thefederal courts do retain their historical authority to resolvePetitioners' statutory challenges to the lawfulness of theirfinal removal orders.:As set forth below, the Court should affirm the decisionthat Congress has not suspended the right of. aliens in habeas corpus proceedings to challenge in federal court the legality of executive removal orders against statutory claims such as. those brought by Petitioners.3Reprinted in 4 Debates, Resolutions and Other: Proceedings, in Convention, on the Adeption of the Federal Constitution 555 (Jonathan Elliot 2d ed. 1836).5I.THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES TO ALIENS THE RIGHT TO CHALLENGE THE LAWFULNESS OF THEIR DETENTION AND DEPORTATION BY WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.The legal issues raised by Petitioners in this case -- namely their challenges to the lawfulness of final orders commanding their arrest and permanent removal from the United States -- fall squarely within the. scope of the Constitution's guarantee of the writ of habeas corpus, which may not be abrogated by Congress.A. The Right To Habeas Corpus Is Derived From The English Common Law And Is Safeguarded By.The ConstitutionSince its earliest decisions concerning the writ of habeascorpus, this Court has recognized that the federal writderives from the common law and that "the great object of [the-writ] is the liberation of those who may be imprisoned- without sufficient cause. It is in the nature of a writ of error,to. examine the legality of the commitment." Ex parte Watkins, 28 U:S. (3 Pet.) 193, 202 (1830) (Marshall, C.J.). The writ historically has served as "the great bulwark of personal liberty; since it is the appropriate remedy to ascertain whether any person is rightfully in confinement or not...." Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States § 1333 (1833).As Blackstone explained, the value of the writ lies in commanding the government to provide a legal accounting in court for its decision to deny a person's liberty:[T]he glory of the English law consists in clearlydefining the times, the causes, and the extent when,wherefore, and.to what degree, the imprisonment of the subject may be lawful. This induces an absolute neces-6sity of expressing upon every commitment the reason for which it is made; that the court upon an habeas corpus may examine into its validity; and according to the circumstances of the case may discharge, admit to bail, or remand the prisoner.3 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of En-gland *133.7The Founders considered the principle that physical liberty may be restrained only in accordance with law so fundamental. to the preservation of ordered liberty that they guaranteed the Great Writ against legislative or other encroachment in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, which provides that the "Privilege of the. Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." US. Const., Art.-I,'§ 9, cl. 2. Congress immediately vested habeas jurisdiction over claims regarding persons deprived of liberty under or by color.of federal authority in the FirstJudiciary. Act-of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 81-82. That jurisdiction- has remained in place ever since, and is currently codified at 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Although the Suspension Clause permits Congress `to replace the habeas corpus procedure with a functionally equivalent avenue of judicial review, this Court has.emphasized that that statutory avenue must be adequateand effective, and its. scope must be commensurate withconstitutional habeas corpus relief. See Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S. 372, 383-84 (1977); United States v. Hayman, 342 USS. 205, 223 (1952); see also United States ex rel. Tanfara v. Esperdy, 347 F.2d 149, 152 (2d Cir. 1965) (finding petition for review adequate means of testing legality of detention under deportation order); cf Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (statutory restrictions on multiple habeas applications by state prisoners that lie "well within the compass" of the evolution of judicial doctrine-on abuse of the writ do not-violate Suspension Clause).7 B. The. Guarantee of Habeas Corpus Inquiry AppliesWith Particular Force To Orders Involving Executive Detention That the writ is available to persons who. have beendetained pursuant to decisions or orders of the Executive Branch is beyond question. Indeed, judicial inquiry into thelawfulness of executive detention, which entails.inquiry intothe lawfulness of removal orders (see infra at I. C), lies at the traditional core of the writ. See Felker, 518 U.S. at 66364; Swain, 430 U.S. at 380 n.13; id. at 386 (Burger, C.J., concurring) ("[T]he traditional Great Writ was largely a remedy against executive detention."). In fact, the scope of inquiry when habeas corpus is applied to actions of executive officials has always been greater than the scope of inquiry when it is employed as a remedy for prisoners confined after a federal or state court criminal conviction.* American habeas law inherited from England a fundamental distinction between confinement by order of a "superior" court or court of record, and confinement by order of an "`inferior" tribunal or officer, with the requirement that judicial inquiry into the latter must be fuller in scope. See Ex parte Watkins, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 193 (1830); Gerald L. Neuman, Habeas: Corpus, Executive Detention, and the Removal of Aliens, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 961, 982-85 (1998) [Hereinafter, "Neuman, Habeas Corpus'']. Thus, historically, "[w]hile habeas review of a court judgment was limited to the issue of the sentencing court's jurisdictional competency, an attack on an executive order could raise all issues relating to the legality of the detention." Developments in the Law --Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038, 1238(1970); Ex parte Randolph, 20 F. Cas. 242, 254 (C.C.D. Va. 1833) (No. 11,558) (Marshall, Cir. J.) ("[T]he au-"This case does not involve the current scope of the Suspension Clause in relation to postconviction relief, and Amicus takes no position on that issue.8thority, whether given by a legislative act, or otherwise, mustbe strictly pursued. Such agents cannot act on other persons,or other subjects, than those marked out in the power, norcan they proceed in a manner different from that itprescribes.").°,`C. Habeas Corpus Review Is Guaranteed To Aliens Challenging Orders Of DeportationThis Court has always held that habeas corpus is available to review immigration decisions such as those at issue here. Even before the federal government began regulating immigration in 1875, the federal courts had employed the writ of habeas corpus in the analogous contexts of the extradition of foreign criminals and the return of deserting foreign seamen. See, e.g. In re Kaine, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 103 (1853) (extradition); Ex parte D'Olivera, 7 F. Cas. 853 (C.C.D. Mass. 1813) (No. 3967) (Story, Cir. J.) (desertion); Neuman, Habeas Corpus, at 990-1004. More significantly, shortly after Congress adopted the first federal immigration statutes, this Court rejected the government's claim that exclusion did not restrain an alien of his liberty within the meaning of habeas corpus doctrine. See United States v. Jung Ah Lung, 124 U.S. 621, 626 (1888); see also Chin Yow v.. United States, 208 U.S. 8, 12-13 (1908) (Holmes, J.).° Innumerable decisions since Junk Ah Lung confirm that the inquiry on habeas corpus into the lawfulness of detention necessarily includes inquiry into the legal-> Although both inquiries.are sometimes phrased in terms of "jurisdiction," in the case of executive tribunals the term "jurisdiction" encompasses the broad range of legal issues determining the tribunal's authority to order the detention of the individual. See Neuman, Habeas Corpus, at 982-84.*Because aliens have greater constitutional rights in deportation proceedings than in exclusion proceedings, see Landon v.

Although the Court has not had occasion to set forth every element required by the Constitution for habeas inquiry into executive removals, the Court has made clear that the minimum that the Constitution requires includes the judicial scrutiny exercised under the pre-1952 immigration acts with regard to final orders ofdeportation. See Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 233-35(1953).12In the 1890s, congressional dissatisfaction with judicialcorrection of executive decisions led to the enactment ofprovisions purporting to confer finality on executive orders ofexclusion.' This Court, however, in the seminal case ofNishimura Ekiu v.

Jd. at 713-14.Later, once the Court had emphasized the need forobservance of procedural due. process in immigration cases, see Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86 (1903), it modified its doctrine concerning finality of factfinding by insisting that both the fairness of the administrative hearing and the existence of some evidentiary basis for the finding must be open. to review on habeas. See, e.g, Chin Yow v. United States, 208 U.S. 8 (1908); Tang Tun v. Edsell, 223 U.S. 673 (1912); United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration at Port of New York, 273 U.S. 103 (1927);Gerald L. Neuman, The Constitutional Requirement of "Some Evidence". 25. San Diego L. Rev. 631, 637-41(1988).'° As this Court emphasized in Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S.229, 234-35 (1953), these finality provisions had "the effect of precluding judicial intervention in deportation cases except insofar as it was required by the Constitution." The Court, contrasting the due. process ``some evidence" test with the APA test of substantial evidence on the record as a whole, reaffirmed the existence of this constitutionally protected core of habeas inquiry by noting that full APA review°In view of the Government's arguments in proceedings below, it is worth emphasizing that the Court referred to a constitutional requirement of judicial intervention, not to a power of review limited to constitutional errors.`since some of these cases used habeas corpus to enforce procedural due process limitations on exclusion procedures, it may be helpful to observe that they predate this Court's later announcement of the Knauff doctrine, which limited the effect of procedural due process in proceedings for the exclusion of nonresident aliens. See United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537 (1950).14 was broader in scope than habeas inquiry, especially with regard to findings of fact. Id. at 236 & n.11 (citing Vajtauer, 273 US. 103, and Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135 (1945)). The Court later concluded that the full "abuse of discretion" analysis developed under the APA was also broader than the core habeas inquiry. See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954). The constitutional requirement of an avenue for judicial inquiry into the legal basis for removal, however, including issues of. statutory interpretation, has not been questioned.Heikkila is particularly instructive in clarifying the unique and protected position of traditional habeas by contrasting the term "judicial review" with habeas inquiry. The Court's emphasis on the phrase "judicial review" reflects a recurring distinction in terminology. Courts have repeatedly stated that particular decisions were not subject to review but were subject to the narrower inquiry on habeas. See, e.g. Terlinden vy. Ames, 184 U.S. 270, 278 (1902). (extradition); Nishimura, 142 U.S. at 663 (observing that while exclusion decision subject to habeas inquiry it could not be "impeached or reviewed").Thus, as the nature of the writ demands, and as the casesunder the pre-1952 statutes demonstrate, the enforcement of this irreducible constitutional minimum has involved statutory as well as constitutional challenges to the lawfulness of executive decisions, See generally Henderson v. INS, 157 F.3d 106, 114-16° (2d Cir. 1998) (collecting and discussing cases in which the courts reviewed such challenges). This Court regularly employed habeas corpus as a means to keep executive officials within the bounds of their statutory authority in exclusion and deportation matters. The Court corrected errors of law in the construction of exclusion and deportation grounds in such habeas cases as Gegiow v. Uhl, 239 U.S. 3 (1915). (rejecting executive's broad interpretation of public charge exclusion provision); Mahler v. Eby,15264 U.S. findings32 (1924) necessary(rejecting executive's for deportation afterinterpretation of conviction underespionage act); Kessler v. Strecker, 307 U.S. 22 (1939) (rejecting executive's interpretation of ideological deporta-tion provision); Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388(1947) (rejecting executive's interpretation of "entry''); andFong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 US. 6 (1948) (rejectingexecutive's interpretation of "multiple criminal convictiondeportation provision).''. As. Justice Holmes wrote inGegiow:The statute, by enumerating the conditions upon which the allowance to land may be denied, prohibits the denial in other cases. And when the record shows that a commissioner of immigration is exceeding his power, the alien may demand his release upon habeas corpus.239 USS. at 9.The constitutional scheme and this Court's precedents enforcing the `constitutional right of habeas corpus reflect the fact that without judicial control over statutory interpre-tation, executive officials: would have effective power todeport aliens for any reason they chose. The Government's current interpretation of the INA would avoid this result only in part by construing the language of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a) (2)(C) as making the courts of appeals' determination of whether an alien "is removable" on listed -grounds part of their determination of jurisdiction. This interpreta-tion, however, does not go far enough. Rather, interpretationof the statutory text of § 1252 must be informed by the constitutional right to judicial inquiry when the executive"These executiveare pre-Heikkila decisions in which this Court rejected interpretations; the.

That statement was qualified in the original by the need for "judicial intervention. under the `paramount law of the Constitution,' " and this Court's supporting footnote cited habeas decisions that scrutinized. the statutory bases for deportation orders and examined the factual bases of those orders. under the "some evidence" standard. Seeid. at 537 0.27. Indeed, one of those decisions was quite vehement on the subject. See Mahler v. Eby, 264 U.S. 32, 43-45 (1924) ("It is essential that, where an executive is exercising delegated legislative power, he should substantially comply-with all the statutory requirements in its exercise ...."). The Court in Carlson was denying the need for full APA judicial review and contrasting such direct review with an attack on habeas. In another case decided the same day as Carlson, both majority and dissenting opinions listed the right to habeas corpus among the constitutional rights of aliens, citing Nishimura Ekiu as authority.

Habeas Review Of Deportation Orders EncompassesNot Only Deportability, But Also The Lawfulness Of Denials Of Discretionary Relief. The Government has maintained that the level of inquiry preserved by 8 U.S.C. § 1252 does not extend to the BIA's interpretation of the retroactive effect of statutes governing discretionary relief. However, where the immigration laws have given aliens the right to apply for a discretionary waiver of exclusion or deportation, the inquiry'on habeas must also extend to whether the officials have observed any applicable limits on their authority to deny the waiver. The statutory ability to seek discretionary waivers is an important legal right. See Chadha v. INS, 634 F.2d 408, 425-26 (9th Cir. 1980) (Kennedy, J.), afd, 462 U.S. 919 (1983) (noting that such waivers serve to avoid the hardship and suffering that strict application of deportation grounds may entail). This Court has characterized rulings on discretionary relief from deportation as "an integral part of the proceedings which have led to the issuance of a final deportation order," Foti v. INS, 375 U.S. 217, 223 (1963), and as one of the `matters on which the validity of the final order is contingent," INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 938 (1983) (quoting Chadha v. INS, 634 F.2d at 412).-As such, transgression of constitutional or statutory limitations on the agency's power must be open to inquiry on habeas review of any resulting detention. The right to habeas inquiry concerning whether a person has a statutory right to apply for discretionary relief does not require that habeas inquiry must be available with regard to every form of discretionary relief. In some instances, discretion is conferred in such a manner that, aside from constitutional requirements, there is no law to apply, and hence no basis for habeas review. See Mada-Luna v. Fitzpatrick, 813 F.2d 1006 (9th Cir. 1987). (regarding deferral of action). Nevertheless, discretion ordinarily is not so limitless, and21even though the ultimate grant of relief may be "a matter of grace," it remains true that inquiry. is proper at least as to whether the applicants "have been given a right to a discretionary determination." Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345, 354 (1956) (emphasis added); Dessalernos v. Savoretti, 356 U.S. 269, 269 (1958) (finding. petitioner "entitled to have his application for suspension of deportation considered") j6 The federal courts have long enforced statutory bounds on the official's discretion to deny relief, especially when the officials have failed to exercise the discretion delegated to them.In the case `at bar, Petitioners challenge a statutory interpretation by the Government that would foreclose any right of Petitioners to seek discretionary relief. By longstanding pre-IIRIRA administrative and judicial interpreta-tion, Petitioners would have been eligible under INA section212(c) to apply for waiver of grounds for their removal. See Francis v. INS, 532 F.2d 268 (2d Cir. 1976); Matter of Silva, 161. & N. Dec. 26 (BIA 1976); Matter of S-, 61. & N. Dec. 392 (BIA 1954). This form of relief applies only to aliens, such as Petitioners, who are lawful permanent residents and who have resided in the United States at least seven years.'' In IIRIRA, Congress reformulated section`6 Attempts to analogize exercise of this relief to a Presidential pardon are not instructive in cases involving the delegated power to grant discretionay relief from removal, because the power to pardon. is an inherent constitutional power of the President not subject to direction by Congress. See Schick v. Reed, 419 U.S. 256, 266 (1974); United States v, Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 147-48 (1871)." The Government has mischaracterized the situation of a deportable permanent resident under the U.S. immigration laws in its argument that deportation of a permanent resident "is necessary in order to bring to an end an ongoing violation of United States law." Petition for Cert., INS y. St. Cyr (No. 00-0767) (quoting Reno v. American-Arab AntiDiscrimination Comm.; 525 U.S. 471, 491 (1999)). The INA authorizes, but does not require, the Attorney General to remove permanent22212(c): relief prospectively as cancellation of removal under8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The Attorney General held that thisamendment deprived her of authority to grant relief toPetitioners under the previously applicable standards ofsection 212(c). Petitioners' challenge to that interpretationraises a claim of statutory construction relating to failure toexercise discretion, not an objection to the manner in whichdiscretion is exercised.'®°Because Petitioners' claims concern a pure question of law regarding their right to seek discretionary relief under section 212(c), their claims are properly and necessarily subject to habeas inquiry. Indeed, in cases under the pre1952 statutory regime, the lower federal courts routinely applied the constitutionally guaranteed writ of habeas corpus to ensure the lawful exercise of discretion under the Seventh Proviso, the statutory predecessor to section 212(c).!? See, e.g., United States ex rel. Devenuto v. Curran, 299 F. 206 (2d Cir. 1924) (upholding reasonableness. of ruleadopted for administration of discretion); Hee Fuk Yuen v. White, 273 F..10, 13 (9th Cir.) (same), cert.: denied subnom., Pang Hing v. White, 257. U.S. 639 (1921); United States ex rel. Patti v.

INS, 532 F.2d 268, 270-71 (2d Cir. 1976).23Cir. 1927); (upholdingGabriel v. Johnson, 29 F.2d existence of evidence to347 (1st sustainCir. 1928) finding ofineligibility).Similarly, the writ ofthis Court and lower habeas corpus underfederal courts the pre-1952employed regime toensure the lawful exercise of the authority to grant otherforms of discretionary relief under the 1917 Act. See, UnitedStates ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268(1954) (finding adequate allegation of failure to exercisediscretion in accordance with regulations on suspension ofdeportation under the 1917 Act); United States ex rel.Adel v. Shaughnessy, 183 F.2d 371, 372 (2d Cir. 1950)(Frank, J.) (courts can review for clear abuse of discretionor a clear failure to exercise discretion); United States ex rel.Kaloudis v. Shaughnessy, 180 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. 1950)(L. Hand, C.J.) (denial of suspension of deportation re-viewable on habeas if "the ground. stated is on its faceinsufficient").:The decisions under the pre-1952 regime agree that the agency's imposition of eligibility requirements for discretionary relief that are not authorized by law constitutes a failure to exercise discretion, rendering a resulting deportation order unlawful and therefore subject to correction on habeas. Accardi, 347 U.S. at 268; Mastrapasqua v. Shaughnessy, 180 F.2d 999 (2d Cir. 1950); United States ex rel. de Sousa v. Day, 22 F.2d 472 (2d Cir. 1927); GonzalezMartinez v. Landon, 203 F.2d 196 (9th Cir.), cert. denied,2© In Accardi, the dissenting opinion denied that irregularities in aproceeding amined onfor discretionary relief under habeas corpus. See 347 U.S. atthe 1917 Act could 269-71 (Jackson, J.,be exdissent-ing). Justice Clark's opinion for the majority rejected this argument,noting that "we which discretion to exercise itsare not here reviewing and reversing is exercised . .. [but rather] the Board's own discretion." See 347 U.S..at 268the manner in alleged failure (emphasis inoriginal).24345 US. 998. (1953); United: States.ex rel. Berman v.Curran, 13 F.2d 96 (3d Cir. 1926). In such cases the courts have not hesitated to grant a habeas remedy, even though the executive would still have the opportunity to deny relief as a matter of properly exercised discretion."Thus, the constitutional right to habeas corpus review of deportation decisions also applies when the unlawfulness inheres in the refusal to exercise discretion. The Constitution requires that habeas remain available to review errors of law. and unconstitutionally. arbitrary denials, even if the operative standard is narrower than. the standards generally applicable under the APA.Ill. SECTION 1252 DOES NOT PRECLUDE FEDERAL COURT JURISDICTION TO EXAMINE THE. LEGALITY OF THE BIA'S DETERMINATION THAT RELIEF UNDER FORMER INA SECTION 212(c) IS_UNAVAILABLE TO PETITIONERS.As the court below and numerous other circuits. have properly found, Congress did not intend to impair the . constitutionally guaranteed right to habeas corpus inquiry when. it enacted IIRIRA. Congress.did not explicitly repeal habeas corpus jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. for re-moval cases, and its restriction of "review" in section1252(a) (2) (C). does not. refer to. habeas. inquiry."'Petitioners also challenge the BIA's action on constitutional grounds. With respect to these constitutional challenges, it is clear that refusing any judicial inquiry into constitutional issues concerning discretionary relief from deportation would abdicate "the primary responsibility of the Judiciary."

Felker was decided three monthsbefore the enactment of IIRIRA on September 30, 1996, and the decision upheld aspects of Congress's April 1996 revisions of the procedure for postconviction habeas corpus.518 USS. at 664; see, e.g., Mahadeo v.

INS, 212 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding proximity "particularly relevant"). Given the lively interest of Congress in its habeas corpus reforms, the traditional presumption that Congress is aware of this: Court's decisions applies with particular force to ITRIRA.In view of the text and timing of ITRIRA, it would be a " disservice to Congress to read expansively subsections of§ 1252 that make no specific mention of habeas corpus or of 28 U.S.C. § 2241 as barring access to the writ.B. The Reference To 1252(a}(2)(C) Does Corpus Inquiry`Review' In Not EncompassSection HabeasIn employing the term "review," and omitting the term "habeas corpus," in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C), Congress acted against the background of this Court's decisions previously discussed at length that protect the right to habeas corpus against inadvertent or casual impairment.Language shall be no denying thein section 1252(a)(2)(C) providing that there "review" is thus most naturally interpreted as alien the full scope of APA review, and asaffording the alien access to only the narrower form of26habeas corpus inquiry preserved: under the pre-1952 immi-gration statutes, as discussed supra in section II. Such aninterpretation is bolstered by the traditional distinction between "review" and habeas corpus noted by this Court in Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 236 (1953); NishimuraEkiu v, United States, 142 U.S. 651, 663 (1892), and othercases. C. `Two Alternative Readings Of Section 1252 Are Consistent With This Court's Jurisprudence Section 1252 may properly be read. in one of two ways.One reading, consistent with this Court's decisions.in Felkerand -Yerger, is that habeas corpus jurisdiction remains available in the district court under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. This interpretation would entail merely affirming the. jurisdictional rulings of the court of appeals, and holding that the preclusion of direct review is: constitutionally permissible because habeas corpus jurisdiction over these Petitioners' claims is available in the district court.This interpretation flows naturally from the text. Section 1252(b) (9) would preserve habeas. corpus jurisdiction over final removal. orders that are not subject to direct review under § 1252(a)(1). The title of § 1252(b)(9) is "Consolidation of questions for judicial review." Section 1252(b) (9) is also qualified by the introductory language that appears at the beginning of subsection 1252(b), which reads "With respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a) (1), the following requirements apply." Thus, if § 1252(b).(9) is a "zipper clause," then it serves only to consolidate review of orders subject to direct review, not to preclude habeas jurisdiction over orders that are not subject to direct review. The traditional distinction between2This Court characterized section 1252(b) (9) as a "zipper clause" in Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471, 483°(1999).27"review" tation ofand thehabeas phraseinquiry would also "Judicial review"support an interprein § 1252(b) (9) asmeaning APA-style review.cadAiphsspatAenrltainthlceeitsslrinacnCotognouiurvrtedttlihyreh,eachbtarseetaqhrseuerivericjeeCoudwrog.,inusirdzthtieahcdbete,irmaoesanb.ytyheiinranlHeqssuanou.idbcreehyracisoncnigasnsttCeor.sotuhreep.tuuhnesen§xeeccrS1eoc2usui5ssrs2ptaeerny-a.oosff sion Clause protects the substance rather than the form of the privilege of the writ. See Swain v. Pressley, 430 US. 372, 383-84 (1977); United States v. Hayman, 342 USS. 205, 223.(1952). The constitutional requirement would be equally satisfied if aliens were required to seek their remedy in the courts of appeals in the first instance. See Hayman, 342 U.S. at 223 & n.40 (discussing requirement of exhaustion of alternative judicial remedies); United States ex rel. Tanfara v.-Esperdy, 347 F.2d 149, 152 (2d Cir. 1965) (upholding replacement of habeas corpus by direct review of deportation orders).The Government argues, and some lower courts haveobserved, of appealsthat channeling the inquiry directly into the courts would serve the goal of streamlining the removalof aliens. Congress's power over the jurisdiction of the lowerfederal courts entitles it to designate any of these avenues, ora hybrid system of review, but Congress must permit someeffective avenue for.judicial resolution. of constitutional andstatutory challenges to removal orders.Thus, while Amicus takesreasonable interpretations ofno position.on which of these§ 1252 best reflects the intentof Congress, the Court should choose among these reasona-ble constructions that do not violate the constitutional rightto habeas corpus inquiry in deportation proceedings.28Iv. IF SECTION 1252 WERE READ AS BARRING ACCESS TO THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS WITH RESPECT TO PETITIONERS' CLAIMS, THEN IT WOULD VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION.If the Court were to conclude that a provision of § 1252 prohibits inquiry into the lawfulness of a deportation order on habeas `corpus, without providing a substantially equivalent and effective mode of review, that provision would be unconstitutional. Such a prohibition would not be a mere regulation of jurisdiction of the federal courts, because it would permit no alternative forum."As Henry Hart emphasized, Congress's power to define the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts is. subject to constitutional limits, and the explicit limit of the Suspension Clause applies to deportation. See Henry M. Hart, Jr., The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of FederalCourts: An Exercise in. Dialectic, 66 Harv. L. Rev. 1362, 1393, 1397 (1953). When a federal court is unavoidablyconfronted with an invalid preclusion statute, "its duty isContrary to the Government's suggestion in the court of appeals, this Court is not available as an alternative forum. See Brief for Respondent, Calcano-Martinez v. INS, at 73 n*. The constitutional limits on this Court's original jurisdiction would forbid this Court to serve as the court of initial jurisdiction for habeas inquiry into deportation orders. The grant of a writ of habeas corpus directly to an executive official, in a case that is not within the jurisdiction of any lower court, would be an exercise of original jurisdiction. Such writs could be granted on behalf of "Ambassadors, other public Ministers and. Consuls," U.S. Const., Art. TH, § 2, el. 1, but not on behalf of ordinary aliens. See Ex parte Bollman, 8.U.S. (4-Cranch) 75, 100-01 (1807).Moreover, the recent immigration statutes cannot reasonably be interpreted as contemplating that state courts would exercise habeas jurisdiction to review federal immigration decisions, even if such review were constitutionally permissible.29simply to declare the jurisdictional limitation invalid also,and then proceed under the general grant of jurisdiction."Id. at 1387; see United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S.828 (1987); Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S.200, 219 & n.* (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in thejudgment)..Well-established principles, of statutory construction require that, where reasonably possible, this Court interpret Congress's acts to avoid a grave constitutional question. See Jean v. Nelson, 472 U.S. 846, 854 (1985) (interpreting immigration statute and regulations to avoid constitutional question); United States v. Witkovich, 353 U.S. 194, 201-02 (1957) (same). Here, such a construction. is not only possible, but it yields the most natural reading of Congress's intent.CONCLUSIONThe Court's past fidelity to the Great Writ provides the fundamental answer to the jurisdictional question currently before this Court. This Court should affirm federal court jurisdiction over constitutional and statutory challenges to the BIA's orders.Respectfully submitted, MARTHA W. BARNETT**
 FUNCTIONARIES IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO A JUDICIAL REMEDY AND TO SECURE AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY4.1. THE DUTY TO PROTECT JUDICIAL FUNCTIONARIES IS INTRINSIC TO THE DUTY TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS UNDER THE CONVENTION18. This Court's jurisprudence has explained the law applicable to this case with abundant clarity. For example, in the case relating to the State of Guatemala's failure to investigate, for over 10 years, the extra-judicial killing of Myrna Mack Chang, a Guatemalan anthropologist, the Court specifically addressed the relationship between the State's duty to investigate and prosecute human rights violations, on the one hand, and its duty to protect the judicial functionaries charged with conducting such investigations and prosecutions, on the other hand. The Court concluded that prolonged threats and harassment against judges, witnesses, and police investigating that case resulted in "deficient" judicial proceedings, in violation of Articles 1(1), 8 and 25 of the Convention.28 In particular, the court found that judges and police investigators were routinely threatened, monitored, and harassed, and, in one instance, a police investigator was murdered.29 The harassment of several members of the investigative and judicial teams forced them into exile, and, at the time of the Myrna Mack Chang decision, the27 Inter-Am.

Guatemala, Merits, Reparations and Costs. Judgment of November 25, 2003, Series C No. 101, para. 271. 29 Ibid. para. 188.10State of Guatemala had not yet brought to justice those responsible for that harassment.30 The Court finally concluded that "in light of the above, this Court deems that the State, to ensure due process, must provide all necessary means to protect the legal operators, investigators, witnesses and next to kin of the victims from harassment and threats aimed at obstructing the proceeding and avoiding elucidation of the facts, as well as covering up those responsible for said fact".3119. A similar pattern of harassment has been alleged in the present case, and, as with the Myrna Mack Chang case, it is further alleged in the present case that the State of Colombia has not brought those responsible to account for what they allegedly did.20. In the Myrna Mack Chang case, the Court noted in particular that the State's obligation to investigate and prosecute includes the duty to "provide sufficient security measures to the judicial authorities, prosecutors, witnesses, [and other law enforcement personnel]".32 The failure to do so was seen by the Court to impede the judicial proceedings, thereby generating "feelings of insecurity, defenselessness, and anguish in the next of kin of the victim" and "foster[ing] chronic recidivism of the human rights violations involved".33 Significantly, as previously noted, the Court found that the failure to protect the judicial functionaries working on the case, and the resulting failure to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the killing, violated the right of the "society as a whole" to be informed of "everything that has happened in connection with [grave violations of human rights]".3421. This Court has consistently held that the mere existence of formal remedies is not itself sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article 25; such remedies also must be demonstrably effective in practice, ensuring the restoration of rights, where possible, the reparation of any harm caused by the violation, and the punishment of those responsible.35 Among other things, the availability of effective remedies depends on the30 Ibid. paras. 189 and 197. 31 Ibid. para. 199. 32 Ibid. para. 277. 33 Ibid. paras. 271-272; see also Inter-Am.

In the present case, the State of Colombia has argued that there have been a variety of military investigations, disciplinary proceedings and administrative remedies, but11existence of an independent judiciary and legal profession and on the State Parties' discharge of their responsibilities with respect to the protection of that independence.22. Thus, in the case of Reverón Trujillo, which concerned the alleged arbitrary dismissal of a member of the Venezuelan judiciary, this Court noted the central importance of the State Parties' duty to protect judges, recognizing that the duty to protect judges from all form of threats and pressures "inspires legitimacy [...] not only to the parties, but to all citizens in a democratic society".36 Given the critical importance of ensuring that judicial officials operate free from all undue influence, the Court in that case recognized that even indirect threats may compromise the right to an independent judiciary and judicial protection, and therefore called upon "public officials, particularly the top Government authorities, [...] to be especially careful so that their public statements do not amount to a form of interference with or pressure impairing judicial independence and do not induce or invite other authorities to engage in activities that may abridge the independence or affect the judge's freedom of action".374.2. THE DUTY TO PROTECT JUDGES AND LAWYERS UNDER GENERAL INTERNATIONAL LAW.The duty to protect judges from any infringement on their independence23. This Court's jurisprudence on the duty to protect judicial functionaries from all forms of threats, harassment, and other forms of interference, whether official or not, is consistent with a host of universal and regional human rights treaties and with general principles of international law. One of the most important treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the "ICCPR"),38 states in Article 14(1) that "everyone shall be entitled to a fair trial and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law".24. The U.N. Human Rights Committee, the body charged with authoritatively interpreting the ICCPR, has interpreted Article 14(1) to require, among other things, "the actual independence of the judiciary from political interference by the executive branch andthe Commission has noted that such remedies are no substitute for a full investigation and prosecution. In doing so, the Commission has accurately summarized upon the jurisprudencia constante of the Court; See IACHR, Merits report, supra n.6, para. 436-446. 36 Inter-Am Ct. H.R., Reverón Trujillo v.

Many entities and representatives of the United Nations have emphasized the connection between the protection of human rights and independence of the judiciary. For example, the U.N. General Assembly reiterated the need for complete independence of the judiciary from all threats and improper pressures in the Basic Principles of Independence of the Judiciary, noting that "judges are charged with the ultimate decision over life, freedoms, rights, duties and property of citizens".4026. In 2003, when Leandro Despouy, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, presented his first Report to the Commission on Human Rights on the Economic and Social Council, he specifically "noted that his mandate is derived from the Commission's concern at the frequency of attacks on judges, lawyers and court officials and its realization of the link existing between the safeguards for the judiciary and lawyers and the gravity and frequency of human rights violations".4127. The Special Rapporteur's 2003 report identified various infringements on the independence and impartiality of judges and lawyers and the right to a fair trial, including pressures and threats against magistrates and lawyers. The Special Rapporteur expressly noted that:"Among the legal professions, judges and lawyers seem to incur the gravest risks. [...] And yet the work of the Commission over a period of 10 years shows how frequently judges and lawyers are exposed to risks that may range from harassment, intimidation or threats to assault, including physical violence and murder, to arbitrary arrest and detention, to restrictions on their freedom of movement, or to economic or other sanctions for measures they have taken in accordance with recognized professional obligations and standards and ethics. In the case of lawyers, it is not uncommon for such39 Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 32 Article 14: Right to Equality before Courts and Tribunals and to a Fair Trial, 90th Sess., July 9-27, 2007, U.N.

However, there can be no independence of judges and lawyers if those individuals can be exposed to such situations and if the State does not take steps to prevent and remedy them".4228. In a 2010 report, the Special Rapporteur specifically stated that the State is responsible for protecting judicial bodies from all attacks, acts of intimidation, threats, and reprisals, which responsibility includes the identification of those who perpetrate such threats, the proper investigation of all reports and complaints, and the undertaking of measures to protect judges and their family members, especially in sensitive cases such as those concerning terrorism and organized crime.43The duty to protect lawyers from any infringement on their independence29. Maintaining the rule of law and ensuring the efficient protection of human rights in a democratic society not only requires an independent judiciary, but the existence of an independent legal profession as well. Recognizing the importance of the independence of the legal profession, the U.N. Congress on the Prevention of the Crime and the Treatment of Offenders adopted the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers. The ninth paragraph of the preamble to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers44 specifically acknowledges that "Adequate protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms to which all persons are entitled, be they economic, social and cultural or civil and political, requires that all persons have effective access to legal services provided by an independent legal profession".30. To carry out their professional duties effectively, lawyers and prosecutors must not only be granted all due process guarantees afforded by domestic and international law, they must also be free from improper threats or other pressures. In 2011, while reporting on a special mission to Mexico, the Special Rapporteur observed that this obligation requires that prosecutors be protected from improper influences and stated that "the prosecution's lack of autonomy of the executive branch, [...] can erode the credibility of authority responsible for investigating crimes objectively and undermining confidence in its ability to do so".45 In other words, a just and efficient administration of justice requires that42 Ibid. para. 48-49. 43 U.N.

Principle 16 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers charges the State with the responsibility for ensuring lawyers can do their work without being subjected to such interference: "Governments shall ensure that lawyers (a) are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference; (b) are able to travel and to consult with their clients freely both within their own country and abroad; and (c) shall not suffer or be threatened with, prosecution or administrative, economic or other sanctions for any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics".4632. Principle 17 specifically provides that, "where security of lawyers is threatened as a result of discharging their functions, they shall be adequately safeguarded by the authorities".474.3. THE DUTY TO PROTECT JUDGES AND LAWYERS UNDER THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION33. This Court has often looked to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (the "ECtHR") and to European human rights legal documents as authoritative sources of guidance in this area.48 Here, the relevant jurisprudence of the ECtHR also recognizes that State authorities have an affirmative obligation to ensure that the rights guaranteed under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the "ECHR") are made "practical and effective", and are not relegated to the realm of the merely theoretical or illusory.4934. More specifically, the ECtHR has given effect to Article 6(1) of the ECHR, which guarantees the right to an "independent and impartial tribunal established by law", by holding that "the work of the courts, which are the guarantors of justice and which have a fundamental role in [...] the rule of law, needs to enjoy public confidence. It should therefore be protected from unfounded attacks".5046 Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, supra note 44, Principle 16. 47 Ibid., Principle 17. 48 See e.g. Inter-Am Ct.

The European Council, through its Committee of Ministers, has described the necessity and indispensability of an independent judiciary as follows:"The external independence of judges is not a prerogative or privilege granted in judges' own interest but in the interest of the rule of law and of persons seeking and expecting impartial justice. The independence of judges should be regarded as a guarantee of freedom, respect for human rights and impartial application of the law. Judges' impartiality and independence are essential to guarantee the equality of parties before the courts".5136. More specifically, the European Commission on Human Rights has stated that the independence of a judicial body depends, among other things, on the manner in which its members are appointed, and with regard being given "to the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and to the question of whether the body presents an appearance of independence". 52 The European Commission also has stressed that regard must be given to whether influence from outside sources or any actual bias has occurred.53 In other words, in determining whether a tribunal enjoys the necessary degree of independence and impartiality, the reality of the situation must be taken into account. Judges must be protected from outside pressures, not simply in theory, but effectively and in practice.37. In a recent report on Ukraine, for example, the European Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe outlined the fact that "the independence of the judiciary ­ which also implies the independence of each individual judge ­ should be protected both in law and in practice".54 The Commissioner noted with concern the public perception in Ukraine that "judges are not shielded from outside pressure, including of a political nature. Decisive action is needed on several fronts to remove the factors, which render judges vulnerable and weaken their independence. The authorities should carefully look into any allegations of improper political or other influence or interference in the work of the judicial institutions and ensure effective remedies".55 Insatisfaction), para. 65, 9 June 1998; Brudnicka and others v.

IF PROVEN, THE ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO THE KILLING OF MAGISTRATE URÁN ROJAS AND THE LARGER CONTEXT OF THREATS AND OTHER PRESSURES AGAINST JUDICIAL FUNCTIONARIES IN COLOMBIA CONSTITUTE VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHT TO AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AND JUDICIAL PROTECTIONS38. The Commission has alleged that, notwithstanding the passage of almost thirty years since the alleged crimes occurred, no significant progress has been made in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the torture, disappearance and execution of victims in this case. The petitioners have alleged that the failure to investigate is due, in part, to inappropriate pressures and threats made against judges, prosecutors, and lawyers working on this case. Moreover, public records support the assertion that in this and other cases, judges, prosecutors, and lawyers working on sensitive human rights cases in Colombia have faced a consistent pattern of pressures and threats, both direct and indirect, from both public and private actors.5.1. THE FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE THE KILLING OF MAGISTRATE URÁN ROJAS39. The IACHR has alleged that no meaningful progress has occurred in the investigation into the killing of Magistrate Urán Rojas. Indeed, nearly twenty-eight years after the killing, the persons responsible have not been brought to justice and the case remains open. The petitioners allege that part of this long delay is attributable to the Prosecutor General's decision to remove the case from Dr. Ángela María Buitrago, a prosecutor who diligently investigated and prosecuted the cases on her docket, and re-assign it to the National Unit for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law, an entity which has not made significant progress in several of the important cases assigned to it.5756 Ibid. para. 24. 57 IACHR, Merits Report, supra note 6, at paras. 61-67.1740. In 2006 and 2007, multiple cases assigned to the National Unit for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law appeared to have stalled.58 In contrast, during that time period, Dr. Buitrago was proceeding with diligence in her investigations, one of which had resulted in the detention of a high-level commander.5941. In 2008, the Prosecutor General assigned the case of the execution of Magistrate Urán Rojas to Dr. Buitrago. In 2010, Dr. Buitrago secured the conviction of a high-level commander in another case. Two months later, when Dr. Buitrago opened an investigation concerning three generals implicated in the killing of Urán Rojas, the Prosecutor General immediately removed Dr. Buitrago from the case and re-assigned it to the National Unit for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law. When the IACHR issued its report in October 2011, the National Unit for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law was continuing the investigation.60 That continues to be the case, according to recent press reports.61 The IACHR also has found that the National Unit for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law had failed to demonstrate progress in other investigations assigned to it.6242. The alleged failure to investigate fully and to prosecute those responsible for the killing of Magistrate Urán Rojas raises particularly troubling questions about the State's commitment to ensuring the independence of the judiciary. It is alleged the Magistrate Urán Rojas was videotaped leaving the Palace of Justice wounded and in the custody of security forces, and that he was later found dead with a bullet-wound to the head fired at close range.63 It is further alleged that crucial information in the possession of Colombian security forces concerning the killing has been withheld for years, and that new revelations concerning the incident at the Palace of Justice continue to emerge.6443. If proven, the alleged killing of Magistrate Urán Rojas amounts to a summary execution, which is a "grave violation" of the Convention. According to the jurisprudence constante of this Court, States must "identify, try, and punish all the direct perpetrators58 Ibid. paras. 61 - 64 (alleging the continued absence of progress in the cases). 59 Ibid. para. 51. 60 Ibid. para. 338.61 Juan David Laverde Palma, Proceso por el Palacio de Justicia, El Espectador, August 2, 2013http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/rafael-nieto-sale-del-caso-del-palacio-de-justicia-articulo-437652 62 IACHR, Merits Report, supra note 6, para. 340. 63 Id. note 6, at paras. 271-276. 64 El Tiempo, En bóveda del B-2 apareció la billetera de magistrado muerto en el Palacio de Justicia (May 12, 2007); Juan David Laverde Palma, El reporte secreta del Palacio de Justicia (parte II), El Espectador, June 22, 2013 http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/articulo-429452-el-reporte-secreto-del-palacio-de-justiciaparte-ii.18and accessories, and the other persons responsible for the extrajudicial killing of Myrna Mack Chang and for the cover-up of the extrajudicial killing [....]".65 As the Court has repeatedly held, in a "democratic society [...] the truth on grave human rights violations must be known. This is a fair expectation that the State must satisfy, on the one hand, through the obligation to investigate the human rights violations, and on the other hand, through the public disclosure of the results of the criminal and investigation processes".6644. While some of the individuals under investigation for the killing of Magistrate Urán Rojas have been convicted for other crimes, no one has been brought to justice with respect to this crime. Nearly twenty-eight years after the fact, the matter of the killing of Magistrate Urán Rojas remains open. To say the least, the lack of progress achieved in the investigation undermines the ability of his family members and friends, as well as those of the other victims, to find peace. This lack of judicial clarification of the facts also compromises the Colombian public's ability to assess the possible responsibility of key officials for the events in question, thereby undermining the ability of the public's right to know and to participate in a meaningful way in the democratic process.45. Recognizing the State of Colombia's undeniable legal and moral obligation to investigate and punish grave human rights violations while also pursuing a lasting peace, the ABA respectfully notes that this Court has repeatedly held that, even in the context of an armed conflict, States must fully investigate and prosecute grave human rights violations and "abstain from [...] the establishment of measures designed to eliminate responsibility".67 Such a full elucidation of the facts is necessary, not simply to redress human rights abuses, but also to ensure against their repetition. If not, there can be no closure in this case, neither justice nor the appearance of justice being done, and no guarantee that impunity will not simply beget further impunity.65 Inter-Am Ct.

During proceedings in cases related to the Palace of Justice incident, Judge María Stella Jara Guiterrez stated that she had been the subject of ongoing threats.68 In addition to threats that were delivered directly to her, threatening statements were also published in newspapers; among the newspaper threats was an invitation to the judge's funeral.69 These threats were taken with sufficient seriousness by the IACHR that it issued precautionary measures to protect her on June 2, 2010:"The IACHR granted precautionary measures for Maria Stella Jara Gutierrez and her son, in Colombia. In the request for precautionary measures and in additional information sent later, it is alleged that Judge Jara Gutierrez, who is in charge of the Palace of Justice case, has received threats from alleged armed groups operating outside of the law. It is also alleged that the threats have intensified in recent months, as the date for issuing the final judgment in the case draws near. The information also indicates that there has been a delay in the implementation of a security plan designed to safeguard the life and integrity of Judge Jara Gutierrez and her youngest son. The Inter-American Commission asked the State of Colombia to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee the life and personal integrity of Maria Jara Gutierrez and her son; to reach agreement with the beneficiary and her representatives on the measures to be adopted; and to inform the Commission about the steps taken to investigate the events that led to the adoption of precautionary measures".7047. On June 9, 2010, Judge Jara Guiterrez convicted the colonel in charge of the military operations. On June 10, the President of Colombia publicly criticized the decision.71 He also called for reforms to protect the military from future prosecutions.72 The Minister of Defense likewise issued a statement expressing his sadness at the conviction and calling the colonel a "soldier of the homeland".7368 Juzgado Tercero Penal del Circuito Especializado de Bogotá, proceso 2008-0025 contra Luis Alfonso Plazas Vega, sesión de audiencia pública, (6 de agosto de 2009). 69 Caracol radio, "Cronología de las presiones y amenazas contra la juez María Stella Jara", 4 de septiembre de 2009 available at http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/judicial/cronologia-de-las-presiones-y-amenazas-contrala-juez-maria-stella-jara/20090904/nota/873407.aspx 70 Inter-Am.

On June 11, 2010, two days after Judge Jara Guiterrez had convicted the colonel, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Colombian government to "to take all necessary steps to continue ensuring the security of Judge María Stella Jara, who is facing numerous threats"74 and emphasized the need to provide for the "full protection of witnesses, lawyers, the families of victims, members of the administration of justice involved in these cases".75 Judge Jara Guiterrez subsequently was forced to leave Colombia with her son because she feared for their safety.49. Notwithstanding the many interventions by international and foreign institutions, which repeatedly called on Colombian authorities to fulfill their legal obligations to protect Judge Jara Guiterrez, those authorities have failed to do so. The consequences for that failure have been grave and will be long-lasting.6. CONCLUSION50. For all of these reasons, the threats to the judiciary and legal profession that have been alleged in this case are of grave concern to the international community. The ABA therefore respectfully urges that if the Court finds that these allegations are supported by the evidence, it hold that the State of Colombia violated Articles 1(1), 8(1) and 25(1).74 U.N.

An attorney representing a death row prisoner in federal habeas proceedings has a duty to investigate and develop potentially meritorious claims. In many cases, the investigation requires specialized services such as mitigation specialists, investigators, and mental health experts, in addition to attorneys' work. Without access to adequate funding for reasonably necessary services, counsel will be unable to meet minimum professional standards for effective representation of prisoners in capital6habeas proceedings. The Fifth Circuit's restrictive and circular "substantial need" test effectively prevents counsel representing indigent petitioners from fulfilling their professional responsibilities in this critical stage of proceedings, thereby increasing the risk of an unjust execution.I.INVESTIGATIONTODEVELOPPOTENTIALLY MERITORIOUS CLAIMS IS ANESSENTIAL ROLE AND DUTY OF FEDERALPOST-CONVICTION COUNSELThis Court has repeatedly confirmed what professional standards explicate: A core function of federal post-conviction counsel is to investigate claims which may have merit so that strategic decisions can be made and substantial claims for relief can be developed and presented to federal courts. Rather than investigating only those claims counsel knows from the outset will prove viable on both deficient-performance and prejudice grounds, counsel is duty-bound to conduct a reasonable investigation to determine which potential claims, if any, are ultimately viable on the merits.Criminal defense counsel at all stages of proceedings have a "duty to investigate" issues related to guilt and punishment, and counsel's performance of that duty is crucial to ensuring adequate representation. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 690 (1984); see also Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 380 (2005) ("This case, like some others recently, looks to norms of adequate investigation . . . ."). As the Eleventh Circuit has observed, a defense attorney's "independent duty to7investigate and prepare" is "[a]t the heart of effective representation." Goodwin v. Balkcom, 684 F.2d 794, 805 (11th Cir. 1982).In preparing a federal habeas petition, counsel "must conduct a reasonable and diligent investigation aimed at including all relevant claims and grounds for relief." McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 498 (1991); see also ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.15.1(C) (habeas counsel "should seek to litigate all issues, whether or not previously presented, that are arguably meritorious"). The importance of this duty is heightened in the federal habeas context by doctrines of waiver and abuse of the writ. See McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 860 (1994) (O'Connor, J., concurring)."Claims of ineffective assistance" in particular "often require investigative work" to develop facts that may not appear in the record or in the files of ineffective prior attorneys. Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1, 11 (2012). Indeed, "the inherent nature of most ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims means that the trial court record will often fail to contain the information necessary to substantiate the claim." Trevino v. Thaler, 133 S. Ct. 1911, 1918 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ex parte Varelas, 45 S.W.3d 627, 629-30 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001) ("In most cases, the record on direct appeal is inadequate to develop an ineffective assistance claim because the very ineffectiveness claimed may prevent the record from containing the information necessary to substantiate a claim." (internal quotation marks omitted)).8It follows that, in pursuing the limited procedural-default exception this Court identified in Martinez and Trevino ­ which is available only where, inter alia, "`there was no counsel'" in state habeas "`or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective,'" Trevino, 133 S. Ct. at 1921 (quoting Martinez, 566 U.S. at 17) ­ federal habeas counsel must investigate to identify "the information necessary to substantiate the claim" not effectively pursued below, id. at 1918 (internal quotation marks omitted). An adequate investigation by federal habeas counsel is especially critical where, as here, petitioner's claim is that his prior counsel conducted an inadequate, unreasonably narrow investigation. See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 534, 538 (2003) (counsel's inadequate investigation did not reflect reasonable professional judgment and prejudiced the defendant at sentencing); see also ABA Death Penalty Guideline 1.1, cmt. at 933 ("Like trial counsel, counsel handling state collateral proceedings must undertake a thorough investigation into the facts surrounding all phases of the case.").In recognizing this obligation and defining its parameters, the Court has looked to prevailing norms of practice as reflected in ABA professional guidelines and standards. See, e.g., Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524 (finding counsel's investigation in connection with capital sentencing was unreasonable in light of "well-defined norms" discussed in ABA guidelines). The ABA guidelines and standards serve as "guides to determining what is reasonable," and what obligations are incumbent upon an attorney who agrees to undertake a capital9representation. Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 387; Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524; Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688; see also Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 396 (2000) (citing ABA Standards for Criminal Justice to support determination that "trial counsel did not fulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background").The importance of habeas counsel's duty to investigate is well-supported in the ABA Death Penalty Guidelines and the ABA Criminal Justice Standards. The ABA Death Penalty Guidelines "applied the clear requirements for investigation set forth in the earlier Standards to death penalty cases," providing explicit and "forceful directive[s]" for capital counsel. Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 387 n.7. "[T]hese Guidelines are not aspirational. Instead, they embody the current consensus about what is required to provide effective defense representation in capital cases." ABA Death Penalty Guideline 1.1, History of Guideline.Post-conviction counsel has an "ongoing obligation[]" to conduct a thorough and independent investigation of the case, and to review continually whether prior counsel's theory of the case should be modified in light of subsequent developments. ABA Death Penalty Guidelines 10.7(A), 10.15.1(E); see also Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 522 (discussing counsel's duty to conduct a thorough investigation). To fulfill this obligation, "[t]wo parallel tracks of postconviction investigation are required." ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.15.1, cmt. at 1086. One track focuses on "the capital case," including prior counsel's performance at trial and in any state post-10conviction proceedings. Id.; see also id. Guideline 10.7(B)(1) (counsel must investigate "the defense provided to the client at all prior phases of the case"). The other track "focuses on the client," with the goal of "assembling a more-thorough biography of the client than was known at the time of trial," which allows counsel to identify "mitigation that was not presented previously." Id. Guideline 10.15.1, cmt. at 1086. To develop potential claims at this stage, "collateral counsel cannot rely on the previously compiled record but must conduct a thorough, independent investigation." Id. at 1085. Indeed, to the extent counsel determines the official record of proceedings is not complete, counsel has a duty to "supplement it as appropriate." Id. Guideline 10.7(B)(2).Importantly, this Court has recognized that one reason the duty to investigate is essential is that it enables counsel to advise the client and to make strategic decisions regarding a representation. See, e.g., Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 523 ("[W]e focus on whether the investigation supporting counsel's decision not to introduce mitigating evidence of Wiggins' background was itself reasonable."); Williams, 529 U.S. at 396 (counsel's failure to uncover and present mitigating evidence at sentencing was not justifiable as a tactical decision because counsel had not "fulfill[ed] their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background"); McFarland, 512 U.S. at 855 ("The services of investigators and other experts may be critical in the preapplication phase of a habeas corpus proceeding, when possible claims and their factual bases are researched and identified.").11Investigation is "necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses," not only in the guilt stage but also at sentencing. Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 511.The ABA Death Penalty Guidelines likewise are clear that habeas counsel should conduct a thorough investigation before determining which claims are viable and should be raised in a petition. See ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.8(A)(2). After all,[c]ounsel cannot responsibly advise a client about the merits of different courses of action, the client cannot make informed decisions, and counsel cannot be sure of the client's competency to make such decisions, unless counsel has first conducted a thorough investigation with respect to both [the guilt and penalty] phases of the case.ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.7, cmt. at 1021. For this reason also, counsel may not decline to investigate based on a belief that investigation would be futile or even based on a client's expressed desires. See id.This Court also has held repeatedly thatconstitutional error may occur where counsel fails tothoroughly investigate a defendant's background inorder to identify and develop mitigating factors forsentencing. See, e.g., Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 385-86;Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534-35; Williams, 529 U.S. at393."Mitigating evidence unrelated to12dangerousness may alter the jury's selection of penalty, even if it does not undermine or rebut the prosecution's death-eligibility case." Williams, 529 U.S. at 398. Thus, "investigations into mitigating evidence `should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor."' Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524 (emphasis in Wiggins) (quoting ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 11.4.1(C) (1989)). "[A]mong the topics counsel should consider presenting," depending on the facts in a given case, "are medical history, educational history, employment and training history, family and social history, prior adult and juvenile correctional experience, and religious and cultural influences." Id. (emphasis in Wiggins) (citing ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 11.8.6 (1989)). Where prior counsel failed to adequately investigate potential mitigation factors, habeas counsel's investigation may be time-consuming, but is imperative and potentially outcome-determinative.The surpassing importance of the duty to investigate is demonstrated, crucially and unfortunately, by the fact that "inadequate investigation by defense attorneys . . . ha[s] contributed to wrongful convictions in both capital and non-capital cases." ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.7, cmt. at 1017. The duty to investigate is thus not unique to the capital context or to habeas proceedings. Counsel's professional obligations in the capital context stem from the broader obligation13of all criminal defense counsel "to conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and explore all avenues leading to" relevant facts. ABA Criminal Justice Standard 4-4.1(a).Still, in a capital case, counsel's "duty to investigate the case thoroughly . . . is intensified (as are many duties) by the unique nature of the death penalty." ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.7, cmt. at 1016. Moreover, in the capital context, even if guilt is determined correctly, inadequate investigation concerning the sentencing phase raises the risk that the death penalty will be imposed "in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty." Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605 (1978). The disturbingly high rate of error as to both guilt and sentence demonstrates that "the trial record is unlikely to provide either a complete or accurate picture of the facts and issues in the case" for a variety of reasons, including the possibility that "the trial attorney did not conduct an adequate investigation in the first instance." ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.15.1, cmt. at 1086.The importance of investigation in the federal habeas stage is also starkly illustrated by the numerous cases in which such investigation allowed counsel to develop claims that ultimately led to relief from a death sentence. This Court has vacated death sentences where investigation in federal habeas revealed a viable claim based on intellectual disability, see Brumfield v. Cain, 135 S. Ct. 2269, 2282-83 (2015), or on juror bias and prosecutorial misconduct, see Williams, 529 U.S. at 440 (2000). In both cases, state habeas courts had denied funding14for investigators to pursue the petitioner's claims. See Brumfield, 135 S. Ct. at 2275; Williams, 529 U.S. at 442.The following additional examples are drawn from the experience of attorneys representing capital petitioners through the ABA's Death Penalty Representation Project: Joe Lee Guy: Mr. Guy was four months away from a scheduled execution date when lawyers at Dorsey & Whitney took over his case. The firm's new investigation revealed, among other things, that the investigator hired by Mr. Guy's previous defense counsel had befriended the victim's mother, coached her in her testimony against Mr. Guy, and became the sole beneficiary of her estate worth between $500,000 and $750,000. See Guy v. Dretke, No. CIV.A. 5:00-CV-191-C, 2004 WL 1462196, at *1 (N.D. Tex. June 29, 2004). The new investigation also discovered significant mitigation evidence that had not been presented previously, including the facts that Mr. Guy (a) had an IQ of 77, (b) suffered traumatic childhood abuse at the hands of his mother, (c) was abandoned as a child by both parents, and (d) had an alcoholic father who was murdered. See Howard Witt, Death Row Inmate Wins Sympathy, Chi. Trib., June 23, 2004. After an evidentiary hearing, the federal district court granted habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel and remanded for a new penalty-phase trial. See15Guy, 2004 WL 1462196, at *2. Mr. Guy ultimately received a life sentence. Alberto Martinez Carreon: After state post-conviction relief was summarily denied,Manatt Phelps & Phillips took over the case.The firm conducted a full investigation withthe help of several experts and investigators,some of whom traveled to Mexico where Mr.Carreon was born. See Pet. for Review ofDenial of PCR at 51, Arizona v. Carreon, 2016WL 1603009 (Mar. 14, 2016) (pending). Theinvestigationdiscoveredsubstantialmitigation evidence never presented to thejury about Carreon's abusive, impoverishedchildhood in Tijuana. See id. Among otherthings, a relative who came to rescue Carreonas a child from one of his parents' violentfights reported that she had found him somalnourished that he was on the verge ofdeath and unable even to raise his head orarms. See id. at 64. The case is pending. Quintez Wren Hodges: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom took over Mr. Hodges's case in 2006 and conducted a full investigation of several claims not previously investigated. The federal district court vacated Mr. Hodges's death sentence on multiple grounds, finding that he was entitled to relief based on his showings that (a) the prosecution knowingly presented false testimony during the sentencing phase of the trial, (b) the jury was improperly instructed at sentencing, and (c) Mr. Hodges was prejudiced at sentencing16by the ineffective assistance of his counsel, who was suffering a mental breakdown at the time and conducted no investigation. Hodges v. Epps, No. 1:07CV66-MPM, 2010 WL 3655851, at *38-39 (N.D. Miss. Sept. 13, 2010), aff'd, 648 F.3d 283 (5th Cir. 2011).Were it not for the fact that they were represented by pro bono counsel that had the resources to investigate to develop their claims, Mr. Guy, Mr. Carreon, and Mr. Hodges would likely be dead or on death row today. But as Congress recognized, the system of justice in capital cases must not, and cannot, depend on the availability of pro bono services from law firms and lawyers willing and able to undertake an extensive financial commitment to ensure adequate investigation.55 As a practical matter, at any time, the number of attorneys able to undertake a capital habeas representation ­ including the required investigation ­ on a pro bono basis is limited. Notably, more than 80 percent of private attorneys are solo practitioners or practice in firms with 100 or fewer attorneys. Am. Bar Ass'n, Lawyer Demographics ­ Year 2016, http://goo.gl/CRsjXL. Because small and medium-sized firms often have higher staffing utilization levels and lower profit margins than large firms, it is more difficult for them to make an extensive, open-ended commitment ­ like that required by a capital habeas representation ­ without assurance of adequate compensation for their time and funding for reasonably necessary services. See ABA Standing Committee on Pro Bono and Public Service, Supporting Justice III: A Report on the Pro Bono Work of America's Lawyers, 5 (Mar. 2013). In the ABA's efforts to recruit pro bono counsel for capital cases, we have noted that inadequate funding for expert and investigative members of the defense team is a substantial deterrent to(cont'd)17These examples illustrate the devastating human cost, and cost to the legitimacy of our justice system, when investigations in capital habeas are frustrated.II. INVESTIGATION OFTEN REQUIRES SPECIALIZED SERVICES FOR WHICH INDIGENT PETITIONERS LACK FUNDSThe investigation required at the federal habeas stage often requires specialized services such as investigators, mitigation specialists, and mental health experts, especially when attorneys in prior stages failed to develop the facts relevant to potentially promising claims. This Court has recognized the need for these services, and Congress has provided funding to ensure access to these services for indigent petitioners. Professional guidelines make clear that, without funding for reasonably necessary services, it may become difficult or impossible for habeas counsel to fulfill their investigative obligations.To ensure that access to habeas counsel is a meaningful safeguard for due process ­ and that post-conviction proceedings in capital cases meaningfully examine the constitutionality of trials and appeals ­ defense counsel must have not only the requisite skills and experience but also the time and resources necessary to provide quality representation. Cf. Trevino, 133 S. Ct. at 1921 (counsel must have adequate time and resources to________________________ (cont'd from previous page) attorneys and firms deciding whether they are able to represent an indigent capital client.18ensure a "meaningful opportunity" to develop and present a claim of ineffective assistance at trial). For this reason, and because ineffective-assistance claims in particular "often require investigative work," Martinez, 566 U.S. at 11-12, "[t]he services of investigators and other experts may be critical in the preapplication phase of a habeas corpus proceeding, when possible claims and their factual bases are researched and identified," McFarland, 512 U.S. at 855.Ineffective assistance of counsel claims, by their nature, often are not obvious from a cold record, or even apparent from state habeas pleadings where state post-conviction counsel has failed to investigate. See Trevino, 133 S. Ct. at 1919; Martinez, 566 U.S. at 11-12. Failure of the federal courts to provide adequate funding for investigative services, including the services of mitigation specialists and mental health experts, "results in the inability to attract qualified counsel to take on capital cases and, where adequate counsel might be found, the inability of that counsel to conduct the necessary and thorough investigation of both guilt and penalty phase issues required at every stage of a capital case." Emily M. Olson-Gault, Testimony, Birmingham, Alabama Hearing Before the Judicial Conference of the United States Committee to Review the Criminal Justice Act Program, 3 (Feb. 18, 2016) (footnote omitted).As the Court also has recognized, Congress enacted Section 3599 to provide "enhanced rights of representation" for defendants and petitioners in capital cases, including "more money for19investigative and expert services." Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648, 659 (2012) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f)). Congress has done so "in light of what it calls `the seriousness of the possible penalty and . . . the unique and complex nature of the litigation.'" Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3599(d)). The enactment of Section 3599 "reflects a determination that quality legal representation is necessary" in capital proceedings to ensure "fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty." McFarland, 512 U.S. at 855, 859. Crucially, Congress knew that such legal representation would in many cases require "investigative, expert, or other services," and so provided for defense counsel's ability to obtain funding for such services where "reasonably necessary for the representation." 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f). Just as "Congress's provision of a right to counsel" under the statute "reflects a determination that quality legal representation is necessary in capital habeas corpus proceedings," the fact that the same statute provides for "`the defendant's attorneys to obtain such services' from the court," McFarland, 512 U.S. at 855, reflects Congress's determination that quality legal representation in some cases necessarily entails such services. The Court can "safely assume that [Congress] did not intend for the express requirement of counsel to be defeated," id. at 856, by interposing a restrictive rule that would deny services "reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant," 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f).This commonsense interpretation of the statute is confirmed by the history of Section 3599(f). When Congress initially enacted this statutory provision in 1988, there was substantial concern that identifying20counsel willing and able to represent death-row prisoners in federal habeas proceedings was becoming increasingly difficult. See 134 Cong. Rec. H7285 (daily ed. Sep. 8, 1988) (Statement of Rep. Conyers). When the provision was amended as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ("AEDPA"), Congress was acutely aware of the fact that funding for specialized services to support investigation was needed at the habeas stage. See, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec. S7819 (daily ed. June 7, 1995) (Statement of Sen. Biden) ("[T]he defendant needs the same tools available to him or her that a wealthy defendant would need or the prosecutor needs. . . . Do not be misled by the notion that the trial is over, therefore, there is no other factfinding to go on, you do not need an investigator."); id. at S7816-17 (Statement of Sen. Feingold) (noting "instances of States not providing sufficient resources to assigned defense counsel for proper investigation of a case" and the "significant disadvantage" at which such inadequate investigative resources puts capital defendants "[c]ompared to the resources available to an aggressive prosecutor"). Then-ABA President John J. Curtin, Jr., noted in his testimony that the Supreme Court's recent decision in McCleskey v. Zant had clarified "the intensive level of pre-filing investigation" that constitutes the due diligence standard for capital habeas attorneys. Habeas Corpus Issues: Hearing Before the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, 102nd Cong. 497-98 (July 17, 1991) (statement of John J. Curtin, Jr., ABA President).21"National standards on defense services have consistently recognized that quality representation cannot be rendered unless assigned counsel have access to adequate supporting services." ABA Death Penalty Guideline 4.1, cmt. at 955 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). While the need for such services may arise in a variety of criminal defense contexts, it "is particularly acute in death penalty cases." Id. Where support services are reasonably necessary, these services should be provided by persons independent of the government and counsel should have the right to communicate with them confidentially "to the same extent as would counsel paying such persons from private funds." Id. Guideline 4.1(B)(2).These services may be particularly important to a thorough investigation at the post-conviction stage. See id. Guideline 4.1, cmt. at 955. Investigators are often "indispensable to discovering and developing the facts that must be unearthed . . . in postconviction proceedings," both because they have specialized expertise that counsel lacks and because counsel often simply has too many other duties to discharge. Id. at 954. Likewise, mitigation specialists "possess clinical and informationgathering skills and training that most lawyers simply do not have," and the time and ability to gather and incorporate what may be critical information for the defense case. Id. at 959; see also ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.1 (capital habeas representation "requires enormous amounts of time, energy, and knowledge," and counsel ordinarily cannot be expected to shoulder that burden alone). Additionally, "[t]he circumstances of a particular22case will often require specialized research and expert consultation." Id. Guideline 10.7, cmt. at 1026. For example, where, as here, the petitioner "is a relatively recent immigrant, counsel must learn about," inter alia, "the circumstances of his upbringing in his country of origin." Id."In particular," given the prevalence of mental impairments and severely traumatic backgrounds among those convicted of capital crimes, "mental health experts are essential to defending capital cases." Id. Guideline 4.1, cmt. at 956. "Evidence concerning the defendant's mental status is relevant to numerous issues that arise at various junctures during [capital] proceedings," and "the defendant's psychological and social history and his emotional and mental health are often of vital importance to the jury's decision at the punishment phase." Id.; see, e.g., Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 40 (2009) (reversing denial of habeas relief where counsel failed to investigate and present evidence related to, inter alia, defendant's "mental health or mental impairment"). Empirical research confirms that mental health evidence, if competently documented and credibly presented, frequently (and appropriately) "is considered by jurors to be highly mitigating." John H. Blume et al., Competent Capital Representation: The Necessity of Knowing and Heeding What Jurors Tell Us About Mitigation, 36 Hofstra L. Rev. 1035, 1039 (2008). Thus, where mental health is at issue, "a psychologist or other mental health expert may well be a needed member of the defense team" or at least a mental health evaluation may be needed. ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.4, cmt. at 1004; see also id. Guideline234.1, cmt. at 956 ("Creating a competent and reliable mental health evaluation consistent with prevailing standards of practice is a time-consuming and expensive process.").Thus, depending on the circumstances of a given case, whether an investigation is as thorough as Wiggins requires may depend upon counsel's ability to access reasonably necessary support services. See ABA Death Penalty Guideline 4.1(B). Indeed, in Wiggins it was a licensed social worker who uncovered "powerful" mitigating evidence regarding "petitioner's bleak life history" that this Court found might have changed the sentencing decision if only it had been presented to the jury. Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 516, 534. Commenters suggest that the need for specialized services has only grown in more recent years. See, e.g., Hannah Jacobs Wiseman, Pro Bono Publico: The Growing Need for Expert Aid, 60 S.C. L. Rev. 493, 495 (2008) ("Increasingly, experts are necessities in legal cases, and low income individuals without access to quality expert testimony are at a strong disadvantage."); Craig M. Cooley, Mapping the Monster's Mental Health and Social History: Why Capital Defense Attorneys and Public Defender Death Penalty Units Require the Services of Mitigation Specialists, 30 Okla. City U. L. Rev. 23, 119 (2005) ("In the end, given the enormity of mitigation investigations and what is at stake, capital defense attorneys and public defender death penalty units need to increasingly rely on their colleagues in the mental health and social work communities to effectively represent capital defendants during the penalty phase.").24The ABA Death Penalty Representation Project has found that "[w]hen counsel fails to provide effective representation, it is often due to limitations such as fee caps and the failure to fully fund expert and investigative members of the defense team." Emily M. Olson-Gault, Testimony, Birmingham, Alabama Hearing Before the Judicial Conference of the United States Committee to Review the Criminal Justice Act Program, 3 (Feb. 18, 2016) (emphasis added). In light of Congress's provision for funding of reasonably necessary services and this Court's recognition of the importance of such services in federal habeas, there is no reason habeas counsel should be put at risk of having to violate professional norms by forgoing the assistance of mitigation specialists, investigators, or mental health experts whose services are reasonably necessary to a representation.III. THE FIFTH CIRCUIT'S "SUBSTANTIAL NEED" TEST BLOCKS ESSENTIAL FUNDING AND PREVENTS COUNSEL FROM MEETING THEIR ETHICAL OBLIGATIONSThe Fifth Circuit's "substantial need" rule effectively denies counsel necessary resources to conduct the investigation that is needed to meet minimum professional standards for effective representation. In failing to appreciate the importance of investigation to litigation strategy and the development of claims, it frustrates and even blocks such factual development. Investigation is essential to capital prisoners receiving full and fair consideration of the constitutionality of their convictions and death sentences. Counsel taking on25the extensive burden of a capital habeas representation should be able to do so secure in the knowledge that they will be able to meet their professional duties as attorneys.The Fifth Circuit interprets the language "reasonably necessary" in 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f) to require that the petitioner demonstrate a "`substantial need' for such services to pursue a claim." Ayestas v. Stephens, 817 F.3d 888, 896 (5th Cir. 2016). Not only does the "substantial need" rule appear on its face to interpose a higher standard than the statute requires, but as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit it effectively constitutes a preliminary determination of the merits of the claim that the services are sought to support. See id. at 896 (to obtain funds under § 3599(f) "[t]here must be a viable constitutional claim, not a meritless one"); id. at 898 (rejecting funding "because Ayestas cannot show that his claim is viable"). Requiring counsel to prove the merits of a claim without funding, in order to obtain funding to investigate the merits of that claim, is circular. It is also self-evidently unfair and impracticable, and it impermissibly jeopardizes the availability of funds that Congress has authorized for the performance of investigative functions that this Court recognizes are essential.The decision in this case presents a striking example of the Fifth Circuit's paradoxical reasoning. Mr. Ayestas argued below, relying on Martinez and Trevino, that to prove his prior lawyers were ineffective "he must be allowed to develop and discover what his prior lawyers should have developed or discovered." Id. at 895. In short, Mr.26Ayestas did what other prisoners bringing ineffective-assistance claims based on inadequate investigation have done after Martinez: he pleaded and briefed that claim without having factually developed all aspects of it ­ especially the prejudice showing, which necessarily requires an understanding of what an adequate investigation would have uncovered ­ then moved under 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f) for the resources he needed, including a specific, detailed 20-page investigative plan created by an experienced mitigation specialist. Petitioners who fail to bring such claims in a timely manner risk waiving them. See, e.g., In re Paredes, 587 F. App''x 805, 824-26 (5th Cir. 2014) (affirming denial of relief and denying stay of execution where Rule 60(b) motion based on Martinez and Trevino was not timely filed); Fowler v. Joyner, 753 F.3d 446, 466 (4th Cir. 2014) ("[E]ven if such Martinez-based claims existed, they have been waived by [petitioner's] failure to raise the issue below . . . ."). Mr. Ayestas's briefing identified several critical areas of further investigation that were needed, but of course could not identify more specifically how prior counsel's failure to pursue those investigations would have changed the picture at sentencing until the facts were developed through a thorough investigation during federal proceedings utilizing the necessary specialists.The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that Mr. Ayestas "indeed offered" a "substantiated argument, not speculation, about what [his] prior counsel did or omitted doing." Ayestas, 817 F.3d at 896. The court's determination nevertheless that a mitigation specialist was not reasonably necessary, even to27support a "substantiated argument," because the petitioner could not show that his claim ultimately was "viable" and not "meritless" precludes development of the claim by prejudging its merits. In particular, the denial of funding for a mental health evaluation precludes the development of evidence to show the impact of Mr. Ayestas's sincediagnosed schizophrenia on his mental state at the time of the crime. See id. at 897-98. The Fifth Circuit ultimately recognized that Mr. Ayestas had not in fact been examined by a psychologist ­ correcting an erroneous finding on which the original panel opinion appeared to rely significantly, id. at 897 ­ and reiterated its decision only as to prejudice. Ayestas v. Stephens, 826 F.3d 214, 215 (5th Cir. 2016); see also Ayestas, 817 F.3d at 896 (interpreting the district court's ruling "as being that any evidence of ineffectiveness, even if found, would not support relief"). Thus, even where the Fifth Circuit acknowledges ­ or at least does not rule out the possibility ­ that the record from state proceedings is infected with prior counsel's ineffectiveness, a petitioner may not access the funds authorized by § 3599(f) unless he can prove based on that infected record that he was prejudiced by not having his claim investigated.66 In Texas, as in numerous other states, the state habeas process frequently allows for only a stunted investigation, partly due to strict deadlines. AM. BAR ASS'N, TEXAS DEATH PENALTY ASSESSMENT REPORT at xiii. As the ABA's state assessment team found in its research, "due to ineffective trial, appellate, and state habeas counsel, many inmates with claims of constitutional magnitude may be executed without a court(cont'd)28As at least one district court in the Fifth Circuit has recently acknowledged, the Circuit's rule forces petitioners to "face[] something of a `catch 22' in having to demonstrate that there is some relevant evidence he could discover without first having the funding to pursue that evidence.'" Order at 4, Tong v. Stephens, No. 4:10-cv-2355 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 22, 2014). By virtually guaranteeing the denial of necessary resources to perform one of capital habeas counsel's primary functions ­ investigation ­ the Fifth Circuit's approach not only deprives capital habeas petitioners of reasonably necessary services under 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f), but also effectively deprives them of their statutorily guaranteed right to counsel. In so doing, the Fifth Circuit's standard threatens to defeat this Court's jurisprudence and Congress's intent:Title 18 U.S.C. § 3599 entitles indigent defendants to the appointment of counsel in capital cases, including habeas corpus proceedings. By providing indigent capital defendants with a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel in these proceedings, Congress has recognized that federal________________________ (cont'd from previous page) ever reviewing their case on the merits." Id. at xii. The Fifth Circuit's restrictive standard for authorizing funding for reasonably necessary support services thus compounds an already fraught state process and raises a serious risk that an inmate may be executed without ever having effective assistance in presenting a claim of actual innocence or mitigation.29habeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in promoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.Christeson v. Roper, 135 S. Ct. 891, 893 (2015) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Trevino, 133 S. Ct. at 1916-17 (2013) (recognizing "the historic importance of federal habeas corpus proceedings as a method for preventing individuals from being held in custody in violation of federal law").The Fifth Circuit's approach prevents counsel from discharging their ethical responsibilities, frustrates statutory guarantees of representation, and jeopardizes due process. If the decision below is allowed to stand, the "substantial need" test will threaten to make Martinez and Trevino a dead letter for indigent petitioners. Counsel will rarely if ever be able to show more than a "substantiated argument" regarding both deficient performance and prejudice before obtaining funds necessary to develop the claims. Consequently, counsel will not be able to discharge their professional obligations in federal habeas representation, and the statutory guarantees of 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f) will effectively be unavailable.Such an outcome threatens more than attorneys' ability to act consistent with professional standards. It threatens also the integrity, fairness, and reliability of the habeas process, of capital sentences, and ultimately of our criminal justice system.30 CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae American Bar Association respectfully urges this Court to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: CLIFFORD M. SLOAN DONALD P. SALZMAN BRENDAN B. GANTSAttorneys for Amicus CuriaeJune 16, 2017LINDA KLEIN 
THIS COURT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY REVIEW THE THIRD CIRCUIT'S UNPRECEDENTED DECISION TO DENY CONSTITUTIONAL HABEAS PROTECTION TO PERSONS ON U.S. SOILA. Judicial Review of Executive and Legislative Action Is Essential to a Functioning Democracy.Under our constitutional scheme, judicial review serves as a bulwark against impingement of the rule of law. DOT v. Ass'n of Am. R.R., 135 S. Ct. 1225, 1246 (2015) ("The `check' the judiciary provides to maintain our separation of powers is enforcement of the rule of law through judicial review."). The Framers envisioned a system in which the powers of the U.S. government would be spread among three7branches of government, each with the power to check the others. Judicial review of legislative and executive action is necessary to keep the political branches accountable and maintain the proper balance of powers. See Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 761 (1982).The genius of this structure is that it "serves not only to make Government accountable but also to secure individual liberty." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 742; see Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 756 (1996) (noting that "[e]ven before the birth of this country, separation of powers was known to be a defense against tyranny") (citation omitted); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) ("[T]he Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty."). By helping to ensure that no branch aggrandizes power at the expense of any other, judicial review has played a crucial role in strengthening the separation of powers and protecting individual liberty throughout our Nation's history.That longstanding commitment to judicial review helps explain why this Court has "constantly emphasized the fundamental importance of the writ of habeas corpus in our constitutional scheme." Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 485 (1969). It "must never be forgotten that the writ of habeas corpus is the precious safeguard of personal liberty and there is no higher duty than to maintain it unimpaired." Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U.S. 19, 26 (1939). Moreover, that view is consistent with the views of the Framers, who believed that the right to the habeas writ is "perhaps greater securit[y] to liberty and republicanism" than any of the separate rights8mentioned in the Bill of Rights. THE FEDERALIST No. 84 (Alexander Hamilton).B. The Writ of Habeas Corpus Extends To Any Persons Within the United States, Including Aliens Subject To Removal.Certain constitutionally protected rights, including the right to habeas review, have not been limited to U.S. citizens.This Court has long held that many of the substantive guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect all "persons" within the United States, regardless of citizenship or status. For example, in Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 (1976), this Court explained that while aliens may not be "entitled to enjoy all the advantages of citizenship," "[e]ven one whose presence in this country is unlawful, involuntary, or transitory" was still entitled to fundamental constitutional protections. Id. at 77­78; see also Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 374 (1886) (holding that an ordinance used to discriminate against persons from China violated the Fourteenth Amendment). One of those constitutional protections is due process for aliens in removal proceedings. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001) ("But once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to all `persons' within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent."); see also, e.g., Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32-34 (1982) (affirming procedural due process rights in exclusion proceedings). Although Congress unquestionably enjoys broad powers to regulate9immigration, that power cannot trump individual constitutional protections.In recognition of those fundamental protections, as well as the essential role of judicial review, this Court has repeatedly affirmed "the strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action," including in the context of removal proceedings. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 298; see also, e.g., Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986); McNary, 498 U.S. at 498; Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988). Without such a presumption, serious separation-of-powers questions would arise. Webster, 486 U.S. at 603. And with respect to habeas corpus specifically, this Court has recognized that the Suspension Clause "unquestionably require[s]" judicial review in deportation cases. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 300-301 (internal quotation marks omitted).This Court's prior affirmation that Suspension Clause protection extends to noncitizens within U.S. borders is consistent with English common law, which recognized that the writ ran to all citizens and nonenemy foreigners within the realm. See, e.g., Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 746, 771, 779; see also id. at 746 ("[A]t the absolute minimum the Clause protects the writ as it existed when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Ex Parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75, 93-94 (1807) ("[F]or the meaning of the term habeas corpus, resort may unquestionably be had to the common law . . . ."). For example, at common law the writ was held to apply to aliens who were located overseas, as it was one of the main defenses for (non-English) sailors facing impressment10into the Royal Navy. Kevin Costello, Habeas Corpus and Military and Naval Impressment, 1756-1816, 29 J. LEGAL HIST. 215 (2008).Accordingly, it is no surprise that this Court has continued to make the writ available to any person--citizen or not--within the United States (or other areas under U.S. control). Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001); Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 779. Petitioners fall squarely within the group of persons that the Suspension Clause protects.C. The Third Circuit's Unprecedented And Erroneous Decision Presents A Matter Of Exceptional Importance.The ABA agrees with Petitioners that the Third Circuit erred in denying them access to the writ of habeas corpus. That error is one of fundamental importance.The Third Circuit's approach--barring aliens who have already entered the United States from invoking the protections of the Suspension Clause--is inconsistent with the Suspension Clause's design to "ensure[] that, except during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary will have a time-tested device, the writ, to maintain the `delicate balance of governance' that is itself the surest safeguard of liberty." Boumediene, 553 at U.S. 745 (citing Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (plurality opinion)). Prohibiting aliens already within the United States from invoking the Suspension Clause (at least without requiring Congress to formally suspend the writ) would bar those persons from access to "a vital instrument for the protection of11individual liberty." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 743, 745 (citing Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 536).The Third Circuit should not have relied on the Government's broad plenary power to exclude "alien[s] seeking initial admission to the United States" as its basis for prohibiting Petitioners from invoking the Suspension Clause. Pet. App. 48a (quoting Landon, 459 U.S. at 32). This Court has long recognized that aliens within or controlled by the United States may seek relief from immigration decisions through a writ of habeas corpus. See, e.g., Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 687­88 (concluding habeas review is available for aliens in deportation proceedings); cf. Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 771 (holding that persons held at Guantanamo Bay "are entitled to the privilege of habeas corpus to challenge the legality of their detention"). And aliens "on the threshold of initial entry" or "`assimilated to (that) status' for constitutional purposes," Shaughnessy v. U.S. ex. rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 212, 214 (quoting Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 599 (1953)), could also historically seek habeas relief, see, e.g., id. at 208 (considering an alien's challenge to his exclusion on habeas review); Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, 142 U.S. 651, 660 (1892) ("An alien immigrant, prevented from landing by any such officer claiming authority to do so under an act of Congress, and thereby restrained of his liberty, is doubtless entitled to a writ of habeas corpus to ascertain whether the restraint is lawful.").It is the right of an alien to certain Due Process protections, not his or her right to habeas relief, that has historically driven "[t]he distinction between an alien who has effected an entry into the United12States and one who has never entered ***." Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 693; see also, e.g., id. ("But once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to all `persons' within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent."); Mezei, 345 U.S. at 212 ("It is true that aliens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law.").Moreover, treating aliens within the United States as equivalent to those standing on the "threshold of initial entry" undercuts the rule of law by proscribing judicial review for aliens who fall within certain arbitrary categories, such as those "very near" a border or "within hours of surreptitiously entering," Pet. App. 28a, 52a. Such an approach legitimizes the "manipulation" of the Suspension Clause, thereby undercutting the purpose of habeas review as "an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 765­66. And it "would permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government, leading to a regime in which Congress and the President, not this Court, say `what the law is.'" Id. at 765 (citing Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803)).Proscribing judicial review for certain aliens based on such arbitrary distinctions also replaces a bright-line rule--an alien's location within or without the border of the United States--with an imprecise13and vague alternative that would necessitate future litigation as courts wrestle "to evaluate the Suspension Clause rights of an alien whose presence in the United States goes meaningfully beyond that of Petitioners here." Pet. App. 58a n.30. The longterm implications of such a change are considerable. Although current regulations limit the scope of expedited review principally to those aliens encountered within 14 days of entry without inspection and within 100 air miles of any U.S. international land border, Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 69 Fed. Reg. 48,877-01 (Aug. 11, 2004), the statutory provisions potentially encompass any alien who cannot show presence for up to two years prior to the determination of inadmissibility, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii). Accordingly, leaving undisturbed the Third Circuit's determination that these aliens are not entitled to invoke the Suspension Clause implicates an even broader group of aliens.As the ABA has long recognized, "[f]or many noncitizens, it is the right to go before a judge that differentiates the United States from other countries that lack the same commitment to the rule of law." American Bar Association, Policy Report 114D, at 3 (adopted 2010).4 The ABA has likewise maintained4 In furtherance of its mission and goals, the ABA adopts policies that represent the ABA's official position on numerous legislative, national, and professional issues.

Letter from Robert D. Evans, Dir., Gov't Affairs Office, Am. Bar Ass'n, to the Senate (Apr. 4, 2006).

 Requiring that attorneys litigate a capital habeas case pro bono, or subject to unduly restrictive fee caps, undermines the court's important role of safeguarding4the statutory right to counsel under 18 U.S.C. § 3599. It also conflicts with numerous ABA standards, including the 2003 ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases ("ABA Death Penalty Guidelines")2 and the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice ("ABA Criminal Justice Standards").3 This approach violates important principles and is unworkable in practice.I. Failure to Adequately Compensate Counsel and Fund the Defense Leads to Inadequate Representation in Capital Habeas Proceedings Ensuring that access to counsel truly safeguards due process, and that post-conviction proceedings in capital cases meaningfully examine the constitutionality of trials and appeals, requires that defense counsel have not only the skills and experience but also the time and resources necessary to provide high-quality legal representation. When the level of compensation for defense counsel is inadequate, "[t]he likely result is the denial of effective legal representation for those unable to afford counsel." ABA Criminal Justice Standard 5-1.6, cmt. at 27. This lesson, drawn from the ABA's extensive experience, is amply and unfortunately borne out in the experiences of states that have failed to fully fund indigent defense.The integrity of our criminal justice system demands that indigent persons receive quality legal representation, and it is the responsibility of government to2 Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913 (Am. Bar Ass'n 2003). 3 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services (3d ed. 1992).5fund such representation. See ABA Criminal Justice Standard 5-1.6 ("Government has the responsibility to fund the full cost of quality legal representation for all eligible persons."). "Assigned counsel should be compensated for all hours necessary to provide quality legal representation," should be paid promptly and "at a reasonable hourly rate," and "should be reimbursed for their reasonable out-ofpocket expenses." ABA Criminal Justice Standard 5-2.4. Additionally, "when representation is provided in unusually protracted or complicated cases," compensation should exceed that provided in a typical case. ABA Criminal Justice Standard 5-2.4, cmt. at 41 & n.8.These principles are never more essential than in capital cases. Representing a client in such a case ­ by definition, a complex engagement where a person's life hangs in the balance ­ requires of all members of the defense team "extraordinary responsibilities and commitment," for which any reasonable compensation system must account. ABA Death Penalty Guideline 9.1, cmt. at 988. The ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, which are widely accepted as the national standards for capital defense, see, e.g., Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 387 n.7 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003), provide that each jurisdiction "must ensure funding for the full cost of high quality legal representation," ABA Death Penalty Guideline 9.1(A). Failure to do so, especially in the capital context, "make[s] it6economically unattractive for competent attorneys to seek assignments and expend the time and effort a case may require." Id., cmt. at 986.Thus, attorneys representing clients in capital proceedings must be fully compensated "for actual time and service performed." Id. Guideline 9.1(B)(3). "Flat fees, caps on compensation, and lump-sum contracts are improper in death penalty cases," id. Guideline 9.1(B)(1), because of "the adverse effect such schemes have upon effective representation," id., cmt. at 987. Compensation limits that fail to take into account the unusually complex nature of capital habeas representation are particularly inappropriate. See ABA Criminal Justice Standard 5-2.4, cmt. at 41 & n.8. But these types of arrangements also "should be discouraged" because, more generally, a "primary objective of the payment system should be to encourage vigorous defense representation." Id. at 40. Imposing artificial limits on compensation may create a conflict of interest, as attorneys are forced to choose where to allocate resources in the face of incentives against "doing more than what is minimally necessary to qualify for the flat payment." Id. In fact, the ABA Death Penalty Representation Project has found that "[w]hen counsel fails to provide effective representation, it is often due to limitations such as fee caps and the failure to fully fund expert and investigative members of the defense team." Emily M. Olson-Gault, Testimony, Birmingham, Alabama7Hearing Before the Judicial Conference of the United States Committee to Review the Criminal Justice Act Program, 3 (Feb. 18, 2016).Unfortunately, in many jurisdictions ­ including Florida, Louisiana, Utah, and Missouri ­ inadequate funding has indeed led to woefully inadequate representation and created conflicts of interest. The state of Florida sought to cut costs by closing a public office that handled post-conviction representation in capital cases, attempting to pass its cases off to private attorneys subject to strict funding caps. See Maas v. Olive, 992 So.2d 196, 199 (Fla. 2008); Carl Jones, State Officials Appeal to Florida Supreme Court on Attorney Fee Caps, Daily Bus. Rev., May 15, 2006. Following the change, Florida experienced a sudden, worst-in-thenation rash of missed filing deadlines in capital habeas cases. See Lugo v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 750 F.3d 1198, 1212-13 (11th Cir. 2014). One Justice of the Florida Supreme Court observed that too few private attorneys had the necessary experience and skills to handle capital habeas cases, and that some private attorneys attempting to provide representation in this system had filed "the worst briefs that I have read" and performed "the worst lawyering I've seen."4 Similar problems have arisen from a lack of adequate funding in Louisiana, where at least one public defender's office has been forced to refuse representation of some cases4 Florida Supreme Court Judge Criticizes "Worst Lawyering I've Seen," Miami Herald, Jan. 28, 2005, http://goo.gl/1L85pE.8because woefully inadequate funding has created conflicts of interest.5 In Utah, the prevalence of "fixed fee contracting" has been found primarily responsible for conflicts of interest since "defense providers have negative financial incentives to dispose of cases quickly, rather than effectively." Sixth Amendment Center, The Right to Counsel in Utah: An Assessment of Trial-Level Indigent Defense Services, iii (Oct. 2015). The problem is compounded in jurisdictions that include expenses for investigators and experts in the flat fee because seeking such services effectively reduces a lawyer's take-home pay. See id. at vi-vii. Finally, in Missouri, which spends less per attorney on its public defender system than any other state, excessive caseloads may effectively force public defenders to violate professional and ethical requirements, but legislation passed to address the problem was vetoed by the governor.6Mr. Christeson, whose case began in Missouri state court, has already experienced the effective denial of counsel that occurs when attorneys are conflicted between pursuing their own livelihoods and protecting the rights of their condemned client. See Christeson, 135 S. Ct. at 894-95. The Supreme Court held that Mr. Christeson was entitled to the assistance of substitute counsel in pressing5 Ben Myers, Orleans Public Defender's Office to Begin Refusing Serious Felony Cases Tuesday, Times-Picayune, Jan. 11, 2016. 6 Am. Bar Ass'n, Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems: The Missouri Death Penalty Assessment Report: An Analysis of Missouri's Death Penalty Laws, Procedures, and Practices, 201, 207 (Apr. 2012).9his equitable-tolling claim, see id. at 896, and that even though Christeson "faces a host of procedural obstacles," the district court had abused its discretion by not allowing substitute counsel "to investigate and file a Rule 60(b) motion" on his behalf, id. at 895. When counsel then attempted to do so, however, the district court authorized only minimal funds ­ a small fraction of the amount requested. The court refused to explain its reasons for denying counsel's detailed funding request, but cited In re Carlyle, 644 F.3d 694 (8th Cir. 2011), for the notion that attorneys should represent capital inmates in post-conviction proceedings pro bono. See Christeson v. Roper, No. 4:04-CV-08004-W-DW, slip op. at 21 n.10 (W.D. Mo. Mar. 8, 2016). Yet Carlyle ­ in which the Chief Judge responded to a letter from counsel who had represented an indigent prisoner in state clemency proceedings ­ decided only that a Chief Judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review the district court's reduction of a CJA voucher. See 644 F.3d at 698. That opinion does not support the district court's decision below, and should not be read in sweeping terms.The district court's decision here is also troubling because the court did not provide any reason to justify the denial of funding other than its reference to the notion that attorneys should represent capital inmates in their post-conviction appeals pro bono. Rather than seriously evaluate, in light of the nature and requirements of the case, counsel's proposed $161,000 budget ­ complete with10detailed explanations for the various line items and specific requests for expertfunding to facilitate evaluation of Mr. Christeson's mental impairments ­ the courtessentially ignored that budget and set an extremely low $10,000 flat fee with no other reasoning at all.7 The court's ruling threatens to deprive Mr. Christeson oncemore of quality, conflict-free representation, even after a Supreme Court decisionspecifically providing for such counsel.The experiences of states that fail to fully fund indigent representationillustrate the dangers of relying on inadequately compensated counsel, especially incapital cases. The Judicial Conference of the United States recognizes the"complex, demanding, and protracted nature" of capital habeas proceedings, Guideto Judiciary Policy, Vol. 7 Defender Services § 620.10.20 ("Habeas CorpusProceedings"), and urges judges to "ensure adequate compensation forrepresentation provided," id. § 630.20 ("Adequate Compensation of Counsel"), yetthe district court here authorized only minimal funds. "When a lawyer is forced toproceed with a capital defense matter with a limited budget, . . . [t]he lawyer must7 The district court's subsequent statement regarding its budget order is also troubling. The court's remarkable statement that "no amount of money would change the fact that original counsel simply miscalculated AEDPA's one-year deadline," Christeson v. Roper, No. 04-cv-08004-W-DW, slip op. at 20 (W.D. Mo. Mar. 8, 2016), betrays a view that Christeson's motion is futile, a view the Supreme Court explicitly rejected, see Christeson, 135 S. Ct. at 895. The court's focus on the page count of Christeson's papers ignores the need for investigation, which is especially notable given that Christeson's prior counsel had litigated but not investigated.11work every day knowing that the financial demands of life and legal practice may ultimately force her to choose between working uncompensated on a capital case and working to keep the lights running in her office." David Rudovsky, Gideon and the Effective Assistance of Counsel: The Rhetoric and the Reality, 32 Law & Ineq. 371, 398 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted). To ensure quality representation, the government must not force such a choice. II. Treating Pro Bono Representation As a Substitute For AdequatelyFunded Defense Counsel is Contrary to Important Principles Attempting to justify the provision of inadequate funding to defense counsel by relying on attorneys' pro bono obligations is inconsistent with the principles underlying state-provided counsel. Indeed, in providing for funding under the CJA and higher funding for capital cases under AEDPA, Congress recognized the link between adequate representation and adequate compensation. Congress has recognized repeatedly and for decades that public funding is required to ensure adequate representation of indigent persons in the criminal justice system. In enacting the CJA, Congress acknowledged the unacceptable limitations of an ad-hoc system of uncompensated counsel and therefore authorized funding to induce the participation of the private bar. Indeed, even before the Supreme Court decided Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), most states had begun to reject a system under which the representation of the indigent "ha[d] traditionally been entrusted to members of the bar serving without12compensation," Neal H. Brockmeyer, Attorney and Client--Compensation of Trial Counsel Appointed for Indigent Defendants, 49 Calif. L. Rev. 954, 954 (1961). As courts have recognized, "a narrow and miserly construction" of the CJA ultimately hinders its ability to ensure effective representation because "[o]nly if the practicing bar is encouraged to participate broadly and enthusiastically in the defense of indigent criminal defendants can the promise of the Act ever become reality." United States v. Bailey, 581 F.2d 984, 989 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (citation omitted); see also Don D. Buchwald, Indigent Criminal Defendants Constitutional Right to Compensated Counsel, 52 Cornell L. Rev. 433, 439 (1967) (based on the statute and legislative history, "it would appear that passage of the Criminal Justice Act was prompted by the belief" that counsel provided with only nominal compensation or no compensation "often provides the indigent defendant with only `minimal' representation").Accordingly, the CJA authorized hourly fees and expenses for courtappointed lawyers and for experts. See 18 U.S.C. § 3006A. Though the legislation included fee caps, it also authorized the provision of funds in excess of those caps based on the character or duration of the services required. See id. §§ 3006A(d)(3),133006A(e)(3).8 Indeed, Congress subsequently amended the Act to authorize theJudicial Conference to raise funding levels. See id. § 3006A(d)(1).In enacting AEDPA, Congress authorized higher funding levels for attorneysrepresenting indigent clients in capital cases, including habeas proceedings, anddid not impose any statutory maximum level for those attorneys' fees. See 18U.S.C. § 3599. As the Supreme Court has recognized, the statute "grants federalcapital defendants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of representation,in light of what it calls `the seriousness of the possible penalty and . . . the uniqueand complex nature of the litigation.'" Martel, 132 S. Ct. at 1284-85 (quoting 18U.S.C. § 3599(d)). Thus, in AEDPA, Congress reiterated and sought further toeffect its "determination that quality legal representation is necessary in all capitalproceedings to foster fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty."Id. at 1285 (internal quotation marks omitted). Notably, AEDPA's legislativehistory reveals a substantial concern that the CJA's compensation provisions were8 To be sure, in the CJA, Congress did not provide that an attorney who takes on an indigent client's case is entitled to his market rate, however high, for however many hours he might spend on a case. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 633 F.2d 739, 741 (7th Cir. 1980). Congress was mindful of the history of pro bono legal representation and did not design the CJA with "monetary enrichment" in mind, or to provide a "profit center" for attorneys. Id. It does not follow, however, and Congress did not intend, that attorneys should be required to forego compensation altogether for some or all activities required of defense counsel, or that attorneys' pro bono obligations may be invoked broadly to justify denials of adequate defense funds. Attorneys must be fully compensated "for actual time and service performed." ABA Death Penalty Guideline 9.1(B)(3).14inadequate in capital cases and had led to a shortage of qualified attorneys willing to handle capital cases at every stage, including federal habeas review. See, e.g., Habeas Corpus Reform: Hearings on S. 88, S. 1757, and S. 1760 Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, United States Senate, 101st Cong. 121, 136 (1990) (statement of Donald P. Lay, Chief Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit).Along with other commentators, the ABA has consistently emphasized the pitfalls of attempting to rely on volunteer representation in the criminal justice system and advocated for full funding of defense counsel, especially in capital cases. In public hearings preceding the enactment of AEDPA, then-ABA President Stanley Chauvin, Jr. observed that it was "senseless" to believe that low attorneys' fees would "attract the kind of high quality representation that is essential for capital litigation," and cautioned that underfunding creates a risk that counsel will "shortchange the client" by not spending necessary time. Id. (statement of Stanley Chauvin, Jr., President of the ABA). A previous ABA president, testifying regarding the proposed CJA, explained that, in practice, the burden of representing indigent clients in the criminal justice system was spread among relatively few members of the bar, partly because many attorneys were not sufficiently wellversed in criminal law to render an adequate defense. See Criminal Justice Act of 1963 (Public Defender): Hearings on S. 63 and S. 1057 Before the S. Comm. on15the Judiciary, 88th Cong. 81-82 (1963) ("Senate CJA Hearings") (statement of Sylvester C. Smith, President of the ABA). ABA materials submitted to Congress stressed that "[t]he lawyer himself should not fear indigency while defending the indigent," and expressed concern that indigent defendants forced to rely on uncompensated or nominally compensated counsel might be overmatched by government attorneys. Id. at 49 (ABA Journal article, submitted by Sam J. Ervin, Jr., U.S. Senator from N.C.). Other commenters echoed these concerns and similarly emphasized the public nature of indigent-defendant representation. See, e.g., id. at 207 (Excerpts submitted by Roman Hruska, U.S. Senator from Neb., from the report of the Att'y Gen.'s Comm. on Poverty & the Administration of Criminal Justice) (representation of indigent defendants is "a public concern of high importance," not a charitable activity).In addition to these concerns, it is important to note that forcing attorneys to help the government fulfill its obligation to provide counsel also diverts scarce pro bono resources away from other worthy goals, such as helping to alleviate the desperate need for pro bono legal services in civil cases and other settings in which the state has not undertaken to provide representation. See generally Legal Servs. Corp., Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-Income Americans (Sept. 2009). At least 80 percent of those who16need legal help in civil cases do not receive it. See Carolyn Lamm, Finding New Ways to Help, ABA Journal (Oct. 2, 2009).An attorney representing Mr. Christeson in this complicated capital habeas case requiring substantial attorney hours and expenditures should be granted compensation that is adequate for the task. Mr. Christeson's counsel must "investigate and file a Rule 60(b) motion" addressing the fact-intensive issue of equitable tolling, Christeson, 135 S. Ct. at 895, which in this case includes presenting evidence of Mr. Christeson's intellectual deficits and describing how those deficits may have affected his ability to file a timely petition for habeas corpus. See, e.g., Hunter v. Ferrell, 587 F.3d 1304, 1309-10 (11th Cir. 2009) (equitable tolling claim raised "factual issue as to whether a causal connection exists between [the petitioner's] mental impairment and his inability to file a timely §2254 petition"). Thus, in this case "vigorous defense representation" requires counsel to conduct an "unusually protracted or complicated" investigation. ABA Criminal Justice Standard 5-2.4, Commentary at 40-41 & n.8. Ensuring that Mr. Christeson receives the quality, conflict-free legal representation to which the Supreme Court has made clear he is entitled requires that counsel be fully compensated for the performance of those responsibilities. See Christeson, 135 S. Ct. at 896 (holding that Mr. Christenson is entitled to substitute counsel to address the issues that could not be raised while his initial counsel operated under a17conflict of interest); ABA Death Penalty Guideline 9.1, cmt. at 988 (the legal system must fully compensate defense counsel, particularly in capital cases, so that counsel may provide the legal representation required by ABA Guidelines).The federal government departed decades ago from a volunteer-based model for the representation of indigent persons in criminal cases, especially capital cases. Congress recognized that adequate representation requires compensation that is adequate to fulfill this critical responsibility. To deny counsel funds for needed activities and expect that pro bono representation will fill the gap is fundamentally incompatible with these principles, particularly in capital cases. III. Treating Pro Bono Representation As a Substitute for AdequatelyFunded Defense Counsel is Impracticable A court's decision to provide a mere fraction of the funding reasonably requested by counsel in a capital case or any criminal case, with little or no explanation other than referencing the expectation that attorneys will provide pro bono services, reflects an impracticable approach based on mistaken assumptions about the availability of pro bono legal services. The belief that there is a surplus among the bar of private counsel poised to provide such services, especially in capital cases, is an error that misconceives both the demands of these cases and the context in which pro bono legal services are provided. The representation of indigent persons in criminal proceedings is a substantial undertaking, generally requiring significant time and expense and18involving highly specialized skills. That is never more true than when an individual's life is on the line. In preparing a federal habeas petition, the "petitioner must conduct a reasonable and diligent investigation aimed at including all relevant claims and grounds for relief." McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 498 (1991). In a capital case, post-conviction counsel have an ethical duty to conduct "an aggressive investigation of all aspects of the case," ABA Death Penalty Guideline 10.15.1(E)(4), including reinvestigating prior counsel's performance and the client's biography "to identify mental-health claims which potentially reach beyond sentencing issues to fundamental questions of competency and mental-state defenses," id. Guideline 10.15, cmt. at 1086; see also id. Guideline 10.7(B)(2) (counsel at every stage has an obligation to conduct thorough and impartial investigations, and "to satisfy themselves independently that the official record of the proceedings is complete and to supplement it as appropriate").For capital habeas corpus proceedings, due to the severity of the potential sentence and the unusually complex nature of the litigation, Congress has made "a determination that quality legal representation is necessary." McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 855 (1994); see also 18 U.S.C. § 3599(d). For the same reasons, and in light of attorneys' ethical obligations in these cases, "courts can expect counsel to request significant time and expense in preparation." Asifa Quraishi, Resource Guide for Managing Capital Cases: Vol. II: Habeas Corpus Review of State19Capital Convictions, Federal Judicial Center 15 (Mar. 2010), http://goo.gl/OHGiCD.Expecting pro bono counsel to shoulder enormous financial burdens in complex capital habeas proceedings without adequate compensation is simply unrealistic for several reasons. First, a representation of that intensity and duration goes far beyond the 50 hours of pro bono service the ABA encourages lawyers to provide each year as well as the annual average actually provided, which was 56.5 hours in 2011, with an average of 32.7 hours spent on an attorney's most recent pro bono matter. See ABA Standing Committee on Pro Bono and Public Service, Supporting Justice III: A Report on the Pro Bono Work of America's Lawyers 5, 19 (Mar. 2013) ("Supporting Justice III"). Of course, some attorneys do provide many more hours than the average, and their commitment to pro bono service is laudable. But even those attorneys' pro bono hours may be spread over several different matters. See id. at 7. The practical reality is that, at any time, the number of private attorneys able to take on a capital habeas representation ­ an open-ended commitment that may go on for years and demand substantial time and expenses ­ is limited. See id. at 26.Second, most private attorneys do not specialize in criminal matters, let alone complicated habeas matters. As a result, many attorneys do not feel comfortable taking on such matters, see id. at 17, 26, and those willing to do so20require additional time to get up to speed, see Judge Arthur L. Alarcón & Paula M. Mitchell, Executing the Will of the Voters? A Roadmap to Mend or End California's Multi-Billion-Dollar Death Penalty Debacle, 44 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. S41, S85 (2011). Private attorneys who do take on these cases typically partner with experienced capital counsel who can provide specialized advice.Third, most private attorneys either are solo practitioners or practice in small or medium-sized law firms, settings in which resource constraints can present an especially formidable barrier to highly time-consuming pro bono projects. According to the most recent ABA statistics, more than 80 percent of private attorneys are solo practitioners or practice in firms with 100 or fewer attorneys. Am. Bar Ass'n, Lawyer Demographics ­ Year 2016, http://goo.gl/CRsjXL. These attorneys may have substantial experience working with individual clients, but their practices and firms often have higher staffing utilization levels and lower profit margins than the larger firms whose attorneys provide the most pro bono hours of any group, with an average of 77.7 per year. See Supporting Justice III at 5; see also id. at 27 (finding that larger firms tend to encourage pro bono participation at higher rates); Joel Stashenko, State Bar to Hire Counsel Over New Pro Bono Rule, N.Y. L.J., Feb. 3, 2014 (reporting that former state bar president argued New York's 50-hour pro bono rule would impose a burden on solo and small-firm practitioners). Thus, the ABA's efforts to recruit pro bono counsel for21capital cases have repeatedly encountered a saturation problem, where the firms that are able to undertake the significant investment of time and money required by a capital case almost all have multiple such pending cases already. Our experience also suggests that, following the economic downturn of the last decade, fewer firms have been able to take on these representations. Restrictive caps on compensation act as a substantial further deterrent to attorneys and firms deciding whether they are able to represent an indigent capital client.Of course, attorneys acting pro bono can and do provide valuable service in capital cases. But even where attorneys do so, the pro bono representation they provide may be more appropriate as a supplement than as a substitute for adequately compensated lawyers with relevant experience. See, e.g., Jackson v. United States, No. 109-CV-1039, 2010 WL 3927873, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Oct. 4, 2010) ("The court would not expect pro bono counsel to go it alone, or even to take the laboring oar. It is indeed appropriate that an attorney with . . . years of experience was appointed as co-counsel, and took the lead."). The notion that pro bono representation could provide such a substitute on a broad scale is simply not workable as a matter of practice. Therefore, adequate compensation of defense counsel and full funding of the defense effort are essential to the provision of highquality legal services for indigent clients, especially in death penalty cases.CONCLUSION22For the reasons stated herein, the American Bar Association, by and throughundersigned counsel, submits this brief as amicus curiae in support of granting aCertificate of Appealability or a briefing schedule for direct review in this case toresolve the issue regarding the inadequate funding provided to Mr. Christeson'scurrent counsel or, in the alternative, remanding the case to the district court toconduct an evidentiary hearing after authorizing adequate funding for Petitioner'srepresentation under 18 U.S.C. § 3599./s/__Paulette Brown__________ PAULETTE BROWN 
The Court Should Construe "Lawfully Made Under This Title" to Refer to Only Copies Made in the United States.I. The Ninth Circuit's Construction of "Lawfully Made Under This Title" Best Reflects the Statutory Text and Structure.Section 602(a)(1) of the Copyright Act announces a general prohibition against the "[i]mportation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the United States." 17 U.S.C. § 602(a)(1). But Section 109(a) ­ which embodies the so-called "first-sale doctrine" ­ provides ­ as an exception to the general prohibition ­ that "the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord." Id. § 109(a). The question in this case is whether a copy made and sold overseas is "made under this title" and thus falls within the exception of Section 109(a).6importation into this country of such copy. Omega, 541 F.3d at 989 ("parties can raise § 109(a) as a defense in cases involving foreign-made copies so long as a lawful domestic sale has occurred.").6 The ABA policy applicable to this case is limited to the Copyright Act. Other fields, such as trademark and patent law, involve distinct statutory schemes and implicate separate policy concerns.6The Copyright Act does not separately define the phrase "lawfully made under this title." In interpreting a statute, this Court begins with the text. Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U.S. ___, 129 S. Ct. 681, (2009). Section 109(a) codifies the first sale doctrine, which limits copyright owners' ability to control U.S. distribution of particular copies "lawfully made under this title." 17 U.S.C. § 109(a). "[T]his title" is Title 17 of the U.S. Code, in which the Copyright Act is codified. The statute is thus most naturally read to refer only to copies that are "made under" U.S. copyright law.That conclusion is consistent with the role of Section 109(a) in the overall statutory scheme. Davis v. Mich. Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989) ("It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme."). Section 602(a) addresses a copyright owner's right to control importation of copies "acquired outside the United States." 17 U.S.C. § 602(a). If copies made and sold abroad were exempt from the copyright owner's power to control importation, then Section 602(a) would have little effect. The statute seemingly would apply only to copies possessed by non-owners, such as bailees and licensees. It is unlikely that Congress intended the statute to have such a narrow application. Cf. Freytag v. Comm. of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. 868, 877 (1991) ("Our cases consistently have expressed `a deep reluctance to interpret a statutory provision so as to render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment'").7Relatedly, Section 602(a) in certain circumstances exempts from the copyright owner's exclusive right to control importation those copies that (1) will be used by the government, (2) are for the personal use of the importing party, or (3) are imported for "scholarly, educational, or religious purposes." Id. § 602(a)(1)-(3). But when applicable, these explicit exceptions to the copyright owner's exclusive right to control importation do not allow the importer to then further distribute the lawfully imported copies. Instead, in cases governed by these exceptions, the copyright owner continues to control the further downstream distribution of its works in the United States. See 2 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright (Rev. Ed. 2009). Petitioner's reading of Section 109(a), by contrast, would give the importer of a copy made and sold abroad the much greater power to distribute that copy in the United States over the copyright owner's objection. The statutory design ­ with its narrower express exemptions ­ suggests that Congress did not intend in Section 109(a) to enact such a sweeping exception to Section 602(a).That conclusion is reinforced by the longstanding presumption, which formed the backdrop for the adoption of the Copyright Act, that the country's proscriptive and prescriptive competence ends at its own borders. See American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347, 356 (1909) ("[T]he character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly by the law of the country where the act is done."), overruled on other grounds, Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 704-705 (1962). Containing no contrary statutory indication, the U.S. Copyright Act has been8interpreted consistently as subject to this presumption of territoriality. See generally 1 Paul Goldstein, Goldstein on Copyright § 1.12, at 1:26 (3d Ed. 2005) (" Copyright protection is territorial. The rights granted by the United States Copyright Act extend no farther than the nation's borders."). That is no oversight. In enacting the Copyright Act, Congress recognized territorial limits on copyright ­ for example, the statute identifies the types of works Congress chose to protect under copyright within U.S. borders and provides an importation right in Section 602(a) distinct from the public distribution right of Section 106(3). There is no evidence in the statute that Congress determined that the copyright owner's activities abroad should enhance or extinguish rights under the U.S. Copyright Act that are solely exercisable in the United States. Thus, the Ninth Circuit's refusal to accept the copyright owner's manufacture and sale of copies strictly outside the U.S. as the legal trigger that would exhaust its rights under Section 602(a) in this country is sound.II. The Ninth Circuit's Decision Is Consistent with This Court's Guidance in Quality King.In Quality King, this Court addressed the status under Section 602(a) of copies lawfully made in the United States that returned in the stream of commerce to this country ­ a so-called "round trip." The Court had no reason to construe the phrase "lawfully made under this title" in Section 109(a), because copies produced in the United States are obviously "lawfully made under" Title 17.Nonetheless, Quality King provides substantial guidance with respect to the question presented here.9To illustrate why its holding did not render Section 602(a) a nullity, the Court distinguished between copies "lawfully made" under "the United States Copyright Act" from those made "under the law of some other country." 523 U.S. at 147. The Court then offered as an "example" of this principle the hypothetical case of a copyright owner's division of its distribution rights between U.S. and British publishers. The Court specified that in such a circumstance copies made by the British publisher would not be "lawfully made under this title" for purposes of Section 109(a). Id. at 148. The Ninth Circuit in this case properly recognized that the only rationale for this Court's conclusion would be that the British copies in that circumstance were "made" in another country, not "made under" Title 17. Omega, 541 F.3d at 988.Petitioner responds that in this case respondent did not in fact formally divide its distribution rights between the United States and other countries such as Britain. But that formality is not dispositive, and it is not the point made by this Court in Quality King. Section 109(a) looks to where the copy was "made," not to the copyright owner's corporate or contractual relationships with non-U.S. rights holders, such as whether there exists an explicit geographical allocation of distribution rights. Nor would the regime that petitioner proposes make practical sense. It would operate as an inducement to prudent copyright owners to engage in otherwise unnecessary organizational and licensing schemes in foreign markets solely in order to preserve their U.S. distribution rights. There is no basis on which to conclude that Congress intended to do so.10 CONCLUSION The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: Thomas C.

I. This Court's Precedents Have Established An Appropriate Framework For Balancing The Compelling State Interest In Eradicating Discrimination Against Competing First Amendment Claims By Private Associations, And The Court Below Properly Applied Those Precedents In This Case.A. The Roberts Framework Requires Close Judicial Scrutiny of Assertions That Compliance With Anti-Discrimination Laws Serious ly Burdens Constitutional Rights of Expressive Association.In Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984), this Court addressed freedom of expressive association claims advanced by the Jaycees in its effort to avoid admitting women as required by the Minnesota Human Rights Act. The Jaycees, an all male, private membership organization, was, like BSA, dedicated to worthy civic, patriotic, educational, and personal goals. See id. at 612-13. This Court noted the potential threat to the First Amendment right of expressive association embodied in "a regulation that forces the group to accept members that it does not desire," but observed that "[t]he right to associate for expressive purposes is not . . . absolute." Id. at 623. The Court continued:Infringements on [the right to expressive association] may be justified by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associationa l freedoms.5Id. In applying the least restrictive means analysis, the Court held that "the Jaycees has failed to demonstrate that the Act imposes any serious burdens on the male members' freedom of expressive association." Id. at 626. In its inquiry, the Court identified the expressive purposes that brought the Jaycees together, and then determined whether application of the anti-discrimination statute unduly burdened those expressive purposes. The Court did not accept the Jaycees' assertions at face va lue, but rather looked to the record for evidence that the admission of women would seriously burden the Jaycees' protected expression. After careful review of the facts, the Court found "no basis in the record for concluding that admission of women as full voting members will impede the organization's ability to . . . disseminate its preferred views." Id. at 627.The Court rejected the Jaycees' claim that the very fact that the Jaycees was all male was itself an expressive statement, holding that "any claim that admission of women as full voting members will impair a symbolic message conveyed by the very fact that women are not permitted to vote is attenuated at best." Id. Significantly, the Court firmly refused to accept the Jaycees' conclusory claim based on sexual stereotyping that admission of women would change the expressive message of the Jaycees. Id. at 628.This Court reaffirmed the Roberts approach in Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537 (1987), and in New York State Club Association, Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U.S. 1 (1988). In making its determinations, this Court required the membership organizations to demonstrate that complying with a non-discrimination statute would seriously burden their members' expressive purpose in coming together. The Court looked behind the organizations' bare assertions of a First Amendment violation to inquire into their actual expressive purposes and the evidentiary bases for their claims6that their organizations' expressive activities would be harmed. Such inquiry into the character and content of the core messages that bring an association together is necessary to prevent the "scuttling" of a valid law by pretextual assertions concealed as First Amendment claims. See Dale v. Boy Scouts of America, 706 A.2d 270, 287 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.), aff'd, 734 A.2d 1196 (N.J. 1998).Roberts does not require a reviewing court to judge the validity of an association's expressive purpose. It requires only that the court determine whether expression actually is burdened in any significant way by compliance with the anti-discrimination law. Thus, the inquiry is akin to that undertaken in the free exercise context, where a court must inquire, as a threshold question, into whether asserted religious beliefs are sincerely held. See United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 184 (1965). By contrast, Petitioner's insistence that a reviewing court "must give deference to an expressive organization's characterization of its own beliefs," Pet. Br. at 26, would force courts to accept fabricated statements of belief as license to discriminate.In Roberts, Rotary International, and New York Club Association, this Court concluded that the burden, if any, of an anti-discrimination law on the organizations' respective expressive purposes was not significant enough to outweigh the governmental interest. Application of the Roberts test does not, however, invariably result in enforcement of an anti-discrimination statute because the outcome of the analysis depends upon the facts of each case. In appropriate situations, courts have permitted private membership organizations to maintain restrictive membership policies where First Amendment freedoms were genuinely and seriously burdened by anti-discrimination statutes.For example, in Hart v. Cult Awareness Network, 16 Cal. Rptr. 2d 705 (Cal. Ct. App. 1993), the Court of Appeal of California completed a thorough analysis relying on7Roberts and Rotary International before concluding that the Cult Awareness Network ("CAN") could exclude members of the Church of Scientology without violating California's Unruh Civil Rights Act. Id. at 705-6.Applying the Roberts framework, the Hart court ruled that requiring CAN to admit Scientologists as members would "impede [CAN's] ability to engage in protected activities and to disseminate its preferred views," and therefore would seriously infringe upon CAN's freedom of expressive association pursuant to Roberts. Id. at 712.As advocates, the members of the American Bar Association are deeply committed to First Amendment freedoms, including the right of expressive association. In the case before this Court, however, there is simply no showing comparable to that in Hart that enforcement of the LAD would serio usly infringe upon BSA's freedom of expressive association. Accordingly, the decision below should be affirmed.B. The New Jersey Supreme Court Properly Held That Compliance With New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination Does Not Unconstitutionally Burden BSA's Right Of Expressive Association.The New Jersey Supreme Court properly followed the Roberts framework by first examining BSA's expressive message, and then determining that the application of the LAD to prohibit its dismissal of Dale did not impose a serious burden on that message.1. There Is No Persuasive Evidence That BSA Holds Any Genuine, Non-Pretextual View Regarding Homosexuality, Or That Any Such View Is A Central Or Significant Element Of The Organization's Expressive Purpose.8In its review of the record, the New Jersey Supreme Court found that:[BSA's] ability to disseminate its message is not significantly affected by Dale's inclusion because: Boy Scout members do not associate for the purpose of disseminating the belief that homosexuality is immoral; Boy Scouts discourages its leaders from disseminating any views on sexual issues; and Boy Scouts includes sponsors and members who subscribe to different views in respect of homosexuality.Dale v. Boy Scouts of America, 734 A.2d 1196, 1223 (N.J. 1998).3BSA concedes that it does not express overt views against homosexuality in its official materials, but rather that any such policy is a tacit one. See Pet. Br. at 5 ("Official Scouting materials addressed to the boys do not refer to homosexuality or inveigh against homosexual conduct"); id. at 21 ("Boy Scouting does not convey an explicit `anti- gay' message to the boys under its care"). Similarly, BSA concedes that its view on homosexuality is, at most, incidental to the organization's beliefs. See Petition for Writ of Certiorari, at 24 ("Boy Scout members associate in order to promote a certain set of moral values, of which the view that homosexuality is immoral is merely a small part.") (emphasis added). These admissions belie BSA's contention here that a view against homosexuality is a central or3The courts below also found BSA's claim that opposinghomosexuality is an important part of its expressive purpose to beinconsistent with the fact that BSA accepts significant amounts offinancial support and sponsorship from churches and other organizationsthat strenuously disagree with BSA's discrimination on the basis ofsexual orientation. Dale, 734 A.2d at 1224-25; 706 A.2d at 290-91.9significant part of BSA's expressive purpose, a contention that is not rescued by an unpublished BSA "position paper" or by statements against homosexuality published by BSA in connection with other litigation, see Pet. Br. at 5-6; Dale, 734 A.2d at 1204 n.4. Similarly, there has been no credible evidence presented to support BSA's claim that the values of being "morally straight" and "clean" expressed in the Scout Oath and the Scout Law, respectively, pertain at all to sexuality, much less homosexuality, as opposed to such virtues as "reverence, patriotism, and a desire for selfimprovement." See Roberts at 636 (O'Connor, J., concurring); Dale, 734 A.2d at 1223-25.The New Jersey Supreme Court's conclusions in this regard are consistent with Justice O'Connor's observation in concurrence in Roberts that "[e]ven the training of outdoor survival skills or participation in community service might become expressive when the activity is intended to develop good morals, reverence, patriotism, and a desire for selfimprovement." Roberts at 636 (O'Connor, J., concurring).4 Indeed, the New Jersey Supreme Court acknowledged that "Boy Scouts expresses a belief in moral values and uses its activities to encourage the moral development of its members." Dale, 734 A.2d at 1223. But, as that court noted, encouraging "moral development" does not reflect a specific view on homosexuality, any more than it does on abortion, the use of contraceptives, divorce, euthanasia, or myriad other controversial moral issues on which BSA has no stated position.4The Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. has an explicit policy of non-discrimination with respect to sexual orientation. See Mailand v. Girl Scoutsof the U.S.A., No. 93-CV-949, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8290 (W.D. Mich.Apr. 11, 1994).102. Eradicating Discrimination In Public Accommodations, Including Discrimination Based On Sexual Orientation, Is A Compelling State Interest.New Jersey enacted its Law Against Discrimination in 1945. The statute was based in part on a finding by the state legislature that "because of discrimination, people suffer personal hardships, and the State suffers a grievous harm." These personal hardships were found to include:[E]conomic loss; time loss; physical and emotional stress; and in some cases severe emotional trauma, illness, homelessness or other irreparable harm resulting from the strain of employment controversies; relocation, search and moving difficulties; anxiety caused by lack of information, uncertainty, and resultant planning difficulty; career, education, family and social disruption; and adjustment problems . . ..N.J. Stat. Ann. § 10:5-3 (West 1999) (Finding and Declaration of Legislature).The LAD was intended to combat racial and other forms of discrimination that were recognized at the time of its enactment. In the decades since then, amendments have been adopted to prohibit newly recognized forms of discrimination. New Jersey amended the LAD to cover discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1991, just two years after the ABA adopted its policy encouraging the enactment of such laws. Id. § 10:5-4. The amendment was an "implicit recognition" by the legislature that the "archaic" and "stereotypical" notions so deplored in Roberts with respect to gender discrimination, see Roberts, 468 U.S. at 625, also "cannot be countenanced" with regard to sexual orientation discrimination. Dale, 734 A.2d at 1227 (quoting11706 A.2d at 287). The New Jersey Legislature explicitly found that discrimination in places of public accommodation, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, is a matter "of concern to the government of the State, and that such discrimination threatens not only the rights and proper privileges of the inhabitants of the State but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free and democratic State . . .." N.J. Stat. Ann. § 10:5-3.In amending its non-discrimination law to include prohibitions against sexual orientation discrimination, New Jersey embraced a growing national movement toward recognition that discrimination based on sexual orientation is as debilitating and destructive as other forms of discrimination and that these different manifestations of prejudice are closely linked. See Gordon W. Allport, The Nature of Prejudice (1954); Albert D. Klassen et al., Sex and Morality in the U.S. 206-24 (Hubert O'Gorman ed. 1989). At least nine States, the District of Columbia, 74 cities, and 18 counties have enacted laws tha t prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in public accommodations. See Wayne Van Der Meide, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Legislating Equality: A Review of Laws Affecting Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered People in the United States 4-5, 25-82 (2000). Some 1,600 employers, including corporations, law firms, universities, professional associations (including the American Bar Association), and governmental units, have adopted non-discrimination policies that cover sexual orientation discrimination in employment. See Human Rights Campaign, WorkNet Employer Database (March 20, 2000) <http://hrc.org/worknet>.Indeed, this Court itself has recognized that laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation are equal in kind and in legal dignity to anti-discrimination laws benefiting other classes, see Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631 (1996), and has held that a state may not constitutionally12prohibit local governments from enacting such laws. Id. at 635-36; see also Brief of American Bar Ass'n, Amicus Curiae, in Support of Petitioners, Romer (No. 94-1039).This Court long has recognized that eradication of discrimination is a compelling state interest. See, e.g., Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 604 (1984) (race); Roberts, 468 U.S. at 623-26 (gender). The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has reached the same conclusion with regard to discrimination based on sexual orientation. See Gay Rights Coalition of Georgetown Univ. Law Ctr. v. Georgetown Univ., 536 A.2d 1, 33 (D.C. 1987) (en banc). In concluding that the state interest was compelling, the court in Gay Rights Coalition noted that the District of Columbia Council had:determined that a person's sexual orientation, like a person's race and sex, for example, tells nothing of value about his or her attitudes, characteristics, abilities or limitations. It is a false measure of individual worth, one unfair and oppressive to the person concerned, one harmful to others because discrimination inflicts a grave and recurring injury upon society as a whole. . . . Only by eradicating discrimination based on sexual orientation, along with all other forms of discrimination unrelated to individual merit, could the District eliminate recurrent personal injustice and build a society which encourages and expects the full contribution of every member of the community in all their diversity and potential.Id. at 32 (emphasis in original).As this Court has noted, discrimination "deprives persons of their individual dignity and denies society the13benefits of wide participation in political, economic, and cultural life." Roberts, 468 U.S. at 625. Such discrimination takes many forms and causes many different kinds of harm. In seeking to distinguish Roberts, Petitioners suggest that the harm is greater where the purpose of the association is primarily commercial (such as the Jaycees) rather than primarily expressive: "Participation in such business and professional organizations is important to equality of opportunity in the commercial marketplace, and the First Amendment protection of their exclusionary practices is correspondingly lower." Pet. Br. at 35.Yet this ignores the serious and perhaps irreparable harm that is done to young men who are arbitrarily excluded by BSA. They not only lose the opportunity to develop the kinds of skills that are conveyed as a part of the scouting experience, but also are unable to participate with their peers in what for most communities in this country is an important rite of passage to adulthood. The fact that they may not derive immediate commercial advantage from this activity does not lessen the deprivation to which they are subjected.The court below examined this theme in detail as part of its determination that, under the New Jersey la w, BSA deprived Dale of the benefits of a "public accommodation." The court found that, among other advantages, BSA "indirectly benefits its members through the `advantage' of a large influential network, including Air Force Academy, Annapolis and West Point graduates, Rhodes Scholars, astronauts, United States Presidents and Congressmen, as well as businessmen and community leaders." Dale, 734 A.2d at 1218. The court also found that BSA maintains and benefits from close relationships with numerous federal, state, and local government entities. Id. at 1211-13. BSA affords its members the chance to participate in those relationships, to become familiar with important institutions of self- government, and to develop a confident sense of civic14involvement that can serve as the foundation for a lifetime of engaged citizenship.All in all, BSA is an important training ground for leaders in commerce, politics, and society generally. It is precisely to keep such gateways to opportunity unbarred by prejudice that the Association has adopted its policies against discrimination and, in keeping with those policies, supports enforcement of the LAD in this case.3. The Holding Below Is Consistent With This Court's Decision In Hurley.As the New Jersey Supreme Court correctly held, Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557 (1995), is a "pure speech" case that does not control the outcome here. In Hurley, the Court held that the organizers of a parade ­ a quintessential and historically venerated form of speech, see id. at 568-69 ­ could not be forced by anti-discrimination laws to permit marchers to carry banners proclaiming gay-rights messages at odds with the organizers' beliefs.5 A contrary result would have required the parade organizers "to modify the content of their expression to whatever extent beneficiaries of the law choose to alter it with messages of their own." Id. at 578.Apart from such "pure speech" contexts, however, courts have been unwilling to apply Hurley to cases in which the First Amendment is invoked as a license for discriminatory practices. For example, in Elks Lodges #719 (Ogden) and #2021 (Moab) v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 905 P.2d 1189, 1196 (Utah 1995), the Utah Supreme Court rejected a fraternal organization's5It is notable that even in this context, the Court found theMassachussetts statute prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination alegitimate exercise of "the State's usual power . . . when a legislature hasreason to believe that a given group is the target of discrimination . . .." 515U.S. at 572.15attempt to use Hurley to defend its exclusion of women in violation of the Utah Civil Rights Act. As the Utah court recognized, "Hurley addressed only the right to control the content of a parade's `message' under the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech; it specifically did not address the issue of participation of protected groups in the parade." Id. The court concluded that "Hurley has no application to the issues presented by [a public accommodation's] decision to wholly exclude an entire class of society from participation." Id.Similarly, in the decision below, the New Jersey Supreme Court correctly ruled that Hurley was inapplicable, finding that "Dale's status as a scout leader is not equivalent to a group marching in a parade," and that "Boy Scout leadership [is not] a form of `pure speech' akin to a parade." Dale, 734 A.2d at 1229. The court recognized that enforcement of the LAD would not force BSA to endorse homosexuality, or, indeed, to make any statement at all on that or any other subject. Id.Accordingly, even if the issue of homosexuality implicated BSA's right of expressive association, the organization's exclusionary policies bear no rational relationship to the effectuation of this expressive purpose. Dale did not seek to use his role in the organization to advance an expressive purpose of his own that diluted or undermined the message that the organization was attempting to convey. Although Petitioner attempts to paint Mr. Dale as an "activist" who seeks to use a position in Boy Scouts as a "bully pulpit" to promote or celebrate homosexuality, see Pet. Br. at 22, 24, in fact none of the statements Petitioner attributes to Mr. Dale was made until after his dismissal by BSA, and none was made in a BSA venue or in the course of Boy Scout activities. See Dale, 734 A.2d 1204-05. Indeed, Petitioner concedes that at the time it expelled Mr. Dale, he was away at college and at the time had "very little16involvement" with BSA at all. Pet. Br. at 8. Petitioner learned of Mr. Dale's homosexuality and campus-based gay rights activities from a newspaper article, id., not from anything Mr. Dale said or did while engaged in BSA activities. In the absence of any credible evidence that Mr. Dale attempted so to impose a message upon BSA, BSA's refusal to tolerate his mere presence in the organization is simply an unjustifiable departure from the requirements of the law.II. Failure To Scrutinize Petitioner's First Amendment Claims As Roberts Requires Not Only Wo uld Hinder New Jersey's Laudable Effort To Eradicate Sexual Orientation Discrimination, But Also Would Jeopardize States' Efforts To Combat Other Forms Of Discrimination.The American Bar Association is committed to the elimination of discrimination in all its forms. See, e.g., Canon 3B(5), discussed above, which is one of numerous Association policies that seek to address bias or prejudice, including bias or prejudice based on sexual orientation, in a comprehensive fashion.Similarly, the state interest embodied in the LAD should be seen as an undifferentiated whole: the State of New Jersey has a compelling interest in combating discrimination in the many forms enumerated in the statute; it does not have a stronger or more compelling interest in combating some forms more than others.For the same reason, there is more at stake in this or any other civil rights case than the rights of the particular group members involved in the matter at hand. What this Court decides will affect not only James Dale and the community to which he belongs, but also those belonging to other communities whose rights have found vindication through the methodology enunciated in Roberts.17Since the Roberts decision, state courts consistently have declined the invitation to read into the Court's approach a license for private membership organizations to engage in exclusionary practices upon the mere invocation of the freedom of expressive association. See, e.g., Lloyd Lions Club v. Int'l Ass'n of Lions Clubs, 724 P.2d 887 (Ore. App. 1986) (rejecting claim of national membership organization that application of Oregon Civil Rights Act to require admission of women violated members' right to freedom of expressive association); Fraternal Order of Eagles, Inc. v. City of Tucson, 816 P.2d 255, 258 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1991); Elks Lodges #719 (Ogden) and #2021 (Moab) v. Dep't of Alcoholic Beverage Control, 905 P.2d 1189, 1196 (Utah 1995). See also Isbister v. Boys' Club of Santa Cruz, Inc., 707 P.2d 212, 214 (Cal. 1985) (application of California Civil Rights Act to require local boys club to admit girls implicates a compelling state interest and does not substantially infringe on the freedom of expressive association).Like the New Jersey Supreme Court in the decision below, these state tribuna ls diligently applied the Roberts framework, sensitively balancing the competing claims presented when an anti-discrimination statute is asserted against a private membership organization.Should the Court now reject the Roberts approach, or reinterpret it to permit a less exacting review of First Amendment claims of the kind that Petitioner asserts, it would create a dangerous and unnecessarily broad exception to laws that are the primary means by which the states have chosen to redress discrimination within their borders.18CONCLUSION The judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court should be affirmed.Respectfully Submitted, WILLIAM G.

I. Although The ABA Recommends Employing The Doctrine Of Constitutional Avoidance, It Agrees That 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226(c) And 1226(a) Are Constitutionally Infirm As Applied To Class Members By Permitting Prolonged And Excessive Detention Without An Individualized HearingCongress did not expressly provide any mechanism for ensuring that immigrants detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b) or 1226(c) are provided individualized hearings to test the basis for their detention before they are detained for excessive periods. Congress also did not provide any time period in which immigrants detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) may seek a subsequent bond hearing where their detention is prolonged. See 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(2)(A).The Fifth Amendment's right to due process is incompatible with prolonged civil detention without an individualized hearing to determine flight risk or danger. See Resp. Br. at 17-19. This is true as applied to all "persons" within the United States, including noncitizens, Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001), and as applied to deportation proceedings. See, e.g., Petr. Br. at 29, 47 (recognizing Respondents' entitlement to due process protections); Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 305-306 (1993). The ABA has therefore urged this Court to apply the4canon of constitutional avoidance and interpret each statute in question as containing a reasonable time limit within which a neutral decision maker must provide an individualized hearing to test whether detention is justified based on flight risk or danger. As set forth in the ABA's original amicus brief in this matter (Br. 10-11), interpreting the statutes otherwise "would raise serious constitutional problems." INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 299-300 (2001); see also Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 695. The ABA favors applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance over expressly invalidating the entirety of, or portions of, these acts of Congress both out of respect for a coordinate branch of Government and to give Congress greater latitude to amend its legislation.The Court's request for supplemental briefing, however, appears to seek the views of interested parties as to whether some or all of the three mandatory detention statutes at issue violate the Constitution. The ABA believes that each of the statutes does violate the Constitution because they all suffer from the same fundamental infirmity: absent a saving interpretation, each statute could, and has been, interpreted in a manner that results in the prolonged, and potentially indefinite, detention of individuals with no timely individualized hearing to determine the basis for their detention.Government detention violates due process "unless the detention is ordered in a criminal proceeding with adequate procedural protections, or, in certain special and `narrow' non-punitive `circumstances,' where a special justification, such as5harm-threatening mental illness, outweighs the `individual's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.'" Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690 (emphasis and citations omitted). Civil detention extending beyond, or not related to, its "special justification" runs afoul of due process. See id. (holding that detention is improper when it no longer bears a reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual was committed); Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972) (holding that, where detention's goal is no longer attainable, detention does not comply with due process); Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 530 (2003) (finding detention permissible for the "limited period of his removal proceedings"). Each statute at issue is infirm because each could be, and has been, interpreted to permit indefinitely prolonged detention of individuals without any proceeding to determine that their detention remains reasonably related to its purpose.II. The ABA's Experience Demonstrates Temporal Guidelines Are Required To Safeguard Due Process RightsThe ABA has extensive experience and understanding of the practical results of various enforcement regimes in securing the constitutional rights of detainees in numerous contexts. These include criminal proceedings, as well as various forms of civil proceedings such as involuntary commitments, juvenile detention, and immigration proceedings. The conclusions of ABA task forces that have studied these areas were the results of separate endeavors, by separate committees, at different times. Yet all of them came to the same conclusion--6that the best method for ensuring that timely review is granted is to set an outer time limit and an appropriate method of review based on the type of detainee and other relevant factors, and that such review must be conducted within that time limit. Their conclusions, which have been adopted by various courts, are reflected in decisions such as this Court's holding in County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991).The ABA has not taken a position as to the specific point in time by which an individualized hearing must take place to ensure that these statutes satisfy constitutional norms, but agrees that the approach adopted by the Court of Appeals complies with two key principles that are essential to satisfying due process. First, the duty must rest with the Government to justify the basis for detention; second, to ensure this duty is carried out in a timely manner, some outer time limit must be established for an individualized proceeding.A. The Burden Rests With The Government To Establish Grounds For DetentionThis Court has consistently placed the burden on the Government, not the individual detained, to prove the justification for continued detention. See, e.g., Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 86 (1992); Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 431-33 (1979); County of Riverside, 500 U.S. at 56. This is especially true in situations such as this, in which the individual detained has no right to appointed counsel, is confined in a manner that restricts access7to other resources, and is part of a uniquely vulnerable population.B. An Outer Time Limit For An Individualized Hearing Ensures That Due Process Rights Are ProtectedRelying on the input of prosecutors, defense attorneys, jurists, and distinguished experts, the ABA has repeatedly concluded that immigrant detainees must be afforded a timely review of the Government's basis for determining that the detainee presents a threat to public safety or a substantial flight risk that cannot be mitigated through parole, bond, or a less restrictive form of custody or supervision.2 This conclusion reflects the ABA's extensive experience evaluating the effects of various immigration detention review proceedings, as well as standards to protect a detainee's constitutional rights in related contexts. The basis for this determination is set forth at length in the ABA's amicus brief and is reflected in the ABA's Civil Immigration Detention Standards ("Detention Standards"), which implement principles of justice, humane treatment, and due process.32 Brief of American Bar Association as Amicus Curiae in Support of Respondents, at p. 12, nn. 3-4 (quoting specific provisions from the ABA Civ. Immigr. Det. Standards, 12A102, adopted August 2012, as amended in August 2014 by Res. 111, available at http://www.americanbar.org/ content/dam/aba/administrative/immigration/abaimmdetstds .authcheckdam.pdf).3 See Detention Standards, Acknowledgements.8The ABA's experience in the criminal justice and mental health contexts also lends support to this principle. The ABA's Criminal Justice Standards on Pretrial Release ("Pretrial Release Standards"), for example, call for a detained criminal defendant to be granted a prompt first appearance no later than 24 hours after the initial arrest, during which time the judicial officer must make a decision as to pretrial release based on a specific determination of flight risk or threat to the community.4 This time frame comports with the nature of the detention, the status of the detainee, and the failure of less specific limits to ensure prompt probable cause review. The ABA has likewise endorsed the need for temporal boundaries for proceedings to evaluate the need for continued pretrial detention,5 determine competence to stand trial,6 and decide whether a speedy trial has been accorded.74 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Pretrial Release (3d ed. 2007), Standards 10-4.1, 10-5.3, available at http:// www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/criminal _justice_standards/pretrial_release.authcheckdam.pdf.5 Pretrial Release Standards, Standard 10-5.12 (allowing the defendant to file a motion with the court requesting that it re-examine the release decision, and requiring the parties to file a status report when the defendant has been detained for more than 90 days without a court order).6 ABA Criminal Justice Standards on Mental Health, Standard 7-4.12, adopted August 2016, available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/ criminal_justice_standards/mental_health_standards_2016. authcheckdam.pdf (prescribing that a defendant's competence should be "periodically redetermined by the court" upon the occurrence of significant events and at9The ABA's Criminal Justice Standards on Mental Health ("Mental Health Standards") also endorse temporal limits for administering civilcommitment detention in compliance with the Due Process Clause. Those Standards condition civil commitment following a not guilty verdict by reason of insanity on the detaining authority preparing a detailed evaluation report within 30 days after the verdict.8 This temporal guideline ensures that the government has timely stated its justification for commitment. The Standards further call for the prosecutor to move for a commitment hearing within five days thereafter, and direct that a hearing be held within 15 days of the filing of the evaluationperiodic intervals of "30 days, 90 days, 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter"); see also id. at Standard 7-4.14 (requiring a hearing to determine whether the defendant is "unrestorable" within a set time after the defendant was deemed incompetent).7 ABA Criminal Justice Standards on Speedy Trial and Timely Resolution of Criminal Cases (3d ed. 2006), Standard 12-2.1(b), available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/ dam/aba/publications/criminal_justice_standards/speedy_ trial.authcheckdam.pdf ("The presumptive speedy trial time limit for persons held in pretrial detention should be [90] days from the date of the defendant's first appearance in court after the filing of a charging instrument. The presumptive limit for persons who are on pretrial release should be [180] days from the date of the defendant's first appearance in court after either the filing of any charging instrument or the issuance of a citation or summons. Shorter presumptive speedy trial time limits should be set for persons charged with minor offenses.").8 Mental Health Standards, Standard 7-7.3.10report.9 As in the immigration context, these temporal guidelines protect the due process rights of the vulnerable populations subject to detention, and properly place the burden on the government to justify the deprivation of liberty.The ABA's experience thus reflects that the need for a fixed time limit in which to conduct a proceeding to justify continued detention applies across comparable categories of detainees. The Court's jurisprudence in other contexts confirms the need for such bright-line rules. See, e.g., County of Riverside, 500 U.S. at 56; Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373, 380-81 (1966). This approach works equally well to fulfill due process requirements regarding detention across the immigration, criminal prosecution, or involuntary civil commitment contexts. In each case, the liberty interest is sufficiently important to warrant meaningful review, the competing government interests are similar, and immigrants are as limited as these other groups--if not more so--in their ability to compel compliance with due process rights.III. Habeas Is Inadequate To Ensure That Detained Immigrants Have A Meaningful Opportunity To Test The Reasonableness Of Their DetentionThe Court has also solicited the views of interested parties regarding whether the approach adopted by the Court below is constitutionally required. The ABA's experience addressing case-by-9 Id.11case determinations in this and related contexts confirms that some form of individualized administrative hearing must be conducted within a reasonable period of time.The ABA's experience in multiple contexts has shown that, without a fixed deadline, governments lack necessary incentives to devote limited resources to providing timely proceedings. This may result in the government unintentionally, or in some cases deliberately, delaying review, and adopting strategies that have the actual and expected effect of significantly delaying or effectively eliminating review. These strategies may include requiring confined, impoverished, and non-English speaking or potentially illiterate individuals to initiate proceedings themselves, imposing the burden to prove government error on such individuals, or establishing review within a perennially sluggish and overcrowded adjudicative process.The ABA's original brief (Br. 25-27) described how the complexity of habeas proceedings presents an insurmountable barrier to many detained immigrants, who would thereby be effectively denied any opportunity for review. Habeas is ill-suited to this particular context because it imposes a heavy burden on detained immigrants, who often are unrepresented and do not have the language comprehension and other skills required to understand the complexity of the federal court system. Habeas procedures and crowded federal dockets therefore inevitably compound--rather than relieve--the period of prolonged detention.12If the Court chooses to fashion a different approach from the Ninth Circuit, the ABA suggests that due process requires at the very least that some specific elements be retained. Specifically, the Court should require (i) that the Government provide a hearing directly in immigration court--i.e., without requiring detainees to file habeas petitions to obtain that hearing--and (ii) that the hearing occur within some specified period of time. In Zadvydas, this Court recognized that, after six months, if a detained immigrant provided good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal "in the reasonably foreseeable future" (such significant likelihood of removal being the underlying justification for the detention in the subject statute), the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing. 533 U.S. at 701. In other words, once the underlying justification for the detention ceases, the detention must end. Id.The ABA recommends adopting a similarapproach here, and requiring an individualizedhearing to determine whether the immigrant'scontinued detention would offend the protections ofthe Due Process Clause. Compared to habeas relief,such a hearing would better comport with thefindings of the ABA that the only way to ensure fairand timely review is through "a prompt hearingbefore an Immigration Judge for any alien inremoval proceedings who is denied release with orwithout bond, including meaningful administrativereview and judicial oversight." ABA Report 197E 1,adopted February 2006, available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/directories/policy/2006_my_107e.authcheckdam.pdf.This13hearing would not require immigrants to resort to the inadequate, lengthy, and burdensome habeas process to obtain an eventual determination of whether their length of detention has become unreasonable.Experience shows that temporal guidance on the length of detention is ineffective without an automatic hearing. Otherwise, a judicial directive limiting detention to a "reasonable" period cannot defeat the proven tendency of the immigration system to let immigrants languish in detention. For example, although the Third Circuit held in Diop v. ICE/Homeland Security, 656 F.3d 221, 231, 233 (3d Cir. 2011), that a hearing under § 1226(c) would be necessary after a "reasonable" period of time, experience shows that immigrants were forced to continually rely on the faulty backstop of habeas corpus simply to obtain the hearing that the Government had been ordered to provide in a reasonable time. In Chavez-Alvarez v. Warden York County Prison, 783 F.3d 469 (3d Cir. 2015), it took the immigrant petitioner three years after detention to finally obtain an appellate court order directing a bond hearing based on his habeas petition. See id. at 470-71; see also Farrin R. Anello, Due Process and Temporal Limits on Mandatory Detention, 65 Hastings L.J. 363, 390, 397-400 (2014) (reviewing Third Circuit mandatory detention case law and concluding that district courts have taken "inconsistent approaches to similar facts"). Such delays will likely remain widespread in the absence of an automatic hearing, and will continue to confound enforcement of detainees' due process rights.14Because the Government has demonstrated that it cannot prevent unconstitutional prolonged detentions in a system that relies on habeas review, the ABA believes due process requires an automatic hearing before an immigration judge within a fixed period of time. Immigration judges familiar with these cases are qualified to make such determinations. Indeed, immigration judges are already entrusted to determine whether an individual is "properly included" under the mandatory detention statute. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(h)(2)(ii). Immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals routinely hear claims by immigrants that they are not properly subject to the terms of the statute, and nothing precludes the immigration courts from hearing such matters. The ABA would therefore urge that any modifications of the Ninth Circuit's remedy at least provide an automatic hearing to determine whether continued mandatory detention has become unreasonable.15CONCLUSION"In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception." United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987). The ABA appreciates the opportunity to provide its insights to assist the Court in determining the scope of the Due Process Clause's carefully limited exception and the procedures required to ensure compliance with the Due Process Clause. For the foregoing reasons, amicus ABA urges the Court to affirm the decision below.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: JEFFREY L. BLEICH IAN R. BARKER PETER Z. STOCKBURGER BENJAMIN P.

I. Lawful Permanent Residents are Entitled to the Individualized Determination Traditionally Afforded By U.S. Criminal and Civil Detention SystemsFreedom from physical detention "lies at the heart" of the liberty interest that the Due Process Clause protects. Zadvydas9. The Vera Institute study is discussed in greater detail below.10v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (2001); Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750 (1987). Because detention involves a complete deprivation of all personal liberty, due process requires that it may be imposed only through a process that affords considerable procedural protections. While the scope of procedures afforded may vary depending on the length and nature of the detention at issue, due process has always required some independent arbiter to determine that the Government's legitimate purposes justify the deprivation of liberty in the individual case.In this case, the Government asserts two interests supporting the detention of lawful permanent residents who have not yet been found deportable: (1) the risk that they will fail to appear for subsequent court proceedings ("flight risk"); and (2) the risk that, if released, they will pose a danger to the public. Petr. Br. at 12. While insisting that such individuals are afforded ample hearing prior to their detention under Section 1226(c), Petr. Br. at 26-27 (citing In re Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. 799, 1999 WL 339053 (BIA 1999)), the Government can point to no determination at any stage as to whether the individual is in fact a flight risk or a danger. Indeed, there is no individual hearing evaluating whether there is any relationship between the Government's asserted interests and the deprivation to be inflicted. In this respect, Section 1226(c) falls short of every other detention scheme this Court has approved.Due process requirements are stringent and unconditional where the state seeks to detain an individual as punishment for a crime. The Government may not sentence a person to imprisonment absent a finding of guilt. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535-36 (1979); see also Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 671-672 n. 40, 674 (1977); Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 165, 167, 186 (1963); Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228, 237 (1896). Indeed, between the "Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must11be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt." Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 476 (2000).10 Punitive detention outside the strictures of these protections may not be imposed.Where the Government's asserted interest is preventive, rather than punitive, the procedural safeguards required are only slightly less exacting. But they invariably include the requirement that detention of an individual serves the purposes the Government seeks to advance. Thus, the Government may not detain a person on suspicion of having committed a crime for any substantial period absent an individualized showing that there is reason to believe that the person committed the crime. See, e.g., Cupp v. Murphy, 412 U.S. 291, 294-95 (1973); Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75 (1807); Ex parte Burford, 3 Cranch 448 (1806). Recognizing the "necessary accommodation between the individual's right to liberty and the State's [regulatory] duty to control crime," this Court determined that arrest by an officer on the street could be accompanied by a simple finding of probable cause to believe that the individual to be detained "had committed or was committing an offense." Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 111-12 (1975) (quoting Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964)). But once the individual has been detained, the Government's reasons for avoiding the delay of an individualized hearing lest a crime be committed no longer apply, and a prompt judicial determination is required. "The consequences of prolonged detention may be more serious than the interference occasioned by arrest, . . . imperil[ing] the suspect's job, interrupt[ing] his source of income, and impair[ing] his family relationships." Id. at 114. Indeed: "When the stakes are this high, the detached10. Almendarez-Torresv. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998), which remains a narrow exception to the Apprendi rule, does not alter the analysis. There, the fact that the defendant had a prior conviction was itself sufficient to increase his sentence. The fact of prior conviction was not used as an irrebuttable proxy for a determination that defendant was dangerous or posed a risk of flight.12judgment of a neutral magistrate is essential" to justify an "extended restraint of liberty." Id. at 114; see also County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991) (probable cause hearing must be held within 48 hours of arrest).Likewise, in upholding the 1984 Bail Reform Act, the Court relied on the existence of an individualized process for considering whether to permit release on bail before allowing a federal court to detain an arrestee pending trial. Balancing the same set of interests ­ individual liberty against the Government's "regulatory" goal of preventing danger to the community ­ this Court upheld the Act based on its series of strict procedural protections. Salerno, 481 U.S. at 747. Among other things, the Government was required to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence after a "full-blown" adversarial hearing that no conditions of release could "reasonably assure the safety of the community or any person." Id. at 742-51. Further, the Act operated only on arrestees charged with "extremely serious offenses," and detention was subject to the "stringent time limitations" of the Speedy Trial Act. Id. at 747-50. As the Court explained, the "extensive" procedural safeguards set forth by the Act were "specifically designed to further the accuracy of [the] determination" in the individual case. Id. at 751.Because civil commitment implicates precisely the same, powerful liberty interest as imprisonment, this Court has repeatedly recognized that an individualized determination of reasons is precisely as essential. There is plainly a substantial liberty interest in avoiding confinement in a mental hospital. Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491-92 (1980) (commitment entails "a massive curtailment of liberty,"); Parham v. J. R., 442 U.S. 584, 600 (1979); Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979); Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972) (due process requires at least that the nature and duration of commitment to a mental hospital "bear some reasonable relation to the purpose" of the commitment). Accordingly, the Court has required the use of exacting ­ and manifestly individualized ­ procedural13protections to guard against error in allowing for civil detention of the mentally ill.Thus, in Addington v. Texas, this Court invalidated a Texas civil commitment statute because it lacked a sufficiently demanding standard of proof to justify depriving an individual of his liberty. Addington arose from a petition by the appellant's mother for his involuntary commitment. Under Texas law, the son was entitled to retain counsel, and trial was held before a jury to determine whether he could be committed. Addington, 441 U.S. at 420. Despite the substantial procedural protections Texas law already provided, this Court held that the standard of proof the state Supreme Court accepted, a "preponderance of the evidence," was insufficiently strict given the magnitude of the liberty interest involved. While the state "has a legitimate interest" in providing care to its citizens, and in protecting the community from those who may pose a danger, "the State has no interest in confining individuals involuntarily if they are not mentally ill or if they do not pose some danger to themselves or others." Id. at 426. As this Court explained: "The individual should not be asked to share equally with society the risk of error when the possible injury to the individual is significantly greater than any possible harm to the state." Id. at 427. Accordingly, states must meet a burden "equal to or greater than the `clear and convincing' standard" to satisfy due process constraints. Id. at 433.Particularly when commitment is employed as an alternative to criminal detention, procedural protections must include an individualized finding to support it. In Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 81-82 (1992), the Louisiana law at issue automatically committed defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity on the grounds that such a verdict established that the defendant was dangerous. The state could then continue to detain such defendants indefinitely without any adversarial hearing in which the state was required to demonstrate that the defendant was actually dangerous. Id. The Court held the Louisiana law unconstitutional, finding that the law did not even14approach the Bail Reform Act requirement upheld in Salerno, which provision required the Government to show that the "arrestee presents an identified and articulable threat to an individual or the community." Id. at 81; see also Addington, 441 U.S. at 425-26; Jackson, 406 U.S. at 738 (state may not detain defendant who lacks capacity to stand trial without satisfying procedures for civil commitment). Among other things, Foucha plainly rejects the notion that because a finding in a criminal proceeding might logically support administrative detention, such detention is, irrebuttably, justified in every case.Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354 (1983), demonstrates precisely the same point. There, the Court held that a state may commit a defendant to a mental hospital upon a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. At the very outset of its discussion, the Court made clear that such a verdict was sufficiently probative of mental illness justifying institutionalization because the verdict itself established the fact that defendant "committed the act because of mental illness." Id. at 363-64. While the Jones Court also found that evidence of "violence" per se was not a "prerequisite for a constitutional commitment," id. at 365 (suggesting that petitioner's conviction itself was probative of dangerousness), the Court has since emphasized that it would not be permissible to assume this in every case "without regard for [the individual's] particular crimes." Foucha, 504 U.S. at 88 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("[T]he strong interest in liberty of a person acquitted by reason of insanity but later found sane might well outweigh the governmental interest in detention where the only evidence of dangerousness is that the acquittee committed a non-violent or relatively minor crime."). In this case, Mr. Kim's simple verdict of theft with priors establishes no fact relating to his flight risk, no fact demonstrating his deportability, and no evidence supporting a finding of dangerousness.1 111. In any event, the insanity acquittees subject to the District of Columbia detention scheme in Jones were at least entitled by law to a(Cont'd)15The Court again highlighted the importance of this principle in the context of civil commitment just last Term in Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407 (2002) (Constitution prohibits civil commitment of a convicted sexual offender absent some specific finding that the offender lacked the ability to control his behavior). In reaching its conclusion, the Court followed closely the guidance of Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997), which upheld a civil commitment statute targeting sexual offenders. As the Court explained: "Hendricks underscored the constitutional importance of distinguishing a dangerous sexual offender subject to civil commitment `from other dangerous persons who are perhaps more properly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings.'" Crane, 534 U.S. at 412 (quoting Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 360). That distinction, the Court emphasized, "is necessary lest `civil commitment' become a `mechanism for retribution or general deterrence.'" Id.The distinction ­ and the requirement that a court make a specific finding of flight risk or dangerousness despite a prior conviction ­ is just as essential in the ostensibly non-punitive context of immigration detention. "Whether a due process right is denied when [here, potentially] removable aliens who are flight risks or dangers to the community are detained turns," at least in part, "on whether there are adequate procedures to review their cases, allowing persons once subject to detention to show that through rehabilitation, new appreciation of their responsibilities, or under other standards, they no longer present special risks or danger if put at large." Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 721 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Government detention violates due process unless there exists, at a minimum, some "special justification" for detention that "outweighs the `individual's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical(Cont'd)hearing within 50 days of commitment at which they would have an opportunity to demonstrate that they were no longer mentally ill or dangerous. 463 U.S. at 357-58. The immigration statute here promises no such assessment ­ of flight risk or dangerousness ­ at any point.16restraint.'" Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690 (quoting Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 356). To determine whether such a "special justification" exists, this Court has always required that non-punitive detention be based on a "special," individual assessment.The liberty interest of a lawful permanent resident in such an individual determination is no weaker because he may, as a result of his prior conviction, be deportable. Just as the liberty interest of a parolee is still cognizable even though he may well be subject to re-incarceration, the mere possibility of deportation that exists here does not of itself suffice to eliminate respondents' powerful interest in living at liberty in this country for as long as they may remain.The liberty of a parolee enables him to do a wide range of things open to persons who have never been convicted of any crime. The parolee has been released from prison based on an evaluation that he shows reasonable promise of being able to return to society and function as a responsible, self-reliant person. Subject to the conditions of his parole, he can be gainfully employed and is free to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life. Though the State properly subjects him to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison . . . We see, therefore, that the liberty of a parolee, although indeterminate, includes many of the core values of unqualified liberty and its termination inflicts a "grievous loss" on the parolee and often on others.Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 482 (1972). Accordingly, even where an individual's liberty interest is arguably weakened, due process requires a case-by-case determination ­ not that the individual committed a crime in the first instance ­ but that the current deprivation of liberty is justified anew. That rule17holds for the termination of pre-parole conditional supervision programs, Young v. Harper, 520 U.S. 143 (1997) (opinion of unanimous Court); the revocation of probation, Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973); the revocation of prison goodtime credits, Walpole v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985); and for involuntary transfer from a prison to a mental institution, Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491 (1980) (inmate's "residuum of liberty" demands that the state satisfy "minimum requirements of due process" before proceeding with transfer).12The requirement of an individualized assessment of the need for detention likewise applies without exception in the context of civil juvenile detention ­ where, as this Court has asserted, due process liberty interests may also be diminished. In Schall v. Martin, 467 U.S. 253 (1984), this Court upheld a New York statute allowing for pretrial detention of a juvenile after an individualized finding that the arrested juvenile posed a "serious risk" of committing a crime before his return date. Id. at 255. The Schall Court emphasized that the important risk of "erroneous and unnecessary deprivations of liberty" was checked by the fact that "notice, a hearing, and a statement of facts and12. Even where the individual due process interest is significantly less than the total deprivation of liberty effected by detention, the Constitution affords individuals, at a minimum, an "opportunity to present reasons . . . why proposed action should not be taken." See, e.g., Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985) ("`[T]he root requirement' of the Due Process Clause" is "`that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest'"; hearing required before termination of employment); Memphis Light, Gas and Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 18 (1978) (hearing required before cutting off utility service); Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 579 (1975) (at minimum, due process requires "some kind of notice and . . . some kind of hearing" before suspension of students from public school); Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557-58 (1974) (hearing required before forfeiture of prisoner's good-time credits); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80-84 (1972) (hearing required before issuance of writ allowing repossession of property); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 264 (1970) (hearing required before termination of welfare benefits).18reasons are given prior to any detention. . . . [and a] formal probable-cause hearing is then held within a short while thereafter, if the factfinding hearing is not itself scheduled within three days." Id. at 274, 277. Since Schall, virtually all state juvenile court acts have adopted specific requirements about who may be detained pending adjudication; have required a judicial detention hearing following soon after admission to detention; and have strictly limited the duration of pretrial detention. Indeed, under most state codes, only those charged with criminal offenses may be detained pre-adjudication for any length of time. At the detention hearing, the state bears the burden of proving reasonable cause for believing that the minor has committed an offense, and that detention ­ as opposed to any other less restrictive alternative ­ is necessary. Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Desktop Guide to Good Juvenile Detention Practice, at 27-28 (Oct. 1996).13In Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 297 (1993), the Court reaffirmed these principles in the context of immigration proceedings involving juveniles. There, the Court considered INS regulations permitting juveniles who are detained pending deportation hearings to be released only to their parents, close relatives, or legal guardians. In contrast to this case, the Flores regulations preserved the INS district director's discretion in "unusual and compelling circumstances" to release the juvenile to some other adult and the juvenile was entitled to appeal a refusal of release. Id. at 310. While concluding that juveniles' interest in "freedom from physical restraint" was less powerful13. The ABA's Standards Relating to Interim Status: The Release, Control, and Detention of Accused Juvenile Offenders Between Arrest and Disposition likewise recognize the importance of such procedural protections. Under these standards, an accused juvenile taken into custody should be accorded a hearing in court within a day of the filing of a petition for a release hearing. The burden is on the state to show probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed an offense charged, and the juvenile is entitled to actual notice of the hearing and the presence of an attorney. Id., Standard 7.6.19than adults', id. at 302, the Flores Court emphasized that the regulations afforded juveniles substantial protection: the INS district director had discretion, subject to review in a hearing before an immigration judge, to release a juvenile to an unspecified custodian, id. at 313-14; 8 C.F.R. § 263.3(c)(4). Under these circumstances, the Government's suggestion that Flores somehow approves non-discretionary, mandatory detention of adults in the same context cannot withstand scrutiny.In contrast to all of the foregoing, the cases cited by the Government do not suggest that an irrebuttable presumption of flight risk or dangerousness can justify non-punitive detention. Particularly in Carlson v. Landon, the Court upheld the Attorney General's authority to detain Communist aliens pending hearings, but emphasized that he retained discretion, subject to judicial review, to grant bail when appropriate. 342 U.S. 524, 544 (1952) ("Of course purpose to injure could not be imputed generally to all aliens subject to deportation, so discretion was placed by the 1950 Act in the Attorney General to detain aliens without bail. . . ."); id. at 543-44 ("[T]he Attorney General is not left with untrammeled discretion as to bail. Courts review his determination. Hearings are had, and he must justify his refusal of bail by reference to the legislative scheme to eradicate the evils of Communist activity."). A presumption against granting bail to certain classes of persons must be distinguished from a categorical refusal even to evaluate a person's flight risk and dangerousness.14Finally, the Government's suggestion that a pre-detention determination of deportability satisfies any constitutional14. See Salerno, 481 U.S. at 765 n.6 (Marshall, J., dissenting)The majority states that denial of bail in capital cases has traditionally been the rule rather than the exception. And this of course is so, for it has been the considered presumption of generations of judges that a defendant in danger of execution has an extremely strong incentive to flee. If in any particular case the presumed likelihood of flight should be made irrebuttable, it would in all probability violate the Due Process Clause.20requirement relating to detention misses the point. Petr. Br. at 26-27 (citing In re Joseph, 22 I. & N. Dec. at 806, 1999 WL 339053, at *6-7). Whether a person falls within the class of immigrants who may be deportable under Section 1226(c) does not resolve whether they should be detained ­ based on flight risk or dangerousness ­ while the Government determines whether or not they may be deported. As this Court has recognized, even an immigrant who has been ordered deported (which Mr. Kim has not) retains a cognizable liberty interest. See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 679-80, 696. Thus, regardless of whether an immigrant may be deportable, the Government may not detain him pending further proceedings unless the Government also has a "special," particularized reason for doing so. See Foucha, 504 U.S. at 81-82.II. There Is No Reasonable Basis Here for an Exception to the Due Process RuleThe ABA agrees that ensuring appearances in immigration proceedings and protecting the public are legitimate Government interests. But "the mere invocation of a legitimate purpose," Schall, 467 U.S. at 269, is not enough to justify the mandatory detention, for an unknown period of time, of lawful permanent residents who are not being punished for a crime. Rather, when less restrictive alternatives are equally capable of serving the Government's interests in public safety and speedy process, due process plainly favors their use. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690 (Government must present "special justification" for detention that "outweighs the `individual's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint'" (quoting Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 356)); Salerno, 481 U.S. at 747 (detention for a non-punitive purpose must not be "excessive" means of fulfilling Government purpose); id. at 750 (upholding federal pretrial detention scheme only in the "narrow circumstances" where a neutral magistrate had found that "no conditions of release can reasonably assure the safety of the community") (emphasis added). This disposition toward liberty rather than detention21unless necessary is part of the fabric of the U.S. judicial system.15 As this Court has very recently emphasized: "The choice . . . is not between imprisonment and the alien `living at large.' It is between imprisonment and supervision under release conditions that may not be violated." Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 696 (citations omitted).A. Numerous Less Restrictive Alternatives Can Guard Against Flight and Threats to Public SafetyAny number of "conditions of release" can more than adequately satisfy the Government's asserted interests here. Indeed, such conditioned release programs have long been the norm in United States criminal and civil detention schemes. Limited by continually strained resources, and driven by the same due process concerns that have animated the Court's jurisprudence in this area, jurisdictions throughout the country make it standard practice to avoid unnecessary detention and to conduct individual assessments of individuals' suitability for some form of release. Pretrial release programs for criminal suspects awaiting trial have been implemented in more than 300 counties and in all 94 districts in the federal court system. National Institute of Justice Issues and Practices, Pretrial Services Programs: Responsibilities and Potential, NCJ 181939, at 8 (March 2001) (hereinafter "DOJ Pretrial Services Survey"). In fact, immigration detention is the only area in which supervised release programs are not pursued as a matter of course.To ensure that courts reach objective and consistent decisions regarding release, the ABA has urged that every jurisdiction establish a pretrial services agency to collect information and risk assessments, to monitor and assist released15. The reasons for this presumption are plain: "Deprivation of liberty pending trial is harsh and oppressive, subjects defendants to economic and psychological hardship, interferes with their ability to defend themselves, and, in many instances, deprives their families of support." Pretrial Release Standards, Standard 10-1.1.22defendants, and to review the status (and eligibility for release) of detained defendants. Pretrial Release Standards, Standard 10-1.10.16In keeping with these standards, pretrial services programs have been operating for the past four decades and now vigorously perform two key functions: supervising defendants who are released from custody while awaiting trial, and gathering information about newly arrested defendants and available release options for use by a judicial officer who will be determining the defendant's custody or release status. See generally DOJ Pretrial Services Survey. Most programs manage the risk of harm to the public or nonappearance in court by monitoring defendants' compliance with conditions of release (such as regular phone or in-person check-ins, movement restrictions, or electronic monitoring, and, in certain cases, confinement). Id. at 37-48. Through their decades of accumulated experience, these programs have taught law enforcement a great deal about strategies that can dramatically improve appearance rates (including numerous steps as simple as reminding defendants of upcoming court appointments) and manage risk to the public. Id.16. The ABA maintains that courts should employ "the least restrictive condition(s) of release that will reasonably ensure a defendant's attendance at court proceedings and protect the community, victims, witnesses or any other person." Id. Standard 10-1.2. Only if it can be determined that "no conditions of release" would satisfy these needs may defendants be detained. Id.; see also 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)If, after a hearing pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f), . . . the judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before to trial.The National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies (NAPSA) Performance Standards and Goals for Pretrial Release, Standard I & comm. at 4 (2d ed. 1998).23Recognizing that such programs had tremendous potential for relieving its perennially overburdened detention system, the INS commissioned a study by a well-known nonprofit research organization to determine whether various supervised release techniques ­ from monitoring through regular phone and inperson appearances before program staff to providing regular reminders of court hearings and referrals to relevant services ­ could boost appearance rates at deportation proceedings. Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program (August 1, 2000).17 Although the appearance rates of the lawful permanent residents who had served criminal sentences was already quite high (89%) without any supervisory assistance, when these individuals were given the benefit of even limited appearance assistance support, their appearance rate exceeded 94%. Id. at 33-36.18 In the end, about 90% of all of the supervised immigrants participating in the program appeared at all court hearings. As the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee recognized, "[t]he results from the Vera Institute's program exceeded expectations, resulting in . . . an impressive appearance rate at court hearings." Letter to the Honorable John Ashcroft, Attorney General from Senators Leahy, Kennedy, Hatch, and Brownback (Aug. 16, 2002) (hereinafter "Ashcroft Letter").Because the pilot program so exceeded expectations, Congress last year allocated $3 million for the implementation17. The Vera Institute Appearance Assistance Program study was conducted between 1997 and 2000, and involved 534 participants, 127 of whom were presumptively subject to removal and detention based on their criminal convictions. Of this 127, all but six were lawful permanent residents. The Vera Institute study remains, to the ABA's knowledge, the sole effort to examine the appearance rates of the class of immigrants at issue in this case.18. Indeed, the lawful permanent residents involved in the study consistently demonstrated a higher appearance rate (with assistance or without) than any other immigrant group studied, including political asylum seekers and undocumented immigrant workers.24of "alternatives to detention" programs. Senate Appropriations Report 107-42, "Department of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill, 2002," p. 40. As a recent letter from the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee responsible for adding these appropriations makes clear, P.L. 107-77 "specially directed" the Department of Justice to devote these funds to using "community-based organizations to screen asylum seekers and other INS detainees for community ties, provide them with necessary services and help to assure their appearance at court hearings." Ashcroft Letter.In all events, the INS could fail to pursue the release program Congress has authorized and still employ a far less restrictive approach to determining removability ­ an approach that imposes no additional burden on the liberty of the individual potentially subject to removal. As the INS has long recognized, unnecessary detention can be avoided entirely simply by identifying those who are potentially deportable and conducting deportation hearings while they are still incarcerated for a criminal offense. U.S. General Accounting Office, Criminal Aliens: INS' Efforts to Identify and Remove Imprisoned Aliens Continue to Need Improvement (Feb. 1999); see also id. (Oct. 1998 edition); id. (July 1997 edition). Faced with concerns that it was failing to identify potentially deportable immigrants while they were still in prison, the INS began efforts to implement an "Institutional Hearing Program" ("IHP") ­ an effort to ensure that potentially deportable immigrants were identified while still incarcerated, and subject to removal hearings during that same period, without the need for indefinite detention past the expiration of their sentences. The GAO found repeatedly that the INS had simply failed to identify these individuals while they were still serving their criminal sentences. As a result, the INS was forced to detain immigrants who did not complete the removal hearing process in prison (incurring on the order of $40 million in avoidable detention costs in the process). Perhaps worst of all, those immigrants whose deportation hearings happened to start before they were released25from prison faced an average of 23 additional days in detention; for those whose hearings were commenced after their release, individuals were subject to an average of 88 additional days in detention. Id. (Oct. 1998 Edition) at 36.Taking into account the INS' ongoing IHP program, the Vera Institute's pilot Appearance Assistance Program, and Congress' own insistence that the INS pursue such alternatives to detention with the money Congress expressly earmarked for that purpose, there can be no justification for insisting upon mandatory detention of the class of immigrants here ­ lawful permanent residents ­ who are most likely to appear in court of their own accord.B. Congress Did Not Review the "Actual Consequences" of Discretionary ReleaseThe Government maintains that "[t]he mandatory detention requirement of 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) is the product of Congress's close scrutiny of the actual consequences of allowing release of criminal aliens." Petr. Br. at 8. In fact, the Government presents no "actual" support for the conclusion that immigrants who fall within the definition of Section 1226(c) must be detained in order to protect the public or to guard against the risk of flight. On the contrary, as discussed above, the statistical and experiential evidence that does exist supports just the opposite conclusion.The vast majority of the evidence in legislative history cited by the Government in support of its description of the "scrutiny" Congress applied was not in fact before the Congress that passed Section 1226(c) in 1996. As has been noted, supra at 7-8, the mandatory detention policy challenged here was adopted in 1996 and put into effect for the first time in 1998. Before that, policy regarding the disposition of immigrants pending deportation hearings changed repeatedly ­ sometimes annually ­ with successive new enactments. The evidence cited by the Government from legislative history preceding earlier amendments to the Immigration and Naturalization Act cannot26be said to have led the 1996 Congress to an "ineluctabl[e] conclu[sion]," Petr. Br. at 21, about anything, much less about the need for the particular mandatory detention provision then enacted and now at issue in this case.19 Worse, the evidence cited that was before these earlier congresses vacillates randomly between statistics describing the behavior of illegal entrants to the United States (only legal permanent residents are at issue in this case), and "aliens" generally without any description of whom this category includes.20 Much of the rest of the legislative history cited by the Government is either inapposite (speaking to Congress' concern generally about the slow pace of removal, not the need for mandatory detention to speed things up), or would tend to lead Congress to just the opposite conclusion as the one the Government now maintains it reached. See, e.g., Petr. Br. at 18 (citing high costs of incarceration and contribution to prison overcrowding resulting from detention of immigrants). Most striking in the Government's catalog of legislative history is the complete absence of any evidence that the Congress, in enacting the latest Section 1226(c), devoted any time to weighing the necessity of mandatory detention for all immigrants potentially subject to deportation.Having found no comfort in the record actually before Congress when Section 1226(c) was enacted, the Government19. See, e.g., Petr. Br. at 13 (quoting reasoning from 133 Cong. Rec. 28,840-41 (1987)); id. at 16-17, 20 (studies cited in Hearing on H.R. 3333 Brief the Subcomm. On Immigration, Refugees, and International Law of the House Comm. On the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 71-72 (1989)); id. at 17-21 (Statistics from Criminal Aliens in the United States: Hearings Before the Permanent Subcomm. On Investigations of the Senate Comm. On Governmental Affairs, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1993)).20. Compare, e.g., Petr. Br. at 13 (citing 1987 testimony by thenpending legislation sponsor regarding arrest rates of "illegal aliens"), with id. at 19 (citing statistics of number of "aliens" in 1992 who had committed an aggravated felony (presumably, as then quite narrowly defined) and then failed to appear for hearings).27turns to a 1996 study ­ apparently cited nowhere in the legislative history ­ purporting to show that fully 90% of immigrants like Respondent abscond. Petr. Br. at 23-25. (citing Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Dep't. of Justice, Inspection Report, Immigration and Naturalization Service Deportation of Aliens After Final Orders Have Been Issued, Rep. No. I-96-03 (Mar. 1996) (hereinafter "OIG Report"). Even a passing look at the OIG Report reveals that the study does not address the question at issue in this case: whether it is reasonable to presume ­ irrebuttably ­ that lawful permanent residents pose such a flight risk or danger that they must be detained, for an arbitrary period, until the Government gets around to determining their removability.The OIG Report found, simply, that 89% of non-detained aliens subject to a final removal order were never deported. This finding does not purport to address, in particular, the flight risk of immigrants subject to Section 1226(c), immigrants who have not yet been issued final orders of removal, immigrants released on bail after a hearing, or lawful permanent residents. At a minimum, as this Court is well aware, "[t]here is a clear difference . . . between facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation." St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 325; see also Kim v. Ziglar, 276 F.3d 523, 535 ("[t]he incentives to flee are greater for an alien already ordered removed than for an alien still in removal proceedings"); Cardoso v. Reno, 127 F. Supp. 2d 106, 114 (D. Conn. 2001) ("applying a presumption of flight risk to aliens such as Ms. Cardoso is, in fact, counter-intuitive, because as her last opportunity to remain lawfully in the United States, Ms. Cardoso has every incentive to attend the . . . hearing at which her removability will be determined"); General Accounting Office, Illegal Aliens: Opportunities Exist to Improve the Expedited Removal Process (Sept. 2000).Further, the reason given in the OIG Report as to why 89% of "non-detained" aliens are never deported after receiving final orders of removal has nothing to do with a finding that these individuals invariably pose a risk of danger or flight. Rather,28the OIG Report concludes that the INS has simply failed to enforce final orders of deportation. The OIG Report repeatedly emphasizes that such factors as the lack of detention and transportation resources, delays in receipt of final orders by the detention and deportation centers, failure to send surrender requests, and failure to pursue or investigate abscondees contributed significantly to the low deportation rate. Id. at 511; see also Serrano v. Estrada, 201 F. Supp. 2d 714, 726 n. 53 ("citing a `shortage of investigative resources' the report noted that `[n]ondetained aliens who do not comply with a surrender request [we]re rarely pursued actively'") (citations omitted). The OIG Report thus proposes reforms aimed at more "efficient use of detention resources," including "moving more quickly to present surrender notices to aliens after receiving final orders," "delivering surrender notices instead of mailing them," actually "pursuing aliens who fail to appear," "coordinating with other governmental agencies to . . .track[ ] aliens who fail to appear," and "taking aliens into custody... when final orders are issued." Id. at 14.In contrast to the scant evidence supporting mandatory detention for all lawful permanent residents, there is no question that the "actual consequences" of mandatory detention of immigrants like Mr. Kim have been to overwhelm INS detention resources to the breaking point. This outcome is not surprising. As of December 2001, the INS had access to 21,304 beds in federal, state and local facilities to detain legal and illegal immigrants. In Fiscal Year 2000 alone, the INS admitted more than 188,000 aliens into custody for some period of time. Statement of Joseph Greene, Acting Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner for INS Field Operations, Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 107th Cong., 1st Sess., at 18 (Dec. 19, 2001).Since the INS began asking Congress to reconsider implementing Section 1226(c)'s mandatory detention requirement (which took effect in 1998), the INS has maintained29that it "will be unable to meet the custody requirements of IIRIRA." Testimony of Doris Meissner, Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service, before the Subcommittee on Immigration Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate (Sept. 16, 1998). Justice Department studies conducted since then have in fact found resources deeply strained. Indeed, one INS district office reported that it was releasing aliens ­ not because the local officials wanted to authorize release, but because of lack of detention space. U.S. General Accounting Office, Illegal Aliens: Opportunities Exist to Improve the Expedited Removal Process, at 64-65 (Sept. 2000).Whatever the formal strictures of due process, the system that produces such results ­ that detains and releases individuals on the basis of whether or not a bed happens to be available, and whether or not their detention actually serves the Government's purposes ­ is arbitrary at best. Even "removable and inadmissible aliens are entitled to be free from detention that is arbitrary or capricious." Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 721 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). The liberty interests, and accompanying procedural safeguards, afforded to "persons" in this country are surely at least equal to this.30CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, amicus American Bar Association urges that the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,ALFRED P. CARLTON, JR.*President, American Bar Association 750 North Lake Shore DriveChicago, IL 60611Of Counsel:(312) 588-5000JEFFREY L. BLEICH DEBORAH N. PEARLSTEINAttorneys for Amicus Curiae * 
I. THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS PROVIDES A CRUCIAL MECHANISM FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR ALL PERSONS WITHIN THE UNITED STATESA. Judicial Review Of Executive And Legislative Action Is Essential To A Functioning DemocracyUnder our constitutional scheme, judicial review serves as a bulwark against impingement of the rule of law. DOT v. Association of Am. R.R., 135 S. Ct. 1225, 1246 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) ("The `check' the judiciary provides to maintain our separation of powers is enforcement of the rule of law through judicial review."). The Framers envisioned a system in which the powers of the U.S. government are split among three branches of government, each with the power to check the others. Judicial review of legislative and executive action is necessary to keep the political branches accountable and maintain the proper balance of powers. See Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 761 (1982) (Burger, J., concurring).The genius of this structure is that it "serves not only to make Government accountable but also to secure individual liberty." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 742; see Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 7567(1996) (noting that "[e]ven before the birth of this country, separation of powers was known to be a defense against tyranny"); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) ("[T]he Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty."). By helping to ensure that no branch aggrandizes power at the expense of any other, judicial review has played a crucial role in strengthening the separation of powers and protecting individual liberty throughout our Nation's history.That longstanding commitment to judicial review helps explain why this Court has "constantly emphasized the fundamental importance of the writ of habeas corpus in our constitutional scheme." Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 485 (1969). It "must never be forgotten that the writ of habeas corpus is the precious safeguard of personal liberty and there is no higher duty than to maintain it unimpaired." Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U.S. 19, 26 (1939). That view, moreover, is consistent with the views of the Framers: the right to the habeas writ is "perhaps greater securit[y] to liberty and republicanism" than any of the separate rights mentioned in the Bill of Rights. THE FEDERALIST NO. 84 (Alexander Hamilton).B. Both Precedent And Practice Dictate Habeas Review For Noncitizens On U.S. SoilThis Court has consistently made the writ of habeas corpus available to any person--citizen or not--within the United States (and even other areas under U.S. control). Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 779; St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 305-306. To exclude individuals8placed in expedited removal from that tradition would contravene established precedent and practice.Certain constitutionally protected rights,including the right to habeas review, have not beenlimited to U.S. citizens. This Court has long held thatmany of the guarantees of the Fifth and FourteenthAmendments protect all "persons" within the UnitedStates, regardless of citizenship or status. Forexample, in Mathews v. Diaz, this Court explainedthat while aliens may not be "entitled to enjoy all theadvantages of citizenship," "[e]ven one whose presencein this country is unlawful, involuntary, or transitory"is still entitled to fundamental constitutionalprotections. 426 U.S. 67, 77-78 (1976); see also YickWo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 374 (1886) (holding thatordinance used to discriminate against persons fromChina violated Fourteenth Amendment). Thoseconstitutional protections include due process inremoval proceedings. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S.678, 693 (2001) ("But once an alien enters the country,the legal circumstance changes, for the Due ProcessClause applies to all `persons' within the UnitedStates, including aliens, whether their presence hereis lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent."); seealso, e.g., Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 32-34(1982) (affirming procedural due process rights inexclusion proceedings).Although Congressunquestionably enjoys broad powers to regulateimmigration, that power cannot trump individualconstitutional protections.In recognition of that principle, as well as the essential role of judicial review, this Court has repeatedly affirmed "the strong presumption in favor9of judicial review of administrative action," including in the context of removal proceedings. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 298; see also, e.g., McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc.,, 498 U.S. 479, 498 (1991); Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988); Bowen v. Michigan Acad. of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986). Without such a presumption, serious separation-of-powers questions would arise. Webster, 486 U.S. at 603. And with respect to habeas corpus specifically, this Court has recognized that the Suspension Clause "unquestionably require[s]" judicial review in deportation cases. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 300-301 (internal quotation marks omitted). Prohibiting noncitizens already within the United States from invoking the Suspension Clause--at least without requiring Congress to suspend the writ--would deprive those persons of "a vital instrument for the protection of individual liberty." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 743, 745 (citing Hamdi v. Rumsfield, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004)).Even noncitizens "on the threshold of initial entry" or "`assimilated to (that) status' for constitutional purposes," Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 212, 214 (1953) (quoting Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 599 (1953)), historically have been able to seek habeas relief. See, e.g., id. at 208 (considering an alien's challenge to his exclusion on habeas review); Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, 142 U.S. 651, 660 (1892) ("An alien immigrant, prevented from landing by any such officer claiming authority to do so under an act of Congress, and thereby restrained of his liberty, is doubtless entitled to a writ of habeas corpus10to ascertain whether the restraint is lawful."). Indeed, this Court has held that such review is "required by the Constitution." Heikkila, 345 U.S. at 235.This Court's prior affirmation that Suspension Clause protection extends to noncitizens within U.S. borders is also consistent with English common law, which recognized that the writ ran to all citizens and nonenemy foreigners within the realm. See, e.g., Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 746, 771, 779; see also id. at 746 ("[A]t the absolute minimum the Clause protects the writ as it existed when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.") (internal quotation marks omitted); Ex Parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75, 9394 (1807) ("[F]or the meaning of the term habeas corpus, resort may unquestionably be had to the common law[.]"). At common law, for example, the writ was held to apply to noncitizens located overseas, as it was one of the main defenses for sailors facing impressment into the Royal Navy. Kevin Costello, Habeas Corpus and Military and Naval Impressment, 1756-1816, 29 J. LEGAL HIST. 215 (2008).That precedent and history forecloses the government's attempt to deny habeas protections to persons already within U.S. territory. In seeking to restrict habeas, the government argues that recent unlawful entrants should be treated like noncitizens seeking to enter the United States, rather than those already in the United States. Even if that were appropriate, however, it cannot justify denying habeas review at the threshold here. Due process doctrine has distinguished between those seeking to enter and those in the country. See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 693 (noting "[t]he distinction between an alien who has11effected an entry into the United States and one who has never entered"); Mezei, 345 U.S. at 212 ("It is true that aliens who have once passed through our gates, even illegally, may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law."). But that distinction has never been part of habeas law; habeas was always available regardless of entry. In fact, it was the availability of habeas that permitted adjudication of the extent of due process afforded to entering noncitizens in the first place. See, e.g., Plasencia, 459 U.S. at 32; Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522 (1954); Mezei, 345 U.S. 206; Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952); Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524 (1952); United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537 (1950); Zakonaite v. Wolf, 226 U.S. 272 (1912); Nishimura Ekiu, 142 U.S. 651.C. Barring Habeas Review In This Case Threatens Noncitizens More BroadlyTreating noncitizens within the United States as equivalent to those standing on the "threshold of initial entry" undermines the rule of law. Under the government's view, it would proscribe judicial review for persons who fall within certain arbitrary categories, such as those without "sufficiently meaningful ties to the country" or who have not lived here "for some meaningful period." U.S. Br. 23, 25. Such an approach legitimizes the "manipulation" of the Suspension Clause, thereby undercutting the purpose of habeas review as "an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 765-766. It also "would permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of12government, leading to a regime in which Congress and the President, not this Court, say `what the law is.'" Id. at 765 (citing Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803)).Limiting habeas protections for certain noncitizens based on such arbitrary distinctions additionally replaces a categorical rule--habeas is available to all within the United States--with an imprecise and case-specific alternative that will necessitate future litigation. Courts will wrestle to understand the boundary of the Suspension Clause for other aliens with a more "meaningful" presence in the United States than Respondent in this case. But as already explained, this Court's precedents demonstrate that any presence in the United States is sufficient to trigger the Clause's protections. See supra pp. 7-11. Because judicial review of removal orders is necessary to safeguard the separation of powers, the Suspension Clause's application cannot turn on nebulous factors such as exactly where and when a noncitizen is apprehended. Moreover, as an asylum seeker, Respondent's "ties" to the country cannot be measured simply by the number of days or feet he was in the country before his arrest.Though it is critical for the Suspension Clause's protection to extend to all persons within U.S. borders, the rationale underlying the categorical rule is reinforced by the government's current position on the increased scope of its removal authority. Previously, the government limited application of the statutory expedited removal procedure to those aliens encountered within 14 days of entry without inspection and within 100 air miles of any U.S.13international land border. Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 69 Fed. Reg. 48,877, 48,879 (Aug. 11, 2004). But earlier this year, the government (as it acknowledges in a footnote, U.S. Br. 6 n.2) expanded expedited removal "to eligible aliens apprehended in any part of the United States who have not been admitted or paroled by immigration authorities, and who have been physically present in the country for" up to two years. HILLEL R. SMITH, CONG. RESEARCH SERV., R45314, EXPEDITED REMOVAL OF ALIENS: LEGAL FRAMEWORK 2 (2019); see Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 84 Fed. Reg. 35,409 (July 23, 2019); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii). Thus, while the government in this case emphasizes Respondent's "momentary unlawful presence," U.S. Br. 17, its position also risks denial of Suspension Clause protections for a much broader group of noncitizens--including, under current DHS regulations, those located anywhere in the country two years after entry.Under the government's logic, a noncitizen residing anywhere in the country for nearly two years could be arrested, placed into expedited removal proceedings, and deported without any judicial hearing. For example, federal immigration authorities could apprehend a group of noncitizens from the streets of Seattle, Topeka, or Detroit-- potentially thousands of miles away from where they crossed the border years earlier--and still deport them via expedited removal.That scenario is no mere hypothetical. According to news reports, months ago DHS set up a fake university to lure noncitizens, arresting a "total of14about 250 students *** who [were] enticed *** to attend the school that marketed itself as offering graduate programs in technology and computer studies." Niraj Warikoo, ICE Arrests 90 More Students at Fake University in Michigan, DETROIT FREE PRESS (Dec. 11, 2019).5 Some students received a final order of removal, while others were "given an expedited removal by U.S. Customs and Border Protection." Id. In the government's view, the Suspension Clause offers that latter group of students no protections at all. Additionally, because the government also claims that due process is only available to those lawfully admitted, and ties habeas corpus to due process rights, the government's position would mean even those here far longer could constitutionally be removed without administrative or judicial review.This is especially troubling given the types of claims foreclosed without the safeguard of habeas review. Respondent challenged his removal on the grounds that "the government failed to follow the required procedures and apply the correct legal standards when evaluating his credible fear claim." Pet. App. 37a. But it also forecloses reviewing denials of claims based on racial, ethnic, or religious animus. Without habeas, there would be no vehicle to review these blatantly unconstitutional actions.In adopting its policy position, the ABA was guided by the consideration that, "[f]or many5 Available at https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/ michigan/2019/11/27/ice-arrested-250-foreign-students-fakeuniversity-metro-detroit/4277686002/.15noncitizens, it is the right to go before a judge that differentiates the United States from other countries that lack the same commitment to the rule of law." American Bar Association, Policy Report 114D, at 3 (adopted 2010). 6 Indeed, the ABA highlighted the fundamental issue with prohibiting judicial review for persons within the United States based merely on the circumstances of their entrance: "The administration of our immigration and naturalization laws will thus become an administration of men rather than of laws." Revision of Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality Laws: Joint Hearing on S. 716, H.R. 2379, and H.R. 2816 Before the Subcomms. of the Comms. on the Judiciary, 82nd Cong. 527 (1951) (statement of Jack Wasserman, American Bar Association), as reprinted in American Bar Association, Policy Report 119, at 23 (adopted 1983). The government's approach, which would deny judicial review to both Respondent and a greatly expanded category of people residing in the United States, makes that warning a reality.II. SECTION1252(E)(2)ISUNCONSTITUTIONAL AS APPLIED TORESPONDENTFor all the reasons detailed in Part I, the Suspension Clause plainly applies to Respondent, who was apprehended within U.S. borders. That answer raises a further question: whether the review6 Available at https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/ aba/directories/policy/2010_my_114d.pdf.16provided in section 1252(e)(2) is an adequate substitute for habeas corpus.Although this Court has not elaborated all "of the requisites for an adequate substitute," the Court deemed it "uncontroversial *** that the privilege of habeas corpus entitles the prisoner" to review of legal claims. Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 779. Because section 1252(e)(2) lacks this critical hallmark of habeas review, it cannot pass constitutional muster. And no argument grounded in efficiency can overcome that fatal constitutional flaw.A. Section 1252(e)(2) Blocks Review Of Weighty Legal Questions That Habeas Historically Has Enabled Courts To HearTo be an adequate substitute for habeas corpus, section 1252(e)(2) must be commensurate with the "necessary scope of habeas review." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 779-783. Habeas provides a "critical check on *** Executive" power, Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 525, and is a "precious safeguard of personal liberty," Bowen, 306 U.S. at 26; see also Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural (Mar. 4, 1802) (habeas corpus is one of the "essential principles of our Government"), reprinted in Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States, S. Doc. No. 101-10, at 16 (1989).These core habeas functions require a "judicial inquiry" into the legality of detention. Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 744. Thus, at a minimum, habeas review (or an adequate substitute) must provide "the prisoner *** [with] a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to `the erroneous17application or interpretation' of relevant law." Id. at 779. And a habeas court must be empowered to consider and adjudicate such legal claims. Id. at 787 (considering whether the procedures at issue "allow[ed] the Court of Appeals to conduct a proceeding meeting the[] standards" of habeas review) (emphasis added).This Court has embraced that responsibility: it has used habeas cases as the vehicle for some of its most consequential constitutional rulings. See, e.g., Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (whether Eighth Amendment bars executing juveniles); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) (what appropriate standard is for ineffective assistance of counsel); In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967) (whether Fourteenth Amendment due process requirements apply to juvenile court proceedings); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963) (whether Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies to defendants in state courts); Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 373-374 (whether facially neutral law applied "with an evil eye and an unequal hand" could violate Equal Protection Clause). Even the cases the government cites as evidence of a noncitizen's lack of separate due process rights never would have been decided without the writ of habeas corpus. See supra p. 11.The expedited removal provision, however, does not permit review of such fundamental constitutional questions. Under section 1252(e)(2), persons placed into expedited removal can raise only three challenges: (1) that they are not an alien, (2) that they were never in fact "ordered removed," and (3) that they are a legal permanent resident, "ha[ve] been admitted18as a refugee," or "ha[ve] been granted asylum." 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2). That is all. A person cannot argue that he or she was "actually []admissible," id. § 1252(e)(5); that the agent incorrectly applied the law; or that the removal was unconstitutional on some other ground. At bottom, section 1252(e)(2) restricts judicial review to "questions relating to an alien's status or identity" and nothing else. U.S. Br. 20. But habeas was not designed for--let alone confined to-- "claims of mistaken identity." Br. in Opp'n 4.Restricting review to questions of mistaken identity prevents courts from considering the fundamental requirements of law. Without the ability to do so, courts are left to act as little more than rubber stamps--constrained to approve executive decisions without any real scrutiny at all.B. Any Delay Incident To Habeas Review Does Not Warrant Discarding The WritThe government warns that permitting habeas review in this case will "create[] a pathway for thousands of inadmissible aliens *** to delay their removal for potentially extended periods by filing a habeas petition." U.S. Br. 47. But the normal burdens of judicial review--i.e., time and resources--have always been "necessarily and properly incident to the processing and adjudication of habeas corpus proceedings." Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 297 (1969); see Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 769 ("Compliance with any judicial process requires some incremental expenditure of resources."). Except in cases of formal suspension, neither the number of potential19petitioners nor the prospect of delay has ever justified diluting the writ's protections.In 1882, for example, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which "restrict[ed] the admission" of Chinese nationals. LUCY E. SALYER, LAWS HARSH AS TIGERS: CHINESE IMMIGRANTS AND THE SHAPING OF MODERN IMMIGRATION LAW 7 (1995). Although a "collector of customs at each port" was charged with the enforcement of the act, Chinese nationals consistently challenged their denials "by filing petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the local federal courts." Id. at 18. As a result, thousands of habeas petitions were filed--many in just one court, the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Id. at 74.The number of filings impaired the ability of courts to adjudicate the cases. See In re Tung Yeong, 19 F. 184, 185 (D. Cal. 1884) ("The very great number of cases in which writs of habeas corpus have been sued out of this court by Chinese persons claiming to be illegally restrained of their liberty, and which were of necessity summarily investigated and disposed of, has rendered it impossible for the court to deliver a written opinion in each case."). The flood of cases also impaired the Executive Branch's ability to remove petitioners after cases were adjudicated. See In re Chin Ah Sooey, 21 F. 393, 394 (D. Cal. 1884) (explaining how remanding immigrant petitioners "to the custody from which [they] w[ere] taken, when such custody [wa]s found to be lawful, *** was impracticable" due to "the number of cases"; "for the ship would, in the ordinary course of her trade, have departed long before petitions could be heard").20Yet these practical burdens were insufficient to deny habeas review. As the federal district court explained:When, therefore, Chinese in large numbers arrived at this port, who were detained on board the ship by the master, at the instance of the customs-house authorities, their right to demand the judgment of the court whether they were lawfully restrained of their liberty could not be gainsaid. Writs of habeas corpus were accordingly issued in hundreds of instances.Chin Ah Sooey, 21 F. at 393-394. When a customs inspector "suggested to a congressional subcommittee on immigration in 1890 that the problem of Chinese immigration could be solved by revoking the privilege of habeas corpus from the Chinese, Senator Watson C. Squire wryly queried: `That would be a little inimical to the spirit of the Constitution?'" SALYER, supra, at 75.The delay associated with habeas review is a cost this Court has been willing to impose for the "stable bulwark of our liberties." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 742 (quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 137). In St. Cyr, as here, the government argued that a ruling in respondent's favor would result in "significant delays" in removal proceedings. U.S. Br. 15-16, St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (No. 00-767) ("The court of appeals['] *** conclu[sion] that the district court had authority to review respondent's challenge to his removal order by habeas corpus *** threatens to cause significant delays in the removal of criminal aliens from the21United States, despite Congress's manifest desire that removal of criminal aliens be expedited."). This Court affirmed the court of appeals' recognition of habeas jurisdiction anyway: "Because of [the Suspension] Clause, some `judicial intervention in deportation cases' is unquestionably `required by the Constitution.'" St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 300.To be sure, Congress has the power to ameliorate possible delay occasioned by habeas review. "[T]he Suspension Clause does not resist innovation in the field of habeas corpus." Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 795. And "[c]ertain accommodations can be made to reduce the burden of habeas corpus proceedings." Id. But those "accommodations" may not "impermissibly dilut[e] the protections of the writ." Id. Where this Court has upheld "habeas substitutes," the "statutes at issue were attempts to streamline habeas corpus relief, not to cut it back." Id. at 774.By contrast, section 1252(e)(2)'s limitation of habeas review to three narrow, identity-focused issues is not merely "streamlining" habeas relief; it is gutting the writ's protections. Neither precedent nor practice countenances that result.22CONCLUSION The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted.Pratik A. Shah James E. Tysse Michelle A.

I. The Petition Raises Issues Of Nationwide Import.Every state, and the federal judiciary, has adopted some set of judicial canons predicated on the ABA's model. See generally L. MILORD, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ABA JUDICIAL CODE 7 (1992); M. Peter Moser, The 1990 ABA Code of Judicial Conduct: A Model for the Future, 4 GEO. J. LEGAL ETHICS 731, 731 n.3 (1991). Moreover, the preferred merit selection method for choosing judges notwithstanding, the ABA committee drafting the Model Code has for some time been "aware that the public election method was deeply4rooted in many jurisdictions and unlikely to change significantly in the near future." MILORD, supra, at 46. Accordingly, the ABA must confront the dual reality that (1) judicialethics codes modeled on ABA standards are in force everywhere there are judges in this country, and (2) many of those judges will be chosen in elections, where they must campaign for office.In the face of Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765 (2002), no state that follows the ABA model can be sure how to conduct an election, and no judicial candidate can know the boundaries of permissible campaign behavior. This Court's guidance is critical for the proper operation of judicial elections.A. The Eighth Circuit's Ruling Calls into Question Portions of the Judicial Canons of 31 States Across the Nation.The ABA's Canons of Judicial Ethics (1924), Code of Judicial Conduct (1972), and Model Code of Judicial Conduct (1990) serve as the basis for the states' and federal judiciary's codification of "basic standards which should govern the conduct of all judges." ABA MODEL CODE OF JUD. CONDUCT (1990) (Preamble). Since the ABA began its work on the creation of standards for ethical conduct of judges in 1922, every state in the union, along with the federal judiciary, has adopted some iteration (albeit with a variety of modifications) of the ABA's judicial ethics guidelines. See generally MILORD, supra, at 7; Moser, supra, at 731 n.3.Specific to this case, 29 states have crafted a ban on judicial candidates' personal solicitation of campaign contributions like that reflected in Minnesota's Canon 5B(2).33 See ALASKA COURT RULES, CODE OF JUD.

This far-reaching effect justifies this Court's review of the issues raised. See, e.g., New York v.

But no clear consensus has developed.For instance, in Weaver v. Bonner, 309 F.3d 1312 (11th Cir. 2002), the Eleventh Circuit Court overturned Georgia's ban on personal campaign fund solicitations. "[W]e believe that the Supreme Court's decision in White suggests that the standard for judicial elections should be the same as the standard for legislative and executive elections." Weaver, 309 F.3d at 1321. But White itself said no such thing: "we neither assert nor imply that the First Amendment requires campaigns for judicial office to sound the same as those for legislative office." White, 536 U.S. at 783. Indeed, the high courts of Maine and New York have upheld restrictions on judicial campaign conduct even in light of White.6 See In re Dunleavy, 838 A.2d 338 (Me. 2003) (upholding ban on sitting judges from soliciting support for political candidates and political organizations, and from purchasing tickets to political dinners or functions); In re Raab, 793 N.E.2d 1287, 1292 (N.Y. 2003) (upholding limitations on judicial candidates' participation in other candidates campaigns and contributions to political organizations that support other candidates or general party objectives; "the State's interest in ensuring that judgeships are notand do not appear to be`for sale' is beyond compelling. The public would justifiably lose confidence in the court system were it otherwise and, without public confidence, the judicial branch could not function.").6 Disciplinary bodies and judicial ethics advisory committees in a number of jurisdictions have stated that campaign speech restrictions not explicitly addressed by the White decision should continue to be enforced. See Cynthia Gray, The States' Response to Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, 86 JUDICATURE 163 (2002).9These conflicting opinions are to be expected. As one district court has noted:To say there is considerable uncertainty regarding the scope of the Supreme Court's decision in White is an understatement. Whether the decision in White left any room for the regulation of speech of judicial candidates is a question yet to be resolved . . . . It has caused, and will continue to cause, considerable uncertainty and consternation on the part of judicial candidates.North Dakota Family Alliance v. Bader, 361 F. Supp. 2d 1021, 1041-42 (D.N.D. 2005). This confusion will permeate judicial elections across the nation.No fewer than 30 states are set to hold elections of their high court judges in 2006. Justice at Stake, Scheduled Supreme Court Elections 2006-2008, http://www.justiceatstake. org/files/SCElections06to08.pdf. Absent guidance from this Court, judicial candidates are left in an untenable situation either comply with potentially suspect rules, or worse, violate statues that are ultimately deemed constitutional and suffer prosecution and punishment. See, e.g., White, 536 U.S. at 769 ("[F]earing that further ethical complaints would jeopardize his ability to practice law, Wersal withdrew from the election."). To alleviate this state of confusion, the Court should provide guidance.II. The Petition Presents The Opportunity For ThisCourt To Address The Constitutionally Permissible Bounds Of Judicial Campaign Restrictions.This case concerns both the role of the judiciary and public's trust in the courts. It is therefore important to the ABA, which promulgates judicial-ethics standards:Explicit standards of judicial conduct provide essential guidance for judges in the proper discharge of their duties and the honorable conduct of their office. The10legislative bodies, judicial committees, and professional associations that promulgate those standards perform a vital public service.White, 536 U.S. at 793 (Kennedy, J., concurring).As the drafter of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct adopted in a majority of the states, the ABA must consider this Court's direct influence on the shape of judicial governance. The Model Code is being evaluated at the very time that this Court will consider granting certiorari in this case. How that Code is interpretedand whether the Partisan Activities Clause and the Solicitations Clause will surviveis of great moment.A. Judicial Independence, Integrity, and Impartiality are Critical Both to the Role of the Judiciary in American Government and the Public's Respect for the Courts."The citizen's respect for judgments depends . . . upon the issuing court's absolute probity." White, 536 U.S. at 793 (Kennedy, J., concurring). After all, "[j]udicial integrity is, in consequence [of public trust in a court's judgments], a state interest of the highest order." Id.Following White, many lower courts have reviewed the judicial canons only in the context of the First Amendment. See, e.g., Weaver v. Bonner, 309 F.3d 1312 (11th Cir. 2002) (striking down Georgia's ban on personal campaign fund solicitations). They do so with no apparent consideration of the important distinctions between judicial campaigns and those of the political branches. But one of the primary purposes of judicial canons, and therefore of the ABA's modelcode drafters, is the protection of judicial independence, integrity, and impartiality.In American government, the judiciary serves as a counterbalance to the majoritarian executive and legislative11branches. While introducing the Bill of Rights to the first Congress, James Madison articulated the link between security of fundamental, personal rights and an independent judiciary:Independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the legislative or executive; they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the constitution by the declaration of rights.1 ANNALS OF CONG. 457 (Joesph Gales, ed., 1789) (reprinted in THE MIND OF THE FOUNDER 224 (Marvin Meyers, ed., 1973)). See also ALEXANDER HAMILTON, THE FEDERALIST NO. 78 ("The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution."); West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943) ("One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.").As this Court has noted, "[t]here is almost no legal or political issue that is unlikely to come before a judge of an American court, state or federal, of general jurisdiction." White, 536 U.S. at 772-73 (quoting Buckley, 997 F.2d at 229). In handling this virtually infinite variety of matters, judges must resolve disputed cases and issues; they are not elected to represent geographic constituencies, or to further the interests and values of certain constituencies. See id. at 805-07 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). "[T]he judge represents the Law-- which often requires him to rule against the People." Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 411 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting).Because of a judge's unique position in the government, the judicial branch has a need to create and maintain independence from "outside" influences. See Buckley v. Illinois Jud. Inquiry Bd., 997 F.2d 224, 228 (7th Cir. 1993) ("Judges12remain different from legislators and executive officials, even when all are elected, in ways that bear on the strength of the state's interest in restricting their freedom of speech.").7 Put another way, judges are different from other governmental officialsand should be regulated differently too. "[S]tates need not treat candidates for judicial office the same as candidates for other elective offices" because "the judicial office is different in key respects from other offices." Am. Civil Liberties Union of Fla., Inc. v. Fla. Bar, 744 F. Supp. 1094, 1097 (N.D. Fla. 1990).The White case produced five separate opinions. But it also produced agreement on two key points. The Court was unanimous in its beliefs that (1) an independent and impartial judiciary is central to American democracy,8 and (2) judicial campaigns can present the possibility of undermining the public's confidence in the judiciary.97 Compare Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 364 (1967) (Douglas, J., concurring) ("Under the separation of powers created by the Constitution, the Executive Branch is not supposed to be neutral and disinterested."), with FrontLine: Justice for Sale (PBS television broadcast Nov. 23, 1999) (transcript avail. at http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/ frontline/shows/justice/ interviews/supremo.html) (quoting Justice Ken nedy, "[T]he law commands allegiance only if it commands respect. It commands respect only if the public thinks the judges are neutral.").8 "It may well be that impartiality in this sense, and the appearance of it, are desirable in the judiciary . . . ." White, 536 U.S. at 778 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., O'Connor, J., Kennedy, J., and Thomas, J.); "We of course want judges to be impartial . . . ." Id. at 788 (O'Connor, J., concurring); "Judicial integrity is, in consequence, a state interest of the highest order . . . ." Id. at 793 (Kennedy, J., concurring); "[T]he State [has an] interest in maintaining both the appearance in this form of impartiality and its actuality." (Stevens, J., dissenting, joined by Souter, J., Ginsberg J., and Breyer, J.); "[P]reserving the public's confidence in the integrity and impartiality of its judiciary [is a compelling state interest]." Id. at 817 (Ginsberg, J., joined by Stevens, J., Souter, J., and Breyer, J., dissenting).9 "[W]e neither assert nor imply that the First Amendment requires campaigns for judicial office to sound the same as those for legislative13Given American democracy's need for judicial independence, integrity, and impartiality, the ABA has fostered standards that recognize the importance of these ideas. "Intrinsic to all sections of th[e] Code are the precepts that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial office as a public trust and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in our legal system." ABA MODEL CODE OF JUD. CONDUCT (1990) (Preamble).The ABA favors "an election process geared to the judicial office." White, 536 U.S. at 805 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). In light of the Court's unanimity in endorsing the goal of preserving judicial integrity, the question left open by White is the constitutionally-permissible means of upholding this goal. This case provides an excellent opportunity to consider this important question.B. The ABA Seeks This Court's Guidance in Crafting a Judicial Ethics Code That Promotes Judicial Independence, Integrity, and Impartiality.This Court has noted the ABA's role in stating standards of judicial ethics. See White, 536 U.S. at 786 ("The first codeoffice." White, 536 U.S. at 783 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., O'Connor, J., Kennedy, J., and Thomas, J.); "Even if judges were able to refrain from favoring donors, the mere possibility that judges' decisions may be motivated by the desire to repay campaign contributors is likely to undermine the public's confidence in the judiciary." Id. at 790 (O'Connor, J., concurring); "[J]udicial campaigns in an age of frenetic fundraising and mass media may foster disrespect for the legal system." Id. at 794 (Kennedy, J., concurring); "Elected judges, no less than appointed judges, occupy an office of trust that is fundamentally different from that occupied by policymaking officials . . . . There is a critical difference between the work of the judge and the work of other public officials . . . ." Id. at 797-98, 801 (Stevens, J., dissenting, joined by Souter, J., Ginsberg J., and Breyer, J.); "Judges, however, are not political actors. They do not sit as representatives of particular persons, communities, or parties; they serve no faction or constituency. . . ." Id. at 817 (Ginsberg, J., dissenting).14regulating judicial conduct was adopted by the ABA in 1924."); 48 ABA Reports 74 (1923) (report of Chief Justice Taft). Since its first involvement in promulgating the model codes, the ABA's interest has been the same:[T]he American Bar Association, mindful that the character and conduct of a judge should never be objects of indifference, and that declared ethical standards tend to become habits of life, deems it desirable to set forth its views respecting those principles which should govern the personal practice of members of the judiciary in the administration of their office. The Association accordingly adopts the following Canons, the spirit of which it suggests as a proper guide and reminder for judges, and as indicating what the people have a right to expect from them.ABA CANONS OF JUD. ETHICS (1924) (Preamble).The ABA's interest in judicial ethics extends to those cases discussing its Model Code. This case involves two provisions of the Minnesota Code of Judicial Conduct, which in turn are derived in part from the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct. Compare 52 MINN. STAT., CODE OF JUD. CONDUCT 5B(2) (the "Solicitation Clause") and 52 MINN. STAT., CODE OF JUD. CONDUCT 5A(1) (the "Partisan Activities Clause") with ABA MODEL CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Canon 5 (1990).The ABA expends tremendous effort in the formulation of its judicial ethics code. The ABA seeks input from groups spanning the entire legal community, including representatives of the ABA Judicial Administration Division Coordinating Committee, the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Center for Judicial Conduct Organizations, the American Judicature Society, the Josephson Institute for the Advancement of Ethics, and the Conference of Chief Justices. Additionally, federal and state judges in every jurisdiction provide feedback and in-15sights into working drafts. See, e.g., JUDICIAL CODE SUBCOMM. OF THE ABA STANDING COMM. ON ETHICS & PROF. RESPONSIBILITY, DRAFT REVISIONS TO THE ABA CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT (May 1, 1989).Following this Court's decision in White, the ABA Standing Committee on Federal Judicial Improvements formed a working group on the First Amendment and Judicial Campaigns. See Eileen Gallagher, Judicial Ethics and the First Amendment, JUDGES' J. 26, 26 (Spring 2003). The purpose of the group was to "evaluate Canon 5 of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct in light of First Amendment concerns." Id. at 27.Building upon the working group's deliberative efforts, the ABA's Joint Commission to Evaluate the Model Code of Judicial Conduct recently issued a new draft of Canon 5. See News Release, ABA, ABA Releases Complete Final Draft of Revisions to Model Code of Judicial Conduct (Dec. 21, 2005). This new version reflects the ABA's intensive iterative process to set reasoned restrictions on the political activities of judges and judicial candidates. See id. For instance, the final, complete draft differentiates ethical rules governing candidates in partisan elections from rules governing candidates in non-partisan elections (like those in Minnesota). See id.Inasmuch as the provisions of the ABA's Canon 5 are now under study and redrafting, the ABA has an interest in learning this Court's reasoning about standards that relate to a judicial candidate's or judge's behavior on the campaign trail. The ABA respectfully requests this Court's review of the questions presented.16 CONCLUSION The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the Eighth Circuit should be granted.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:RICHARD P.

I.THE DECISION BELOW UNDERMINESTHE RULE OF LAW BY FAILING TOPROVIDE SPECIAL JUSTIFICATIONS FORABANDONINGCONSISTENTANDLONGSTANDINGPRECEDENTUPONWHICH LEGISLATORS, REGULATORS,AND THE PUBLIC HAVE RELIED.In City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), this Court advised lawmakers that they can-6-and should rely on the Court's rulings as a durableframework for legislative action.As JusticeKennedy wrote, "When the political branches of theGovernment act against the background of a judicialinterpretation of the Constitution already issued, itmust be understood that in later cases andcontroversies the Court will treat its precedents withthe respect due them under settled principles,including stare decisis, and contrary expectationsmust be disappointed." 521 U.S. at 536.The experience of numerous institutions withthe Court's precedents regarding regulation of firearms demonstrates how these institutions rely onlongstandingjudicialinterpretationsofconstitutional provisions in enacting laws, adoptingregulations, and formulating policies. Throughoutthe Nation's history, the democratically electedbranches of federal, state, and local governmenthave regulated firearms based on the consistentinterpretation of the Second Amendment, asarticulated by this and other courts and reflected incongressional statements, that limitations onfirearms are permitted unless the restrictionsinterfere with the maintenance of a well-regulatedmilitia. The number, diversity, and long history ofregulatory enactments demonstrate that thisprinciple of Second Amendment law has become"embedded" in our "national culture." Dickerson v.United States, 530 U.S. 428, 443-44 (2000).Again and again, this Court has emphasized why judges should eschew constitutional interpretations that would defeat such settled expectations regarding governing legal principles.First, respect for precedent imposes discipline in judicial decision-making and prevents disruption-7-of theCreditpoliticalUnion,process.491 U.S.See164,Patterson v.172 (1989)McLean("/S/taredecisis is a basic self-governing principle within theJudicial sensitiveBranch, which is entrusted with and difficult task of fashioningthe andpreserving a jurisprudential system thatupon `anGathers,arbitrary490 U.S.discretion.");805, 824South(1989)is not based Carolina v.(Scalia, J.,dissenting) ("[T]he [should] increasel],respect accorded prior decisions rather than decreasel], with theirantiquity, as the society adjusts itself to theirexistence, and the surrounding law becomespremised on their validity.").Second, respect for precedent ameliorates the uncertainty of judge-made law and_ enables legislatures and regulators -- as well as legal organizations like the ABA -- to rely on accepted, generally applicable legal rules. See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, No. 06-1164 slip op. at8-9 (Jan. 8, 2008) ("reexamination of well-settledprecedent could nevertheless prove harmful... . `in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.") (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 398, 406 (1932) (J. Brandeis, dissenting)).And third, respect for precedent restrains courts from encroaching on areas long reserved to democratically elected legislators, at least absent reason to believe the challenged legislation reflects a breakdown in the democratic system, e.g., Brown v. Bad. of Educ. of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), has bred confusion, e.g., California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565, 579 (1991), or has produced ill-founded results, e.g., Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 266 (1986). As-8-Justice Breyer approach, "[T]he to... prior case from precedent justifications' . .recently summarized this Court'srule lawof belaw thedemands that adhering norm [and] [dlepartureis exceptional . . especiallyand requires `special [where] the principlehas over2489424Ub.ae(Sc2.ol0o0mn61eg)(1sp9(eed7tre6tic)lol.edidniotnfghrtoituomgeh.o"veirtreRuralanetdiaolnB]u,caknld1e26yreiSv..terCVata.tlieooan,tThe decision below of settled expectations structure built upon justifications -- and noneundermines many decadesand threatens the legalthem.Absent -- specialwere articulated by thecourt below -- such a departure from precedentoffends basic tenets of the rule of law.A.The Decision Below Conflicts with aVast Body of Precedent.The court of appeals' decision represents thefirst time since ratification of the Bill of Rights in1791 that a federal appellate court has invalidated aregulation of firearms as offending the SecondAmendment.Courts have consistently upheldregulation of firearms based on the understandingthat the Second Amendment ties the right to beararms to maintenance of a well-regulated militia, andfew, if any, limitations on firearms in the modernage would defeat that purpose. For many decades,the ABA has relied on this interpretation informulating its policies, and Congress and state andlocal legislatures have relied on it in adoptinglegislation.Well before 1939, the year Miller was decided, courts routinely refused to recognize that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to own,-9-ASuekevypeeehmcpreoe,ylntddteacnolAduemrgvti.esunlsSaedtttomaitoeewn,nceotanopsn2oi1ndofersriTresentfanoatrr.htmeess(ea2ilcsnfhsa-Hualdeluoelmfgee.unnpe)srgseie.o.dr154u,tSVnoeidere,1tMr5ui7ale-llgt5l.eh8y,er(1840) ("bear arms" does not mean an individualright to impliescarry weapons for personal use, a right to bear arms only asbut rather related tomilitary use); (1876); State City of Salinasee also Fife v. State, 31 v. Workman, 14 S.E. 9 (W. v. Blaksley, 83 P. 619 (Kan.Ark. 455 Va. 1891); 1905).In Miller, the Court upheld the National Firearms Act of 1934 on this basis. The Court read the "declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment" in conjunction with the Militia Clauses of Article I. 307 U.S. at 178 Thus, in the Court's words:The Constitution as _ originally adopted granted to the Congress power-"To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. With obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces the declaration and-10-guarantee of the Second Amendment were made. Jt must be interpreted and applied with that end In view.Id. (citation omitted) (emphases added).Thefundamental holding of Miller, conjunction of these provisions, isbased on inescapable:the theSecond Amendment protects "possession or use" of afirearm only insofar as related to the "preservationor efficiency of a well regulated militia." Jd. at 178.Since Miller, each of the eleven regional federal circuits has considered the purpose and scope of the Second Amendment. Prior to the decision below, all save one interpreted Miller to mean that the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms only insofar as it relates to the functioning of a well-regulated militia.3 Even the one circuit that separated the right to bear arms from the maintenance of a militia, the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 208, 261 (5th Cir. 2001), upheld the challenged restrictions on firearms. The overwhelming majority of state court cases have3 See, e.g., Cases v. United States, 131 F.2d 916, 922 (1st Cir.1942); United States v. Toner, 728 F.2d 115, 128 (2d Cir. 1984); United States v. Rybar, 103 F.3d 273, 285-86 (3d Cir. 1996);LoveStatesv. Pepersack,v. Warin, 53047 F.3d 120,F.2d 103, 106124 (4th(6th Cir.Cir. 1995); United1976); Gillespie v.City of Indianapolis, 185 F.3d 693, 710 (7th Cir. 1999); Cody v.United States, 460 F.2d 34, 37 (8th Cir. 1972); Hickman v.Block, 81 F.3d 98, 101-02 (9th Cir. 1996); United States v.Oakes, 564 F.2d 384, 387 (10th Cir. 1977); United States v.Wright, 117 F.3d 1265, 1273 (11th Cir. 1997).-l1-agreed with the established view in the federal courts.4Nevertheless, in 2007, 216 years into the life of the Second Amendment, a divided panel of the court below concluded differently, refusing effect to laws duly enacted by the democratically elected representatives of the District of Columbia to restrict possession of handguns. This new course could affect a vast array of measures intended to secure public safety and prevent crime.B.The Decision Below Jeopardizes anExtensive Regulatory Framework ThatWas Predicated on LongstandingJudicial Precedent.Relying on the consistent interpretation of the Second Amendment long "embedded" in our national culture, legislators and regulators -- at the recommendation of the ABA and others -- have built an elaborate system to regulate firearms. The ABA is concerned that the decision below would destabilize that system by prompting decades of litigation and uncertainty regarding the status of critical firearms legislation.4 The decision below cited eight state court cases as suggesting that "the Second Amendment protects an individual right." Pet. App. 48. Seven of these cases involve statements that were not essential to the holding or construe state constitutional provisions rather than the Second Amendment. The lone exception is Rohrbaugh v. State, 607 S.E.2d 404, 412 (W. Va. 2004). But like Emerson, that decision did not declare gun control legislation unconstitutional. In upholding the West Virginia statute at issue, the court concluded: "[Tlhe legislature may enact laws limiting one's firearm rights in conjunction with its inherent police power." Jd. at 413.- 12 -1.Federal Legislation on FirearmsSince 1934, Congress has repeatedly enactedfirearms legislation to respond to the exponentialgrowth in crime, attacks burgeoning violence. Inon sonational figures, doing, Congressand wasadvised, and repeatedly concluded, that the SecondAmendment did not impinge on these legislativeenactments.The National Firearms Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C. §§ 5801 et seq., was the first major federal guncontrol legislation. The Act allows the Government to regulate certain "firearms" including machineguns, short-barreled shotguns and grenades and bazookas, silencers,rifles, hand and deceptiveweapons. See 26 U.S.C. §§ 5861. Congress soonexpanded these prohibitions and restrictions in theFederal Firearms Act of 1938, 18 U.S.C. § 921. ThatAct bans the sale of firearms to known criminals andimposed licensing requirements for manufacturers,dealers, and importers of firearms and handgunammunition. As Miller shows, by this time the linkbetween the Second Amendment right to bear armsand the maintenance of a well-regulated militia wasestablished in the law.The next major legislative initiative came thirty years later. The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. §§ 921 et seqg., authorizes federal regulations related to interstate commerce in firearms, and prohibits certain persons, such as convicted felons, from buying or owning a gun. In considering this legislation, which the ABA supported, Congress specifically assessed Second Amendment law and found unwavering support in the courts for the proposition that it is only "a-18-rpistnreatoptehreriisfbneitrteoeifdonthwineith1uU9np6io8tonhne.U".FSoe.rdCgS.e.arnCaRi.lezApa..tNi.oaNncot.2i1o1on92f,0-1miw20l1h9i6i7t9ci;ha (1s9eb6eyw8o)uatllhsadeos MRO1fe9ef6gmi9i.c)setr(fao"rftcoiomoLnnesgtWaiailtnludltiiCoaoLnmuianclseeHn.los,bijnRegecRhetn:iAqocuntPisrsootfb,pao1ss9eAe6dsd9sto.anFteAdt4thetery(a.FleSbe.GceGonun1.n3d,, Amendment's guarantee of `the right of the people to keep and bear arms' [do not] present any serious legal obstacle to this legislation").5Congress again passed gun control legislation in the 1990s.

How many would survive the court of appeals' ruling is unclear, but it is more than plausible that such a significant change in Second Amendment law would dictate repeal or revision of many. At the very least, this shift in the law will prompt years of litigation regarding the constitutionality of statutory, regulatory, and administrative provisions, and will disrupt law enforcement in an area critical to public safety.-16-2.StateandLocal FirearmftegulationsbaIgmTasnoowssnsveatstenuirlttntuoymntrNieeoognctwnuTtewelhsraiat.o2pttau0iohi0sonns2nast))nJ.at,odnynopdfeiTsnGhmSf.geuainonrf-eVdsCateagthrrotauemnntnoseitsrcrnykouai(lnmse.deg&r.rb,LeyolgauLoiswcissaessstlavt?raeatnflteeMaid.wo(essnBtraaranHtlodieeon(spkcsulilelranubovwngcdaesa,senn,lcopmsfatuaarrntrfcedyihsar)aet,saoaerrmylciocdnoweefcanaeislatielinrcegnsedgrta(piatwennwerdeianoptdyofs-pniserire(xmatir(wftemsoltstrviatentyeg-ss)s(i,ttxawtleepalswsev)tsre,amtielsti)ftos,cirtenangtseaistnn)hdtg,eomandatory background checks (forty-nine states).Legal Comm.

P. 5300.5, State Laws andPublished Ordinances xvi (2005).Revisiting the basic premise of the Second Amendment and striking down gun legislation for the first time in 216 years would have ripple effects through this entire network of state and local regulation. Although the Court ruled in Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886), that the Second Amendment limits the power only of the federal government, the decision relied on the importance of militias as a check on federal power. Separating the right to bear arms from the maintenance of a wellregulated militia would cast doubt on the authority of state and local governments to regulate firearms. Such a ruling would thus invite challenges to-17-hundreds of state and local restrictions, upon the courts difficult policy judgments reasonableness of individual regulations.thrusting about the1.THE DETERMINATIONS REQUIRED BYTHEDECISIONBELOWWOULDCOMPOUND THE DISRUPTION OF THEREGULATORY SYSTEM DEVELOPED RELIANCE ON JUDICIAL PRECEDENT.INThe impracticality and unpredictability of theapproach to the Second Amendment taken in thedecision below further places at risk the regulatorysystem for firearms. As this Court has noted,unclear and impractical standards impede effectivelaw enforcement. See, e.g., [linois v. Gates, 462U.S. 213, 231 (1983) (probable cause involves"factual and practical considerations of everyday lifeon which reasonable and prudent men,technicians, act") (citation omitted).not legalUncertainstandards invite litigation, which burdens courts andregulators, and engenders further uncertainty.A.The Decision Below Does Not Create anObjective, Reliable, and _ IntelligibleDefinition of "Arms."The court below stated that "[olnce it isdetermined -- as we have done -- that handguns are `Arms' referred to in the Second Amendment, it is not open to the District to ban them." Pet. App. 53. The court, however, provided no meaningful guidance as to how judges are to determine what weapons qualify as "Arms." Instead, the court fashioned a test that turns in large part on the physical characteristics of the weapon and whether it is a "lineal descendant" of those used by Foundingera militiamen. Pet. App. 51. In making this issue a-18-key part of its test, the court departs from the standard articulated in Miller, which is whether use or possession of the firearm has a "reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia." 307 U.S. at 178.The "lineal descendant" standard is inherently subjective and is likely to engender massive confusion regarding the permissible scope of gun control. Moreover, the standard will prove highly impractical. By tying the Second Amendment to historical and technological issues, requiring judges to assess the physical effects and relative lethality of eighteenth century weapons and to extrapolate those conclusions to the vast array of modern firearms, the decision below supplants legislative expertise and saddles courts with issues they are ill-suited to resolve. See, e.g., United States v. Rybar, 103 F.3d 278, 294 n.6 (3d Cir. 1996) (Alito, J., dissenting) (as a rule, appellate judges "are not experts on firearms, machine guns, . . . or crime in general").7 With many thousands of variations in arms -- plus many new ones every year -- intersecting with many hundreds of variations in state and federal regulations, the court of appeals' departure from the Miller standard can only yield confusion and dislocation.Even a brief survey of weaponry subject to regulation demonstrates that the court of appeals' approach, focusing on the weaponry rather than the relation of the regulation at issue to a well-regulated7 These concerns are heightened by the suggestion in the decision below that a court should determine that a particular "lineal descendent" of a firearm was in "common use" and had "potential military application." Pet. App. 51. These questions do not lend themselves to judicial expertise.-19-militia, provides neither clarity nor stability. TheJustice Department's three basic types --taxonomy shotguns,divides firearms into rifles, and handguns(including revolvers, which store ammunition inarevolving chamber, other handguns).and Butpistols, which each type mayrefer to all be furtherdistinguished firing action automaticallyby whether they feature automatic (fully automatic weapons, whichload and fire bullets as long as thetrigger is depressed, and semiautomatic weapons,which triggerautomatically load and fire one function), caliber (bore diameter),bullet gaugeper (forshotguns), and muzzle velocity (how fast a bulletleaves the gun). See generally Marianne W. Zawitz,U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,Firearms, Crime, and Criminal Justice: Guns Usedin Crime 2 (1995).Thus, under the "lineal descendant" standard employed below, courts will have to decide whether an automatic or semiautomatic pistol, or only a revolver, is protected by the Second Amendment. They will have to assess whether it is reasonable to ban certain handguns, say those over .38 caliber. They will have to decide whether to draw lines based on the number of shots a gun can fire, the type and power of bullets it uses, the accuracy of the gun at particular distances, or the general lethality of the weapon. No doubt, the distinctions courts devise on these questions will differ, both between courts and over time. As new weapons technologies develop, courts will have to revisit these questions repeatedly. Such inevitably subjective decisionmaking is detrimental to the rule of law, which requires clear legal rules, of general applicability, on which courts, legislators, and the legal profession may rely.-30-B.The Decision Courts inBelow FactualWill Entangle and _ PolicyDeterminations More AppropriatelyLeft to State and Local Legislatures.From the ABA's the rule of law, the appeals' approach stemperspective as problems with not only froman advocate for the court ofthe disruptiveconsequences of changing the rules on which anentire regulatory adverse effects of legislative policyscheme rests, but entangling courts decisions. Evenalso from the in essentially if courts couldsettle on a workable definition of "arms," theassessment "whether any particular restriction onthe possession of weapons is `reasonable' -- forexample, banning handguns or limiting firearms tolaw enforcement officers -- would be as subjectiveand arbitrary as decisions as to whether modernweapons are `comparable' to 18th century weapons."Richard Allen, A Gun May Be a Gun May Be a Gun,Legal Times, Nov. 26, 2007, at 42.Insofar as courts, when deciding the reasonableness of a regulation, weigh the states' interests, the varying strength of those interests will produce disparate results in different jurisdictions. A "Saturday night special," for example, may pose a greater threat in urban areas than in rural jurisdictions, based on the level of violent crime, population density, and trafficking in unregistered guns. Thus, a court in one jurisdiction could find banning this weapon to be constitutionally "unreasonable," but courts in another jurisdiction could uphold such a ban. The prospect of such disparities militates against revision of Second Amendment standards in a manner requiring greater judicial intervention. See Lawrence G.-91-Sager, Fair Measure: The Legal Status ofUnderenforcedREV. 1212, 1217C(o1n97s8t)i.tutionalNorms,91Harv.L.Even if courts could steerjurisprudential thicket, that does notshould.Within the boundariesthrough mean thatset bythis theytheConstitution, the legislature has traditionally beenthe branch that balances the interests of the state inpublic safety against the interests of individuals inowning weapons.'

FREEDMAN CHRISTOPHER S. RHEE MURAD HUSSAIN JENNIFER NEWBERGER EMILIA P, PETERSENWILLIAM H. NEUKOM,
 THAT THE ORDERCANNOT BE REVIEWED FOR COMPLIANCEWITH THE INAA. Reviewing Executive Action For Compliance With Congressional Commands Is An Essential Judicial Role Even When National Security Is At IssueThe Government asserts that this Court may not review the President's actions to determine whether they are consistent with Congress's mandate in the INA. That position contravenes the judiciary's fundamental role--to "say what the law is" and whether it has been complied with. Marbury8v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803). As Chief Justice Marshall explained, where the Court is asked to apply a statute to a particular case, the Court "must of necessity expound and interpret" that statute. Id. Such statutory interpretation is "the very essence of judicial duty." Id. at 178. And courts cannot avoid that duty merely "because the issues have political implications." INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 943 (1983).To the contrary, resolving questions of statutory interpretation--and thereby determining whether the executive branch is complying with Congress's dictates--is a core judicial responsibility, even where the question implicates sensitive issues of foreign policy or national security. See, e.g., Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, 196 (2012). Zivotofsky sought to enforce a statute that permitted citizens born in Jerusalem to request their birthplace be identified as "Israel" rather than "Jerusalem" on their passports, notwithstanding contrary State Department policy. The Government argued that the dispute was nonjusticiable because it implicated the President's authority to speak for the Nation in international affairs, and specifically the Executive's policy of neutrality in the IsraeliPalestinian dispute over the status of Jerusalem. This Court rejected that argument:The federal courts are not being asked to supplant a policy decision of the federal branches with the courts' own unmoored determination of what United States9policy toward Jerusalem should be. Instead, Zivotofsky requests that the courts enforce a specific statutory right. To resolve his claim, the Judiciary must decide if Zivotofsky's interpretation of the statute is correct, and whether the statute is constitutional. This is a familiar judicial exercise.Id.So too here. This Court is not being asked to determine appropriate immigration policy by itself and without standards. Rather, it is being asked to determine whether the Order comports with Congress's mandate in the INA--a quintessential judicial task.Indeed, this Court has long understood its responsibilities to include restraining exercises of executive power not authorized by Congress, even in wartime and when national security is at issue. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), for example, the Court famously struck down President Truman's executive order directing the Secretary of Commerce to seize steel mills to avoid a strike that the President believed would cripple the national defense and imperil his ability as Commander-in-Chief to prosecute the Korean War. Applying ordinary tools of statutory interpretation, the Court concluded that Congress had not authorized the seizure; rather, by adopting very different schemes for resolving labor disputes, it had10implicitly precluded the President from exercising such power. Id. at 585-86; id. at 602 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). The executive order's finding of a national security crisis neither prevented this Court from reviewing the Order's compliance with Congress's dictates nor excused the President from obeying them. See id. at 588-89; see also Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 675-76 (1981) (reviewing scope of President's statutory authority to direct transfer of Iranian assets and suspend pending suits as part of settlement of claims against Iran following Iranian hostage crisis).Similarly, in a more recent wartime dispute over the scope of executive power, this Court reviewed and held unlawful the procedures of a military commission convened to try an alleged enemy combatant held at Guantanamo for conspiracy to commit terrorism. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 567 (2006). The Court first rejected the Government's argument that it should abstain from hearing Hamdan's challenge until the military commission proceedings were complete, declining to presume that the proceedings would vindicate Hamdan's constitutional rights. Id. at 58687. Exercising its ordinary function of statutory interpretation, the Court concluded that the military commission did not comply with Congress's mandate in the Uniform Code of Military Justice ("UCMJ") requiring that such a commission's procedures be the same as those applied to formal courts-martial "insofar as practicable." Id. at 620-23 (quoting 10 U.S.C. § 836(b)). The President had determined that11it was "impracticable" for military commissions to comply with formal court-martial rules, but this Court found that the President had not made the necessary showing of impracticability. Id. at 623. Again, the Government's pleas of exigency were insufficient to prevent this Court from either scrutinizing executive action for consistency with Congress's direction or examining the sufficiency of the underlying record.In short, this Court's "precedents, old and new, make clear that concerns of national security and foreign relations do not warrant abdication of the judicial role." Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S 1, 34 (2010).B. Neither the "Plenary Power" NorThe "Consular Nonreviewability"DoctrineSupportsTheGovernment's PositionThere is no constitutional or prudential reason that this Court should have a more limited role in disputes involving the scope of the executive's power over immigration than it does in other cases, such as those discussed above, implicating sensitive questions of foreign policy or national security.The Government relies on two lines of cases in support of its contention that the Order is unreviewable. Neither is applicable here.1. The Government cites cases articulating what is generally known as the "plenary power"12doctrine--which the Government characterizes as holding that the political branches' power to exclude aliens is essentially unreviewable by the courts. Pet'rs Br. 22-23. Even to the extent those cases retain their full validity today--which is questionable--the Government reads them too broadly, and they fail to support the notion that the Order is immune from judicial review.As an initial matter, the Government fails to acknowledge the most basic point regarding the plenary power doctrine: Decisions regarding immigration are committed to Congress, not to the President. See Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954) (the formulation of policies "pertaining to the entry of aliens and their right to remain here" is "entrusted exclusively to Congress"); see also Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 409 (2012). This principle is "as firmly imbedded in the legislative and judicial tissues of our body politic as any aspect of our government." Galvan, 347 U.S. at 531. The question presented in this case is not the wisdom of the policy Congress articulated--or even the wisdom of the policy the President articulated-- but whether the Order is within the power Congress granted the President in the first place. As discussed above, that is the kind of question this Court is uniquely competent to resolve.The cases on which the Government relies are not to the contrary. In Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787 (1977), for example, the Court was not presented with the question whether an executive action13comported with Congress's dictates, but with the constitutionality of Congress's choice to distinguish between nonmarital children's relationships with their mothers and their relationships with their fathers in granting preferential immigration status. The Court addressed the question, concluding that such a distinction was reasonable and within Congress's constitutional authority. Id. at 799-800. It nowhere suggested that courts could not determine whether the President had acted within the powers Congress granted him, and such a suggestion would fly in the face of long-standing precedent such as Youngstown and its progeny.Similarly, the Government relies on dicta in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952), which upheld deportations of past members of the Communist Party under the Alien Registration Act, to the effect that "any policy toward aliens is . . . interwoven with . . . the conduct of foreign relations, the war power, and the maintenance of a republican form of government. Such matters are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference." Id. at 588-89; see Pet'rs Br. 23. Harisiades did not, however, rely on that language to foreclose judicial review of the deportation orders in question, engaging--though rejecting--the deportees' constitutional challenge to the statute. See Harisiades, 342 U.S. at 583-84. Again, no challenge to executive authority was raised.14Undoubtedly, the plenary power doctrine-- along with the McCarthy-era terror of Communism-- had a role in driving the substantive constitutional analysis in Harisiades and similar cases such as Galvan. But the extreme reluctance in Harisiades and like cases to "deny or qualify the Government's power of deportation" by imposing due process limitations on that power, 342 U.S. at 591, cannot be squared with this Court's more recent precedent.The Court has not hesitated in recent years to address challenges to the government's power of deportation and related immigration issues and to uphold those challenges where appropriate. In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 689 (2001), for example, the Court applied constitutional avoidance principles to construe the INA to impose a "reasonable time" limitation on detention of removable aliens, whose application was reviewable in federal court. The Court observed that "the Due Process Clause protects an alien subject to a final order of deportation," and that Congress's plenary power over immigration is "subject to important constitutional limitations." Id. at 693-95. Finding that indefinite detention would raise serious due process concerns, and locating no clear statement in the statute that Congress intended to authorize it, the Court held that indefinite detention is not authorized. Id. at 699. The Court also rejected the Government's argument that the federal courts must defer to the Government's decision that a particular detention is reasonable. Notwithstanding "the greater immigration-related expertise of the15Executive Branch," determining whether a particular detention is reasonable and thus authorized by statute is the job of the courts. Id. at 699-700. The same logic applies a fortiori here, where individualized decision-making is not at issue, but simply the scope of the Executive's rulemaking authority.2. The Government also relies on cases involving the so-called "consular nonreviewability" doctrine. Pet'rs Br. 24-25. Despite the Government's casual attempt to expand that doctrine into a broad prohibition on review of all immigration-related decisions, id. at 25, those cases articulate a narrow exception to the general principle of reviewability of agency action. Under that exception, "a consular official's decision to issue or withhold a visa" to a specific alien seeking entry to the United States is committed to that officer's discretion and thus not reviewable absent Congress's express authorization. See Saavedra Bruno v. Albright, 197 F.3d 1153, 1159-60 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Most of the decisions the Government cites fall into that category. See Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953); United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537 (1950); Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, 142 U.S. 651 (1892). In each case an alien seeking entry to the United States and detained at the border sought review by habeas corpus of the individual decision to exclude him or her.16These cases are irrelevant here for two reasons. First, the plaintiffs were aliens outside the United States contesting their own exclusion, not-- as here--United States citizens, residents, or entities contesting the exclusion of persons in whose admission they have an interest. Second, the question here is not whether a consular official has reasonably exercised the discretion Congress has granted him, but whether the President has acted pursuant to any statutory authority.For the same reasons, the Government's contention that Congress has precluded judicial review of the Order fails. The Government notes that Congress has expressly declined to create a private right of action to challenge "a decision . . . to grant or deny a visa" or to revoke a visa. Pet'rs Br. 25 (quoting 6 U.S.C. § 236(f)). But Respondents here are not challenging "a decision . . . to deny a visa"; they challenge an order preemptively forbidding entry by a group of more than 180 million people defined by their nationality and religion, subject to burdensome case-by-case waiver procedures.The Order at issue here is far from a run-ofthe-mill exercise of discretion over entry of an individual alien. It is extraordinary and unprecedented: a presumptive bar for a significant period on entry of all nationals of six overwhelmingly Muslim countries and all refugees, candidly referred to by the President and his advisors as a "Muslim ban." See Resp't Hawaii Br. 5-7; J.A. 1133. The Court should reject the Government's contention17that it cannot even consider whether this was Congress's intent.II. THE INA SHOULD NOT BE READ TO GRANT THE PRESIDENT UNTRAMMELED DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE A CLASS OF ALIENS FOR ANY REASONThe Government contends that the President's action is authorized by section 212(f) of the INA, which provides that the President may "suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens" whose entry he finds "would be detrimental to the interests of the United States." 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). That provision does not grant authority for the Order.To be sure, the language of § 1182(f) is broad. But that does not mean that it grants the President absolute discretion to exclude any group of persons for any reason, as the Government would have it. As this Court recognized long ago in the immigration context, "[a] restrictive meaning for what appear to be plain words may be indicated by [the INA] as a whole, by the persuasive gloss of legislative history or by the rule . . . that such a restrictive meaning must be given if a broader meaning would generate constitutional doubts." United States v. Witkovich, 353 U.S. 194, 199 (1957). That is true here. First, the Government's interpretation of § 1182(f) would nullify significant portions of a complex and reticulated statutory scheme, including provisions Congress enacted to address the precise problems at which the Order is purportedly directed, and would18override Congress's considered judgment not to institute the travel ban the Order imposes. Second, such an interpretation would raise serious constitutional concerns, as it would imply a delegation to the President of sweeping power over immigration--including the power to engage in discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and religion that would not be tolerated in any other context-- without any discernible standards for exercising that power or any check on its exercise. The application of those principles here makes clear that Congress has not granted the President the authority he claims.A. The Government's Interpretation of Section 1182(f) Is Incompatible With the Statutory Scheme As A WholeThe Government's reading of § 1182(f) would render much of the remainder of Congress's careful scheme in the INA--which includes specific provisions dealing with precisely the national security issues the Order claims to address-- surplusage. Even more strikingly, it would contravene Congress's specific judgment not to impose a travel ban on nationals of the six countries at issue, but instead to institute more carefully tailored precautions. And it would violate the express repudiation of national-origin discrimination in immigration that has been a centerpiece of the INA since 1965.191. Congress has not sat idly, failing to address the risk of domestic terrorism potentially posed by admitting aliens from countries that have been known to harbor terrorists. In 2015, Congress enacted a law designed to address precisely that concern, the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. 114113 div. O, tit. II (2015) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1187(a)(12)) ("Visa Waiver Act" or "Act").The Act modified the existing visa waiver program, under which aliens in certain categories-- such as those seeking short-term entry as a tourist, 8 U.S.C. § 1187(a)(1), having completed immigration forms, id. § 1187(a)(4), or having a round-trip ticket, id. § 1187(a)(8)--are not required to obtain a visa for entry. It provided that nationals of, or persons recently present in, the six countries identified in the Order, along with Iraq, are not eligible for the visa waiver program because of those countries' ties to terrorism. Id. § 1187(a)(12).7 Accordingly, those persons will receive the full vetting necessary to receive a visa--vetting meticulously designed to exclude foreign nationals suspected of any association with terrorist activity or organizations,7 Syria and Iraq are specifically designated in the Act; the other five countries have been designated by the Secretary of State or Secretary of Homeland Security under authority granted by the Act.

L. 109-13.The Visa Waiver Act, however, does not impose a ban on entry by all nationals of the countries at issue. That was not an oversight, but a deliberate choice expressly discussed during debate over the bill. As Representative Lofgren, one of the bill's supporters, stated in debate on the bill:For those who have traveled to or are nationals of certain high-threat countries, a visa interview, rather than visa-free travel, will be required. These individuals are not barred from traveling to the United States.177 CONG. REC. H9050 (daily ed. Dec. 8, 2015) (statement of Rep. Lofgren) (emphasis added). Similarly, while opponents of the bill criticized it as overbroad and discriminatory, they still understood it as limited to subjecting affected persons to additional screening measures prior to entry. See, e.g., id. at H9051 (statement of Rep. Conyers) ("I understand that these individuals are not banned from traveling to our Nation and are simply subject to increased questioning and scrutiny before they can travel here."); id. at H9057 (statement of Rep. Ellison) ("While this bill does not restrict entry to the U.S., it creates additional barriers.").21On the Government's reading, then, § 1182(f) permits the President to override Congress's deliberate decision not to impose a travel ban on nationals of exactly the six countries at issue. And it renders Congress's carefully crafted remedy in the Visa Waiver Act a nullity, since the President is free to impose the more drastic measure of a travel ban on nationals or residents of any country.It need hardly be said that such a reading contravenes basic principles of statutory interpretation. This Court typically will not read a statute in a way that renders another part of the statute superfluous. See, e.g., Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 101 (2004). Relatedly, where a general provision and a specific provision of a statute are addressed to the same problem, the specific provision takes precedence over the general provision. See, e.g., RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012); Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 183 (2012) ("[T]he specific provision comes closer to addressing the very problem posed by the case at hand and is thus more deserving of credence."). Here, Congress set out a careful and reticulated scheme, developed over many years, specifically designed to address the domestic terrorism risk posed by entry of nationals of the countries at issue. Interpreting the INA to permit the Order renders all of those labors superfluous, see, e.g., Abourezk v. Reagan, 785 F.2d 1043, 1056-58 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Ginsburg, J.) (putting a limiting construction on the Executive's power to exclude22certain aliens under one subsection of § 1182(f) in order to avoid rendering another subsection surplusage), and permits the general provision to override the specific.Most significantly, that interpretation of the statute turns on its head Congress's deliberate decision not to impose a travel ban. There is no reason to believe Congress intended to delegate to the President a power to cast aside all the meticulously developed specifics of the INA in this manner. Just as in Youngstown, see 343 U.S. at 58688, by adopting a specific scheme for addressing terrorism concerns that does not include a travel ban, Congress has precluded the President from doing so on his own.88 The scope of the President's authority under § 1182(f) is also illuminated by historical practice. See NLRB v. Noel Canning, 134 S. Ct. 2550, 2559 (2014) ("[L]ong settled and established practice is a consideration of great weight in a proper interpretation of constitutional provisions regulating the relationship between Congress and the President.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 610-11 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (noting that "a systematic, unbroken, executive practice, long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned . . . may be treated as a gloss on `executive Power' vested in the President" by the Constitution). In the few instances where other presidents have invoked Section 1182(f), the suspension of nationals232. On the Government's interpretation, § 1182(f) would also run afoul of the bar on nationalorigin discrimination in § 1152 of the statute--a key piece of civil-rights-era legislation specifically designed to repudiate the then-existing national origin quota system for immigration. Section 1152 provides:[N]o person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person's race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.8 U.S.C. § 1152(a)(1)(A).The bill ultimately codified in § 1152 was intended "fundamental[ly] [to] reform . . . the national origins system of selecting immigrants." Letter of Transmittal from President John Kennedy to Vice President Lyndon Johnson and Speaker of the House John McCormack, 1 (July 23, 1963). President Kennedy's transmittal letter emphasizedfrom a particular country was in response to specific and articulable foreign policy events or other reasons having nothing to do with invidious discrimination based on nationality. Unlike the situation here, none of those actions branded the foreign nationals threats to public safety based solely on their nationality. See J.A. 1215-16; Resp't Hawaii Br. at 45-46.24that "[t]he use of a national origins system is without basis in either logic or reason," and that the new legislation would help "in developing an immigration law that serves the national interest and reflects in every detail the principles of equality and human dignity to which our nation subscribes." Id. at 1-2.Senator Philip Hart described the "principal effort" behind the bill as "the elimination of a mistake that was made in the twenty's and has lived with us ever since in this business of the national origins quota system." Immigration: Hearings on S. 500 Before the Subcomm. on Immigration and Naturalization of the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, pt. I, 89th Cong. 4 (1965) (statement of Sen. Philip Hart, Member, S. Subcomm. on Immigration and Naturalization). Similarly, Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach told the House Committee:Under present law, we choose among potential immigrants not on the basis of what they can contribute to our society . . . . We choose, instead, on the basis of where they . . . happened to be born. There is little logic or consistency in such a choice . . . when we proclaim to all the peoples of the world that every man is born equal and that in America every man is free to demonstrate his individual talents.Id. at 8 (statement of Nicholas Katzenbach, Att'y Gen. of the United States). The House Report25likewise explained that the new legislation was intended to "eliminat[e] . . . the national origins system as the basis for the selection of immigrants" and replace it with "a new system of selection designed to be fair, rational, humane, and in the national interest." H.R. REP. NO. 89-745, at 8, 12 (1965).The Order on its face violates § 1152's prohibition on "discriminat[ion] in the issuance of . . . immigrant visa[s] because of the person's . . . nationality" by denying entry to the United States (including entry as an immigrant) solely on the basis that a person is a national of one of the six identified countries. See 8 U.S.C. § 1152(a)(1)(A).The Government acknowledges--as it must-- that § 1152 prohibits national-origin discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas. It nevertheless argues that § 1182(f) empowers the President to ban "entry" on the basis of nationality. "[I]f an alien is subject to Section 2(c) . . . , he is denied an immigrant visa because he is ineligible to receive one as someone barred from entering the country under Section 1182(f)--not because he is suffering the type of nationality-based discrimination prohibited by Section 1152(a)(1)(A)." Pet'rs Br. 52. This is sophistry. The reason such an alien is ineligible to receive an immigrant visa is because he is barred from entering the country based on his nationality.Indeed, the Government's interpretation would render Section 1152 entirely meaningless. It26would enable the President to override Congress's ban on racial, nationality and gender discrimination in the issuance of immigration visas by simply banning entry for the same discriminatory reasons. That cannot have been what Congress intended in enacting § 1152. Rather, under longstanding principles of statutory interpretation, the specific ban on national-origin discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas must be treated as an exception to the general power to exclude classes of aliens. See RadLAX, 566 U.S. at 645. The alternative reading makes § 1152--a historic and much-heralded repudiation of national-origin quotas--a nullity.B. The Government's Reading Of Section 1182(f) Raises Grave Constitutional ConcernsThe INA, like other statutes, must be interpreted, where possible, to avoid constitutional concerns. See Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 689 ("It is a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation . . . that when an Act of Congress raises a serious doubt as to its constitutionality, this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided." (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted)). Thus, in Zadvydas, as discussed above, the Court construed a provision of the INA that arguably provided broad authority to detain a deportable alien indefinitely to include an implicit limitation to a reasonable time period. Id. And in Witkovich, the Court construed a grant of power to27the Attorney General to require aliens with outstanding deportation orders to provide whatever information he "may deem fit and proper" as limited to information reasonably necessary to keep him informed of their availability for departure. 353 U.S. at 195-202. In both cases, the Court adopted a narrowing construction of language that "if read in isolation and literally, appears to confer upon the Attorney General unbounded authority" to avoid the constitutional concerns that would otherwise result. Id. at 199; see id. at 200-01.The Government's reading of § 1182(f) as granting the President absolute and unreviewable discretion to exclude any or all aliens for any reason and any length of time he wishes likewise raises serious constitutional questions, including separation-of-powers concerns.The Constitution confers power over immigration matters in the first instance on Congress, not the President. See U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 4 (granting Congress the power "[t]o establish [a] uniform Rule of Naturalization"); id., art. I, § 8, cl. 3 (granting Congress the power "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations"); Arizona, 567 U.S. at 409 ("[p]olicies pertaining to the entry of aliens" are the "exclusive[]" province of Congress" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Congress may, of course, delegate portions of that authority to the President, accompanied by some discernible principle to guide its exercise--but the President may not arrogate it all to himself and wield it at his28whim. Such an assertion of absolute power must-- at the very least--"be scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system." Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring).These separation-of-powers concerns are compounded by the Government's position that the President's actions are immune from judicial review--an approach that "condense[s] power into a single branch of government," in contravention of our fundamental system of checks and balances. Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (examining both the statutory authorization for executive detention of enemy combatants and the constitutional limitations on its exercise) (emphasis omitted). "Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake." Id.The Government contends that Congress should be presumed to have barred the courts from reviewing the President's actions to determine whether they are authorized, absent an express statement to the contrary. Pet'rs Br. 24-25. It apparently draws that proposition from the narrow line of consular non-reviewability cases discussed above, see supra Part I.B.2. As a general matter, however, this Court has held that such presumptions run the other way. Congress is not presumed to29push the envelope of constitutionality. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988); cf. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (in federalism context, requiring clear statement before statute is interpreted to "upset the usual constitutional balance"). And ambiguities are resolved in favor of readings that do not create constitutional concerns-- including concerns posed by the preclusion of judicial review. See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 300 (2001) (in the context of habeas review of removal orders, holding that "[a] construction of the [INA] that would entirely preclude review of a pure question of law [including a statutory question] by any court would give rise to substantial constitutional questions.").This case does not, like St. Cyr, raise Suspension Clause concerns. But it surely does raise the serious concerns associated with "condens[ing] power into a single branch of government." Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 536. And it is also troubling that the Government appears to recognize no limitation on the President's ability to exclude aliens for discriminatory reasons--such as race and religion-- that in other contexts would clearly be forbidden, and that would change the character of our Nation.These concerns are heightened yet further by the specifics of the Order here. The Order attempts to justify its blanket ban on entry by nationals of the six designated countries and by refugees as necessary to protect the Nation from acts of30terrorism pending the Administration's review of vetting procedures. But that justification is weak at best. The Order provides no instance of any national of five of the six designated countries engaging in an act of terrorism, and the only example it gives from the remaining country, Somalia, is of a national who entered as a two-year-old, became a citizen, and was later radicalized here. See J.A. 276. As the courts below noted, the Department of Homeland Security has found no meaningful relationship between citizenship of a foreign nation and proclivity to commit terrorist acts; and former national security officials from both Republican and Democratic Administrations have rejected any simple equation between nationality and the potential for terrorism. See J.A. 178, 1226. Moreover, the Order does not demonstrate any weakness in existing vetting procedures that necessitates a blanket ban on entry while they are reconsidered.Combined with the repeated statements, described in Respondents' briefs and by the courts below, that the Order and its predecessor were intended to implement a "Muslim ban," the thinness of the putative justification for the Order gives pause. And it puts in stark relief the consequences of accepting the Government's assertion that the President's power is unilateral and unreviewable. The Court should reject that argument and construe § 1182(f) to avoid the serious constitutional doubts the Government's reading raises.31III. THIS COURT SHOULD NOT LIMIT ITS ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE INQUIRY TO THE ORDER'S ASSERTED PURPOSEShould this Court reach the Establishment Clause question, it should reject the Government's argument that its inquiry is limited to examining the four corners of the Order to determine whether it provides a "facially legitimate and bona fide reason" for its terms. Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 770 (1972). The Government contends that so long as the Order itself articulates some colorable national security rationale, this Court is precluded from inquiring any further into the underlying motives for and effects of the ban. Whatever the merits of that analysis in the ordinary case, this is no ordinary case. The record contains substantial evidence that the Order was motivated by a desire to ban entry of Muslims. This Court is not required to, and should not, ignore that evidence.Kleindienst certainly imposes no such requirement. There, the question was whether the Government had articulated a sufficient basis for burdening the plaintiffs' First Amendment right to hear the speaker who was excluded. In that context, this Court concluded that it would be undesirable for courts to "be required to weigh the strength of the audience's interest" in hearing a speaker "against that of the Government in refusing a waiver to the particular alien applicant" on a case-by-case basis. Id. at 769. But those concerns are not implicated here. The Order is a sweeping proclamation32presumptively excluding over 180 million people, not an individualized determination to exclude a particular person that incidentally burdens a U.S. citizen's rights. Equally importantly, Kleindienst involved no evidence of unconstitutional motive like that here. Where, as here, a litigant offers a prima facie "affirmative showing of bad faith" and unconstitutional motivation on the part of the Government, this Court should take that showing into account in determining the validity of the challenged action. See Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128, 2141 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Respondents' Establishment Clause claim deserves this Court's serious and full consideration, including examining the Order in the context of the entire record. When the President and his advisors themselves casually acknowledge their intent to implement a "Muslim ban," the threat to our constitutional values requires nothing less.33CONCLUSION This Court should affirm the judgments below.Respectfully submitted, HILARIE BASSCounsel of Record PRESIDENT AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION321 N.

 Non-ECONOMIC DAMAGE CAPS UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INJURED PLAINTIFFS WITH MERITORIOUS CASES To SEEK REDRESS FOR THEIR INJURIES IN THE COURTS. The ability of injured plaintiffs with meritorious cases to seek redress in the courts is fundamental to the American system of justice. For over thirty years, the ABA has studied the issues that have given rise to calls for caps on non-economic damages and, as a result of this work, has concluded that such caps undermine this fundamental concept and therefore, are not an appropriate way to reform a compensatory tort system. As Robert B. McKay, Chair of the ABA's Commission to Improve the Tort Liability System, commented, it was the "violent cyclical swings of boom and bust, profitability and loss" in the insurance industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s that resulted in higher medical malpractice premiums and complaints from the medical profession. Robert B. McKay, Rethinking the Tort Liability System: A Report From the ABA Action Commission, 32 VILL. L. REV. 1219, 1219-20 (1987) (footnotes omitted). As Mr. McKay concluded in that article, much of the resulting damage caps legislation was intended to influence a downturn in rates by reduci:ng recoverie: s, 3 but "was i: ll-concei:ved, or at least di:d not perform as* Proponents of caps on non-economic damages commonly claim that caps will either attract doctors to the state or keep those in the state from relocating or closing their practices. A longitudinal analysis of the impact of liability pressureintended." Jd. at 1220. Nevertheless, the "crisis" subsided, probably for two reasons: interest rates began to climb, permitting insurance companies to recoup their liability payouts through investment income, and doctors adjusted to the higher rates as a cost of business. Jd.In the years before and since the Commission issued its Report and Mr. McKay authored his article, the ABA has continued to collect research on the effects of non-economic damage caps, and has found that impartial scholarship provides strong and objective evidence that caps discourage lawyers from filing meritorious malpractice cases, functionally depriving a significant number of persons of their day in court. For malpractice victims who cannot find lawyers to take their cases, caps do not merely limit damages; they eliminate damages altogether.Noteworthy among these scholars are two distinguished Research Professors of the American Bar Foundation ("ABF'"). As described on the ABA's website:The American Bar Foundation ["ABF"] organization dedicated to advancing justice rigorous research on the law, legal practices, law's impact on our society.is an through and theon the supply of Obstetrician-Gynecologists found, however, that most did not respond to the risk of liability in such ways.

Harris County is where Houston is located, is the most populous jurisdiction in Texas, and is home to nearly 3,866,000 people, one-sixth of the state's total population. Jd.Daniels and Martin also reported "evidence of a similar decline in filings in Cook County, Illinois after this state enacted a $500,000 cap on non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases in 2005." Jd. at 70. The findings reported by Daniels and Martin on the substantial decrease in malpractice filings in Houston and Chicago were consistent across seven law review articles that Daniels and Martin have published on the effects of caps on access to justice during the last decade.

A Study of Malpractice Jury Verdicts in California, 23 HEALTH AFF. 54 (2004). In addition, their findings are consistent with two studies by the U.S. General Accounting Office ("GAO") published in 2003 (U.S. General Accounting Office, Medical Malpractice: Implications of Rising Premiums on Access to Health Care GAO-03-836 (2003), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03836.pdf; U.S. General Accounting Office, Medical Malpractice Insurance: Multiple Factors10Have Contributed to Increased Premium Rates GAO-03-702 (2003), http://www.gao.gov.new.items/d03702.pdf [hereinafter Medical Malpractice Insurance]), and with a thorough survey of the relevant literature by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in Ferdon ex rel. Petrucelli v. Wisconsin Patients Compensation Fund, 284 Wis.2d 573, 639-644, 701 N.W.2d 440, 473-75 (2005), in which that court struck down a cap on non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases. Daniels and Martin conclude that caps are, in part, aimed at reducing the number of malpractice cases, without reference to the merit of the claims, by making them less economically attractive for lawyers to take. Texas Two-Step, at 643-44.Empirical research has also shown that caps diminish access to the civil Justice system for specific classes of potential malpractice plaintiffs. An analysis of jury awards in California, Florida and Maryland found that the primary impact of damage caps was on cases involving women, children and the elderly, and especially in death cases involving those groups. Lucinda M. Finley, The Hidden Victims of Tort Reform: Women, Children, and the Elderly, 53 Emory L.J. 1263, 1313 (2004). Analyzing Florida-specific jury verdict data, Professor Finley found that "statutory caps on noneconomic loss damages will have an adverse impact on overall recoveries for wrongful death and that this disadvantageous impact will be especially pronounced in the case of female decedents." /d. at 1304. In addition, "statutes that cap full recovery for noneconomic loss damages in personal injury11cases," according to Professor Finley, "will have a devastatingly disproportionate impact on sexual assault victims; for women in particular, a cap can become tantamount to a virtual ceiling on total recovery." Lastly, Professor Finely noted that such a cap statute would disadvantage the elderly, and elderly women in particular, because elderly plaintiffs "have a much higher proportion of noneconomic damages than general tort awards." Id. at 1306. Consequently, "a noneconomic damages cap law may set the effective ceiling on tort recoveries for elderly women, while still allowing elderly men to collect a greater amount of the total awarded by the jury." Jd.Significantly, empirical research has also demonstrated that, "[d]epending on the costs, difficulties of proof, and need for expensive expert testimony, a damages cap may serve as a strong disincentive for lawyers to accept these cases, even though the injuries are some of the most calamitous that anyone can suffer." Jd. at 1301. Although Professor Finley was referring to sexual assault cases, the GAO also found that "Attorneys may be less likely to represent injured parties with minor economic damages if noneconomic damages are limited." Medical Malpractice Insurance, at 42. Similarly, as Daniels and Martin concluded, the Texas caps led lawyers who continued to handle medical malpractice and nursing home cases to avoid clients who suffered severe injury or death, but who had minimal economic damages. Texas Plaintiffs' Practice, at 316. Professor Rustad12found that "[c]apping noneconomic damages is likely to have harsh ramifications on the elderly infirm who will be unable to find legal representation to pursue their claims of neglect or abuse." See Michael L. Rustad, Neglecting the Neglected: The Impact of Noneconomic Damage Caps on Meritorious Nursing Home Lawsuits, 14 ELDER L. J. 331, 350 (2006); see generally Garber, et al., Do Noneconomic Damages Caps and Attorney Fee Limits Reduce Access to Justice for Victims of Medical Negligence?, 6 J. OF EMPIRICAL LEGAL STUD. 637 (Dec. 2009).Based on this and other research, the ABA asserts that the present case implicates, first and foremost, the ability of all persons who have been injured as a result of negligence by health care providers to pursue their claims for full compensation in Florida state courts. As the ABA's 1987 Policy states, when a person suffers such an injury, that person's ability to seek full compensation should be tempered only by the judiciary's use of additur or remittitur.CONCLUSION Amicus American Bar Association requests that the Court answer the questions certified to it by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit consistent with the considerations set forth above, namely, that caps on noneconomic damages interpose barriers to court access and deny redress to tort victims with meritorious cases.13Dated: August4f M401 1Respectfully submitted,Florida Bar Robert J.

I. The ATS Confers Jurisdiction Over SuitsArising From Conduct That Takes Placein Other CountriesThe plain language of the ATS, which confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear "any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations," 28 U.S.C. § 1350, allows an alien to bring a tort action in a federal district court without any restriction on where the tort occurs. This language is categorical; it con tains no hint that Congress intended to place a territorial limitation on its grant of jurisdiction. See, e.g., Conn. Nat'l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 (1992) ("[C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there."). When Congress has intended to create an exception for acts committed outside the United States, it has done so expressly. For example, a provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(k), con tains an exception to the grant of jurisdiction for "[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country." The ATS contains no such language and should be given its natural reading, that is, that an alien may bring a tort claim based on a violation of the law of nations regardless of where that violation occurs. If application of the plain language of astatute is thought to lead to improvident results, it is the responsibility of Congress to enact lan guage appropriate to those concerns.Congress, in fact, has signaled its approval of enforcement of the ATS's plain language. When Congress enacted the TVPA in 1991, it considered the scope of the ATS and whether revisions to its jurisdictional grant were necessary. The legisla tive history of the TVPA shows that Congress specifically considered judicial interpretations permitting the ATS to be invoked for torts arising from conduct taking place in other countries and acquiesced to that interpretation. Both the House and Senate committee reports on the TVPA dis cussed Filartiga, the seminal case that underlies modern ATS litigation, and which, significantly, involved claims arising from conduct that took place in Paraguay. See S. Rep. No. 102-249, at 4 (1991) ("The Filartiga case has met with general approval."); H.R. Rep. No. 102-367, at 4 (1991) (same). Both reports referred to the ATS as a "remedy already available" to aliens for the kind of extraterritorial conduct covered by the TVPA. See S. Rep. No. 102-249, at 5 (noting that the TVPA "would . . . enhance the remedy already available under [the ATS]"); H.R. Rep. No. 102367, at 3 (noting that the TVPA does not replace the causes of action "under existing an law, [ATS], which permits Federal district courts to hear claims by aliens for torts committed 'in violation of the law of nations'"). These reports concluded that the TVPA was necessary to provide a cause ofaction for American citizens who are victims oftorture or extrajudicial killing and to dispel any ambiguity raised by a concurring opinion in8Tel-Oren, see S. Rep. No. 102-249, at 4-5 (1991); H.R. Rep. No. 102-367, at 4 (1991), and recom mended against making any alterations to the ATS. The House report explained that claims covered by the TVPA (i.e., those based on torture and summary executions) "do not exhaust the list of actions that may appropriately be covered by [the ATS] ... or may ripen in the future into rules of customary international law." H.R. Rep. No. 102367, at 4 (1991). The TVPA was then codified as a note to the ATS. In these circumstances, the evi dence of Congress' adoption of the prevailing interpretation of the ATS as encompassing torts arising in other jurisdictions is unmistakable. See, e.g., Francis v. Southern Pacific Co., 333 U.S. 445, 450 (1948) (when Congress partially amends a statute while leaving intact the "established [judicial] interpretation" of another part of the statute, the latter "become[s] part of the warp and woof of the legislation").Finally, construing the ATS to exclude claims arising from conduct taking place in other coun tries would create an unnecessary layer of com plexity in cases where the plaintiff alleges actionable conduct that crossed national borders, that is, where conduct occurred in part in this country and in part abroad. See, e.g., Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692 (2004) (United States and Mexico); Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 654 F.3d 11 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (United States and Aceh territory in Indonesia); Taveras v. Taveraz, 477 F.3d 767 (6th Cir. 2007) (United States and the Dominican Republic); Hamid v. Price Waterhouse, 51 F.3d 1411, 1418 (9th Cir. 1995) (conduct "inter national in scope"). A categorical rejection of ATSjurisdiction over torts arising in foreign jurisdic tions would likely result in further litigation ofintricate issues as to where various acts constituting the violation occurred, and would inevitably call upon the courts of appeals, and ultimately this Court, to craft fact-intensive rules to govern these claims. It is unnecessary to add this layer of complexity when, as discussed in the next section, courts already have at their disposal a number of well-recognized tools to limit the ATS's jurisdiction to appropriate cases.II. Limitations Employed by Federal Courts in ATS Cases Alleviate Any PossibleConcerns Related to Exercise of ATSJurisdiction Over Torts Occurring inOther CountriesThis Court has emphasized that the desire toavoid inadvertent international conflicts isparamount in determining the geographic scope of federal statutes. See, e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991). Courts applying the ATS to violations of estab lished international law occurring in other coun tries, however, have consistently attended to this concern, and have invoked customary legal and pragmatic limitations, as necessary, when a potential for international conflict is present. A survey prepared for this brief of ATS cases that have reached federal courts of appeals since Filartiga (attached as Appendix B) shows that, while the great majority of ATS cases arise from conduct occurring in foreign territories, the fed eral courts have consistently considered and applied appropriate legal rules, including pruden tial doctrines, to ensure that the application of the10ATS to such tort claims does not trigger concerns about interference with United States foreign pol icy or the sovereignty of other law-abiding states. Many of the limitations considered and applied inthese cases are consistent with those recommended in the ABA's 1985 Report (see App. A at 3a-4a; 16a-20a; and 23a-24a).7 As it did in 1985, the ABA continues to believe that the proper reso lution of the jurisdictional question depends noton a categorical denial of jurisdiction, but on the pragmatic and prudent application of these limit ing principles, which are already part of the law, on a case-by-case basis. The principal limitations considered by courts are surveyed here:Limitations on causes of action cognizable under the ATS. Even before Sosa, where thisCourt warned lower courts to exercise cautionwhen identifying actionable claims under the ATS, see Sosa, 542 U.S. at 732, lower federal courts generally restricted the ATS's reach by limiting ATS causes of action to those norms that are spe cific, obligatory, and universally accepted by inter national law. For example, in an ATS case where the plaintiff sued his former wife for taking their children from the Dominican Republic to live in Ohio, the Sixth Circuit affirmed dismissal and ruled that the plaintiff had failed to show that parental child abduction "is a wrong so generally and universally recognized that it becomes a viola-7 In light of developments in ATS case law since 1985,some of the limitations noted in the ABA's 1985 Report are now less germane. Courts have also employed other limita tions not referenced in the ABA's 1985 Report. The ABA does not suggest that courts are limited to the principles dis cussed in the ABA's 1985 Report.11tion of the law of nations within the meaning ofthe ATS." Taveras, 477 F.3d at 782. Courts have also held that free speech rights are not so univer sal as to be a part of the law of nations. See, e.g., Guinto v. Marcos, 654 F. Supp. 276, 280 (S.D. Cal. 1986). ATS claims of environmental harms and cultural genocide have also been dismissed because they were not characterized by the requi site universal consensus "as to their binding status and their content." Beanal v. FreeportMcMoran, Inc., 969 F. Supp. 362, 383-84 (E.D. La. 1997), affd, 197 F.3d 161 (5th Cir. 1999); see also Amlon Metals, Inc. v. FMC Corp., 115 F. Supp. 668 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (holding that environmental claims arising from transportation of hazardous waste are not actionable under the ATS).In recent years, heeding Sosa's directive of "vigi lant doorkeeping," see Sosa, 542 U.S. at 729,courts have continued to dismiss claims that donot fall within Sosa's specific criteria. For exam ple, the Ninth Circuit recently dismissed ATS claims of racial discrimination and crimes against humanity grounded in a blockade of food and med ical supplies because the rights were insufficiently "specific, universal, and obligatory." Sarei v. Rio Tinto, PLC, 671 F.3d 736, 769 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc). For the same reason, the Seventh Circuit held that claims of child labor are not cognizableunder the ATS. Flomo v. Firestone NaturalRubber Co., 643 F.3d 1013 (7th Cir. 2011).88 Additional substantive limitations regularly applied by courts when considering claims brought under the ATS are the various immunities accorded by federal law, such as the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C.12Existing doctrines that limit the territorialpurview of federal courts. Federal courts regu larly apply existing legal rules, including pruden tial limitations, that explicitly take into account the appropriateness of hearing a case with a foreign nexus.As a threshold matter, personal jurisdiction over the defendant is required in each ATS case. See Kadic v. Karadzic, 70 F.3d 232, 247 (2d Cir. 1995) (requiring personal jurisdiction in ATS case); Carmichael v. United Techs. Corp., 835 F.2d 109, 112 (5th Cir. 1988) (dismissing ATS claims against corporate defendants that lacked sufficient contacts with the forum).Courts have also invoked traditional discretionary doctrines such as forum non conveniens to limit ATS litigation arising from violations of the law of nations in other countries. See, e.g., In re Union Carbide Corp. Gas Plant Disaster at Bhopal, India in December, 1984, 634 F. Supp. 842 (S.D.N.Y. 1986), affd as modified, 809 F.2d 195 (2d Cir. 1987) (dismissing ATS claims on forum non conveniens grounds); Aguinda v. Texaco, Inc., 303 F.3d 470 (2d Cir. 2002) (same); Turedi v. The Coca-Cola Co., 343 F. Appx. 623 (2d. Cir. 2009)§§ 1330 (providing that "foreign states shall be immune from the jurisdiction" of both federal and state courts except as provided in the Act) and the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978, 22 U.S.C. § 254a-e (providing, with exceptions, immu nity to diplomatic agents, members of their families, and a foreign country's administrative and technical staff and their families). See also Ahmed v. Hoque, No. 01-CV-7224 (DLC),2002 U.S. Dist. Lexis 14852 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 2002) (giving deference to the State Department's views that the defen dant must be afforded diplomatic immunity and dismissing ATS claims).13(same). The application of this doctrine ensures that United States courts are not open to those claimants whose claims are more properly consid ered in another country.Because the availability of another competent and more convenient forum is part of the forum non conveniens analysis, a separate exhaustion analysis is often unnecessary. Nonetheless, some courts hearing ATS cases have separately consid ered whether a plaintiff has exhausted effective remedies in the country where the violation took place. Whether considered as an independent doc trine or wrapped into the forum non conveniensanalysis, courts can decline jurisdiction over ATS suits where clear and convincing evidence shows that justice can be assured in a country with a stronger nexus to the events underlying the claim. See Sosa, 542 U.S. 733 n.21 (noting that exhaus tion in ATS cases might be warranted when "appropriate"); Sarei, 671 F.3d at 755 ("The district court did not abuse its discretion when it considered whether exhaustion was required under the controlling plurality opinion of this court['s earlier decisions]."); see also App. A at 3a-4a and18a-20a.9Consistent with the Court's observation, the ABA's 1985 Report noted that federal courts should have the authority to decline ATS cases if they find that "justice could 'reasonably be assured' in the nation where the alleged viola tions took place." App. A at 4a. The report further noted that exhaustion of remedies is discussed in several interna tional instruments, which "provide that [exhaustion] ... is not a precondition for consideration of a claim where resort ing to the domestic remedies would be 'unreasonably pro longed.'" Id. at 19-20a.14Even before Sosa, the Ninth Circuit required district courts to carefully consider exhaustion "[w]here the United States 'nexus' is weak." Sarei, 671 F.3d at 754. A review of federal courts handling ATS cases over the past 30 years shows that they have consistently considered a more con venient competent forum, when available, in assessing whether ATS jurisdiction has been appropriately invoked. See App. B.Nonjusticiability of foreign policy determinations. Courts have declined to hear ATS casesthat present nonjusticiable questions under the well-established political question doctrine. Evenbefore this Court observed in Sosa that "federalcourts should give serious weight to the Executive Branch's view of [an ATS] case's impact on foreign policy," Sosa, 542 U.S. at 733, federal courts repeatedly considered the government's views in ATS cases. For instance, the District of Columbia Circuit relied on the government's position in Joo v. Japan, 413 F.3d 45, 52 (D.C. Cir. 2005), in con cluding that "[t]he Executive's judgment that adjudication by a domestic court would be inimical to the foreign policy interests of the United States is compelling and renders this case nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine."The courts' careful consideration of justiciability standards has proven to be an effective bulwark against the possibility of improper adjudication of foreign policy determinations that are beyond the institutional competence of the courts.10 That is10 Even in ATS cases that do not present a nonjusticiable political question, courts often request, receive, and con sider the Executive Branch's views on whether allowing a case to go forward would impinge on the United States' for-15not to suggest that ATS cases inevitably or even frequently present the potential for interference with United States foreign policy. As the United States argued in its amicus brief to the Second Circuit in Filartiga, "before entertaining a suit alleging a violation of human rights, a court mustfirst conclude that there is a consensus in theinternational community that the right is pro tected and that there is a widely shared under standing of the scope of this protection. When these conditions have been satisfied, there is little danger that judicial enforcement will impair our foreign policy efforts."11eign policy objectives. See, e.g., Corrie v. Caterpillar, 503 F.3d 974, 978 n.3 (9th Cir. 2007) (taking "considerable inter est" in the government's view "regarding a matter impinging upon foreign policy" and affirming dismissal of ATS claims); Sarei, 671 F.3d at 756-57 (observing that, as the government no longer sought dismissal of the ATS claims on foreign pol icy grounds, "there [was] no longer any basis for a fear of interference by the courts in the conduct of foreign affairs"); Khulumani v. Barclay Nat'l Bank, Ltd., 504 F.3d 254, 264 n.14 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (considering, but declining to give dispositive weight to, the United States government's position on whether a court should exercise jurisdiction in an ATS suit), affd for lack of quorum sub nom. Am. Isuzu Motors, Inc. v. Ntsebeza, 553 U.S. 1028 (2008); Kadic, 70 F.3d at 250 (noting that after oral argument, the Second Circuit "wrote to the Attorney General to inquire whether the United States wished to offer any further views concern ing any of the issues raised"); Matar v. Dichter, 563 F.3d 9, 15 (2d Cir. 2009) (noting that the district court "invited the State Department to 'state its views, if any'").11 Memorandum for the United States Submitted to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Filartiga, 630 F.2d 876, reprinted in 12 Hastings Int'l & Comp. L. Rev. 34, 46 (1988).16In sum, the ABA suggests, consistent with the findings in its 1985 Report, that faithful applica tion of the ATS's unambiguous grant of federal court jurisdiction without geographic limitation over tort claims arising from violations of estab lished norms of international law is being accom plished through discerning application by the courts of existing and well-understood legal rules, including prudential limitations. A categorical rejection of jurisdiction whenever the operative conduct occurs in whole or in part in a foreign jurisdiction is therefore not only contrary to the plain language of the ATS, but is unnecessary.Instead, courts should be instructed to continue toapply existing limitations on a case-by-case basis consistent with long-standing precedent that "[international law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction, as often as questions of right depending upon it are duly pre sented for their determination." The Paquete Habana, 175 U.S. 677, 700 (1900).III. The Plain Language of the ATS isConsistent With This Nation's Interestin Promoting the Rule of Law andAccess to JusticeThrough its work in over 50 countries, the ABA plays a significant role in promoting the rule of law, an independent judiciary, access to justice, and respect for human rights.12 As part of this12 See, e.g., ABA, Access to Justice Assessing Tools: AGuide to Analyzing Access to Justice for Civil Society Organizations (2012), available at http://www.american bar.org/content/dam/aba/directories/roli/misc/aba_ roli_access_to_justice_assessment_manual_2012.authcheckdam.pdf.17work, the ABA has observed the positive impact that the ATS has had in motivating other coun tries to enact laws providing remedies for interna tional human rights law violations and inspiring foreign courts to provide effective processes for theresolution of human rights claims.13 See also Jennifer Levine, Alien Tort Claims Act Litigation: Adjudicating on "Foreign Territory, 30 Suffolk Transnat'l L. Rev. 101, 117-24 (2006) (discussing Italian and British court decisions relying upon ATS precedent to allow claims arising from extraterritorial violations of universally recog nized human rights); Developments in the Law-- Extraterritoriality, 124 Harv. L. Rev. 1280, 1284 (2011) (noting that foreign courts have used ATS precedent "in decisions opening their own courts and suspending the sovereign immunity of defen dants for claims arising from violations of human rights law"). As the United States argued in its amicus brief to the Second Circuit in Filartiga, "[a] refusal to recognize a private cause of action in these circumstances might seriously damage the credibility of our nation's commitment to the protection of human rights."14The ATS also provides an important forum for victims of human rights abuses to call to account13 See also App. A at 4a-5a (noting that allowing victimsof human rights abuses in other countries to seek redress in American courts "would encourage other nations to develop and apply meaningful domestic remedies, clearly the most effective deterrent to continued human rights abuses"; "[t]his country can and should become a model for other nations, . . . by extending practical remedies to victims of human rights abuses").14 Memorandum for the United States Submitted to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, supra note 11, at 46.18perpetrators of grievous wrongs, particularly when other mechanisms for bringing the wrongdo ers to justice--such as prosecution, extradition and deportation--may not be available. Further, the ATS has proved to be an important means of securing relief for such victims who have fled their home countries under the threat of persecution, and who cannot return to pursue their cases in the courts of their home countries. That, of course, is the situation alleged by the plaintiffs in this case. Limiting the ATS to exclude such claims, in many cases, would deny the possibility of justice to all such persons.Filartiga and its progeny emerged from the real ity that perpetrators of widespread torture and extrajudicial killing in Latin America had come to the United States to take up residence, with at least some attempting to avoid accountability in their home countries. Over the past 30 years, an important use of the ATS has been in cases in which individuals are seeking redress from perpe trators of alleged human rights violations who have settled in the United States. See, e.g., Chavez v. Carranza, 559 F.3d 486 (6th Cir. 2009) (suit against former Salvadoran military officer living in Tennessee); Yousuf v. Samantar, 552 F.3d 371 (4th Cir. 2009) (suit against Somali government official living in Virginia), affd, 130 S. Ct. 2278 (2010); Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan, 770 F.2d 202, 205 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (suit against, among others, a Nicaraguan leader of a paramili tary group living in Florida).From mobile courts that address the epidemic of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to prosecutions for genocide in Guatemala,19accountability for human rights violations is increasing throughout the world. The UnitedStates has contributed to this international trendthrough diplomatic exchanges, training exercises, negotiation of treaties, and the provision of signif icant funding for technical assistance. The ABA assists in these efforts by sending judges, prosecu tors, and other lawyers to work with local advo cates in developing accountability mechanisms for human rights violations that will function within each country's distinct legal system. These ABA representatives are invited to these countries because they are experienced in working with a credible, functioning legal system in which the reality exists that wrongdoers can be brought to justice, within the appropriate exercise of tradi tional jurisdictional requirements, when that real ity is often not clearly established in the localsystem.Because of the important role that the ATS plays in providing access to justice to victims of internationally recognized human rights viola tions, the ABA strongly urges this Court to con firm the intent of Congress to provide a forum, except where the exercise of jurisdiction would be inappropriate in a specific case, to such victims when they find their perpetrators in the United States, regardless of whether the violations took place in another country.20CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set out above, amicus curiae the American Bar Association respectfully requests that the Court affirm that the ATS confers jurisdiction on the federal courts to hear claims of vio lations of international law that arise in whole orin part in other countries, while also instructing the courts that, in appropriate cases, they should consider and apply established legal rules, including prudential limitations, to determine whether jurisdiction should be declined.Dated: June 13, 2012Respectfully submitted,William T.

JLWOP CRUELCATEGORICALLY CONSTITUTES AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT.A.THE ABA'S RESEARCHINVESTIGATION, AND THE EXPERIENCEORFEJIETCS TIMOENMBEOFRSJLSWUOPPPOSRETNTAENCES.ThisprohibitingCourt has adopted categorical rulesthe death penalty for defendants whocommitted their crimes before age 18, Roper, 543U.S. 551, and JLWOP for defendants convicted ofnon-homicide crimes committed before age 18,Graham, 130 S. Ct. 2011.This Court hasrecognized "the necessity of referring to `theevolving standards of decency that mark theprogress of a maturing society' to determine whichpunishments are so disproportionate as to be crueland unusual."

As the Court held, "[t]he standard ofextreme cruelty is not merely descriptive, butnecessarily embodies a moral judgment.Thestandard itself remains the same, but itsapplicability must change as the basic mores ofsociety change." Graham, 130 S.

ABA, 2008 Report with Recommendation #105C at 2 (Policy adopted Feb. 2008) [hereinafter the "Report"}.7 As stated in the Report at 2, "The ABA's overall approach tojuvenile justice policies has been and continues tobe to strongly protect the rights of youthfuloffenders within all legal processes while insuringpublic safety."6 ABA, Report with Recommendation #101D (Policy adoptedFeb.2002),availableathttp://www .americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/uncategorized/criminal_justice/jj101d.authcheckdam.pdf (last visited Jan. 11,2012).Availableat http://www 2.americanbar.org/sections/criminaljustice/CR200000/Pages/default.aspx (last visitedJan. 11, 2012).As noted in the Report at 6, the ABA'sopposition to JLWOP sentences dates back to theABA's adoption in 1991 of a policy that endorsedthe United Nations ConventionChild. With the ABA's longon the Rights of thehistory of work injuvenile justice as its basis, the Report concludedthat sentences for juvenile offenders must recogmizethat, no matter how adult-like their offenses, theyare not adults. Id. at 6.8As this Court concluded in Roper and againin Graham, juvenile offenders have lesser culpability than adult offenders due to the typicalbehavioral characteristics inherent in adolescence. Roper, 543 U.S. at 569-70; Graham, 130 S.Ct. at2026.Informed by its history of working in juvenile justice and by input from the medical and behavioral scientists, the ABA similarly has concluded that: (1) sentences for juveniles should generally be less punitive than those for adults who have committed comparable offenses; and (2) sentences for juveniles should recognize the key mitigating considerations relevant to their youthful status, including those identified by the Court in Roper, 543 U.S. at 567-70, as well as the seriousness of the offense and the delinquent and8 The ABA has continued to adopt policies based on thecharacteristics of youth, most recently the ABA Report withRecommendation #102B (Policy adopted Feb. 2010), availableathttp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/leadership/2010/midyear/daily_jourmal/102B.authcheckdam.pdf (last visited Jan. 12, 2012), urging the development ofsimplified Miranda warnings for juveniles, in light of theirmore limited verbal comprehension levels.10ceioAsfecspfrvoncilaoeriencicrnncmngloowsteiiurlhibendadeladnainiet1ecflynn9oreoggr9rasl1thk,yjiehifi,utaaooosnvrnrhntmadedlooin,ysarJcieynilLaoddpretifWfeea.olr,OcdfeoaaaoePaldsnnseutcivelrhaeitRehendcsaaan,ptetssoeenjhototrdutrehnsiveerbahoen,ebbndoceeiliuoejnolfceluteabdjvh;lacueeltstavnrpyhbheeinoeeeadlnnineiontdrltthAoeeweenBsacor(mAr3beorda)'elaasnuyysftsrstpissiherduenoreenbppgu.dcrotepr®lirseeceodciidlnormtttecmteihiaeeseeoosfsi.,bndnoeerr9 ABA, adoptedReport with Recommendation #105C, at 9 (Policy Feb. 2008), available at http:/Awww .americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/leadership/2008/midyear/updated_reports/hundredfivec.aut hcheckdam.doe (last visited Jan. 11,2012) (relying, in¢er alia, upon research including MacArthurFoundation Research Network on Adolescent Developmentand Juvenile Justice, Issue Brief 3: Less Guilty by Reason ofAdolescence(2006),availableathttp://www.adjj.org/downloads/6093issue_brief_3.pdf(astvisited Jan. 11, 2012); Elizabeth Cauffman & LaurenceSteinberg, (Im)maturity of Judgment in Adolescence: WhyAdolescents May be Less Culpable Than Adults, 18 Behav.

Ascompared to adults, juveniles have a lack ofmaturity,anunderdevelopedsenseofresponsibility, are more vulnerable to negativeinfluences and peer pressures, have less controlover their surroundings, and their characters arenot as well formed. Graham, 130 S. Ct. at 2021;Roper, 543 U.S. at 569-70.Thus, there is"sufficient evidence that today our society viewsjuveniles .. . as `categorically less culpable than theaverage criminal."

As this Court concluded:From a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for the greater possibility exists that a minor's character deficiencies will be reformed. Indeed, "[t]he relevance of youth as amitigating factor derives from the factthat the signature qualities of youth are transient: as individuals mature, the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside.Roper, 543 U.S. at 569-70 (citations omitted).Likewise, this Court concluded that juvenilesare more capable of change than adults, and their actions are less likely to be evidence of irretrievablydepraved character.Graham, at 2026, citingRoper, 543 U.S. at 570. "Maturity can lead to thatconsidered reflection which is the foundation forremorse, renewal and rehabilitation." Graham, 130S. Ct. at 20382. Accordingly, juvenile offenderscannot be classified among the worst offenders. Id.at 2088, citing Roper, 573 U.S. at 569.In considering a juvenile offender's personal responsibility and moral guilt, and the ensuing consequences for the sentencing of juveniles, this Court has concluded that children in the criminal justice system are more vulnerable to coercion, and more likely to falsely confess to crimes they did not commit than are adults. J.D.B. v. North Carolina,13131 S.Ct. 2394, 2403-2404 (2011). The ABAmaintains that, based on its study, research and the experience of its members, two other observations should be considered as well:First, juveniles are less capable than adultsof communicating with and giving meaningfulassistance to their counsel, their limitedappreciation of long-term consequences impairstheir ability to make appropriate decisionsregarding plea bargains and other aspects of theirlegal strategy, and they lack the basic skills toassist them in identifying exculpatory facts andeffectively communicating them to their counsel.MartyBeyer, Immaturity,Culpability&Competency in Juveniles: A Study of 17 Cases, 15Crim. Just. 27, 28 (Summer 2000).Second, "in eleven out of the seventeen yearsbetween 1985 and 2001, juveniles convicted ofmurder in the United States were more likely toenter prison with a life without parole sentencethan adult murder offenders.Even whenconsidering murder offenders sentenced to eitherlife without parole or death sentences, in four ofthose years, children still were more likely thanadults to receive one of those two most punitivesentences."

See#101D, supraABA Reportnote 7, at {6("judgesshouldconsidertheindividualcharacteristics of the youth during sentencing").Many juveniles sentenced to JLWOP, including the Petitioners here, are tried as adults and the relevant statutes only permitted the adult sentences of either death or life without the possibility of parole? As Roper eliminated the12 "On its face, this data suggests that states have often been more punitive towards children who commit murder than adults. At the very least, it suggests age has not been much of a mitigating factor in the sentencing of youth convicted of murder." Amnesty International & Human Rights Watch, The Rest of Their Lives: Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in the United States at 33. These statistics are even more troubling because in the period from 1980 to 2008, just11.1% of homicide offenders were age 17 and younger. AlexiaCooper and Erica L. Smith, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office ofJustice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, HomicideTrends in the United States, 1980-2008 (Nov. 2011), available at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf (last visited Jan. 11, 2012). The ABA questions whether the homicides these children were involved in warranted harsher punishment than the 89% committed by adults. 13 See Ark. Code 5-10-101(c)(1) and Ala.

Thus, thesestatutory schemes deprived these judges of anydiscretion whatsoever to consider the backgroundsand mental development of these children in thesentencing process, or any other mitigating factorsassociated with young offenders, and, the ABAasserts, should be deemedCourt's Roper and Grahamto be contrarydecisions. Thisto thelack ofdiscretion is exacerbated by the increasingfrequency with which children since the 1970s havebeen transferred to or tried in the adult criminaljustice system. Patrick Griffin et al.

Graham, 130 S.Ct. at 2016 citing Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 1001 (J. Kennedy, J., concurring). Indeed, a4 Transfer laws generally fall into three basic categories.First, waiver laws allow juvenile courts to waive jurisdiction on a case by case basis. Second, prosecutors are often vested with discretion, sometimes without formal standards, in deciding whether a prosecution should be brought in juvenile or criminal court. Third, statutory exclusion laws grant criminal courts exclusive jurisdiction over certain classes of cases involving juvenile offenders, thus bypassing the juvenile system altogether. Jd. at 2. Statutory and prosecutorial discretion laws proliferated from the 1970s to 2000, and have changed little since then.

State, 105 Nev. 525, 526 (1989) A JLWOP sentence "means denial of hope; it means that good behavior and character improvement are immaterial; it meansthat whatever the future might hold in store for themind and spirit of [the child], he will remain in prison for the rest of his days." Id.The ABA submits that the research, experiences of its members, and informedconsideration that provided the basis for theISA/ABA Juvenile Justice Standards and the ABA's policies, as well as behavioral research and studies, reinforce the fact that the transient characteristicsthat make juveniles less morally culpable and morelikely to mature and reform, along with the severenature of the sentence -- death in prison -- leadsonly to a conclusion that a JUWOP sentence should be categorically unconstitutional, even when thejuvenile is convicted of homicide.18 Lawrence Steinberg, A Behavioral Scientist Looks At The Science Of Adolescent Brain Development, 72 Brain and Cognition 160, 162 (2010) (`From this perspective, middle adolescence (roughly 14-17) should be a period of especially heightened vulnerability to risky behavior, because sensationseeking is high and self-regulation is still immature.

The ABA submits that the same distinction should be made here, in declaring JLWOP unconstitutional for all defendants who committed crimes as juveniles.Cc.NONE OF THE STANDARD CRIMINALJUSTICE SENTENCING THEORIESARE SERVED BY JLWOP.This Court recognized in Roper and Grahamthat transient characteristics of youth mean that none of the standard penological justifications ofsentencing -- retribution, deterrence, incapacitationor rehabilitation -- were served by death sentencesfor juveniles or JLWOP for juveniles convicted ofnon-homicide crimes.Roper, 543 U.S. 551;Graham, 180 S. Ct. 2011. The ABA maintains thatthe principles recognized in Roper and Grahamapply with equal force to JUWOP sentences forchildren convicted of homicide.This Court recognized that the reduced moral culpability of juvenile offenders means that "the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an adult." Graham, 130 S.Ct. at 2028, citing Roper, 543 U.S. at 571; see also Roper at 571. (Retribution is not proportional if the law's most severe penalty is imposed on one whoseage of criminal responsibility and harsh sentences for adolescents.").18culpability or blameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree, by reason of youth and immaturity.")Likewise, "[dleterrence does not . . . justify the sentence [because] the same characteristicsthat render juveniles less culpable than adultssuggest . . that juveniles will be less susceptible todeterrence." Graham, 130 S. Ct. at 2028-9. Ajuvenile's lack of maturity and propensity for"impetuousandill-consideredactionsanddecisions" render them "less likely to take apossible punishment into consideration whenmaking decisions." Id.; see also, Roper, 543 USS. at571 (`the absence of evidence of deterrent effect isof special concern because the same characteristicsthat render juveniles less culpable than adultssuggest as well that juveniles will be lesssusceptible to deterrence.") (citing Harmelin, 501U.S. at 998-99 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring)).'*The ABA respectfully asserts that this Court's conclusion -- that JUWOP for crimes other than homicide is not justified without the dubious finding that a child is "incorrigible" and not capable16 Studies indicate that there appears to be no significantdifference in deterrence between a juvenile death penalty andJLWOP. See, e.g., MacArthur Foundation Research Networkon Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice, Issue Brief3: Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence (2006), available athttp://www.adjj.org/downloads/6093:issue_brief_3.pdf(lastvisited Jan. 11, 2012) (concluding that juveniles' "lack offoresight, along with their tendency to pay more attention toimmediate gratification than to long-term consequences, areamong the factors that may lead them to make baddecisions").19of reform, Graham, 130 S. Ct. at 2029 -- applies with equal force to juveniles convicted of homicides. Likewise, while this Court recognized that the penological goal of incapacitation is served when a juvenile may be a threat to society, the Court also observed that because "the signature qualities of youth are transient," Roper, 543 U.S. at 570 (citing Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 368 (1993)), the juvenile's continued incapacitation throughout adulthood and into old age without an opportunity for reevaluation, is not justified. See Roper, 543U.S. at 573 (It is difficult even for expertpsychologists to differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects . . . transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whosecrime reflects irreparable corruption"). The ABAasserts that the analysis should be no different forjuveniles convicted of homicide.Finally, the Court's conclusion that a sentence of JLWOP for crimes other than homicide cannot be justified by the goal of rehabilitation, Graham, 130 S.Ct. at 2029-30, applies with equal force to juveniles convicted of homicide. As stated by Justice Marshall in his dissent in Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1028, a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole "does not even purport to serve a rehabilitative function...." Id. (quoting Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 307 (1972) (Stewart, J., concurring))."A legitimate punishment must further at least one of these goals." Ewing v. California, 538 U.S. 11, 25 (2003); Harmelin, 501 U.S at 999 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). As stated in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S.20584, 592 (1977), the Eighth Amendment barspunishment that "(1) makes no measurablecontribution to acceptable goals of punishment andhence is nothing more than the purposeless andneedlessgrosslyimposition of painout of proportionand suffering; or (2) 1sto the severity of thecrime." JLWOP fails on both counts.D.NEITHER PUBLIC SAFETY NORPENAL OBJECTIVES WOULD BECOMPROMISED BY ALLOWING THECHANCE FOR PAROLE.Public safety would not be compromised by giving the right merely to be considered for paroleto those who were children when they committedhomicide.Indeed, public safety has not beencompromised by giving 14 parole hearings toSirhan Sirhan!' and 11 parole hearings to CharlesManson (with another scheduled for 2012)!8, both adults when they committed murder. "Those whocommit truly horrifying crimes as juveniles mayturn out to be irredeemable, and thus deserving ofincarceration for the duration of their lives."Graham, 130 S. Ct. at 2030. However, the EighthAmendment "forbid[s] States from making thejudgment at the outset that [juveniles convicted ofnonhomicide crimes] never will be fit to reentersociety." Id. The ABA asserts that the same17 Parole Denied for Sirhan Sirhan, CDCR Today, March 2, 2011, http://cedertoday.blogspot.com/2011/03/parole-denied-forsirhan-sirhan.html (last visited Jan. 11, 2012) 18 Parole Denied for Charles Manson, CDCR Today, May 23, 2007, http://edertoday.blogspot.com/2007/05/parole-denied-for-charles-manson.html (last visited Jan. 11, 2012).21analysis should be applied to juveniles convicted ofhomicide.The parole process has safeguards to protect the public, as well as recognized law enforcement and rehabilitative functions.!° Thus, neither the public safety nor the objectives of the penal system would be compromised by allowing juvenile offenders the chance to be considered for parole.Parole involves significant checks to protect the public.

In Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), five Justices concluded that the Trial by Jury Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as incorporated against the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, did not require unanimous jury verdicts in criminal cases--but those five Justices disagreed with and indeed contradicted each other on the rationale for that conclusion.6 Four Justices concluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimous verdicts in criminal cases. Id. at 410-411 (White, J., plurality opinion). Justice Powell, concurring only in the judgment, concluded that the Sixth Amendment does require jury unanimity in federal court--and thus disagreed with the plurality, which believed that the Sixth Amendment did not require unanimous verdicts at all. Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 369-371 (1972) (Powell, J.). But Justice Powell also concluded that that particular aspect of the Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantee was not incorporated against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 371-380.76 Apodaca was decided in tandem with Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356 (1972), which held that the Due Process Clause of its own force does not require jury unanimity. Several of the separate opinions applicable to Apodaca appear in Johnson.7 Four dissenting Justices concluded that the Sixth Amendment applies equally in federal and state courts, and requires jury unanimity in both. Johnson, 406 U.S. at 380-394 (Douglas, J.); Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 414-15 (Stewart, J.). Ironically, then, eight Justices concluded that the Sixth Amendment has the same scope in federal and state courts, and five Justices concluded that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts--yet a majority of the Justices nonetheless concluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimous jury verdicts in state courts.7The outcome in Apodaca was not only unsatisfying; it proved to be unstable. Since that decision, the Court has reaffirmed what was clear from its previous decisions--that the Sixth Amendment does require unanimous jury verdicts, at least in federal court. See Richardson v. United States, 526 U.S. 813 (1999). The Court has thus rejected the rationale of the Apodaca plurality. Separately, the Court has also repudiated the approach to incorporation reflected in Justice Powell's concurrence, and has reaffirmed that, if a right secured by the Bill of Rights is incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment, it applies in equal measure to the federal and state governments. See Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S. Ct. 682 (2019); McDonald v. City of Chi., 561 U.S. 742, 766 n.14 (2010). Neither of the lead opinions in Apodaca thus reflects the Court's current jurisprudence (and both were inconsistent with prior decisions as well).Given the incongruity in Apodaca, it is appropriate for the Court to reconsider that decision. The Court, quite rightly, does not often overrule its precedents, but the status of Apodaca as a precedent, other than the bare outcome, is doubtful. In addition, extending well established Sixth Amendment case law to the states would cause little disruption; as of now, every State other than Louisiana and Oregon requires unanimous jury verdicts in criminal cases.Apodaca also did not have the benefit of significant information that undermines the reasoning of the lead opinions. First, the plurality believed that a requirement of unanimity would not "materially contribute to the exercise of [the jury's] commonsense judgment," 406 U.S. at 410, but cited no empirical research to support that conclusion. Similarly, Justice Powell suggested that a non-unanimous rule would not result in "the8exclusion of minority group viewpoints" in the jury room, 406 U.S. at 378, but also cited nothing in support. Since Apodaca, research in jury and other small-group dynamics has shown that a unanimity rule is important to ensure that the jury debates thoroughly and respects minority viewpoints. In addition, research has revealed that the non-unanimous rule was likely adopted in Louisiana and Oregon in part for racially discriminatory reasons--a grave defect that threatens to undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system. All of these reasons warrant the Court reconsidering Apodaca and holding that the Sixth Amendment, of its own force and as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment, requires unanimous jury verdicts in criminal cases.I. THE SIXTH AMENDMENT'S GUARANTEE OF JURY UNANIMITY IS INCORPORATED IN THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTA. The Sixth Amendment Guarantees Jury UnanimityAs explained above, the four plurality Justices in Apodaca would have held that the Sixth Amendment permits non-unanimous verdicts--but that position was expressly rejected by five other Justices, including Justice Powell, who provided the controlling vote. See Johnson, 406 U.S. at 366 (Powell, J., concurring) ("In an unbroken line of cases reaching back into the late 1800's, the Justices of this Court have recognized, virtually without dissent, that unanimity is one of the indispensable features of the federal jury trial."). Louisiana has urged the Court to conclude that the Sixth Amendment does not require a unanimous jury. See Opp. 6-12. But that argument has been rejected by the Court both before and after Apodaca.9Nearly 90 years ago, the Court stated it was "not open to question" that the Sixth Amendment mandates unanimous criminal jury verdicts. Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 288 (1930). Patton traced this Court's jurisprudence to 1897 to confirm that jury unanimity is "embedded" in the Sixth Amendment, "beyond the authority of the legislative department to destroy or abridge." Id. at 289-290 (citing American Publ'g Co. v. Fisher, 166 U.S. 464 (1897); Springville v. Thomas, 166 U.S. 707 (1897); Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581 (1900)); see also Thompson v. Utah, 170 U.S. 343, 353 (1898) ("[The] wise men who framed the Constitution of the United States and the people who approved it were of opinion that life and liberty, when involved in criminal prosecutions, would not be adequately secured except through the unanimous verdict of twelve jurors.") And the requirement of unanimity dates to long before the nation's founding. See Johnson, 406 U.S. at 382 n.2 (Douglas, J., dissenting) (tracing requirement of unanimity to 1367).The Court has reaffirmed the requirement of unanimity several times. In Andres v. United States, 333 U.S. 740, 748 (1948), for example, the Court stated without qualification: "Unanimity in jury verdicts is required where the Sixth and Seventh Amendments apply." And the Court cited with approval Justice Powell's Apodaca/Johnson concurrence in Richardson, 526 U.S. at 817, where it stated: "[A] jury in a federal criminal case cannot convict unless it unanimously finds the Government has proved each element." See also Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 498 (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring) ("[The defendant's] guilt of the crime ... will be determined beyond reasonable doubt by the unanimous vote of 12 of his fellow citizens."); Fed. R. Crim. P. 31(a).10Given this unbroken case law, it must be regarded as settled that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts. Although the Apodaca plurality suggested otherwise, that position has never commanded a majority of the Court. Respondent seeks to draw an analogy (Opp. 7-8, 11-12) to Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78 (1970), but Williams does not permit split criminal verdicts. Rather, at issue in Williams was the constitutional propriety of a six-person jury in a non-capital criminal case. This Court determined that Florida's six-person jury did not offend the Sixth Amendment, reasoning that "the fact that the jury at common law was composed of precisely 12 is a historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system." 399 U.S. at 102. But the Court has never suggested that the unanimity requirement was a historical accident; quite the contrary, it has always viewed unanimity as fundamental to the very concept of a jury. And the Court in Williams "intimate[d] no view whether or not the requirement of unanimity is an indispensable element of the Sixth Amendment jury trial." Id. at 100 n.46. Thus, whatever may be said of Williams, it does not speak to the non-unanimous verdict here under review.B. The Sixth Amendment Should Be Wholly Incorporated In The Fourteenth AmendmentSince this Court has already held that the Sixth Amendment's Trial by Jury Clause requires a unanimous verdict, the next question is whether the Amendment's guarantee of jury trials--including its unanimity requirement--is wholly incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court's precedents on the Sixth Amendment and on incorporation make clear that unanimity is required in state and federal courts alike.11The test for incorporation is whether the right in question is "fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, or deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition." Timbs, 139 S. Ct. at 687 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Court has repeatedly held that the Sixth Amendment's protections meet this standard.The general constitutional right to trial by jury was held to be incorporated in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968). There, the Court, surveying historical practice and its own precedents, held unequivocally that "trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American system of justice," id. at 149, and "reflect[s] a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered," id. at 155. "Our conclusion," the Court explained, "is that in the American States, as in the federal judicial system, a general grant of jury trial for serious offenses is a fundamental right, essential for preventing miscarriages of justice and for assuring that fair trials are provided for all defendants." Id. at 157-158.The jury trial right thus stands on equal footing with other aspects of the Sixth Amendment that are fully incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment. For example, the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that trials be public was found embedded in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. See In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 266-273 (1948) (tracing "distrust" for "secret" trials to "English common law heritage" and to "notorious use of this practice by the Spanish Inquisition, to the excesses of the English Court of Star Chamber, and to the French monarchy's abuse of the letter de cachet."). Likewise, "the assistance of counsel is one of the safeguards of the Sixth Amendment deemed necessary to insure fundamental human rights and liberty." Gideon12v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 343 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted). The "Sixth Amendment's right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is likewise a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment," Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403 (1965), as is its guarantee of compulsory process, Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 18-19 (1967), and a speedy trial, Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213, 223-226 (1967).Because the Sixth Amendment's Trial by Jury Clause requires jury unanimity, and because that Clause has been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, the only way to conclude that the States are not bound by the unanimity requirement would be to hold that one particular aspect of the Sixth Amendment jury trial right has not been incorporated-- essentially, the rationale for Justice Powell's separate opinion in Apodaca. But this Court has rejected that approach to incorporation. As the Court explained in Timbs, "[i]ncorporated Bill of Rights guarantees are `enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect [federal] rights against federal encroachment.' Thus, if a Bill of Rights protection is incorporated, there is no daylight between the federal and state conduct it ... requires." 139 S. Ct. at 687 (quoting McDonald, 561 U.S. at 765).8Moreover, jury unanimity bears every hallmark of "fundamental" importance as each of the other incorpo-8 In Timbs, the Court noted that the "sole exception" to this rule is "that the Sixth Amendment requires jury unanimity in federal, but not state, criminal proceedings," which it ascribed to the "`unusual division among the Justices'" in Apodaca. Timbs, 139 S. Ct. at 687 n.1.13rated Sixth Amendment rights. See Patton, 281 U.S. at 290 (unanimity right is "substantial and essential"); Johnson, 406 U.S. at 369 (Powell J.) ("[U]nanimity is one of the indispensable features of federal jury trial.") Like the reasonable doubt standard, it is of ancient vintage and touches upon the jury's core function. Johnson, 406 U.S. at 381-383 (Douglas, J., dissenting). It is therefore peculiar to estrange jury unanimity from its related rights within the Sixth Amendment. Justice Douglas observed the anomaly when it first arose, asking how an incorporated Sixth Amendment could nonetheless secure a right to unanimity only in federal trials. Id.; see also id. at 395 (Brennan, J., dissenting) ("Readers of today's opinions may be understandably puzzled ....").Today it is clear there is no reason for such an exception. As explained in Part II.A, infra, the American Bar Association's survey of research since the 1972 Apodaca decision shows that jury unanimity serves a crucial function in the criminal justice system, by fostering effective group decision making, protecting minority jury votes, and reducing inconsistencies. Moreover, professed concerns about "efficiency" have long been a pretextual justification for a policy at least partly rooted in a racially discriminatory purpose. For these reasons the ABA's Criminal Justice Standards have now for decades called for unanimous jury verdicts. See pp. 2-3, supra.C. Stare Decisis Is Insufficient Reason To Preserve ApodacaGiven the weight of both this Court's case law and the research militating in favor of a fully incorporated Sixth Amendment, the sole justification for continuing to permit non-unanimous jury verdicts is stare decisis. But in this highly unusual context, stare decisis does not warrant adherence to Apodaca.14"Overruling precedent is never a small matter." Kimble v. Marvel Entm't, LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2401, 2409 (2015). Time and again this Court has explained that stare decisis is a "foundation stone of the rule of law," Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782, 798 (2014), necessary to "promote[] the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, foster[] reliance on judicial decisions, and contribute[] to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process." Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827 (1991). But stare decisis has never been an absolute rule in this Court, and the Court has been more willing to reconsider its prior decisions when it "interpret[s] the Constitution because [that] interpretation can be altered only by constitutional amendment or by overruling [its] prior decisions." Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 235 (1997).The ABA respectfully submits that "special justification" exists to overrule Apodaca. As an initial matter, as this Court recently observed, the Apodaca plurality opinion was `"the result of an unusual division among the Justices,"' Timbs, 139 S. Ct. at 687 n.1, with the concurring opinion of Justice Powell effectively producing precedent with which eight other Justices differed. Overruling Apodaca is thus not to succumb to a temptation for later courts to overrule earlier, well-reasoned decisions with which they simply disagree. Rather, here there is effectively no prior "decision" by the Court at all, so much as the opinion of one Justice advancing a theory of partial incorporation that the other eight Justices rejected--and a quirk of arithmetic.Moreover, developments in the Court's case law and empirical research have eroded support for the two (competing) rationales for Apodaca. As explained above, the Apodaca plurality's rationale--that the15Sixth Amendment does not require jury unanimity, period--has been repudiated by this Court, as has the concurrence's rationale--that the Sixth Amendment need not be incorporated in toto. See pp. 6-7, supra. Moreover, the two States that have allowed nonunanimous juries, Louisiana and Oregon, do not have a substantial reliance interest in the perpetuation of this plainly erroneous legal rule.9 A ruling for petitioner here would not threaten any upheaval of their judicial administration. Rather, those two States would merely become aligned with the 48 other States and the entire federal system by dint of minor adjustment of criminal procedure. See Payne, 501 U.S. at 828 ("Considerations in favor of stare decisis are at their acme in cases involving property and contract rights, where reliance interests are involved; the opposite is true in cases ... involving procedural and evidentiary rules.") (internal citations omitted).Indeed, it is the State's position that would disturb the law in the way that stare decisis seeks to prevent. Louisiana has argued (Opp. 6-12) that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimity at all. Such a ruling would expose all potential criminal defendants to the possibility of conviction by split verdict--a practice that virtually every jurisdiction in the nation has rejected. It would be ironic indeed were stare decisis used to justify such a result.9 This case does not require the Court to consider whether a decision that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments require unanimous verdicts would apply retroactively to cases that are already final. See Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 352 (2004) ("New rules of procedure ... generally do not apply retroactively.").16II. A UNANIMITY REQUIREMENT PROMOTES THE RELIABILITY OF JURY VERDICTS AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMA. A Unanimity Rule Promotes Better Decision Making By JuriesWhen the Court last considered the issue of jury unanimity in Apodaca and Johnson, every Justice agreed on the basic principle that the Sixth Amendment should be construed to promote thorough jury deliberations, attention to minority viewpoints, and community confidence in the criminal justice system, but they disagreed on whether unanimity was necessary to those constitutional objectives. The Justices disagreed, in particular, on the effect that non-unanimous decision rules would have on the jury's deliberative process. Compare Johnson, 406 U.S. at 361 (suggesting that jury members would not automatically and prematurely "cease discussion and outvote a minority" under a nonunanimous decision rule) and id. at 374 & n.12 (Powell, J.) (predicting that community confidence in jury verdicts would not diminish under a rule permitting nonunanimous verdicts) with id. at 388 (Douglas, J.) (nonunanimous verdicts "diminish[] the reliability of a jury") and id. at 398 (Stewart, J.) (non-unanimous verdicts suppress consideration of minority viewpoints and undermine "community confidence in the administration of justice").At the time of the Court's decisions in Apodaca and Johnson, there was little empirical research that might have confirmed or disproved those competing predictions.10 Since that time, extensive studies have been10 The Court did have empirical evidence that a nonunanimity rule makes it easier in some cases for the prosecution to obtain a conviction. As Justice Douglas related, the influential17conducted into the way juries make decisions and have reached conclusions that support a unanimity rule.11 Several of those studies were reviewed by the ABA when it adopted its 2005 Principles for Juries and Jury Trials, which reconfirmed the ABA's support for unanimous jury verdicts.12study of juries by Professors Kalven and Zeisel concluded that, in States with a unanimity requirement, 56% of deadlocked juries contained either one, two, or three dissenters, and the majority favored the prosecution in 44% of those cases (i.e., of the 56%) but the defendant in only 12%. Thus, although a non-unanimity rule may reduce the number of hung juries, it likely does so in a way that systematically favors the prosecution. See Johnson, 406 U.S. at 390-391 (Douglas, J., dissenting) (discussing Kalven & Zeisel, The American Jury 461, 488 (1966)). Subsequent research supports that insight. See Buckhout et al., Jury Verdicts: Comparison of 6- vs. 12-Person Juries and Unanimous vs. Majority Decision Rule in a Murder Trial, 10 Bull. Psychonomic Soc'y 175, 178 (1977) (in mock-jury study, "the majority ... verdict rule clearly [resulted in] more convictions").11 This Court has previously considered empirical evidence when assessing the constitutional contours of the jury trial right. See Ballew v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 223, 231 n.10 (1978) (Blackmun, J.) (social science research supported a conclusion that a jury smaller than six persons could not fulfill its constitutional role).12 Given the difficulties (and in many situations the impermissibility) of observing live jury deliberations, many studies of jury dynamics have necessarily involved controlled experiments with mock juries. See, e.g., Hastie et al., Inside the Jury (1983); Saks, Jury Verdicts: The Role of Group Size and Social Decision Rule (1977). Professor Hastie's research team culled representative jury pools from an actual Massachusetts venire, conducted voir dire, and selected juries of twelve. Each jury was shown an identical (pre-taped) murder trial and was given identical instructions, except that one third of the panels were told that unanimity was required, one third were told that ten votes were needed for a verdict, and one third were told that eight votes were needed. See Hastie, supra, at 60. Professor Saks's team selected 451 former18Unanimous juries are not flawless, of course. But research does indicate that a unanimity rule fosters more thorough, careful, and reliable deliberations because it requires minority viewpoints to be considered and, where possible, accepted or rejected by the entire jury. Where unanimity is required, jurors tend to evaluate evidence more thoroughly, spend more time deliberating, and take more ballots. By contrast, where unanimity is not required, jurors tend to end deliberations once the minimum number for a verdict is reached. ABA, Principles for Juries and Jury Trials, Principle 4.B Commentary 24 (2005); see Hastie et al., Inside the Jury 60 tbl. 4.1 (1983) (finding that 12-person juries required to reach unanimous verdicts deliberated for 138 minutes on average, whereas those required to reach an 8-member majority deliberated for only an average of 75 minutes); Saks, Jury Verdicts: The Role of Group Size and Social Decision Rule 94 (1977) (finding that once jurors reach the threshold for a majority-rule verdict, they regard that as "psychologically binding" and do not thereafter change their views toward the minority position); Devine et al., Jury Decision Making: 45 Years of Empirical Research on Deliberating Groups, 7 Psych. Pub. Pol'y & L. 622, 669 (2001); Davis et al., The Decision Processes of 6- and 12-Person Mock Juries Assigned Unanimous and Two-Thirds Majority Rules, 32 J. Personality & Soc. Psychol. 1, 12 (1975) (findingjurors from Franklin County, Ohio, to serve on 58 mock juries, which were shown a one-hour videotape of a staged felony burglary trial. The 58 juries were randomly allocated six- or twelvemember compositions and unanimous or two-thirds (4/6 or 8/12) decision rules. Saks, Jury Verdicts: The Role of Group Size and Social Decision Rule 62-66 (1977); see also Nemeth, Interactions Between Jurors as a Function of Majority vs. Unanimity Decision Rules, 7 J. Appl. Soc. Psych. 38 (1977) (mock juries composed of University of Virginia undergraduates).19that unanimity requirement increased deliberation and "conscientious" consideration of dissenting views); Taylor-Thompson, Empty Votes in Jury Deliberations, 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1262, 1273 (2000) (citing empirical research showing that "majority rule discourages painstaking analyses of the evidence and steers jurors toward swift judgments that too often are erroneous or at least highly questionable").In particular, a unanimity rule protects dissenting voices in the jury room, because it requires that every point of view be considered and all jurors be persuaded. Researchers have found that, "[c]ompared to unanimous rule juries, quorum rule juries have been found to deliberate less equitably (that is, the distribution of talking is skewed more extremely, with the talkative jurors talking more and the untalkative talking less than in unanimous rule juries." Saks, What Do Jury Experiments Tell Us About How Juries (Should) Make Decisions?, 6 S. Cal. Interdisc. L.J. 1, 40 (1997). On majority-rule juries, "large factions ... adopt a more forceful, bullying, persuasive style," possibly because "their members realize that it is not necessary to respond to all opposition arguments when their goal is to achieve a faction size of only eight or ten members." Hastie et al., supra, at 112; Nemeth, Interactions Between Jurors as a Function of Majority vs. Unanimity Decision Rules, 7 J. Applied Soc. Psych. 38, 55 (1977) (concluding that unanimity-rule juries were more likely to reach consensus and more likely to change their opinions); Kerr et al., Guilt Beyond a Reasonable Doubt: Effects of Concept Definition and Assigned Decision Rule on the Judgments of Mock Juries, 34 J. Personality & Soc. Psychol. 282, 290 (1976) (although non-unanimous rules produce faster verdicts and fewer hung juries, a majority of non-unanimous ju-20ries immediately ceased deliberation upon hitting the required majority-rule threshold).As Professor Hastie summarized the differences between unanimity-rule and majority-rule jurors:[B]ehavior in unanimous rule juries contrasts with typical behavior in majority rule juries in six respects: deliberation time (majority rule juries take less time to render verdicts), small faction participation (members of small factions are less likely to speak under majority rules), faction growth rates (large factions attract members more rapidly under majority rules); holdouts (jurors are more apt to be holdouts at the end of deliberation under majority rules), time of voting (majority rule juries tend to vote sooner) and deliberation style (majority rule juries are slightly likelier to adopt a verdict-driven deliberation style in contrast to the evidence-driven style)....Verdict driven juries vote early and organize discussion in an adversarial manner around verdict-favoring factions, as opposed to evidence-driven juries which defer voting and start with a relatively united discussion of evidence, turning to verdict categories later in deliberation.Hastie et al., supra, at 173-174.Research also indicates that individual jurors are themselves less satisfied with the decisions they reach under non-unanimity rules. See Nemeth, supra, at 47 ("Individuals under unanimity requirements also tended more to agree that justice had been administered than individuals required to deliberate to 2/3 majori-21ty... ."); Kerr et al., 34 J. Personality & Soc. Psychol. at 290 (finding that a non-unanimous decision rule results in decreased `"satisfaction with the way decisions were made in the jury"' and diminished `"satisfaction with the final verdict"').And perhaps most crucially, the same is true of the public at large. Citizens consider unanimous juries to be more accurate, more thorough, more likely to account for the views of jurors holding contrary views, more likely to minimize bias, better able to represent minorities, and fairer. See ABA, 2005 Jury Trial Principles, Principle 4.B Commentary, supra, at 24-26; MacCoun & Tyler, The Basis of Citizens' Perceptions of the Criminal Jury: Procedural Fairness, Accuracy, and Efficiency, 12 Law & Hum. Behav. 333, 337-338 & tbl. 1 (1988). As then-Circuit Judge Anthony Kennedy observed in 1978, "[b]oth the defendant and society can place special confidence in a unanimous verdict." United States v. Lopez, 581 F.2d 1338, 1341 (9th Cir. 1978).13Many of the findings cited in the ABA's 2005 Principles were confirmed by a subsequent study of actual civil jury deliberations in Arizona, which allows nonunanimous (six of eight) verdicts in civil trials. See Diamond et al., Revisiting the Unanimity Requirement: The Behavior of the Non-Unanimous Civil Jury, 10013 The actual results of Louisiana's system support Justice Kennedy's concern about confidence in non-unanimous verdicts. Louisiana is second in the rate of wrongful convictions in the nation, and there is reason to believe Louisiana's non-unanimous jury system is a contributing factor. "In 2017, the Innocence Project-New Orleans reported that [11] of [25] Louisiana exonerations resulted from trials where non-unanimous juries were used." See ABA Resolution 100B, Report at 4 (May 1, 2018).22Nw. U. L. Rev. 201, 205 (2006).14 The authors of that study concluded that the jurors were "quite conscious" that they did not need unanimity, which in some cases translated into "dismissive treatment of minority jurors (`holdouts')," and that "both outvoted holdouts and majority jurors are less positive about their juries than jurors who reach unanimous verdicts, giving lower assessments of their jury's thoroughness and then openmindedness of their fellow jurors." Id. at 205.The conclusions by social scientists that juries operating under non-unanimous rules may ignore dissenting or distinctive viewpoints is particularly troubling for confidence in the administration of justice. As Justice Stewart warned in Apodaca and Johnson, "nine jurors can simply ignore the views of their fellow panel members of a different race or class." 406 U.S. at 397 (Stewart, J., dissenting). This Court has repeatedly emphasized that "[o]ur notions of what a proper jury is have developed in harmony with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government," and that if a jury is to fulfill that function, it must "be a body truly representative of the community ... and not the organ of any special group or class." Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 527 (1975) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see Carter v. Jury Commission, 396 U.S. 320, 330 (1970).A rule that would allow racial or gender bias to take root in the jury room thus warrants particularly close scrutiny. Cf. Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 137 S. Ct. 855, 868 (2017) ("[R]acial bias [is] a familiar and re-14 The authors of this study were permitted by the Arizona Supreme Court to videotape 50 civil jury trials and deliberations between 1998 and 2001 and to administer questionnaires to the jurors and judges.23curring evil that, if left unaddressed, would risk systemic injury to the administration of justice."). To be sure, a criminal defendant is not entitled to a jury of any particular demographic composition. But just as confidence in the jury system suffers when potential jurors of particular categories (such as race and sex) are excluded from serving, see Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 413-414 (1991); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 87 (1986), so too does it suffer when the jury operates under rules that would allow a majority to treat the criminal justice system as its exclusive province.B. The Non-Unanimity Rule In Louisiana And Oregon Has Roots In Racial DiscriminationAs social science research shows, concerns that non-unanimous juries result in disenfranchisement of minority jurors and easier convictions of minority defendants are well-founded. And those concerns are all the more troubling because that is not only the effect, but also the original purpose, of the non-unanimous rule in Louisiana and Oregon--reason enough to render it constitutionally suspect. See Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 229 (1985).Louisiana and Oregon both initially required unanimous juries in all felony cases. The non-unanimous verdict arrived in Louisiana only after Reconstruction, as the white majority sought to perpetuate its supremacy in the State. Non-unanimous verdicts were first introduced in 1880, allowing defendants to be convicted by nine of twelve jurors. Split-verdict convictions were written into the Louisiana Constitution at the 1898 Constitutional Convention, which was deeply mired in racism. Indeed, the Convention's support for white supremacy was not a hidden fact, but a proclaimed truth. At the Convention's conclusion, the Chairman of the24Committee on the Judiciary spoke amid applause and announced the Convention's accomplished purpose: "Now then, what have we done? is the question. Our mission was, in the first place, to establish the supremacy of the white race in this State to the extent to which it could be legally and constitutionally done." Official Journal of the Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Louisiana 375 (1898) ("Louisiana Journal").Non-unanimous convictions were part of that design. State officials announced, when discussing the proposed Article 116 allowing non-unanimous verdicts: "We need a system better adapted to the peculiar condition of our State." Louisiana Journal at 76. The more "efficient" system allowed the State to obtain quick convictions that facilitated the use of free prisoner labor under Louisiana's convict-leasing system and ensured that AfricanAmerican jurors could not use their voting power on the jury to block convictions of other African Americans. See generally Aiello, Jim Crow's Last Stand: Nonunanimous Criminal Jury Verdicts in Louisiana (2015); Allen-Bell, How the Narrative About Louisiana's NonUnanimous Criminal Jury System Became a Person of Interest in the Case Against Justice in the Deep South, 67 Mercer L. Rev. 585 (2016).15Non-unanimous jury verdicts in Oregon have a similarly tainted racial origin. "Oregon adopted nonunanimous juries in the wake of a 1933 murder prosecution of a15 The State's 1973 constitutional conviction changed the law to require the vote of at least ten jurors. As in 1898, "efficiency" was a stated reason for retaining split verdicts. Although race was not discussed as openly as at the 1898 convention, the rule of non-unanimous verdicts was reaffirmed despite expressed concerns that mostly "poor, illiterate, and mostly minority groups" were affected. See ABA Resolution 100B, Report, supra, at 5.25Jewish defendant, which controversially ended in a manslaughter verdict--a compromise resulting from a lone holdout juror." Frampton, The Jim Crow Jury, 71 Vand. L. Rev. 1593, 1598 n.21 (2018). The backdrop of that trial was a rising Ku Klux Klan and "[a] society where racism, religious bigotry, and anti-immigrant sentiments were deeply entrenched in the laws, culture, and social life." Kaplan & Saack, Overturning Apodaca v. Oregon Should be Easy: Nonunanimous Jury Verdicts in Criminal Cases Undermine the Credibility of Our Justice System, 95 Or. L. Rev. 1, 3 (2016) (quotation marks omitted). An Oregon circuit court recently surveyed the origins of Oregon's non-unanimous jury system and found that "race and ethnicity was a motivating factor" in its adoption. Opinion 12-16, State v. Williams, No. 15CR58698 (Or. Cir. Ct. Multnomah Cty. Dec. 15, 2016).Even if the historical origins of Louisiana's splitverdict system were not enough to condemn it, there is evidence that even today that system continues to exacerbate severe racial disparities in Louisiana's criminal justice system. African-Americans constitute approximately one third of the population of Louisiana, but they make up two thirds of state prisoners and three fourths of inmates serving life imprisonment without parole. An analysis showed that 40 percent of trial convictions came over the objection of one or two holdouts, and that when the defendant was AfricanAmerican, the proportion went up to 43 percent, versus 33 percent for white defendants.1616 See Adelson et al., How an Abnormal Louisiana Law Deprives, Discriminates and Drives Incarceration: Tilting the Scales, The Advocate (Apr. 1, 2018), https://www.theadvocate.com/ baton_rouge/news/courts/article_16fd0ece-32b1-11e8-8770-33eca2a 325de.html.26All of the above reasons--the incongruity of the Apodaca decision with the rest of this Court's Sixth Amendment and incorporation jurisprudence; social science research demonstrating the flaws of nonunanimous verdicts; and the racial origins and implications of that system--are enough to make this the extraordinary case in which the Court should overrule a prior decision. The ABA therefore respectfully submits that the Court should bring to an end this unusual and unfortunate aspect of our criminal justice system.CONCLUSIONThe judgment of the Louisiana Court of Appeal should be reversed.Respectfully submitted.PAUL R.Q.

I. Allowing Bankruptcy Courts To Hear, Determine, And Enter Final Orders And Judgments With Litigant Consent Does Not Violate Article III Of The Constitution.A. The Court Has Historically Upheld The Ability Of Litigants To Waive The Right To An Article III Court.This Court has consistently upheld the authority of non-Article III tribunals, with the consent of the litigants, to hear any and all proceedings in bankruptcy or other civil cases, and to order the entry of judgment. See, e.g., Gonzalez v. United States, 553 U.S. 242, 252 (2008); Roell v. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580, 586-87 (2003); Schor, 478 U.S. at 848; MacDonald v. Plymouth County Trust Co., 286 U.S. 263, 268 (1932). As the Court explained in Schor, "Article III does not confer on litigants an absolute right to the plenary consideration of every nature of claim by an Article III court. Moreover, as a personal7right, Article III's guarantee of an impartial and independent federal adjudication is subject to waiver, just as are other personal constitutional rights that dictate the procedures by which civil and criminal matters must be tried." 478 U.S. at 848-49 (citations omitted). In Schor, the Court rejected the argument that allowing a litigant to file a state law counterclaim in a CFTC reparation proceeding created a "substantial threat to the separation of powers," id. at 854, recognizing that such concerns are diminished when "the decision to invoke [the non-Article III] forum is left entirely to the parties and the power of the federal judiciary to take jurisdiction of these matters is unaffected." Id. at 855.The singular importance of consent to the constitutional analysis runs through the relevant authorities. The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 authorized bankruptcy referees to hear and decide summary matters incident to the administration of the bankrupt's estate and to adjudicate creditors' claims against the estate, but did not authorize those referees to hear and decide plenary suits to recover money for the estate. See Ralph Brubaker, A "Summary" Statutory and Constitutional Theory of Bankruptcy Judges' Core Jurisdiction After Stern v. Marshall, 86 Am. Bankr. L.J. 121, 128-29 (2012).In MacDonald, a case decided under the 1898 Act, the Court held that litigants could waive the right to have a plenary suit, like the fraudulent transfer action at issue here, heard by an Article III court.8286 U.S. at 268. In Cline v. Kaplan, 323 U.S. 97, 99 (1944), also decided under the 1898 Act, the Court held that "[c]onsent to proceed summarily may be formally expressed" or "may be waived by failure to make timely objection."When the Court addressed the constitutionality of the jurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 in Northern Pipeline, 458 U.S. 50, consent continued to be a determinative factor in the Court's analysis. In commenting on the plurality decision, both the concurring and dissenting opinions emphasized that the defendant Marathon had not consented to having an Article I court decide the debtor's breach of contract action against it. Id. at 89-90, 92.In Schor, the Court reinforced that point, explaining that "the absence of consent" in Northern Pipeline was "a significant factor" in the Court's decision that "Article III forbade" the adjudication of Northern Pipeline's breach of contract action against Marathon in the bankruptcy court. 478 U.S. at 849. In Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U.S. 568, 584 (1985), the Court described Northern Pipeline as "establish[ing] only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review." (emphasis added).9B. In Similar Contexts, The Court Has Affirmed The Singular Significance Of Consent.In the analogous context of magistrate judges, the Court in Roell again emphasized the singular significance of consent, holding that a magistrate judge may enter a final judgment with the consent of the parties and that such consent may be express or implied. 538 U.S. at 589-91. The Roell Court held that, by allowing magistrate judges to hear and determine matters where consent is inferred, "[j]udicial efficiency is served; the Article III right is substantially honored." Id. at 590. See also Peretz v. United States, 501 U.S. 923, 936 (1991) (no constitutional infirmity in the delegation of felony trial jury selection to a magistrate judge with litigant consent).10Consistent with Roell and Peretz, the eleven circuit courts to address the issue have held that it is constitutionally permissible for magistrate judges to enter final judgments in civil proceedings based on the parties' consent.7 As the Fifth Circuit recently explained, the Federal Magistrates Act was `"saved from any constitutional infirmity by its requirement that all parties consent. . . .'"

Stern Does Not Change The Constitutional Analysis.Stern does not hold that parties may no longer consent to non-Article III adjudications. In Stern, the Court addressed the issue of waiver in two contexts and reached different conclusions based on the facts, thereby demonstrating that Stern's focus was not on whether consent is constitutionally permissible, but on what constitutes consent to a non-Article III adjudication. 131 S. Ct. at 2614-18.In Stern, the creditor, E. Pierce Marshall ("Pierce"), never expressly consented to being sued in the bankruptcy court and objected to the bankruptcy court entering a final judgment on the debtor Vickie Lynn Marshall's ("Vickie") state law counterclaim against him both before and after the bankruptcy court ruled against him. Id. at 2601-02. The Court rejected the argument that Pierce had consented to being sued in bankruptcy court merely by filing a proof of claim against Vickie, and held that the subpart of the statute which authorized the bankruptcy court to enter a final judgment on Vickie's state law counterclaim, 28 U.S.C. §157(b)(2)(C), without Pierce's consent, was unconstitutional "in one isolated respect." 131 S. Ct. at 2620.The Court reached the opposite conclusion when Pierce gave his consent. Pierce told the bankruptcycontent/dam/aba/administrative/house_of_delegates/resolutions/ 2013_hod_midyear_meeting_109.docx.12court that he was "happy to litigate his claim" against Vickie in the bankruptcy court. 131 S. Ct. at 2597. The Court held that Pierce's consent waived the right to trial in an Article III court on his claim against Vickie even though the subsection at issue with respect to Pierce's claim, Section 157(b)(5), provides that the district court "shall order" claims like Pierce's tried in the district court. 131 S. Ct. at 2606-08; see Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998) (holding the use of the word "shall" connotes a mandatory action).The juxtaposition of the Court's determination that Pierce's consent allowed the bankruptcy court to enter judgment on Pierce's claim against Vickie with its determination that Pierce's lack of consent prevented Vickie from having the bankruptcy court enter judgment on her state law counterclaim against Pierce demonstrates that Stern did not eliminate the ability of litigants to consent to determinations by non-Article III courts. Instead, Stern held only that when a creditor files a proof of claim he does not consent to being sued on a state law counterclaim in the bankruptcy court unless resolution of the proof of claim will resolve the counterclaim. 131 S. Ct. at 2620.The ABA submits that those circuit courts that have read Stern to hold that parties can no longer consent to non-Article III adjudications have incorrectly interpreted Stern's discussion of the structural importance Article III plays in our "system of separated powers." See, e.g., Frazin v.13Haynes & Boone, L.L.P., 732 F.3d 313, 320 n.3 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Stern, 131 S. Ct. at 2620). But Stern's discussion should be considered in the context of its facts: Pierce had not consented to being sued in bankruptcy court and had affirmatively objected. Pierce's refusal to consent to a bankruptcy court adjudication of the claims against him distinguishes Stern from Schor, and resulted in the Court's conclusion in Stern that Article III was violated. 131 S. Ct. at 2614.The Court's conclusion in Stern that structural concerns predominated in the absence of consent, however, does not mean that those structural concerns preclude hearing, determination, and final judgment in an Article I tribunal when the parties give their consent. The Court recognized in Stern that "the structural principles secured by the separation of powers protect the individual as well." 131 S. Ct. at 2609. Thus, Article III's dual protection of both the individual and structural separation of powers concerns, recognized in Schor, remains the law post-Stern. Moreover, as the Court concluded in Schor, "separation of powers concerns are diminished" and litigants may waive the right to an Article III court, when "the decision to invoke [a nonArticle III] forum is left entirely to the parties and the power of the federal judiciary to take jurisdiction" is unaffected. Schor, 478 U.S. at 855.Under the statutes relevant to the bankruptcy courts, "the power of the federal judiciary to take jurisdiction," even in matters where the parties14consent to proceed in the bankruptcy court, is unaffected. Id. The jurisdictional statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1334, vests jurisdiction in the district courts over all bankruptcy cases and civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to a bankruptcy case. The district courts also have complete discretion when deciding under 28 U.S.C. § 157(a) whether to refer a case or adversary proceeding to the bankruptcy court and under 28 U.S.C. § 157(d) whether to withdraw the reference of a matter previously referred to the bankruptcy court. Thus, the "power of the federal judiciary to take jurisdiction" in bankruptcy cases and adversary proceedings is preserved, making consent the determinative factor in the constitutional analysis. Schor, 478 U.S. at 855.The conclusion that Stern did not eliminate the right of litigants to consent to non-Article III adjudications also is consistent with the Court's reliance in Stern on its precedent addressing Seventh Amendment jury trial rights in bankruptcy cases. See Stern, 131 S. Ct. at 2618 (citing Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 52-56 (1989), Langenkamp v. Culp, 498 U.S. 42, 43 (1990) (per curiam), and Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323 (1966)). In Granfinanciera, the Court equated the right to trial by jury with the right to trial by an Article III court, stating that "if a statutory cause of action is legal in nature, the question whether the Seventh Amendment permits Congress to assign its adjudication to a tribunal that does not employ juries as factfinders requires the same answer as the15question whether Article III allows Congress to assign adjudication of that cause of action to a nonArticle III tribunal." 492 U.S. at 53. Stern adopts the Granfinanciera analysis and the two decisions together stand for the proposition that if a litigant has a right to trial by jury, he also has the right to be heard in an Article III court. See R. Brubaker, A "Summary" Statutory and Constitutional Theory of Bankruptcy Judges' Core Jurisdiction After Stern v. Marshall, 86 Am. Bankr. L.J. 121, 150-51 (2012) (explaining that Stern and Granfinanciera equate the right to a trial by jury to the right to an Article III court). Because the Court has recognized in this Seventh Amendment precedent that a party may waive its right to trial by jury in the bankruptcy context, see Stern, 131 S. Ct. at 2618, it should follow that a party similarly should be entitled to waive its right to have a judgment entered by an Article III court when the constitutional analysis that Stern requires leads to the conclusion that the bankruptcy court may not otherwise be entitled to enter a final judgment order.Moreover, like the Federal Magistrates Act, Section 157(c) also provides an effective means for litigants entitled to an Article III court to consent to the bankruptcy court's entry of a final judgment. 28 U.S.C. § 157(c); see also Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8001(a). "The inspiration for 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(2) is 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(1), which deals with the powers of United States magistrate judges in like situations." 1 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 3.03[4] (16th ed. 2011). In Stern, the Court explained that the remedy for the16constitutional violation was the "the removal of counterclaims such as Vickie's from core bankruptcy jurisdiction. . . ." 131 S. Ct. at 2620.9 Because Section 157 divides the universe of claims into only two categories, those that are core and those that are not, by "remov[ing]" Vickie's counterclaim from the bankruptcy court's core authority, the Court necessarily classified that counterclaim into the only other class of matters recognized under Section 157, those that are non-core. 131 S. Ct. at 2620. Thus, Section 157(c) applies and provides litigants with an effective means to consent to final adjudication by the bankruptcy court or absent such consent, allows for the bankruptcy court to enter proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law subject to de novo review in the district court.9 The Court stated that the "removal" of Vickie's counterclaim from the bankruptcy court's authority to enter a final judgment would not "meaningfully change[] the division of labor in the current statute; we agree with the United States that the question presented here is a `narrow' one." 131 S. Ct. at 2620 (Citing United States as Amicus Curiae at 23). The United States' position, with which the Court agreed, was that "[t]he narrow constitutional question presented is whether Congress, consistent with Article III, could authorize the bankruptcy judge to enter final judgment on petitioner's counterclaim (subject to appellate review as provided in 28 U.S.C. § 158) rather than simply submitting proposed findings and conclusions to the district court." See Brief of United States as Amicus Curiae at 23, Stern v. Marshall, 131 S. Ct. 2594 (2011) (No. 10-179), 2010 WL 4717271 (emphasis added).17II. The Ability Of Litigants To Consent To Final Adjudications By Non-Article III Tribunals Serves An Important Role In The Federal Court System.Contrary to the Court's prediction in Stern that its ruling would "not change all that much," 131 S. Ct. at 2620, the ABA asserts that there would be a sea change in the division of labor between the bankruptcy courts and the district courts if parties are no longer able to consent to bankruptcy courts hearing and deciding fraudulent transfer claims or any other matters which are held to be core but outside of the bankruptcy court's constitutional power to adjudicate. The ABA submits that where such a change is not constitutionally required, judicial economy and practicality should be considered. "The idea of separation of powers is justified by eminently practical considerations. It is [therefore] faithful to the idea of separation of powers to examine the real consequences of the statute." Pacemaker Diagnostic Clinic, 725 F.2d at 546-47 (citing The Federalist No. 51 (J. Madison) at 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1962)).18The consequences of eliminating consent would be stark. Statistics compiled by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts demonstrate that the district courts are stressed and without adequate resources.10 In 2012, 66 of the 677 authorized district court judgeships remain unfilled (approximately 10%).11 Seventeen of those positions had been open for more than 18 months.12 As a result of these vacancies, the district courts experienced 28 judicial emergencies in 2012.13 To help ease the burden on authorized judges, 354 senior United States district court judges with staff also served the Judiciary.14 District court judges handled a total of 382,068 pending civil and criminal cases, resulting in civil filings per authorized judgeship of 411 cases (up 10%10 See also, October 29, 2013, Letter from Thomas M. Susman, Director, ABA Governmental Affairs Office, to Hon. Robert W. Goodlatte, Chair, Committee on Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives (urging that Congress has an obligation to provide the federal judiciary with resources, in both judges and funds, needed to carry out its constitutional and statutory duties), available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam /aba/uncategorized/GAO/2013oct29_judgeshiph_l.authcheckdam .pdf. 11 http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/2012/ status-article-iii-judgeships.aspx. 12 Id. 13 A judicial emergency is either "a vacancy of any duration where weighted filings per judgeship are in excess of 600; or any vacancy longer than 18 months in a district court with weighted filings between 430 and 600 per judgeship; or any vacancy in a district court with more than one authorized judgeship and only one active judge." Id. 14 Id.19from 2008) and weighted filings per authorized judgeship of 520 cases (also up 10% from 2008).15The district courts' already heavy workload currently is lessened by the Judiciary's reference of title 11 matters to bankruptcy courts. As of 2012, 334 bankruptcy judges and 38 retired bankruptcy judges heard the 1,107,699 bankruptcy petitions filed in the twelve months preceding September 30, 2013 and the 65,599 adversary proceedings that were pending as of September 30, 2012.16 If this Court concludes that bankruptcy courts lack the ability to hear adversary proceedings involving matters that are denominated as core but where those courts may not constitutionally enter judgment, or issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in those cases, the resulting shift to the district courts will substantially increase their work load.15 "Weighted filings statistics take into account the different amounts of time it takes a judge to resolve various types of civil and criminal actions.... The average civil case or criminal defendant each receives a weight of approximately 1.0. For more time-consuming cases, higher weights are assessed." http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/2012/usdistrict-courts.aspx. 16 http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/2012/ status-bankruptcy-judgeships.aspx; http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/Bankruptcy Statistics/BankruptcyFilings/2013/0913_f2.pdf; http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/ 2012/appendices/F08Sep12.pdf.20 To demonstrate the impact on the district courts, the ABA gathered case filing data from the CM/ECF system for a sample district from each circuit. By searching under the "Nature of Suit," the ABA was able to determine the number of adversary proceedings filed during the four-year period from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2013 that included fraudulent transfer, preference and state-law based claims.17 The ABA then compared that number to the total number of civil proceedings filed in the applicable district during the same four-year period and calculated the percentage increase in the district courts' civil case load that would result if all fraudulent transfer, preference, and state-law based adversary proceedings were withdrawn to the district courts.17 The ABA searched using the following queries: "Recovery of money/property ­ 548 fraudulent conveyance", "Recovery of money/property ­ 547 preference", and "Other (e.g. actions that would have been brought in state court if unrelated to bankruptcy)."21The following chart summarizes that analysis:Court1st Cir.

First, a broad reading of Stern is likely to lead to matters in addition to fraudulent transfer, preference, and state law counterclaims being deemed outside of the bankruptcy court's constitutional authority to enter a final judgment. The Seventh Circuit, for example, recently held that a bankruptcy court could not constitutionally decide an action seeking a declaration against the debtor23that certain property was property of the bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C. § 541. Wellness Int'l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 727 F.3d 751, 774-76 (7th Cir. 2013). The foregoing analysis does not capture a matter of this type that typically would be brought by a motion filed in the bankruptcy case itself, outside of the adversary proceeding context, see Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7001(1), and for which no readilyobtainable data from the CM/ECF system is available.19Second, the chart reflects only a snapshot in time. A large liquidating chapter 11 case can generate a significant number of adversary proceedings that may pend for many years. In 2010, for example, a19 If allowed to stand, the holding in Wellness will impact the district courts' workloads in two significant ways. First, it would expand Stern's "narrow" holding in an unprecedented manner to include actions against a debtor to determine what is property of the estate, a determination which historically has always been viewed as "stem[ing] from the bankruptcy itself," and under a "narrow" reading of Stern would be within the bankruptcy court's constitutional authority to decide. 131 S. Ct. at 2618, 2620; see Thomas E. Plank, Why Bankruptcy Judges Need Not And Should Not Be Article III Judges, 72 Am. Bankr. L.J. 567, 584-87, 607-09 (1998) (explaining the historical authority of bankruptcy commissioners to determine what is property of the bankrupt). Second, under Wellness, if a matter is denominated as core but outside of the bankruptcy court's constitutional authority, the matter must be heard entirely in the district court. 727 F.3d at 776-77. The combined impact of these two rulings, which is not captured in the chart, would exponentially increase the number of motions and adversary proceedings that will have to be heard entirely in the district court.24trustee in a case pending in the District of Minnesota filed 203 such adversary proceedings, and as of the filing of this brief, 123, or 59.7% of those adversaryproceedings, remain pending.20Third, a holding that litigants may not consent toproceed before non-Article III courts may include inits sweep matters now heard by magistrate judges,who "account for a staggering volume of judicialwork" and are "indispensable." Peretz, 501 U.S. at928 & n.5 (1991) (citing Gov't of the Virgin Islands v.Williams, 892 F.2d 305, 308 (3rd Cir. 1989)). In 2012,for example, magistrate judges disposed of 1,068,153matters, including 15,049 civil cases concluded withfinality by motion, jury trial, or bench trial withlitigant consent.21 As of 2012, the United States had573 magistrate judges and 67 recalled retiredmagistrate judges, who providesubstantialassistance to the 1020 active and senior statusdistrict court judges.22The impact of eliminating consensual non-Article III adjudications is further demonstrated by these specific examples: a trustee in the case In DBSI, Inc., et al. (Case No. 08-12687), pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, filed 885 fraudulent transfer and20 https://ecf.mnb.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/qryAscCases.pl? 298823.21 http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/ 2012/us-magistrate-judges.aspx.22 http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/ 2012/appointments-magistrate-judges.aspx#table13.25preference actions in 2010.23 Among the four district court judges in that district, during 2010, there were 1,595 civil cases pending; thus, if all of the fraudulent transfer and other avoidance actions had been transferred to one or more of the district court judges, their civil workload would have been increased by approximately 55.49%.24 Similarly, a trustee in a case in the District of New Mexico, In re Vaughan Company, Realtors, (Case No. 10-10759), filed 168 fraudulent transfer and preference complaints in 2012.25 That District had 1,085 civil matters pending at the end of 2012; thus a transfer to the district court of these 168 adversary proceedings would increase that district court's civil case load by 15.48%.26 Additionally, in a pending case in the Eastern District of Washington, In re LLS America LLC (Case No. 09-06194), the liquidating trust filed 226 fraudulent transfer and preference actions in 2012.27 Again, in the absence of23 To compile this number and the other individual case numbers, the ABA reviewed the adversary complaints filed in these bankruptcy cases. The DBSI adversary complaints are available at: https://ecf.deb.uscourts.gov/ cgi-bin/qryAscCases.pl?114658. 24 http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/Statistical TablesForTheFederalJudiciary/2010/dec10/C01Dec10.pdf. 25 http://ecf.nmb.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/qryAscCases. pl?125654. 26 http://www.uscourts.gov/Viewer.aspx?doc=/uscourts/ Statistics/FederalJudicialCaseloadStatistics/2012/tables /C00Mar12.pdf. 27 https://ecf.waeb.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/qryAscCases. pl?158228.26consensual non-Article III adjudications, the district court judges in that district would be required to add these cases to their 2012 pending case load of 834 civil cases, leading to 27% increase in their civil dockets.28Eliminating consent also will have an impact on all civil litigants. More cases on the district courts' dockets necessarily mean more delay between the filing of a complaint and trial as more cases compete for the district courts' time and attention.Further, the elimination of consent creates "the risk of gamesmanship" by losing parties, Roell, 538 U.S. at 590, as the following hypothetical demonstrates: a trustee brings an action against a creditor seeking turnover of estate property. That matter is denominated as core under 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(E) and in accordance with Federal Bankruptcy Rule 7008(a), the trustee alleges that the court may enter a final judgment order; the creditor does not respond to this allegation. The bankruptcy court hears the matter without objection and enters judgment. On appeal, the creditor asserts it did not consent to be sued in the bankruptcy court and that the turnover action is outside of the bankruptcy court's constitutional core authority. If Stern is extended to eliminate both express and implied consent and also to eliminate the ability of bankruptcy courts to recommend proposed28 http://www.uscourts.gov/Viewer.aspx?doc=/uscourts/ Statistics/FederalJudicialCaseloadStatistics/2012/tables /C00Mar12.pdf.27judgments, litigants in this circumstance may safely "sit back without a word" knowing that they may "vacate any judgment that turned out not to be to their liking" and re-start their cases in the district court. Roell, 538 U.S. at 590.Litigation in which the parties dispute which court will hear a matter can be inefficient and costly. Recognizing that bankruptcy cases are especially cost-sensitive, when Congress enacted the modern Bankruptcy Code, it sought to eliminate wasteful litigation about the forum in which matters would be decided. See Report Of The Commission On The Bankruptcy Laws Of The United States, July, 1973, H.R. Doc. No. 93-137, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess., Part I, ch.4B. (1973). Extending Stern to eliminate express and implied consent would defeat this Congressional purpose and would lead to more, not less, litigation and to further delay and expense for the parties and the federal court system.Accordingly, the ABA submits that, where, as here, considerations of judicial economy and practicality are not in conflict with constitutional principles, this Court can and should consider the impact that decision will have on the courts and both bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy litigants. See Schor, 478 U.S. at 850-51. The ABA therefore urges this Court to decline Petitioner's invitation to read Stern as eliminating the ability of litigants to consent to non-Article III adjudications.28CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae American Bar Association requests that the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.Dated: November 15, 2013Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: CATHERINE STEEGE BARRY LEVENSTAM MELISSA HINDS SONIA O'DONNELLJAMES R.

THE APPLICATION APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TEXT OF THE COPYRIGHT ACTSubsection 411(a) of the United States Copyright Act states that, subject to certain exceptions, "no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title." 17 U.S.C. § 411(a). The issue before this Court is the meaning of the term "registration" in this Subsection.When confronted with a question of statutory interpretation such as this, this Court "begin[s] by examining the text," Carter v. United States, 530 U.S. 255, 271 (2000), including both "the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole," K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291 (1988). The Copyright Act defines the term "registration" to mean "a registration of a claim in the original or the renewed and extended term of copyright." 17 U.S.C. § 101. This self-referential definition sheds little light on the meaning of Subsection 411(a) because it does not indicate what steps must be taken, and by whom, for registration to occur.8In contrast to its unhelpful definition of the term "registration," the Copyright Act makes clear through other provisions that submitting a copyright application, deposit copy, and fee is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Subsection 411(a). This Court already implicitly has read the text of Subsection 411(a) as providing that registration occurs when the copyright holder acts by delivering her application, deposit copy, and fee to the Copyright Office. In Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, this Court found that Subsection 411(a)'s registration requirement was a precondition to filing rather than a limitation on a court's subject-matter jurisdictional prerequisite. 559 U.S. 154. In so holding, this Court highlighted the "incentives to encourage copyright holders to register their works." Id. at 158 n.1 (emphasis added). 6Neighboring provisions to Subsection 411(a) also confirm that registration is dependent upon the6 Relatedly, reading Subsection 411(a) to give the Copyright Office control over which authors can enforce their copyrights and when is inconsistent with the fundamental rule expressed in the Copyright Act that copyright "subsists . . . in original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression," 17 U.S.C. § 102(a), and that fixation occurs when the work is made sufficiently permanent "by or under the authority of the author," id. § 101. This language makes clear that copyright protection is contingent upon the author's acts, not Copyright Office action. Reading Subsection 411(a) to increase arbitrarily the burden on authors to enforce their copyrights is inconsistent with this "broader context of the [Copyright Act] as a whole." Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997).9copyright holder's conduct, not that of the Copyright Office. Possibly most critically, Subsection 410(d) expressly states that the effective date of a registration is the "day on which an application, deposit, and fee" are submitted to the Copyright Office. Id. § 410(d); see also Cosmetic Ideas, Inc. v. IAC/Interactivecorp, 606 F.3d 612, 617 (9th Cir. 2010). Thus, registration is deemed to have occurred when the copyright holder submitted the registration materials, not when the Copyright Office issued a certificate memorializing that registration. It would be inconsistent with the statute's text to interpret Subsection 411(a) as saying that registration does not occur until the Copyright Office acts, because that would suggest that the date of the Copyright Office's action is the date of registration, which the plain language of Subsection 410(d) refutes. The application approach accords with this language by focusing on the timing of the submission of registration materials.In addition, Subsection 408(a) expressly states that "[t]he owner of copyright or of any exclusive right in the work may obtain registration . . . by delivering to the Copyright Office the deposit specified by this section, together with the application and fee specified." 17 U.S.C. § 408 (emphasis added). This confirms that the copyright holder alone effectuates registration by "delivering" registration materials. The certificate approach would have the Court read into the statute the additional words "and receiving a certificate of registration or refusal from the10Copyright Office," but that is not what the plain text says.7Similarly, the latter part of Subsection 411(a) shows that registration does not require Copyright7 Respondents argue that Section 408's preregistration provision supports the certificate approach, see Respondents' Brief in Opposition to Petitioner's Petition for Certiorari ("Resp. Cert. Br.") 15, but Section 408 is a red herring. As an initial matter, preregistration is a completely distinct process from the registration process that is at issue in this appeal, applying in a unique set of circumstances involving delineated types of works. Moreover, the text of Section 408 does not support Respondents' assertion that submitting an application, deposit copy, and fee under Subsection 408(f)(3) constitutes an "application for registration," rather than a registration. The statute makes clear that the phrase "application for registration" refers to solely the application form, not the combined registration materials. See 17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(3)(A) ("application for registration" is one out of three materials that must be submitted); id. § 409 (describing an "application for copyright registration" without mention of deposit copies or fees). Respondents also argue that Subsection 408(f) states that a preregistrant "must `appl[y] for registration of the work'" by submitting an application, deposit copy, and fee. Resp. Cert. Br. 15 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(3)). The text, however, does not provide that submitting these materials constitutes "application." Instead, it merely says that one must "submit to the Copyright Office" the enumerated materials. 17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(3). Lastly, the Government's argument that the application approach would render the preregistration scheme unnecessary, see U.S. Amicus Br. 16­17, does not stand as, under either approach, an author wanting to sue for infringement of an unfinished, unpublished work would be unable to do so without the benefit of preregistration.11Office action. That provision permits the copyright holder to file suit even "where the deposit, application, and fee required for registration have been delivered to the Copyright Office in proper form and registration has been refused." 17 U.S.C. § 411(a) (emphasis added). The language here is telling because saying "registration has been refused" in the past tense contemplates a registration upon filing, which only later was refused. Indeed, this phrasing suggests that the act of registration is something distinct from the act of refusal. If these acts were one and the same, this provision would not make sense, as the Copyright Office cannot refuse to accept a registration that does not yet exist.8Finally, while advocates of the certificate approach argue that the Copyright Office must act for registration to occur, the provisions on which they rely actually support the application approach because each of those provisions focuses on issuance of the "certificate of registration." Id. §§ 408(a), 410(a). This8 In interpreting this portion of Subsection 411(a), some certificate-approach courts have found that because the provision contemplates that one may submit the "deposit, application, and fee required for registration" yet registration may still be refused, the submission of registration materials cannot constitute registration, see La Resolana Architects, PA v. Clay Realtors Angel Fire, 416 F.3d 1195, 1200­01 (10th Cir. 2005); Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, LLC, 856 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir. 2017). But again, the plain text undermines this argument, as it construes registration and acceptance or refusal of the registration as different things.12makes sense under the application approach as the act of registration (filing the application, deposit copy, and fee with the Copyright Office) is different from the issuance of a certificate of registration. By contrast, the certificate approach would require treating two different terms used by Congress--"registration" and "certificate of registration"--as defining the same conduct. This is contrary to the standard rules of statutory interpretation. See Jama v. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, 543 U.S. 335, 358 (2005) (explaining that a statute should be interpreted so that "distinct words have distinct meanings").9As a result, "only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law." United Sav. Ass'n of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs., Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988). Submitting an application, deposit copy, and fee to the Copyright Office constitutes "registration" under Subsection 411(a).II. THE APPLICATION APPROACH BETTER REFLECTS THE UNIQUE NATURE AND PURPOSE OF COPYRIGHT LAW AS OPPOSED TO PATENT LAWAs discussed above, the application approach is the better reading of the Copyright Act. At best, those supporting the certificate approach have raised arguments suggesting that the term "registration" is9 See also 2 MELVILLE B. NIMMER & DAVID NIMMER, NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT § 7.16[B][3][a][i] (2013) (hereinafter NIMMER).13ambiguous. When this Court is confronted with an ambiguous statute, it looks to the "statutory context, `structure, history, and purpose.'" Abramski v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 2259, 2267 (2014) (quoting Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.S. 48, 76 (2013)).There can be no debate that the application approach is more consistent with the purpose of the statute and the unique role of the Copyright Office. As discussed below, adopting this approach is critical to the ABA as copyright practitioners prosecute copyright registrations and advise their clients on copyright law issues every day. The certificate approach diverges from ordinary copyright principles in an unhelpful and inconsistent manner.A. Copyright is Created through Fixation in a Tangible Medium, Not Copyright Office GrantWhile this Court sometimes has analyzed copyright and patent as analogous regimes due to their "historic kinship," Sony Corp. of Am. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 439 (1984), there are fundamental differences in the way individuals and their lawyers secure rights under these regimes that have critical bearing on the question presented.Under patent law, no patent rights exist until the Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") undertakes an extensive analysis of factors including novelty, obviousness, and subject matter, and formally issues14a patent. In other words, one can acquire patent rights through only an express grant from the PTO after the intense application process detailed below; "the patentee has no exclusive right of property in his invention, except under and by virtue of the statutes securing it to him, and according to the regulations and restrictions of those statutes." Dable GrainShovel Co. v. Flint, 137 U.S. 41, 43 (1890); see also Morrow v. Microsoft Corp., 499 F.3d 1332, 1336­37 (Fed. Cir. 2007).By contrast, Congress designed the Copyright Act to allow copyright to "subsist" from the time that an author fixes a work in a "tangible medium of expression," with no Copyright Office input required. 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). The Copyright Office is not positioned as a gatekeeper for deciding who receives copyrights and when those rights arise. Thus, unlike the PTO, "[t]he Copyright Office does not grant copyrights." Chere Amie, Inc. v. Windstar Apparel, Corp., 191 F. Supp. 2d 343, 350 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).This is not to say that registration with the Copyright Office is not, or should not be, encouraged.10 ABA practitioners regularly counsel their clients to register their copyrighted works, as it confers many practical benefits. For example, a certificate of registration can constitute prima facie evidence of a10 See H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 158 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5774 (stating that a robust register of copyrighted works "is useful and important to users and the public at large").15copyright's validity, see 17 U.S.C. § 410(c), and timely obtaining a certificate may enable the copyright holder to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees for infringement, see id. §§ 411, 412, 501­505. But while a certificate of registration might afford the copyright holder litigation benefits, it does not determine whether, and when, copyright exists.Critically, the certificate approach does not incentivize registration of copyrighted works any more than the application approach. Under either approach, copyright holders must register their copyrights to enforce them against infringers.11 Congress's express aim in the Copyright Act was to induce copyright registration "in some practical way."12 ABA practitioners have found that the application approach--which furthers the goals of the registration system to the same extent as the certificate approach--achieves this in the manner that "best effectuate[s] the interests of justice and promote[s] judicial economy." Int'l Kitchen Exhaust Cleaning Ass'n v. Power Washers of N. Am., 81 F. Supp. 2d 70, 72 (D.D.C. 2000).11 See Jane C. Ginsburg, The U.S. Experience with Mandatory Copyright Formalities: A Love/Hate Relationship, 33 COLUM. J.L. & ARTS 311, 340­41 (2010) ("Where the author has in fact sought to make the requisite public record of her claim, it is unclear what public policy such a wooden approach . . . to registration advances.").12 H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 158 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5774 (emphasis added).16Thus, the application approach better accords with the structure of the Copyright Act.B. The Procedural Barriers to Patent Protection are Higher than CopyrightThe application approach also better accords the Copyright Office's review procedure, which in turn reflects the basic tenet of copyright that legal rights arise upon the author's fixation in a tangible medium, which typically occurs before the Copyright Office is called upon for review. In contrast to the patent regime, Congress did not position the Copyright Office as a gate-keeper to copyright protection so much as a steward looking after authors and their works. The application approach better reflects the important practical distinctions between these systems.Specifically, patent practitioners regularly find that patent law imposes demanding subject-matter, novelty, and non-obviousness requirements on inventors seeking patent protection. See Original Appalachian Artworks, Inc. v. Toy Loft, Inc., 684 F.2d 821, 824 (11th Cir. 1982) (noting that "courts generally agree that `originality' for copyright purposes is something less than the novelty or uniqueness necessary for patent protection"). Consistent with the fact that the PTO's decision on patentability determines whether an inventor receives patent rights, the review required prior to17issuance of a patent is extremely demanding.13 See, e.g., Prima Tek II, L.L.C. v. Polypap, S.A.R.L. 412 F.3d 1284, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (noting that the patent application process is so demanding because the "patent system depends primarily on the Patent and Trademark Office's . . . care in screening out invalid patents during prosecution"). In addition to the statutory requirements for patentability, the patent itself must satisfy an additional set of requirements. In particular, it must (1) provide a written description showing actual possession of the invention; and (2) enable a person of ordinary skill in13 To obtain a utility patent, an applicant must prove to the PTO that a claimed invention is a "new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter," 35 U.S.C. § 101, that is novel and nonobvious, id. §§ 102, 103. The inventor must prove this in a written application consisting of a specification, drawing, and oath or declaration. See id. § 111. Once submitted, the application is assigned to a patent examiner who begins a rigorous process of review. This involves a "thorough study" of prior art (i.e., things that have already been invented) to test for novelty and nonobviousness. 37 C.F.R. § 1.104(a). The examiner looks "both to compliance of the application . . . with the applicable statutes and rules and to the patentability of the invention as claimed, as well as with respect to matters of form." Id. The patent examination process is an "ongoing negotiation," Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc), that usually involves initial rejection, narrowing or clarification efforts from the applicant, reconsideration by the examiner, evidentiary submissions, amendments, and other steps depending upon the claims at issue, see, e.g., In re Brandt, 886 F.3d 1171, 1175­76 (Fed. Cir. 2018).18that art or field to make and use the invention without undue experimentation. 35 U.S.C. § 112(a)­(b). Although litigants often challenge the patentability of the subject invention in patent litigation, it is also common to challenge these elements of the patent itself.Unlike the rigorous, highly formal requirements of obtaining patent rights, this Court has made clear that copyright has a low threshold that permits any work that has been "independently created by the author" and that possesses "at least some minimal degree of creativity" to qualify for protection. Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 345 (1991). Thus, while the Copyright Office reviews an application to make sure that it comports with the overall requirements of copyrightability, it is not the same type of analysis typically conducted by the PTO. The application approach better accords with this reality.In fact, the United States systematically has sought to remove administrative barriers to copyright protection (known as formalities). See, e.g., Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-568, 102 Stat. 2853. As a result, submitting works to the Copyright Office "is not a condition of copyright protection." 17 U.S.C. § 408(a). Nor is compliance with other formalities--such as affixing copyright notices to the work--required. See id. § 401 (stating that a notice of copyright "may be placed" on copies of the work (emphasis added)); id. § 407(a) ("Neither the deposit requirements of this subsection19nor the acquisition provisions of subsection (e) are conditions of copyright protection."). The net-effect of these critical legislative decisions is that a work is protected by copyright law as soon as the author creates it in tangible form, regardless of the Copyright Office's subsequent opinion on whether the work deserves a certificate of registration.Consistent with the foregoing, the Copyright Office's policy is to conduct only a high-level review of submitted registration materials,14 focusing on whether "the material deposited constitutes copyrightable subject matter and that the other legal and formal requirements of [the Copyright Act] have been met." Id. § 410. Although the Copyright Office reviews some substantive qualities of the work, a certificate of registration "is usually granted as a matter of course, so long as the applicant correctly files their application and the deposited subject matter is within the scope of copyright protection."1514 Indeed, Congress understood that, "unlike a patent claim, a claim to copyright is not examined for basic validity before a certificate is issued." H.R. Rep. 94-1476, at 5773.15 Ben Depoorter & Robert Kirk Walker, Copyright False Positives, 89 NOTRE DAME L. REV. 319, 348­49 (2013). The Copyright Office admits that in its review, it "generally does not compare deposit copies to determine whether the work for which registration is sought is substantially similar to another work." See, e.g., U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE, COMPENDIUM 602.4(C). Nor does it undertake a substantive review of prior registrations to ascertain what, if any, expression in the application is protected. See, e.g., Ginsburg, supra note 11, at 347 (noting that the "bulk" of20If the Copyright Office has questions about matters in an application, it will informally correspond with the copyright holder, often seeking additional materials or written answers to clarify and remedy any perceived issues. Once its examination is complete, the Copyright Office either will issue a certificate of registration, effective as of the date it received the registration materials, see id. § 410(d), or will refuse to issue a certificate, notifying the copyright holder in writing of the reasons for refusal, see id. § 410(a)­(b).Finally, it should not go unnoticed that while patent litigants routinely challenge both the validity of the patented invention and the sufficiency of the patent specification itself, in copyright cases, the words of the certificate are almost never relevant and even copyrightability is rarely challenged due to the low standard described above. This further supports why the certificate approach is ill-suited to the needs of litigation: it places weight on Copyright Office formalities that are generally irrelevant to theexamination time is spent reviewing information in the application form, not "ascertaining originality"). Indeed, "[t]he enforcement of the substantive provisions of Copyright law by the Copyright Office is . . . limited." Arthur J. Levine & Jeffrey L. Squires, Notice, Deposit and Registration: The Importance of Being Formal, 24 UCLA L. REV. 1232, 1262 (1977). As a result, and as the United States government has admitted, the Copyright Office accepts approximately ninety-nine percent of the applications it receives. See U.S. Br. at 4 n.2, Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154 (2010).21protectability of a work or the merits of copyright infringement suits.C. The Copyright Office's Opinion on Registrability is Not Binding on CourtsIn addition to the certificate of registration being an infrequent focus of copyright litigation, even where the Copyright Office refuses to issue such a certificate, copyright litigation still may commence. See 17 U.S.C. § 411(a). This makes sense given that the Copyright Office's views with respect to copyrightability do not dictate the existence, scope, or validity of copyrights.In fact, even when courts have access to the Copyright Office's decision in a copyright infringement litigation, "copyrightability is a question of law reserved to the judge and subject to de novo review by appellate courts." Darden v. Peters, 402 F. Supp. 2d 638, 641 (E.D.N.C. 2005), aff'd, 488 F.3d 277 (4th Cir. 2007); see also Bartok v. Boosey & Hawkes, Inc., 523 F.2d 941, 946 (2d Cir. 1975) (noting that the "Copyright Office has no authority to give opinions or define legal terms"). Indeed, it is well-settled that Copyright Office decisions on copyrightability are entitled to the lower level of deference afforded under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1994). See, e.g., EMI Christian Music Grp., Inc. v. MP3tunes, LLC, 844 F.3d 79, 97 (2d Cir. 2016); Varsity Brands, Inc. v. Star Athletica, LLC, 799 F.3d 468, 479 (6th Cir. 2015), aff'd sub nom. Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity22Brands, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1002 (2017). Accordingly, a federal court may elect to follow Copyright Office opinions where it finds them "persuasive and reasonable," Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. Aereokiller, LLC, 851 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2017), but ultimately, where a copyright owner is denied certificate of registration prior to bringing an infringement action, courts "make an independent determination as to copyrightability," Aqua Creations USA Inc. v. Hilton Hotels Corp., No. 10 Civ. 246, 2011 WL 1239793, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2011), aff'd sub nom. Aqua Creations USA Inc. v. Hilton Worldwide, Inc., 487 Fed. App'x 627 (2d Cir. 2012).16Given that the Copyright Office's decision on copyrightability is not binding, the application approach better reflects that the Copyright Office's opinion likely will have little bearing on substantive issues before a court.1716 See also NIMMER, supra note 9, § 12.11[B][3].17 See, e.g., Carol Barnhart Inc. v. Economy Cover Corp., 773 F.2d 411 (2d Cir. 1985) (mannequin figures listed as "sculptures" in certificates of registration not copyrightable); Sari v. America's Home Place, Inc., 129 F. Supp. 3d 317, 326­ 28 (E.D. Va. 2015) (architectural plans not copyrightable even though Copyright Office issued certificate of registration); I.C. ex rel. Solovsky v. Delta Galil USA, 135 F. Supp. 3d 196, 213­15 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (t-shirt design sufficiently original to make out prima facie case of copyright validity despite Copyright Office's refusal to issue registration certificate); ATCS Int'l LLC v. Jefferson Contr. Corp., 807 F. Supp. 2d 516, 518 (E.D. Va. 2011) (drawings were nonprotectable "functionally driven designs" even23III. THEAPPLICATIONAPPROACHSAFEGUARDS AUTHORS' ABILITIES TOEFFECTIVELY RESOLVE INFRINGE-MENT CLAIMSThe application approach resolves numerous critical issues of timing, efficiency, and access to effective redress that arise under the certificate approach.A. The Application Approach Ensures that Authors May Seek the Injunctive Relief that is Critical to Copyright LitigationSignificantly, the application approach ensures that copyright holders may go to court to obtain injunctions or temporary restraining orders "to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright" as early as possible. 17 U.S.C. § 502. One of the unique characteristics of copyright law is the frequent need for copyright holders to seek emergency injunctive relief. As ABA members are well aware, monetary relief often does not suffice to remedy copyright infringement and injunctive relief is the only way ofthough plaintiff held certificate of registration); Sapon v. D.C. Comics, No. 00 Civ. 8992, 2002 WL 485730, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2002) (plaintiff's "Black Bat" drawings not sufficiently original despite fact that Copyright Office issued certificate of registration); Past Pluto Prods. Corp. v. Dana, 627 F. Supp. 1435, 1440­42 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (design for foam hat of Statue of Liberty Crown not protectable despite Copyright Office issuing certificate of registration).24preventing irreparable injury. See, e.g., Salinger v. Colting, 607 F.3d 68, 81 (2d Cir. 2010) (injunction warranted because harm to plaintiff is often "irreparable in light of possible market confusion"); Omega Imp. Corp. v. Petri-Kine Camera Co., 451 F.2d 1190, 1195 (2d Cir. 1971) (noting that "prov[ing] the loss of sales due to infringement is . . . notoriously difficult"). Moreover, circumstances often arise in practice where several days of delay in filing for an injunction can make a world of difference, such as where an infringing work will undermine the demand for the yet-to-be-released original, see New Line Cinema Corp. v. Bertlesman Music Grp., Inc., 693 F. Supp. 1517, 1530­31 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), or the market for the original work is "fleeting" in nature and will be displaced by the infringer, see Lakedreams v. Taylor, 932 F.2d 1103, 1109 (5th Cir. 2011). Indeed, "it is virtually axiomatic that the public interest can be served only by upholding copyright protections and, correspondingly, preventing the misappropriation of the skills, creative energies, and resources which are invested in the protected work." Apple Comput., Inc. v. Franklin Comput. Corp., 714 F.2d 1240, 1254­55 (3d Cir. 1983).As a copyright holder need not register a work to hold a copyright in it, it is common practice for authors not to immediately register their works, particularly given the rapid manner in which works are created in the modern world and the expense of keeping up with such registrations. Thus, it is foreseeable under the certificate approach that a copyright holder could learn of incipient infringement,25but be unable to sue immediately to obtain injunctive relief because she does not yet have a certificate of registration or refusal in hand. By the time the copyright holder's certificate of registration is either issued or refused, irreparable damage already may have occurred, and the proverbial horse will have left the barn.While requiring a copyright holder to obtain a decision from the Copyright Office prior to filing suit may sound like a trivial delay, these delays present real problems. As of July 2018, the Copyright Office reports that a certificate of registration may issue anywhere between three and twenty-eight months after a copyright holder submits her application, deposit copy, and fee.18 The length of time depends upon factors such as the form in which the application was submitted (i.e., online or via mail), "how difficult a claim is to review, whether the Copyright Office needs to correspond with an applicant, and the number of registration specialists available to review claims."19On average, the delay between filing and decision for online claims with no ensuing correspondence is seven months, and nine months for those requiring18 See U.S. Copyright Office, Registration Processing Times, https://copyright.gov/registration/docs/processing-timesfaqs.pdf (last visited August 29, 2018).19 Id.26correspondence.20 For claims made through the mail, the Copyright Office's review takes an average of nine months if there is no correspondence, and sixteen months with correspondence.21 Thus, if a copyright holder learns of infringement early enough to stop it, but must wait to bring an infringement action until the Copyright Office issues either a certificate of registration or a refusal, the copyright holder effectively could lose her ability to get the immediate temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief needed to best protect her interests.The United States Government's brief asserts that this concern can be remedied by authors filing their registration materials through the Copyright Office's expedited review process known as "special handling." Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae ("U.S. Amicus Br.") 22.22 But special handling is not a solution. As a threshold matter, special handling is available only in limited circumstances, namely "pending or prospective litigation," "customs matters," and "contract or publishing deadlines that necessitate the expedited issuance of a certificate."23 In addition, even accepting at face value the Copyright Office's20 See id.21 See id.22 U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE, COMPENDIUM 207 (2017).23 Id. at 623.2 (explaining prerequisites, process, and requirements for special handling).27goal to resolve expedited requests within five working days, this delay could still be the difference between an infringing work being publicly disseminated all over the world or not.24 Moreover, the ABA's members report it can take much longer than five days for the Copyright Office to issue a decision through special handling. Indeed, ABA practitioners find it can take three or more weeks for the expedited decision to issue, if not longer.Even if a copyright holder qualifies for special handling, in reality, this period of inaction can allow the infringement to spread far beyond the initial infringer and become impossible to track down and rectify. See A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001). As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, "the application approach avoids unnecessary delays in copyright infringement litigation, which could permit an infringing party to continue to profit from its wrongful acts," without "impairing the central goal of copyright registration." Cosmetic Ideas, 606 F.3d at 619­20.25 Importantly, it also eliminates the need for victims of copyright infringement to incur the often prohibitive additional24 See id. at 623.4. 25 See also Shira Perlmutter, Freeing Copyright fromFormalities, 13 CARDOZO ARTS & ENT. L.J. 565, 582 (1995) ("If the automatic attachment of rights may be reversed in whole or in part by inadvertent forfeitures of rights or remedies, the structure of incentives is seriously undercut.").28expense required to expedite Copyright Office review of an application.Moreover, it should not be overlooked that special handling requires an $855 fee, as opposed to the $55 required for standard registration.26 For many copyright holders, such as individual artists, photographers, and start-ups, this expense simply is not feasible. Moreover, this $855 sum could be compounded many times over if a copyright holder wants to sue on multiple works at the same time, or must continually file copyright applications due to the repeated infringement of her rights. Although copyright holders with limited resources have some hope of recovering their attorney's fees and costs incurred pursuing their claims should they ultimately prevail, see 17 U.S.C. § 504, they have no hope of recovering this steep special handling fee.27 The net26 See U.S. Copyright Office, Fees, https://copyright.gov/about/ fees.html (last visited August 29, 2018).27 Significantly, statutory damages and attorney's fees only would be available if the registration is made prior to the infringement, which is unlikely under the above circumstances, or within three months of publication. See 17 U.S.C. § 412; see also Pamela Samuelson & Tara Wheatland, Statutory Damages in Copyright Law: A Remedy in Need of Reform, 51 WM. & MARY L. REV. 439, 545­55 (2009) (noting that "`[l]ittle guy' authors . . . in theory, have the same strong legal rights as major copyright industry players, but . . . effectively do not have the means to obtain relief when their rights are infringed" under the statutory damages limitations).29result is that authors who cannot afford the special handling fees may be deprived of the ability to obtain recourse for infringement of their rights. These burdens are inconsistent with copyright law's constitutional goal of incentivizing the creation and dissemination of new works by giving authors a limited monopoly for a period of time, as leaving authors effectively unable to protect their rights disrupts copyright's incentive system.B. The Application Approach Better Accounts for Copyright Infringement's Short Statute of LimitationsThe Copyright Office's delay in deciding whether to issue or refuse to issue a certificate of registration also has consequences for meeting the short threeyear statute of limitations under the Copyright Act. The application approach reduces the likelihood that copyright claims will become statute of limitations barred in the time between filing an application, deposit copy, and fee with the Copyright Office and receiving a final decision.Copyright infringement claims are subject to a short, three-year statute of limitations. See 17 U.S.C. § 507(b). Under the certificate approach, the statute of limitations may run out while the copyright holder waits for a decision from the Copyright Office, thus forever foreclosing a meritorious claim. By contrast, the application approach avoids this abject unfairness by allowing copyright holders to file suit within the30statute of limitations while Copyright Office review is ongoing.This issue is even more significant in courts that calculate the limitations period from the time infringement begins (i.e., using the "injury rule"), rather than the time the author discovers it (i.e., the "discovery rule"). See Petrella v. Metro-GoldwynMayer, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1962, 1969 n.4 (2014) (noting that not all circuits have adopted the discovery rule for infringement claims). In such circumstances, time is truly of the essence, as an author must find and craft claims against the infringer, and potentially also seek and obtain the Copyright Office's decision on whether to issue a certificate of registration, all within the three-year limitations period. Without justification, the certificate approach maximizes the hardship these authors must endure and might forever foreclose a copyright holder from bringing suit.This statute of limitations issue is not idle conjecture. In Kregos v. Associated Press, the plaintiff filed his application with the Copyright Office in 1985, but due to an administrative delay, the Office did not issue a decision on that application until late 1988. 795 F. Supp. 1325, 1328 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). The district court held that the statute of limitations would not be tolled and barred plaintiff's copyright claim that fell outside of the three-year limitations period. Id. at311331.28 Copyright holders should not lose their property rights due to agency delay.C. The Application Approach Eliminates the Wasteful Re-Filing of Infringement Claims that Occurs Under the Certificate ApproachThe application approach also prevents the all-toofamiliar circumstance of a court dismissing a copyright holder's infringement suit for failure to have a certificate of registration or refusal in hand, only to have the same claim refiled once the Copyright Office issues a decision later on. For example, in Asche & Spencer Music, Inc. v. Principato-Young Entm't, Inc., 147 F. Supp. 3d 833, 838 (D. Minn. 2015), the court dismissed a copyright infringement claim after the copyright holder "obtained neither registration nor denial of registration from the Copyright Office" before filing suit, only for the plaintiff to file a new suit for infringement of the same works later, see Asche & Spencer Music, Inc. v. Principato-Young Entm't, Inc., No. 17 Civ. 150 (D. Minn. filed Jan. 18, 2017); see also28 See also Cosmetic Ideas, 606 F.3d at 620 (noting that "under the [certificate] approach, a plaintiff who applied for registration towards the end of the three-year period could see the statute of limitations expire during the time it took the Copyright Office to act on the application"); NIMMER, supra note 9, at § 7.16[B] [1][a][i] ("[G]iven . . . a three-year statute of limitations . . . the narrow [certificate] approach may indeed occasion complete inability to recover damages.").32Lumetrics, Inc. v. Blalock, 23 F. Supp. 3d 138 (W.D.N.Y. 2014) (dismissing copyright infringement complaint for failing to register all software allegedly infringed, only for plaintiff to refile listing registrations, see Lumetrics, Inc. v. Blalock, No. 6:14 Civ. 6322 (W.D.N.Y. filed June 11, 2014)); Greene v. Columbia Records/ Sony Music Entm't, No. 3 Civ. 4333, 2004 WL 3211771 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 1, 2004) (copyright infringement complaint dismissed where plaintiff had not yet received a decision, only for plaintiff to file suit based on infringement of same musical composition later, see Greene v. Columbia Records, Inc., No. 1:13 Civ. 6965 (S.D.N.Y. filed Sept. 30, 2013)). This is wasteful of both the parties' and the judiciary's resources and improperly places form over the substance of the claims, which is out of step with our overall judicial system.The process of filing a complaint, opposing a motion to dismiss, and later refiling a claim is both taxing on litigants--particularly those with limited means--and district courts. Indeed, the cost of filing additional court papers to oppose dismissal, or an amended or second complaint, can be very costly and deny copyright holders access to justice. Moreover, it simply "makes little sense to create a period of `legal limbo' in which suit is barred."29 The application approach alleviates this problem.Overall, the application approach minimizes the procedural barriers to obtaining adequate relief for29 NIMMER, supra note 9, at § 7.16[B][3][b][ii].33copyright infringement, and enables copyright holders to seek such redress in a timely, efficient manner.IV. THE APPLICATION APPROACH MINIMIZES PREJUDICE TO AUTHORS OF UNITED STATES WORKSSignificantly, the certificate approach further disadvantages authors of United States works in seeking relief in their own judicial system. In 1989, the United States became a signatory to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works ("Berne")--an international treaty that, among other things, seeks to lessen formalities under copyright law, such as by eliminating the need to affix copyright notices and obtain registrations for works as conditions to copyright protection. Indeed, Berne mandates that, for foreign works, the "enjoyment and the exercise of . . . [copy]rights shall not be subject to any formality." Berne Convention art. 5(2), Sept. 9, 1886 (Paris Text 1971), S. Treaty Doc. No. 99­27 [hereinafter Berne Convention].Yet, Berne permits its signatories to impose stricter requirements on authors within their own nation. Accordingly, United States law requires authors of United States works to comply with Subsection 411(a) before filing suit, while authors of foreign works seeking to sue in the United States face no such prerequisite. See 17 U.S.C. § 411(a) (applying only to "United States work[s]"); id. § 101 (defining "United States work"). This has resulted in a34situation where authors of foreign works have faster and cheaper access to United States courts than authors of United States works. See Berne Convention art. 5(3).The application approach reduces the burden of this registration formality, and lessens discrimination against the owners of copyrights in United States works. If the certificate approach is followed, authors of United States works must submit registration materials to the Copyright Office, and also wait for the Register's decision before they can enforce their copyrights against infringers. As noted above, this can take months if not years. It is hard to see the logic in interpreting the term "registration" in a way that exacerbates the already significant impediment on the ability of authors of United States works to enforce their rights. Therefore, the ABA supports the application approach as a way of better protecting authors of United States works and facilitating the swift resolution of their copyright claims.35CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the ABA respectfully requests that the Court reverse the Eleventh Circuit's holding below.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: Dale M.

FLORIDA SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO UNDERMINE ATKINS V. VIRGINIA BY ERECTING A TEST THAT PREVENTS ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF A DEFENDANT'S MENTAL RETARDATION.A. The Rights of Defendants with Mental Retardation Warrant the Utmost Constitutional Protection.In Atkins, the Court held that the execution of defendants with mental retardation violated the Eighth Amendment and that "the Constitution `places a substantive restriction on the State's power to take the life' of a mentally retarded offender." 536 U.S. at 321 (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 405 (1986)). This holding was based on a "national consensus" against the execution of these defendants, which provided "powerful evidence that today our society views mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal." Id. at 316. In addition, the Court was "not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty." Id. at 321. As the Court9explained, "[i]f the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution." Id. at 319. And, "the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally culpable" make it less likely that the possibility of execution will act as a deterrent. Id. at 320.In addition, the Court stated that the national consensus "suggests that some characteristics of mental retardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards." Id. at 317. These characteristics, such as "disabilities in the areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses," moreover, "can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants." Id. at 306-07.The ABA respectfully asserts that any defendant claiming mental retardation should be entitled to establish "the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender," id. at 319, pursuant to a constitutionally appropriate test that evaluates both the defendant's level of intellectual functioning and his or her conceptual, social and practical adaptive skills. As is well established in the legal literature and by the ABA's work in this field, defendants with mental retardation may:· mask their disability, making it difficult for counsel to realize that the client is an individual with mental retardation;1414 See, e.g., ABA Guidelines, Guideline 10.5 ("Relationship with the Client"), Commentary at 1009 n.183 (overcoming barriers to10 · find it difficult to recall information that willaid counsel, or have difficulty answering openended questions;15· act as if they understand their attorneys, adapt responses in favor of what they believe attorneys want them to say, or provide answers that are unrelated to the actual facts of the crime;16 andcommunication and establishing rapport with defendant are critical to effective communication and to obtain vital information, an important example of which is the fact that the client is mentally retarded ­ a fact that the client may conceal with great skill, but one which counsel absolutely must know) (citing James W. Ellis & Ruth A. Luckasson, Mentally Retarded Criminal Defendants, 53 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 414, 430-31 (1985) and Atkins, 536 U.S. at 321). See also Denis W. Keyes et al., Mitigating Mental Retardation in Capital Cases: Finding the "Invisible" Defendant, 22 MENTAL & PHYSICAL DISABILITIES L. REP. 529, 531 (1998); Richard J. Bonnie, The Competency of Defendants with Mental Retardation to Assist in Their Own Defense, in THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND MENTAL RETARDATION 97, 99-100 (Ronald W. Conley, et al., eds., 1992).15 See Ellis & Luckasson, supra note 14, at 428-29. ("Because few mentally retarded people are able to determine what information might have legal significance for their case, spontaneous memory and cursory questioning cannot reliably ascertain all the facts."); see also Robert Perske, UNEQUAL JUSTICE 15-16 (1991).16 See Ellis & Luckasson, supra note 14, at 428-29. ("Clients with mental retardation tend to act as though they understand their attorneys when they do not, and to bias their responses in favor of what they believe their attorneys want them to say in the direction of concrete, though inaccurate, responses.").11· be unable to monitor defense counsel's performance or involve themselves in the defense strategy, as they do not comprehend the criminal justice process.17Florida's test does not provide adequate protection against any of these risks to the procedural protections of our capital jurisprudence or to "the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants." Id. at 306-07. As discussed below, Florida's assumption that a defendant with severe social, cognitive, or behavioral impairments is capable of meaningfully participating in his or her defense solely because he or she has an IQ test result above 70 is scientifically unjustifiable and results in an arbitrary and capricious application of the death penalty.B. Florida's Test Undermines Atkins.In Atkins, the Court left to the "[s]tates the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction" on execution of those who suffer from mental retardation. 536 U.S. at 317. The Court, however, did not suggest that states could undermine Atkins through the use of tests that do not comport with scientific consensus, and accordingly, do not afford the protection of the Eighth Amendment to17 See Richard J. Bonnie, The Competence of Criminal Defendants with Mental Retardation to Participate in Their Own Defense, 81 J. CRIM. L. & CRIMINOLOGY 419, 423 (1990) ("fairness of adjudication in most cases involving defendants with mental retardation depends largely on the ability and inclination of the attorney to recognize and to compensate for the client's limitations" and "the risks of inadequate representation are magnified when the client has mental retardation . . . because the client is in no position to monitor the attorney's performance even in a superficial way").12the full range of individuals with mental retardation. Untethered from scientifically accepted definitions of mental retardation, Florida's test results in individuals with mental retardation in Florida being excluded from constitutional protection properly afforded to them in other jurisdictions.1. Florida's Test Ignores Atkins' Guidance on the Use of Scientifically Accepted Definitions of Mental Retardation.Implicit in the Court's delegation to the states was the Court's guidance that "[t]he statutory definitions of mental retardation are not identical, but generally conform to the clinical definitions set forth [by the AAMR (now the AAIDD) and the APA]." Id. at 317 n.22 (citing id. at 309 n.3). These "clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction . . . ." Id. at 318.In the eleven years since Atkins, the vast majority of states have implemented rules that are consistent with the definitions used by mental disability professionals in considering a defendant's intellectual functioning. Many states, for example, allow courts to consider the standard margin of error or specific facts about the administration and scoring of IQ tests.18 A18 For example, the Supreme Court of Tennessee has held that a defendant's raw IQ test scores are not to be treated at "face value" and has permitted defendants to introduce evidence regarding these scores, including margins of error. See Coleman v. State, 341 S.W.3d 221, 242, 247 (Tenn. 2011). See also State v. Pruitt, 2013 WL 5530772, at *17 (Tenn. 2013) (stating that experts may testify to the AAIDD recognized "challenges to the reliability and validity of I.Q. test scores, among which are the13number of other states have recognized that a conclusion regarding whether an individual has mental retardation requires a multi-faceted analysis.19 As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated in Commonwealth v. Miller, 888 A.2d 624, 631 (Pa. 2005), "[i]t is the interaction between limited intellectual functioning and deficiencies in adaptive skills that establish mental retardation."In contrast, Florida's test relies only on a raw IQ score and ignores both the standard margin of error and the relevant scientific evidence of mental retardation (such as adaptive skills) that are includedstandard error of measurement, the Flynn Effect, and the practice effect."). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Indiana considered both margins of error associated with a defendant's tests and expert testimony regarding the test's administration. State v. Pruitt, 834 N.E.2d 90, 104-06 (Ind. 2005). Arizona's statutory definition of mental retardation similarly takes into account the "margin of error for the test administered." Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-753(K)(5).19 See, e.g., Rogers v. State, 653 S.E.2d 31, 35 (Ga. 2007) (stating that "Georgia's statutory definition of mental retardation is consistent with the clinical definitions relied upon in Atkins" and that "there are no `hypertechnical' requirements that a defendant have certain test scores in order to be found mentally retarded"); Goodwin v. State, 191 S.W.3d 20, 30 (Mo. 2006) (applying definition of mental retardation from DSM-IV in evaluating whether defendant had "significantly subaverage intellectual functioning"); Commonwealth v. Miller, 888 A.2d 624, 629-32 (Pa. 2005) (consistent with the AAIDD and APA definitions, court would "not adopt a cutoff IQ score for determining mental retardation in Pennsylvania, since it is the interaction between limited intellectual functioning and deficiencies in adaptive skills that establish mental retardation"); State v. Lott, 779 N.E.2d 1011, 1014 (Ohio 2002) (an IQ test is "one of the many factors that need to be considered" and alone is "not sufficient to make a final determination on the issue [of mental retardation]").14in the definitions adopted by mental disability organizations. With no foundation in scientifically recognized definitions, Florida's rigid test necessarily excludes individuals with mental retardation whom the Court expressly intended to receive constitutional protection.This type of nullification has been rejected by this Court, which has held that this Court's decisions "can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators . . . nor nullified indirectly . . . through evasive schemes . . . ." Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 17, 18 (1958). See also Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is.").2. By Preventing Accurate Assessmentof a Defendant's Mental Retardation,Florida's Test Results in theArbitraryandCapriciousImposition of Death Sentences.Florida's failure to adopt a scientifically-based definition of mental retardation means that the same individual could be eligible for the death penalty in Florida, but not in another state that defines mental retardation in a scientifically valid manner.Indeed, under Florida's test, the courts below were foreclosed from considering both Mr. Hall's IQ score as a range, based on the standard error of measurement, and his deficits in adaptive behavior, as set out in the definitions of the AAIDD and APA. Instead, they were required to consider only whether Mr. Hall's IQ score was below a bright-line cut-off of 70. See Hall v. State, 109 So.3d 704, 719-20 (Fla. 2012) (Perry, J.,15dissenting).20 In contrast, in State v. Gumm, the Court of Appeals of Ohio affirmed the trial court's determination that a defendant successfully established mental retardation through expert evidence concerning the standard error of measurement, where the defendant had IQ test scores ranging between 67 and 79. 864 N.E.2d 133, 136-40 (Ohio Ct. App. 2006).21While Atkins left the states leeway in determining mental retardation, Florida's rigid and unscientific test is not consistent with Atkins, nor is it consistent with basic notions of fairness. See Pruitt v. State, 834 N.E.2d 90, 108 (Ind. 2005) ("Although Atkins recognized the possibility of varying state standards of mental retardation, the grounding of the prohibition in the Federal Constitution implies that there must be at least a nationwide minimum. The Eighth Amendment must have the same content in all United States jurisdictions."); Lois A. Weithorn, Conceptual Hurdles to the Application of Atkins v. Virginia, 59 HASTINGS L.J. 1203, 1230 (2008) ("Rigid rules that result in arbitrary decisions--such as Florida's categorical refusal to consider the standard error of measurement-promote unfairness and undercut the public's trust in our system of justice."); cf. Kennedy v.20 See also ABA, Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems: The Florida Death Penalty Assessment Report, ABA DEATH PENALTY DUE PROCESS REVIEW PROJECT 368 (Sept. 2006), available at http://www.americanbar.org/content /dam/aba/migrated/moratorium/assessmentproject/florida/report .authcheckdam.pdf.21 See also ABA, Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems: The Ohio Death Penalty Assessment Report, ABA DEATH PENALTY DUE PROCESS REVIEW PROJECT 37172 (Sept. 2007), available at http://www.americanbar.org/ content/dam/aba/administrative/death_penalty_moratorium/ohi o_chapter13.authcheckdam.pdf.16 Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 447 (2008) (discussing the need to avoid "arbitrary and capricious application" of the death penalty).This Court's holding in Atkins is clear--the execution of an individual with mental retardation violates the Eighth Amendment. 536 U.S. at 321. As results from the ABA's Death Penalty Due Process Review Project--and this case--have shown, however, Atkins' holding has not guaranteed that individuals with mental retardation will not unlawfully be found eligible for the death penalty when a state's definition of mental retardation is not in accord with scientific understanding of mental retardation.22 In disregarding Atkins' guidance concerning the definitions used by recognized mental disability organizations in determining whether an offender has mental retardation, Florida has erected a test that prevents accurate assessment and poses the graveand unacceptablerisk that individuals with mental retardation will be unconstitutionally executed. This, the ABA asserts, results in an arbitrary and capricious application of the death penalty that denies the constitutional protection mandated by Atkins for all defendants with mental retardation.22 See ABA, Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems: The Florida Death Penalty Assessment Report, supra note 20.17 CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, Amicus Curiae the American Bar Association respectfully submits that the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court should be reversed.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: JOHN A.

 I. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST TRANSGENDER STUDENTS VIOLATES OUR NA-TIONAL COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING EQUAL ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND FULL PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC LIFE Title IX reflects a longstanding national commitment to eliminating sex discrimination in education and promoting individual development and professional achievement. The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the statute to further those goals, which inform the proper resolution of this case. Gloucester's policy of barring transgender students from the bathrooms assigned to their gender is discrimination on the basis of sex because it treats transgender students differently7Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 16 of 39Total Pages:(16 of 40)based on stereotypical notions of how a person's gender identity and presentation ought to conform to his or her sex assigned at birth. When transgender students are denied access to the full complement of school services and facilities, on equal footing with their peers, they are discriminated against in education on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX. That discrimination not only impairs their rights to educational opportunity, but also gravely threatens their ability to participate fully as adults in the professional, social, and civic life of the country.The Supreme Court's anti-discrimination jurisprudence has long stood against such invidious forms of exclusion. The Court has recognized that both the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and federal antidiscrimination statutes have as a primary purpose the guarantee of "equal participation in [the] civic life" of the community. Holland v. Illinois, 493 U.S. 474, 489 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring). Courts have also recognized that federal antidiscrimination statutes reflect a national commitment to rooting out historical prejudices and stigmatizing stereotypes that impede full participation in public life by requiring that all persons be treated on the basis of their individual qualities, not based on pre-conceived notions connected to race, sex, and other characteristics that have historically led to invidious discrimination.Gloucester's policy is contrary to these fundamental principles.8Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 17 of 39Total Pages:(17 of 40)A. Title IX Promotes Equality In Education To Foster Full Participation In The Civic Life Of The Community And To Uproot Stigmatizing, Sex-Based StereotypesTitle IX provides that "[n]o person ... shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).The push for Title IX grew out of a 1970 hearing on sex discrimination in education held by the House Special Subcommittee on Education. See Discrimination Against Women: Hearings on § 805 of H.R. 16098 Before the Spec. Subcomm. on Educ. of the H. Comm. on Educ. & Labor, 91st Cong. (1970). Members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights testified to the persistence of sex discrimination and how it deprives individuals of "genuinely equal opportunity" to realize "full individual potential" and to "ma[ke] the[] maximum possible contribution to improving the quality of life in this Nation." Id. at 662. The President's Task Force on Women's Rights and Responsibilities, whose report was entered into the Congressional Record, likewise concluded that sex discrimination was fundamentally "one of the most damaging injustices" because it "contribut[es] to a second class self image." 117 Cong. Rec. 30,406 (1971).Senator Birch Bayh, sponsor of the legislation that would eventually be enacted as Title IX, recognized the persistence of "corrosive and unjustified discrim-9Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 18 of 39Total Pages:(18 of 40)ination" in the "American educational system." 118 Cong. Rec. 5,803 (1972). He focused on the link between unequal educational opportunities and discrimination in the professional world: "The field of education is just one of many areas where differential treatment ... has been documented but because education provides access to jobs and financial security, discrimination here is doubly destructive." 118 Cong. Rec. at 5,806-5,807.Consistent with the statute's broad purpose, the Supreme Court has liberally construed Title IX's anti-discrimination mandate. Early on, the Court recognized that the statute prohibits outright refusal to admit a student to an educational program on the basis of sex. See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 680 (1979). Shortly thereafter, the Court concluded that, even though the statute "does not expressly include ... employees [in] its scope, ... employment discrimination comes within the prohibition of Title IX." North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. 512, 530 (1982). As the Court explained, "[t]here is no doubt that if we are to give Title IX the scope that its origins dictate, we must accord it a sweep as broad as its language." Id. at 522 (alteration and quotation marks omitted).Similarly, the Supreme Court has recognized that school practices that have the effect of deterring students from attending school or fully participating in school life may constitute unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex. In Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274 (1998), and Davis v. Mon-10Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 19 of 39Total Pages:(19 of 40)roe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999), the Court concluded that sexual harassment by teachers or students may amount to unlawful discrimination if not stopped by school administrators. In reaching this conclusion, the Court paid attention to the detrimental psychological and pedagogical effects that sexual harassment can have on students, leading students to forsake or abandon their studies. See Davis, 526 U.S. at 634 (documenting how the victim of harassment was "unable to concentrate on her studies" and had written a suicide note); Gebser, 524 U.S. at 292.The Supreme Court's expansive approach to evaluating discrimination under Title IX faithfully implements the statute's broad purpose of eliminating genderbased barriers to full participation in public life--whether they be explicit sexbased classifications or practices rooted in unexamined assumptions about how men and women should behave. And it also reflects the Court's recognition that "stigmatizing injury often caused by ... discrimination ... [is] no doubt ... one of the most serious consequences of discriminatory government action." Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 755 (1984). Where, as here, a school adopts an official policy that causes a "stigmatizing injury," id., thereby limiting a student's access to the educational opportunities provided to others, it effects profound harms--harms that Title IX was intended to prevent.11Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 20 of 39Total Pages:(20 of 40)B. School Policies That Prevent Transgender Students From Accessing Facilities Consistent With Their Gender Identity Constitute Sex Discrimination In Violation Of Title IXDiscrimination against transgender students because they are transgender violates Title IX because it treats students differently based on an inherently sexbased characteristic and relies on stereotypical assumptions based on their birth sex. Gloucester's policy does just that--it forbids transgender boys from using the same bathroom as other boys because doing so conflicts with preconceived or stereotypical notions of how a person identified as female at birth should identify and behave. Gloucester's practice, therefore, discriminates based on sex stereotypes-- a type of discrimination that the Supreme Court has long recognized is unlawful. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 251 (1989) (plurality op.) ("[W]e are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group[.]"), superseded by statute on other grounds, 105 Stat. 1075 (1991).The record in this case reveals that a major motivating factor for Gloucester's bathroom policy was a desire to treat G.G. as though his gender corresponded to his birth-assigned sex. At meetings soliciting comments on the proposal, community members repeatedly and pointedly referred to G.G. as a "girl" or a "young lady." JA-16; JA-18. They speculated that permitting G.G. to use the boys' bathroom would lead to sexual assault. JA-16. And they surmised that absent this pol-12Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 21 of 39Total Pages:(21 of 40)icy, non-transgender male students would masquerade as females to gain access to the girls' restroom. JA-16.Gloucester's policy--which, notably, reflected an about-face from prior practice under which G.G. used the boys' bathroom without incident--reflects and gives effect to stereotyped views about students who do not express a gender identity in conformance with their birth-assigned sex. And it is rooted in the expectation that students' gender identities will conform to their birth-assigned sex--a "stereotypical notion[]" that "deprives persons of their individual dignity." Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 625 (1984). The commenters presumed, for example, that all who are identified as female at birth must have a female gender identity, and that birth-assigned male students are inclined to act in a sexually predatory manner. These reductive beliefs "ratify and reinforce prejudicial views" about transgender students. J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 140 (1994). Preventing transgender students from using bathrooms based on their gender identity thus indulges overbroad generalizations about how adolescents assigned at birth to one sex pose either a danger or temptation to those assigned to the other sex. And that violates the Supreme Court's unwavering principle that "[s]tate actors controlling gates to opportunity ... may not exclude qualified individuals based on `fixed notions concerning ... males and females.'" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 541 (1996).13Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 22 of 39Total Pages:(22 of 40)Moreover, this stereotyping imposes a stigma on transgender students-- made plain by the facts of this case. J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 139 n.11. As a boy who both identifies as male and displays outwardly male characteristics like facial hair, G.G. would suffer stigma if he used the girl's bathroom, just as would any other boy. Indeed, G.G. reports that female-identifying students are uncomfortable with his presence in the female restroom. G.G. feels similarly stigmatized if he is required to use a bathroom not otherwise used by his fellow students, such as the one in the nurse's office. The requirement that G.G.--solely because he is transgender--use a restroom not customarily used by any other student is a profound statement of his exclusion from the school community. Cf. McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Educ., 339 U.S. 637, 640-643 (1950) (requirement that black university students sit in a designated row of seats in the classrooms, use separate desks in the library, and eat at special tables in the cafeteria constituted impermissible racial discrimination).The cumulative effect of sex-based stereotyping and stigmatization resulting from Gloucester's policy profoundly harms transgender students, in many cases leading them to reduce or abandon their participation in school life. A comprehensive study of the school experiences of transgender and non-gender-conforming youth in Wisconsin revealed that the majority of students and parents reported that "gender neutral bathrooms ... were not available, or available, yet inconvenient,14Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 23 of 39Total Pages:(23 of 40)making navigation of their daily life in school even more challenging." See Gattis & McKinnon, School Experiences of Transgender & Gender Non-Conforming Students in Wisconsin, Madison 9 (2015). The study found that it was common for children in these circumstances to forgo using the restroom altogether. Id. G.G. is one such student. He experienced distress from using bathrooms that did not reflect his male identity, and stigma when he attempted to use a unisex restroom that "set[] him apart from his peers." JA-19. Consequently, G.G. avoided using school bathrooms altogether and developed multiple urinary tract infections. Id.Such physical harms are only one manifestation of the injuries that discriminatory policies wreak on transgender school-age children. These students also suffer psychological harm from institutionally-sanctioned discrimination and stigma. JA-18-19. Forty-seven percent of transgender students reported skipping school at least once in the past month because they felt unsafe. Dep't of Psychology, UCLA, Transgender Students & School. The Wisconsin study of transgender school-aged youth concluded that these students were "more than five times more likely to have attempted suicide" than their peers. See Gattis & McKinnon, supra, at 4. Conversely, those transgender students who are not stigmatized and are included fully in the school community enjoy improved educational outcomes. See Greytak et al., Gay, Lesbian & Straight Educ. Network, Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in our Nation's Schools (2009). Indeed, a recent15Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 24 of 39Total Pages:(24 of 40)study documented how mere access to gender-appropriate bathrooms increases transgender students' general sense of safety in the school environment, selfesteem, and academic performance. See Wernick et al., Gender Identity Disparities in Bathroom Safety & Wellbeing Among High School Students, J. Youth & Adolescence (forthcoming 2017) (manuscript at 14-15) (on file with amicus). These studies confirm that Gloucester's bathroom policy creates the exact "second class self image" in transgender students that Title IX was enacted to eradicate. 117 Cong. Rec. at 30,406.A policy requiring transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding to their birth-assigned sex inevitably discourages those students from fully participating in school life--indeed, from attending school at all, when attendance comes at the cost of physical pain and stigmatization. Such a policy is impermissible discrimination because it is an "overt, physical deprivation of access to school resources," or, at the least, a policy that "successfully prevent[s] ... students from using a particular school resource." Davis, 526 U.S. at 650-651. And this inevitably has downstream effects: Excluding transgender students from educational opportunities will reduce their participation in the professional world and the greater community, further undermining the objectives of Title IX. See 118 Cong. Rec. at 5,806-5,807.16Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 25 of 39Total Pages:(25 of 40)It may be true that Congress did not have discrimination against transgender students in mind when it passed Title IX. But even if that was "assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title [IX] ... statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil [they were passed to combat] to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed." Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 77, 79-80 (1998). Because Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, that prohibition "must extend to [sex-based] harassment of any kind that meets the statutory requirements." Id.C. The Supreme Court Has Long Recognized The Importance Of Rooting Out Discrimination That Excludes Full Participation In The Civic Life Of This CountryApplying Title IX to prevent sex-based discrimination against transgender students is also consonant with the larger body of anti-discrimination jurisprudence.The Supreme Court has long recognized that both the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and federal anti-discrimination statutes have as a primary purpose the guarantee of "equal participation in [the] civic life" of the community. Holland, 493 U.S. at 489 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also Washington v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 467 (1982) ("The Equal Protection17Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 26 of 39Total Pages:(26 of 40)Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees racial minorities the right to full participation in the political life of the community."); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 300 (1964) (Congress enacted Title II of the Civil Rights Act in response to evidence that discrimination discourages targeted groups from traveling, living, and working in areas where such practices occur).The Supreme Court has expressed particular concern about excluding people from the social web of our Nation in cases involving discrimination in public education. See Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954). The Court has explained that "education has a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society," and stands out from other government services because of "the importance of education in maintaining our basic institutions." Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221 (1982). Schools "prepar[e] ... individuals for participation as citizens." Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 76 (1979). Laws that prevent certain students from obtaining an education, therefore, not only exclude those students from the school community, but also deny those students the tools needed to become fully contributing members of the larger community. Because of the special role of education, our Nation bears "significant social costs" when students are denied access to education, and thereby "denied the means to absorb the values and skills upon which our social order rests." Plyler, 457 U.S. at 221; see also Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 221 (1972) ("[E]ducation is necessary to prepare citizens to18Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 27 of 39Total Pages:(27 of 40)participate effectively and intelligently in our open political system if we are to preserve freedom and independence.").In Virginia, for example, the Supreme Court stressed the deleterious effect of historical attitudes toward women in education that had resulted in fewer opportunities being offered to women. 518 U.S. at 534-546; see also Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 729-731 (1982) (state's "policy of excluding males [from state-supported nursing school] tends to perpetuate the stereotyped view of nursing as an exclusively woman's job"). As the Court emphasized, "[s]tate actors controlling gates to opportunity ... may not exclude qualified individuals based on `fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females.'" Virginia, 518 U.S. at 541.Finally, the Supreme Court has been attentive to the harmful effects that discrimination has on the individual, as well as the individual's opportunity to contribute to society at large. When individuals are classified and treated based on assumptions about their race, sex, or other irrelevant markers, the Court has found that they are deprived of their "individual dignity" and autonomy. Roberts, 468 U.S. at 625 ("[D]iscrimination based on archaic and overbroad assumptions about the relative needs and capacities of the sexes forces individuals to labor under stereotypical notions that often bear no relationship to their actual abilities."). When governmental actors act in reliance on racial or gender stereotypes, "they ratify and19Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 28 of 39Total Pages:(28 of 40)reinforce prejudicial views of the relative abilities" of the groups, J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 140, creating a "stigma or dishonor" that denies the equal protection of the law, Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991). See also J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 139 n.11 ("[S]tate actors [must] look beyond the surface before making judgments about people that are likely to stigmatize as well as to perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination.").These fundamental principles of anti-discrimination law are entirely consistent with interpreting Title IX to guarantee transgender students the right to use the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity. That interpretation frees transgender students from differential treatment and stereotypes that would deny them equal access to educational opportunities, and thus gives them an equal opportunity to participate in the civic life of the community. II. EQUAL ACCESS FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE TO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTU-NITIES IS CRITICAL TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO PROFESSIONAL LIFE AND HELPING THE LEGAL PROFESSION BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY The deleterious effects of exclusion in schools follow both transgender and non-transgender students into their adult lives, and harm as well the broader society in which they live. Moreover, these effects hamper the legal profession in its efforts to provide empathetic representation to clients from all backgrounds and render justice that accounts for the full breadth of the community's experiences.20Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 29 of 39Total Pages:(29 of 40)A. The Supreme Court's Jurisprudence Emphasizes The Role Of An Inclusive Educational Community In Improving Educational And Professional Outcomes For All Students And In Making The Legal System More EffectiveThe Supreme Court has long recognized that fostering inclusiveness and diversity are signal achievements of our Nation's public schools, and that our Nation has a strong commitment to ensuring that all students enjoy the educational benefits that follow from interacting with classmates of varied experiences. In the context of race-conscious admission programs at public universities, for instance, the Court noted that bringing together students from disparate backgrounds and with different experiences fosters a "robust exchange of ideas [and] exposure to differing cultures." Fisher v. University of Tex. at Austin, 136 S. Ct. 2198, 2211 (2016). By encouraging such exchange, schools may directly "promote[] learning outcomes." Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 330 (2003).Ensuring that all students are included in the school community can also teach students valuable lessons about tolerance and respect. Racially integrated classrooms, for example, "promote[] cross-racial understanding, help[] to break down racial stereotypes, and enable[] students to better understand persons of different races." Fisher, 136 S. Ct. at 2210 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330). Stated more generally, students who are exposed to those with different experiences are more likely to appreciate and respect those differences and to gain an understanding about which differences matter--and which do not.21Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 30 of 39Total Pages:(30 of 40)Just as the Supreme Court has recognized the role of schools in exposing students to diversity and teaching inclusion, it has long emphasized the role of schools in strengthening the fabric of civil society. In the Establishment Clause context, Justice Frankfurter observed that public schools are "[d]esigned to serve as perhaps the most powerful agency for promoting cohesion among a heterogeneous democratic people." Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Educ., 333 U.S. 203, 216 (1948) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also id. at 231 (calling schools "at once the symbol of our democracy and the most pervasive means for promoting our common destiny"). In the decades since, the Court has emphasized, repeatedly and emphatically, that schools are the crucible in which good citizenship and common identity are forged. See, e.g., School Dist. of Abington Twp. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 241-242 (1963) ("[T]he public schools serve a uniquely public function: the training of American citizens in an atmosphere free of parochial, divisive, or separatist influences of any sort--an atmosphere in which children may assimilate a heritage common to all American groups and religions.") (Brennan, J., concurring); Ambach, 441 U.S. at 76; Plyler, 457 U.S. at 221; Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 782 (2007) (Kennedy, J., concurring) ("The Nation's schools strive to teach that our strength comes from people of different races, creeds, and cultures uniting in commitment to the freedom of all."). Threaded together with the Court's emphasis on the benefits of diversity22Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 31 of 39Total Pages:(31 of 40)and inclusion, this line of jurisprudence sends a clear message: The school system remains our most powerful tool both for teaching respect for others' differences and for teaching that the embrace of differences is what gives our Nation its singular identity.Just as the Supreme Court has underscored the importance of diversity and inclusion within the schoolhouse, so too has it observed that the benefits of diversity and inclusion in schools do not end when a student's formal education does. Rather, the lessons learned at a formative age play a critical role in students' ability to succeed as they navigate adulthood. Specifically, the Court has observed that "student body diversity ... better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society." Fisher, 136 S. Ct. at 2210 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330). "These benefits are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints." Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330; see also id. at 331 (emphasizing importance of diversity at military academies and within officer corps).Of particular interest to the ABA, the benefits of diversity and inclusion in education are apparent in the context of the legal profession. Lawyers serve as zealous advocates for a wide variety of clients. Policies that promote inclusion in education--from the elementary level through law school--ensure that the legal23Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 32 of 39Total Pages:(32 of 40)profession is open to all and improve the ability of lawyers to understand and serve the interests of those with different experiences. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 332 ("[L]aw schools `cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals and institutions with which the law interacts.'" (quoting Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 634 (1950))). Similarly, inclusive policies can help students belonging to otherwise marginalized groups set their academic sights higher, thus improving the flow through the educational pipeline to the legal profession. See Rhode & Ricca, Diversity in the Legal Profession: Perspectives from Managing Partners & General Counsel, 83 Fordham L. Rev. 2483, 2492-2493 (2015) (noting that increasing intake of diverse groups of law students improves diversity in the legal profession).Diversity among members of the legal profession improves the ability of the profession to serve its clients. A bar that draws from a broad cross-section of the community "is the richer for the diversity of background and experience of its participants. It is the poorer, in terms of evaluating what is at stake and the impact of its judgments, if its members ... are all cast from the same mold." Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, The Supreme Court: A Place for Women, 32 Sw. U. L. Rev. 189, 190 (2003); see also ABA Presidential Initiative Comm'n on Diversity, Diversity in the Legal Profession: The Next Steps 5 (2010) ("[A] diverse legal profession is more just, productive and intelligent because diversity, both cognitive and cultural, often leads to better questions, analyses, solutions, and processes.").24Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 33 of 39Total Pages:(33 of 40)The same holds true for the judiciary; an inclusive bench both signals to younger lawyers (and would-be lawyers) that the profession is open to all and im-proves the ability of all judges to understand litigants whose experiences may not mirror their own. See, e.g., Chen, The Judiciary, Diversity, & Justice for All, 91 Calif. L. Rev. 1109, 1117 (2003); Weinberg & Nielsen, Examining Empathy: Dis-crimination, Experience, & Judicial Decisionmaking, 85 S. Cal. L. Rev. 313, 347348 (2012). Indeed, several members of the Supreme Court have commented on the value that the diverse backgrounds of its Justices have brought to the Court's decisions. Writing about Justice Marshall, Justice O'Connor said thatAlthough all of us come to the court with our own personal histories and experiences, Justice Marshall brought a special perspective.... Justice Marshall imparted not only his legal acumen but also his life experiences, constantly pushing and prodding us to respond not only to the persuasiveness of legal argument but also to the power of moral truth. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Thurgood Marshall: The Influence of a Raconteur,44 Stan. L. Rev. 1217, 1217 (1992). Similarly, during his confirmation hearings, Justice Alito noted that his experiences as the son of immigrants have helped to shape how he understands cases in which plaintiffs allege discrimination based ontheir ethnic background, religion, gender, or disability. See Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to Be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States: Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary,109th Cong. 475 (2006). 25Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 34 of 39Total Pages:(34 of 40)The path from inclusive school policies leads to a visibly open and effective justice system. Students whose identities are embraced at school are more likely to succeed there and to move on to higher education, see supra pp. 14-15, and those who see respect modeled are more likely to act with respect themselves. When these people join the bar (or the bench), they then are better equipped to see past stereotypes and to understand how clients' experiences shape their legal needs.B. The Harm Caused By Excluding Transgender Students In Educational Programs Runs Counter To Decades Of The Supreme Court's Jurisprudence On The Role Of Public Schools In SocietyThe lessons for this case from the Supreme Court's decades of equality jurisprudence are clear: Excluding transgender students from the full scope of the school community harms both those students and their classmates by undercutting the mission of the school system and by hindering students as they enter the workforce. The harm to transgender students is discussed in more detail above, see supra pp. 12-16, but it bears repeating that exclusion and division of those students from other members of the student body impair their education--in terms of their academic achievement, educational aspirations, and sense of safety at school. That exclusion harms the entire school community as well. Rather than reaping the benefits of diversity and inclusion, students are deprived of the full expression of their peers' points of view and of the opportunity to break down stereotypes. And, counter to the mission of schools as a critical force in teaching tolerance, under-26Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 35 of 39Total Pages:(35 of 40)standing, and respect, the public differential treatment of certain students based on gender stereotyping can serve to reinforce prejudices inconsistent with our Nation's commitment to equality.These negative effects only compound over time, entrenching disadvantages faced by transgender people in the workplace and depriving non-transgender people of the skills they need to successfully navigate diverse workplace relationships. Just as racial diversity enables workers to bridge cultural gaps, so too does inclusion of openly transgender people allow workers to better understand transgender and gender-nonconforming people that they encounter in their professional lives.This holds true in the legal profession as well. Transgender students who are not fully included in their school communities are less likely to pursue postsecondary education, including law school, see Greytak et al., supra, at 26-27, depriving the legal profession of a critical voice capable of speaking up for those marginalized for their gender. Similarly, other attorneys will be less exposed to-- and thus less understanding of--transgender or gender-nonconforming people and the issues they face, leaving them less equipped to represent clients facing these problems or to fully understand the impact of the claims these clients ask them to pursue.The need for empathic representation is particularly strong in the transgender community, as many transgender people have experienced discrimina-27Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 36 of 39Total Pages:(36 of 40)tion and, in turn, expect hostility from the legal system (and even from their lawyers). See Transgender Law Ctr., Tips for Lawyers Working with Transgender Clients & Coworkers (2016) (noting that transgender clients "are not fundamentally different from non-transgender clients" but that their experiences with discrimination--possibly leading to "war[iness] about opening up to a lawyer"--can be a barrier to effective representation, even where the representation is not about the client's transgender status); National Ctr. for Lesbian Rights, Tips for Legal Advocates Working with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender Clients (2013) ("Often, LGBT people will assume that a lawyer's office is unfriendly to LGBT people until he or she receives a clear indication otherwise."). But by fostering understanding and respect for transgender and gender-nonconforming people from an early age, schools can ensure that the legal system is better prepared to handle the needs of these clients--both through the inclusion of more transgender people in law schools and the broader profession and through the fostering of a bar better able to see past stereotypes.28Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 37 of 39Total Pages:(37 of 40)CONCLUSION The judgment of the district court should be reversed.Of Counsel: BRUCE M.

Certain Constitutional Claims Can Be Raised Only in State Post-Conviction Proceedings, and Many Death Row Inmates Currently Have No Lawyer to Assist Them with Such Claims.A.For certain claims, state collateral review is theequivalent of direct appeal.Because he was represented by his trialappeal, Exzavious Gibson was barred fromcounselraisingonhisdirectSixthAmendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim until statecollateral review. See Berry v. State, 422 S.E.2d 861, 863 (Ga.1992). tit. 22,Such procedural § 1089(D)(4)(b)bars are common. (1-2). Indeed, asSee, e.g., Okla. Stat. a practical matter, itis virtually always the case that ineffective assistance ofcounsel claims cannot be raised until collateral review. As thisCourt hasopportunityrecognized, "fiJnexists for the fullgeneral,and fairno . . .litigationmeaningfulof a habeaspetitioner's ineffective-assistance claims at trial and on directreview," Kimmelman, review will frequently477 U.S. at be the only378 n.3, and "collateral means through which anaccused canexplained ineffectuate the right to counsel."United States v. Galloway, 56 F.3dJd. at 378.1239 (10thAsCir.1995)brought because(enon "[a]banc),direct factualineffective assistance of counsel claimsappeal "are presumptively dismissible" record must be developed." Jd. at 1240.Other importantinvestigation outsideconstitutional claims also typically requirethe trial record and cannot be brought ondirect appeal.Indeed, "someprosecutorial misconduct, may notirregularities,surface until wellsuchafterdirect review is complete." Giarratano, 492 U.S. atasthe24(Stevens,aright to evidenceJ., dissenting). In Georgia, a defendant does not havereview prosecution and law enforcement files, where of a failure to disclose exculpatory evidence is most7 likely to be found, until direct review is complete. See Ga. Code Ann. § 50-18-72(4); see also Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 90-91 (1963) (requiring the state to discloseexculpatory evidence); Amadeo v. Zant, 486 U.S. 214, 216-17(1988) (upholding finding that claim of prosecutorial misconduct was not reasonably discoverable prior to collateral review). Similarly, claims of jury misconduct or tampering often cannot be discovered until after trial. See, e.g., State v. Freeman, 605 So. 2d 1258 (Ala. Crim. App..1992) (Guror misconduct found on collateral review, based on post-trial investigation).Thus, for certain constitutional claims, collateral review is the equivalent of direct appeal; it is the first time a reviewingcourt may consider a particular constitutional challenge to the conviction and sentence. Moreover, the claims that typically fall into this category are among the most significant in maintaining the integrity of the judicial process in cases where the ultimate punishment of death is sought. These claims, when found to have merit, necessarily implicate the integrity ofthe trial outcome. See, e.g., Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984) (requiring "a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different."); Strickler v. Greene, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 1952 (1999) (requiring, for Brady claim, a "reasonableprobability that the result of the trial would have been different if the suppressed [material had beer] disclosed to the defense"). These claims thus are not concerned with mere technicalities or procedural niceties; rather, they relate directly to the reliability of the underlying verdict and death sentence.And experience has proved that these claims are meritorious in an alarming number of capital cases. As Justice Stevens noted in Giarratano, a 1988 study found that the success rate in federal habeas proceedings in capital cases8 ranged from 60% to 70% during the first decade following the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. 492 U.S. at 24(Stevens, J., dissenting); see also McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S.1256, 1263 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) ("Of the capital cases reviewed in federal habeas corpus proceedings between 1976 and 1991, nearly half (46%) were found to have constitutional error."). There can be no serious dispute that first-time state habeas claims in capital cases are critically important. In an increasing number of cases, however, there are no lawyers available to help death row inmates investigate, prepare, or prosecute their claims.B.Many death row inmates currently do not havecounsel for the preparation and prosecution ofinitial state habeas claims.Exzavious Gibson is not alone in his inability as an indigent death row inmate to find a lawyer to assist him in the preparation and prosecution of initial state habeas claims. Many States provide little or no legal assistance to individuals on death row following trial and direct appeal. And, although volunteer counsel often have been found, there is an increasingnumber of inmates on death row who do not have, and never have had, a lawyer to represent them in connection with initial state habeas claims.The ABA is in a unique position through its Death Penalty Representation Project to assess the availability of counsel for persons on death row following their direct appeal. In early 1998, the Project renewed its efforts to recruit volunteer counsel and made that goal its highest priority. Since that time it has enlisted more than 40 law firms to serve as volunteer counsel in post-conviction capital cases. In addition, the Project now funds five "resource counsel" at non-profit capital representation offices in four states and will shortly fund a: 4 : :9"resource counsel" in a fifth state. Unfortunately, these efforts, and those of other non-profit organizations working in particular States, do not begin to meet the enormous need forcounsel. This is particularly true as a result of recent legislative changes that have reduced resources for capital representation projects and have made it increasingly difficult for volunteer counsel to handle a capital case.Between 1988 and 1995, Congress provided federal funding for 20 capital post-conviction resource centers. That appropriation substantially increased the number of trained lawyers providing direct representation to death row inmates in collateral review proceedings, and was particularly effective in supporting the efforts of volunteer and court-appointed counsel. In 1996, however, Congress eliminated all federal funding forthe resource centers, see Pub. L. No. 104-91, 110 Stat. 7(1996), and most closed their doors by mid-year. To the extent these offices exist today, the overwhelming majority operate with a skeleton staff and little or no financial assistance from the States.The situation became even more urgent with the passagein April 1996 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective DeathPenalty Act ("`AEDPA"), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214(1996). Among other things, the AEDPA provides a one-yearstatute of limitations for the filing of federal habeas actions. 28U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1). For many inmates presently on deathrow, the clock now is ticking under the AEDPA and no post-conviction petition has yet been filed. Although a state courthabeas filing tolls the AEDPA statute of limitations, manyStates have enacted filing deadlines even more rigorous thanthe AEDPA. See, e.g., Ill. Comp. conviction petition generally mustStat. 725 § 5/122-1 (postbe filed within 45 days offiling of defendant's direct appeal brief); Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-4234(D) (post-conviction petition must be filed only 60 days10 after disposition of direct appeal); Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 11.071 § 4(a); Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-654.1.The AEDPA also tightens the relationship between stateand federal habeas, and makes the assistance of counsel in state habeas critical to the entire post-conviction review process.The AEDPA provides that "a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct." 28 US.C. § 2254(e)(1). This presumption may be overcome only by clear and.convincing evidence. Id. See also id. § 2254(d) (providing that federal habeas relief shall not be granted with respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless that adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States" or "resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding").As a result of these legislative developments, it is increasingly difficult to find volunteer counsel willing to assume responsibility for a post-conviction death penalty case. For volunteer counsel, the investment of time -- which amountsto hundreds, if not thousands, of hours -- now must often becompressed into a very short time period, and there is far less support available from experienced death penalty resource centers. As a result, there currently are many death row inmates in several States who have no lawyer to assist them in connection with their initial state habeas claims. For example:.In Georgia, the loss of federal funding for theGeorgia Resource Center in 1996, and the enactment at thesame time of a new state rule expediting post-convictionproceedings in capital cases, see Ga. Super. Ct. Rule 44(effective Jan. 11, 1996), have had a dire impact on the/ A`11 availability of counsel to assist death row inmates. This is demonstrated most dramatically by the instant case, where Exzavious Gibson was forced to stand alone at his postconviction hearing, offering little more than "I don't know what to plead." Gibson y. Turpin, No. 95-V-648, Transcript of Hearing, 2-3 (Sept. 12, 1996, Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia). By the end of the year, there will be no fewer than eight death row inmates who have completed direct review and will be without counsel for state post-conviction proceedings..In Alabama, there are approximately 186 prisonerssentenced to death. While the elimination of the state resourcecenter has made it impossible to track precisely the number ofdeath row inmates currently without lawyers, it is fair to saythat there are at least 30 individuals who are, or within the nextsix months will be, in jeopardy of running the federal statute oflimitations without counsel to file state post-convictionpetitions. State resources for indigent capital representation are virtually non-existent, and appointment of counsel is wholly discretionary. See Ala. Code § 15-12-23. In addition, in those. cases where counsel is appointed, fees are capped at $1000. Jd..In Pennsylvania, an extreme shortage of resourceshas made it impossible to track the number of death rowinmates without lawyers. About half of Pennsylvania's 200death row inmates lacked counsel even before the stateresource center lost its federal funding in 1996.. The crisis hasonly deepened since then. In 1997, the Pennsylvanialegislature defeated a measure to provide state funding for post-conviction representation of indigent death row inmates. Thecapital resource center briefly managed to subsist on privatefunding, but on June 15, 1999, it permanently closed its doorsdue to lack of funds.12InGibsonsum,hasthebroadconstitutional question raisedimpact beyond this case.byExzaviousIl.There Is Recognition Initial StateaSubstantial of a Right to Habeas ClaimsConstitutional Basis for Counsel for the Pursuit ofin Death Penalty Cases.pdpcRapipaa(Eceroeedrnvlu1itonesfoooam9nginvpoenip5acthiitaelnl8ttietsc:reua)doIeiehthtetb,nma'odimlsipnsniioe,eostoannAnndtrspgtmtiote,hasscffeietecuortfoinnfabrayoitdapsntdfmniatnotenmochanesartoednlsteyhucintesuetlettntAadeaiihsttiBtnaoasbohatn,cdlnAaef"fgaoorfptrryinorhnosdH,drraefdososeiodpetve-dgftehupiShpmihiersdtiteosenntonseaifocerTpeotnrdArsrebdgdeomio'dholatespaifeeniribrctaegrDfeoyeteaaoipenthntvrcsloa.idcpcshreawoeyaotooaygnelDntpasulupautreentleptlnrs-edtBleoparmeocnaesitrlelioaocsrnto"vnnne,foy)tciednva1im.Ameedsic0mpswuee,ec32prfsdatnc5Boeeaoiits6dsstcoInshoeheennigf(teerosdasoh1aUdweaft9l.oeetti7Srsehdwv.9otcxew,wahce)nlocehitoaerulceteuwurn8euh.(rltcn6estmiuhet,eseainrectrieltgoothmnlaiuSontact1tirntesehth0yhthntgeeeeir1eeoes itpsAvtch.nuehomecennniersortientmeWsfindpadhoticiemmrurenteteeedwiecnnortnrtntiteagamlthpahotpiaar,tfevnioaegdrlthebashttiaesb4dte7iswhse7oetsnfirumeeet,esxehUiee.xncucSocoon.unecftmtiepolrilneaoexd3tttntehh9eeecee9dm.u,,nttoieifromdmene4i)a0o.nn9oans-yrfete1ae0tAxnoteoewfmtcheuot(lnti1ehtima9eosp8mntl6i.si)oc8fla0otmSneeec(gedanpE,pteiFiaoagtlopfhatallrtneleyhddrtiehsxeseucerueTtlheihiadesbrielwcihatsieyser,ewofhhecotrtwhiheeteivcreuarnl,daecnroinlnsyivtinoidnltigvugetesincotonnaavldmiecuactctlihhaoinmnrsoaawrntrdhaotiwdneemgraoatthrediigsrheemtc.nattyleynTchbeteeo13have never been heard with the assistance of counsel. The ABA submits there is a substantial constitutional basis for a limited exception to the rule of Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551 (1987), which held there is no general right to counsel in post-conviction proceedings.A.Recognition of a right to counsel for an indigentparty generally is dependent on the nature ofthe underlying interest and the importance of.counsel to a fair determination of theproceedings."Courts have confronted, in diverse settings, the `age-old problem' of `[p]roviding equal justice for poor and rich, weak and powerful alike." MLB. v. SL.J, 519 US. 102, 110 (1996) (quoting Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 16 (1956)). Although the Constitution may not guarantee a particular form of state review, "once a State affords that right, Griffin held, the State may not `bolt the door to equal justice." M.L.B., 519 USS. at 110 (quoting Griffin, 351 U.S. at 24 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in the judgment)).In certain circumstances, the right of meaningful access to the courts guaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause encompasses a right to the assistance of counsel. In Douglas y. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963), the Court held that an indigent criminal defendant may not be denied the assistance of counsel in connection with his first appeal as of right, on the ground that "there can be no equal justice where the kind of an appeal a man enjoys `depends on the amount of money he has.'" Jd. at 355 (quoting Griffin, 351 U.S. at 19). The Court emphasized the difference between prosecuting a. criminal appeal with the benefit of counsel, and doing so without:14[T]he rich man . . . enjoys examination into the record,marshaling of arguments on histhe benefit of counsel's research of the law, andbehalf, while the indigentmtr.o.ee.caonra1isdnfgmiofseruaculnendicnlagetpoalpreesashlsoi.rftthrfeiotruearlhr,iomrssewlhafir.elehiTdhtdeheen,inrdhiiacgshento,nmlaynwhtehrehearsigthhteaIuD"ooedfnfowq.ctuuheorage(nnillregsiaemhttsstpyiu,hsttathuaeaistrs3ieii7nmos2nenodrtateiUihlctn.eisSrmd.oel.erqi"oidnufageitirtnJwehh3daeda.i5ls;t7)ho.-atno5bleu8e3i.ten5ane7sn.bdTedhcnrBeaeoaunfntwilCnytobtueharboeptfeaptCnecnwodaoouelutreneatnsrdaeenlert,miidhpcnarhtdhawiaweg"asne[ninadztt]heabipdnshnodoakolsrtu.hwtaaa"eentswaidc4Mctanpeooo8eoppflr1fuppefleepneuialnsrattlrUdeloSteas.llaiv,rtuiSnnaieika.cltdseon4eselngb1yorra7Dftiedicetovnithforiou5sUeiuet5.gcgonwhS6rhlhnss)o.etaaae.s"tvslemt(ieh6enoeao0nscBitt0ahraoao,cirsctdrsleybciiheasseeg6niCthhs1rsmioatsR5aesunluolcvrfrstre,tittd(oseeou1awiar9mdhnsnaaiay6etdnsnt7taaodtg)enhtrracaiesanmoFdt-ann(sainspgntopntcrobferplriooeueieinvfeslpvnyruintiuiiedtgoophdeheaunerdatfcmsesrctpsmSodeothitecosimasaaosvspstt.suippteecneeiotad'ohaswszsuteleireSei,blnterd-tyo)gehpb;ealrtocntroiRonFidoh"fgoaivaiulastnnin,tsttlsihdstthieetaeeiiuyoahtralds,nnvee.l.case.

As explained by the Court: "Coleman has had his `one and only appeal,' if that is what a state collateral proceeding may be considered. ... What Coleman requires here is a right to counsel on appeal from ¢hat determination. Our case law will not support it." Id. at 756 (emphasis in original).Crucial to the Coleman decision, therefore, was that counsel had been provided in the state habeas trial court. Exzavious Gibson had no counsel at that stage. Thus, the Court in Coleman expressly did not decide the questionpresented here, i.e., whether "there must be an exception to therule of Finley and Giarratano in those cases where state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction." Coleman, 501 U.S. at 755.Where, as here, those initial state habeas claims could not havebeen brought on direct review, and therefore the initial state habeas hearing is the equivalent of the inmate's "one and only appeal," the decisions from Douglas through Coleman compel the conclusion that counsel must be afforded to an indigent death row inmate.This Court's due process jurisprudence also supportsrecognition of a right to counsel in the first state habeasproceeding in a capital case. For example, in In re Gault, 387U.S. 1, 41 (1967), the Court held that the Due Process Clauserequires appointment delinquency proceedingof counsel for that may resulta inchild in a juvenile confinement, despite"the `civil' label-of-convenience which has been attached tojuvenile proceedings." Id. at 50. The Court again relied uponthe critical importance of counsel in this setting: "The juvenile16 needs the assistance of counsel to cope with problems of law, to make skilled inquiry into the facts, to insist upon regularity. of the proceedings, and to ascertain whether he has a defense and to prépare and submit it." Jd. at 36. In other settings involving important underlying interests, the Court has recognized a conditional right to counsel dependent upon the nature and complexity of the particular case. See, e.g., ML.B., 519 USS. at 117 (characterizing Lassister, 452 U.S. at 31-32, as recognizing a due process right to counsel in parental termination cases "when warranted by the character and difficulty of the case"); Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 790 (recognizing a due process right to counsel in probation and parole revocation hearings when dictated by "fundamental fairness").As this Court has recognized, cases involving rights of access to judicial processes "cannot be resolved by resort to easy slogans or pigeonhole analysis," M.L.B., 519 U.S. at 120 (quoting Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 666 (1983)), but two factors pervade the analysis. First, is an assessment of the importance of the underlying interest. See, e.g., In re Gault, 387 U.S. at 36 (child may be "subjected to the loss of his liberty for years"); Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 27 ("[a] parent's interest in the accuracy and justice of the decision to terminate his or her parental status is . .. a commanding one"). Second, the Court has considered the extent to which counsel is necessary to protect the rights of the indigent party. Compare Douglas, 372 U.S. at 358 (without counsel, first appeal is "a meaningless ritual"), with Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 787-88 (recognizing a right to counsel in some, but not all, probation and parole revocation proceedings because in many cases the alleged violation is already established and there is less need for counsel). Employing that framework, the Court should recognize a right to counsel in the limited context at issue here.17B.The nature of the underlying interest and theimportance of counsel in the setting presentedhere provides a compelling basis for anexception to the Finley rule in capital cases.This case presents a particularly compelling basis for recognition of an indigent party's right to counsel: there are few interests more substantial than the fair administration of the death penalty, and few instances in which the assistance of a lawyer is more indispensable than the pursuit of postconviction claims, including ineffective assistance of counsel claims, that could not have been raised on direct appeal.This Court long has recognized that "death as a punishment is unique in its severity and irrevocability." Gregg vy. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 187 (1976) (plurality opinion); see also Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U.S. 110, 125 (1991) (same). This fundamental difference creates a greater "need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in aspecific case." Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305(1976) (plurality opinion).Imposition of the death penalty also "places special constraints on the procedures used to convict an accused of a capital offense and sentence him to death." Giarratano, 492 USS. at 8 (plurality opinion). Perhaps most notably, although there generally is no constitutional right to appeal a criminal conviction, "meaningful appellate review" in capital cases "serves as a check against the random or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty," Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 195, 206 (1976) (plurality opinion), and is an integral component of a State's "constitutional responsibility to tailor and apply its law in a manner that avoids the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death penalty." Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 428 (1980) (plurality opinion). Thus, the interest in18 ensuring the validity of a death row inmate's conviction and sentence is of the highest magnitude.In addition, the claims sought to be raised in these initialwdcstileaaattithemhosuthpaaenabndealalabstweyycearpu,lrsaoewbc.oetoehfditFbhnieegrscstac,uosmcepwalinetnoxhfoitttihreeebssepneacotftburrpeootusogothf-ttchtoehnesvuiuuccnnctddeieesorrsnllfyyuiilannlnggydineffective assistance of counsel claims that are often at issue,this Court has recognized that a "layman will ordinarily beunable to recognize counsel's errors and to evaluate counsel'sprofessional performance."

It is noteworthy that Congress has recognized these principles in creating a statutory right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings in death penalty cases. See 21 U.S.C. § 848(q)(7) (expressly noting "the seriousness of the possible penalty and . . . the unique and complex nature of the litigation"); see also Jackson v. Mississippi, 732 So. 24 187, 188 (Miss. 1999) (holding that "the nature of death penalty litigation in the courts of this State, coupled with the ultimate penalty the State seeks to impose," requires recognition of a constitutional right to counsel in capital post-conviction proceedings).Recognition ofnecessarily dictatea right to counsel inthe manner in whichthis settingcounsel iswould notprovided.19This Court frequently has emphasized that States must be afforded `flexibility in ensuring that indigent litigants are afforded meaningful access to the courts. See, e.g., M.L.B., 519 USS. at 112 n.5 (right to meaningful access does not impose an inflexible requirement that a State provide a full trial transcript); Giarratano, 492 U.S. at 13 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (States have "considerable discretion in assuring ... meaningful access to the judicial process"); id. at 14 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) ("The requirement of meaningful access can be satisfied in various ways... ."). States may be able to satisfy their obligation to ensure death row inmates access to the courts by funding resource centers and public defender.organizations to work with the private bar to provide representation to indigent death row inmates. But,as this case illustrates, it cannot be constitutional for the State to do nothing, leaving an indigent death row inmate like Exzavious Gibson totally alone to prosecute his "one and onlyappeal" of first-time Habeas claims. If that result is constitutionally permissible, it too readily may become the nomn for ail capital cases, even in States that presently provide some level of support.For these reasons, the ABA submits that an indigent death row inmate must be afforded counsel to pursue his initial state post-conviction claims. The ABA urges the Court to grant the petition and consider this important constitutional question, which is critical to the integrity of our capital. punishment system. Nothing will be served by allowing an increasing number of these cases to flounder through the state courts without counsel, creating new problems for federal habeas and potentially prolonging the ultimate resolution of these cases before the issue finally is resolved by this Court.20 CONCLUSION The ABA respectfully urges the Court to grant the petition.OF COUNSEL: DAVID W. DEBRUIN SEPTEMBER 8, 1999. :Respectfully submitted, WILLIAM G. PAUL, PRESIDENT AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION 750 NORTH LAKE SHORE DRIVE CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60611 (312) 988-5000 ATTORNEY FOR THE AMERICAN BAR 
AN ATTORNEY-FEE SANCTION UNDER INHERENT POWER MUST BE LIMITED TO THE EXPENSES CAUSED BY THE MISCONDUCT UNLESS HEIGHTENED DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED.A. Under traditional sanctions law, only those attorney's fees caused by the misconduct may be awarded absent contumacious conduct.The ABA's standards address various sources of authority for sanctioning misconduct in litigation, such as Rule 11, the discovery rules, 28 U.S.C. § 1927, and inherent authority. See STANDARDS FOR RULE 11 PRACTICE, 121 F.R.D. at 104. None of the ABA standards, however, considers the possibility of an attorney-fee sanction that is higher than the amount necessary to compensate the other side for the expenses caused by the violation. The ABA standards consistently state that an attorney-fee sanction should be limited to the amount necessary to remedy the misconduct.Under the ABA standards, for example, a court can punish discovery abuse by making a party or counsel "pay the other side's counsel fees and expenses caused by the default or failure." CIVIL DISCOVERY STANDARDS, § I.3, cmt. (emphasis added). Similarly, the ABA standards on Rule 11 practice state that a court may award "reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred as a result of the misconduct." STANDARDS FOR RULE 118PRACTICE, Part L, § 2, 121 F.R.D. at 124 (emphasis added).10This causation element, which runs throughout the ABA standards, comports with this Court's explanation of the "American Rule." See Chambers, 501 U.S. at 46.The American Rule prohibits fee shifting in most cases. Id. at 45 (citing Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 259 (1975)). Indeed, there are just three "narrowly defined" exceptions to the American Rule when a court is acting under inherent power: (1) a "common fund" award; (2) sanctions for the willful disobedience of a court order; and (3) attorney's fees imposed when a party has acted in bad faith. Id. Only the third exception applies here, as the record shows no common fund or finding that a court-order was violated.The third exception serves the dual purposes of punishment and remediation. Id. at 46. Thus, while a court has inherent power to punish bad faith with an attorney-fee sanction, the measure of this punishment is the amount necessary to make the injured party "whole" by giving him the "expenses caused by his opponent's obstinacy." Id. (quoting10 Although these standards refer to sanctioning authority under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, they provide valuable guidance for sanctions under inherent power as well. see , e.g., TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp. v. Powell, 811 S.W.2d 913, 921 (Tex. 1991) (Gonzalez, J., concurring) (stating that the ABA's Standards and Guidelines for Practice Under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should be considered whenever sanctions are at issue).9Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 689 n.14 (1979)). The punishment ­ the attorney's fees ­ must also serve the remedial purpose, which limits the sanction to the extra fees incurred as a result of the misconduct.Significantly, Chambers distinguished the attorney-fee sanction authorized by the third exception, which applies here, from sanctions that are available under the second exception, which deals with contempt of court. Chambers, 501 U.S. at 45-46. Under the second exception, "a court's discretion to determine `[t]he degree of punishment for contempt' permits the court to impose as part of the fine attorney's fees representing the entire cost of the litigation." Id. at 45. Furthermore, the Court characterized that "fine" as "more drastic" than the remedial attorney-fee sanction for bad faith conduct that does not violate a court order:The imposition of sanctions [under the third exception] ... serv[es] the dual purpose of "vidicat[ing] judicial authority without resort to the more drastic sanctions available for contempt of court and mak[ing] the prevailing party whole for expenses caused by his opponent's obstinacy."Id. (emphasis added).In Chambers, the Court approved an attorney-fee sanction that "represented the entire amount of NASCO's litigation costs paid to its attorneys." Id. at 40. Chambers, however, involved contumacious conduct. Id. at 57. "[Th]ere, for example, Chambers' attempt to gain the FCC's permission to build a new10transmission tower was in direct contravention of the District Court's orders to maintain the status quo pending the outcome of the litigation and was therefore within the scope of the District Court's sanctioning power." Id."Thus, a court's discretion to determine `[t]he degree of punishment for contempt' permit[ted] the court to impose as part of the fine attorney's fees representing the entire cost of the litigation." Id. at 45. But where, as here, the court is not punishing for contempt, inherent power to impose an attorney-fee sanction is restricted to those expenses directly caused by the misconduct. See id. at 46; Kerrin v. U.S. Postal Service, 218 F.3d 185, 190 (2d Cir. 2000) (noting remedial goal of attorney-fee sanction under inherent power).There is another reason why Chambers sets no precedent for the non-remedial fine in this case ­ the sanction there was compensatory. See Haeger v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 813 F.3d 1233, 1256-57 (2016) (Watford, J., dissenting). The sanction awarded fees for the entire case, but it was calibrated to the harm because the misconduct occurred throughout the entire case, from start to finish. Id. The award, therefore, was authorized under both the second and the third exceptions to the American Rule.In sum, under traditional sanctions law as set out by Chambers and the ABA standards, a court's inherent power to use an attorney-fee award to punish non-contumacious conduct is limited to making the transgressor pay for those expenses incurred as a result of the misconduct.11B. The proportionality and notice aspects of due process require that compensatory sanctions be linked to the misconduct.When relying on inherent power to impose an attorney-fee sanction for bad faith conduct, a court must observe due process "both in determining that the requisite bad faith exists and in assessing fees." Chambers, 501 U.S. at 50.Due process demands proportionality in the assessment of fees to guard against arbitrary punishment, which is a risk when a court functions as accuser, prosecutor, and sentencer. See Int'l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 831 (1994).11 And arbitrary results should be avoided whether the sanctions are criminal or civil. See id; see also Roadway Express, Inc., 447 U.S. at 763 (discussing the need for consistency in attorney-fee sanctions).The ABA's standards on the "Special Functions of the Trial Judge," therefore, instruct that a judge should select the "least severe sanction" needed to serve the purpose at hand:If the judge determines to impose sanctions for misconduct affecting the trial, the judge should ordinarily impose the least severe sanction appropriate to correct the abuse and deter repetition. . .11 Cf. Ty Inc. v. Softbelly's, Inc., 517 F.3d 494, 499 (2008) (finding that inherent authority to impose sanctions for litigation misconduct is curbed by notions of proportionality required by the Eighth Amendment).12SPECIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE, Standard 6-4.2 (emphasis original); see also STANDARDS FOR RULE 11 PRACTICE, 121 F.R.D. at 124 (instructing courts to impose the "least severe sanction").ABA commentary also explains that "[a]n unnecessarily severe sanction may be self-defeating, as may any appearance of passion or pettiness, because it will bring `discredit to a court as certainly as the conduct it penalizes.'" SPECIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE, Standard 6-4.2, cmt.The judgment in this case contravenes these principles by imposing an attorney-fee sanction that is not tailored to the expenses caused by the discovery violations. Indeed, the district court found that ­ if a direct connection is required ­ the sanction should be reduced by over $700,000. Order (8/26/2013) (Doc. 1125) at 7. A fine that so greatly exceeds the compensatory purpose of the third exception to the American Rule runs afoul of due process because it lacks proportionality.Due process also has a notice requirement. Notice must be given of the type of sanctions a party is facing in addition to notice of what conduct is being challenged.The party sought to be sanctioned is entitled to particularized notice including, at a minimum, 1) the fact that Rule 11 sanctions are under consideration, 2) the reasons why sanctions are under consideration, and 3) the form of sanctions under consideration. Id. Only13with this information can a party respond to the court's concerns in an intelligent manner.Simmerman v. Corino, 27 F.3d 58, 64 (1994); see also STANDARDS FOR RULE 11 PRACTICE, 121 F.R.D. at 127 ("Sanctions may not be imposed upon a person who is not on notice of . . . the type of sanctions under consideration." (emphasis added).In this case, there is disagreement over what type of sanctions were imposed. The majority opinion says that the sanctions were compensatory even though they were significantly greater than the amount that the district court said it would award if the sanction must be limited to the extra fees traceable to the misconduct. The dissent, however, argues that the attorney-fee award was a noncompensatory punitive sanction. This difference is material because ­ even though both involve an attorney-fee award ­ heightened procedural protections apply to the second type of sanctions. See Bagwell, 512 U.S. at 834; see also infra at Section C. Due process requires courts to recognize the difference between these types of sanctions ­ a remedial attorney-fee award versus a larger noncompensatory fine ­ because, if a party is subject to the latter, it must be told this in advance so that it can avail itself of the higher procedural protections that apply in that circumstance.14C. If a court exercises inherent power to punish non-contumacious bad faith conduct with an attorney-fee sanction that exceeds the expenses caused by the misconduct, heightened procedural protections must be observed.Judge Watford's dissent argued that, "[i]f the sanctions that can properly be deemed compensatory seem too paltry under the circumstances, the district court could still fashion an award of punitive sanctions, so long as it applies the corresponding heightened procedural protections." Haeger, 813 F.3d at 1258 (Watford, J., dissenting). The ABA, however, does not concede that, absent contumacious conduct, a court has inherent authority to punish discovery abuse with a substantial non-compensatory attorneyfee fine under any circumstances.12 But, if inherent power does permit a non-contempt attorney-fee sanction greater than the expenses traceable to the discovery abuse, the ABA agrees that such a sanction would require heightened procedural protections.Bagwell discussed the means other than contempt that can be used to remedy misbehavior by litigants and their lawyers ­ such as striking pleadings,12 Again, Chambers recognized that, when faced with contumacious conduct, a court has inherent power to "impose as part of the fine attorney's fees representing the entire cost of the litigation." Chambers, 501 U.S. at 45. But it contrasted that type of sanction with the less drastic sanctions available under the third exception to the American Rule, which governs here. Further, Chambers explained that, under the third exception, inherent power may be used to punish bad faith conduct with a compensatory attorney-fee award.15assessing costs, excluding evidence and entering a default judgment. Bagwell, 512 U.S. at 833. It observed that, like coercive civil fines, those sanctions have never been considered criminal and thus have not warranted criminal due process. Id. Bagwell, however, contrasted those civil sanctions with fines that are "noncompensatory" in character. Id. at 834.Bagwell stressed that the district court had made no attempt to calibrate such serious fines to damages caused by the misconduct "or indicate that the fines were `to compensate the complainant for losses sustained.'" Id. (quoting United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 303-04 (1947)). The fines, therefore, were "more closely analogous to fixed, determinate, retrospective criminal fines which petitioners had no opportunity to purge once imposed." Id. at 837. Accordingly, the Court held that the heightened procedural protections required of criminal proceedings must be observed before such fines could be imposed. Id. at 837-38; cf. id. at 839 (excluding "petty" noncompensatory fines from the heightened procedural requirements). Bagwell, therefore, advanced the teaching of Chambers by making clear that, if monetary sanctions under inherent power stray from the causal-compensatory measure, they must be accompanied by heightened procedural protections.Like the fines in Bagwell, a significant attorneyfee sanction that is not calibrated to the damage caused by the misconduct is closer to a criminal fine than the traditional civil means of controlling judicial proceedings. Thus, the hefty noncompensatory award in this case also requires heightened procedural16protections. See id. at 837-38; see also FTC v. Trudeau, 579 F.3d 754, 770 (7th Cir. 2009) ("If any part of [the attorney-fee sanction] winds up being punitive instead of remedial, then criminal proceedings are required to sustain it.").Simply put, "[w]here, as here, `a serious contempt [or analogous fine] is at issue, considerations of efficiency must give way to the more fundamental interest of ensuring the even-handed exercise of judicial power.'" Bagwell, 512 U.S. at 839 (quoting Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 209 (1968)).Finally, the ABA understands that courts may face a challenge when trying to identify the expenses directly caused by a failure to disclose in discovery. Such difficulty, however, cannot enlarge inherent powers or eliminate procedural protections. Instead, a district court should consider how courts resolve causation issues in other fee contexts ­ keeping in mind the black letter principle that "the judge should ordinarily impose the least severe sanction appropriate to correct the abuse." SPECIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE, Standard 6-4.2.For example, a similar problem was addressed in a "prevailing party" case, Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 436 (1983). Hensley found that, if there was only partial success, total hours times a reasonable rate might yield an excessive award. Id. A district court, therefore, must make an effort to trim the noncompensable hours. Id. There is no precise formula for this task, but a court has options. Id. It "may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the17limited success. Id. at 436-37. The court's discretion is always bounded, however, by its authority to shift fees. Id. at 437; see also Trudeau, 579 F.3d at 770.Yet, in this case, the Ninth Circuit held that no such effort is required ­ even though the sanction was patently over-inclusive, awarding far more than the expenses that were directly caused by the misconduct. Because this excessive fee-shifting is more analogous to a criminal fine than traditional civil sanctions, it was error to impose it without observing the heightened procedural protections required of criminal proceedings.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth herein, the American Bar Association requests that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed.Respectfully submitted.Of Counsel:LAURIE WEBB DANIEL SAMUEL SPITAL MATTHEW D.FRIEDLANDERLINDA A.

 I. Overcrowding Has Been Shown to Have aNumber of Deleterious Effects on the Medical and Mental Health of Prisoners.The Eighth Amendment requires that a government provide medical care for those whom it hasincarcerated. "An inmate must rely on prison authori-ties to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met." Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976); see also DeShaney v.Winnebago County Dep't. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989) ("[W]hen the State by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual'sliberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at the same time fails to provide for his basic needs -- e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care and reasonable safety -- it transgresses the substantive7 limits on state action set by the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause.")."°Prison overcrowding has long been shown to have a number of deleterious effects on the medical andmental health of prisoners and, once prisoners have been released, they "carry the effects or consequencesof that harm back" to the communities to which theyreturn. Craig Haney, The Wages of Prison Overcrowd-ing: Harmful Psychological Consequences and Dysfunctional Correctional Reactions, 22 Was. U.J.L. & PoL'y 265, 265 (2006). Earlier studies establish, forexample, an association between crowding and ele-vated blood pressure and stress; and with elevated death rates in general and elevated suicide andviolent death rates in particular.

The recommendations of the ABA's Commission on Effective Criminal Sanctions and the Kennedy Commission include the following, each of which is discussed below: (1) early release on exceptional and humanitarian grounds; (2) increaseduse of alternatives to incarceration for offenders,including those with substance abuse and/or mental illness problems, who are deemed to pose no substantial risk to public safety; (8) more effective parole andprobation supervision policies that rely on graduated sanctions rather than automatic returns to prison; and (4) rehabilitative and reentry services aimed atreducing recidivism.

Sentence reduction should be broadly available in exceptional circumstances arising after sentencing, including old age, disability, changes in the law, exigent family circumstances, heroic acts, or extraordinary suffering. The ABA recommends that states "establish standards and provide an accessible process by which prisoners may request [such] a reduction of sentence" and "ensure that there are procedures in place to assist prisoners who are unable to advocate for themselves." Kennedy Comm'n Rep., supra 4, note 8, at 64. In accordance with these recommendations, many states employ administrative or judicial sentence reduction mechanisms, while others rely upon executive clemency to secure a prisoner's early release.

Id. New York and New Jersey recent-ly implemented such diversionary programs to reduceprisonnativepopulation. New York's Drug Treatment Alter-to Prison Program diverts drug users chargedwith non-violent crimes to treatment for addiction,while in New Jersey, plea negotiation guidelines wererevised to allow "open pleas" in lower-level drug-freezone cases, giving judges greater discretion to con-sider drug treatment as an alternative to incarcera-tion. Greene & Mauer, supra 10, note 14, at 8; see alsoAlternatives to Incarceration, supra 10, note 13, at10-15 (discussing programs). California alreadypermits diversionary programs. See, e.g., Cal. PenalCode § 17(b)(4).Improvements in Parole and Probation Supervision. Improvements to parole and probation supervision can contribute substantially to reducing prison populations and recidivism: parole and probationviolators account for more than one-third of all prison admissions, and more than two-thirds of those admissions were for a violation of the conditions of release,rather than commission of a new offense. Alternativesto Incarceration, supra 10, note 13, at 20. Revocations often follow minor violations of the terms of super-vised release and do not reflect conduct posing a threat to the community. Jd. The ABA urges, instead,the use of graduated sanctions, which return an offender to prison only on commission of a new crime or when the offender poses a danger to the community.

The ABA recognizes that additionalresources are often not available to provide expanded services during the early weeks of re-entry. However,the ABA recommends that existing resources shouldbe reallocated to those offenders with the greatestneed. Research has shown that some offenders do not need intensive supervision and may be better off without it. Alternatives to Incarceration, supra 10, note 13, at 21-22.

When a court resolves disputed issues of material fact without an evidentiary hearing and without affording one of the parties a meaningful opportunity to develop and present evidence, it departs from accepted norms of judicial practice and violates basic principles of constitutional due process. In Virginia capital cases, however, that troubling practice is commonplace. The Supreme Court of Virginia, which has exclusive jurisdiction over capital habeas proceedings in the Commonwealth, regularly denies death-sentenced prisoners any meaningful opportunity to develop evidence to support claims of constitutional violations, and it frequently resolves disputed questions of material fact without an evidentiary hearing. Yet lower federal courts have failed to recognize that, in those circumstances, the state court's factual conclusions are not entitled to deference.This case is part of that disturbing trend. The Virginia Supreme Court denied petitioner a meaningful opportunity to present evidence in support of his constitutional claims. It then resolved disputed questions of material fact without holding an evidentiary hearing. As a result, the state court failed to make reasonable credibility findings or to receive evidence necessary to resolve the disputed facts set forth in an affidavit petitioner submitted that contradicts the facts relied on by the Commonwealth in connection with a pivotal postconviction issue. Nonetheless, the courts below deferred to the Virginia Supreme Court, assuming6that the state court's factual conclusions were reasonable.The issues raised in this case are recurring and important. Procedures that Virginia adopted in 1995 to streamline post-conviction review have been interpreted by the Virginia Supreme Court to prevent death-sentenced prisoners from developing an adequate factual record to test the constitutionality of their convictions and sentences. As a result, post-conviction proceedings are not "conducted in a manner designed to permit the adequate development and judicial consideration of all claims." Virginia Assessment, at xxiii. That systemic failure not only hinders Virginia's ability to conduct meaningful constitutional review, it also upends how Congress intended federal postconviction procedures to work. It shifts to federal courts the burdens associated with the Commonwealth's decision to impose the death penalty, and it puts federal courts in a difficult position--either assume that the state court's factual conclusions are reasonable despite the absence of a developed record (as the Fourth Circuit did below), or else undertake the essential fact-finding function that Congress intended the state court to perform in the first instance.As part of a comprehensive review of deathpenalty procedures in multiple states, an ABA expert assessment team confirmed that Virginia's postconviction procedures are inadequate to present and develop claims of constitutional error. The system prioritizes finality and expediency at grave costs. See Virginia Assessment, at viii. Death-sentenced7prisoners are rushed out of the gate, with onerous deadlines; they are not given opportunities to develop evidence or amend pleadings with new evidence; and, most relevant here, they do not have meaningful access to an evidentiary hearing, even when they have raised disputed issues of material fact that cannot be reasonably resolved on a paper record. See id. at xxiv (chart summarizing problems infecting Virginia's post-conviction procedures). Together, these restrictions mean that Virginia's deathsentenced prisoners are often denied adequate postconviction review.Having chosen to impose the death penalty andto implement its own post-conviction procedures, it isVirginia's responsibility to ensure that thoseprocedures are meaningful, that constitutional claimsare properly adjudicated, and that constitutionalviolations are remedied. When Virginia has notperformed the obligations that the Constitutiondemands, the federal courts should not defer to theVirginia Supreme Court's factual conclusions, as thecourts did below. Instead, when a petitioner hasraised a substantial claim of constitutional error,that claim should be given the full and fairconsideration it deserves.See 28 U.S.C.§ 2254(b)(1)(B).8REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITIONThis Court should grant the petition to clarify what procedures are necessary to ensure that a death-penalty prisoner has a reasonable opportunity to fully and fairly adjudicate claims of constitutional error. Answering that question will help ensure that state courts comply with due process requirements and provide much-needed guidance to federal courts in understanding when they are required to defer to a state court's factual conclusions.I. Virginia's Post-Conviction Procedures Raise Grave Constitutional Concerns.States are not required to provide post-conviction procedures, but, if they do, the procedures they use must "compor[t] with fundamental fairness." Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 556 (1987). A state's freedom to choose its own procedures, id. at 559, provides no license to dispense with due process or to "transgress[] any recognized principle of fundamental fairness in operation." Medina v. California, 505 U.S. 437, 448 (1992).The petition identifies serious flaws in the postconviction procedures employed by the Virginia Supreme Court to resolve petitioner's constitutional claims. See Pet. 12, 21­22. Those flaws cast grave doubt on whether Virginia has acted "in accord with the dictates of the Constitution--and, in particular, in accord with the Due Process Clause." Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 401 (1985). Moreover, the flaws described in the petition are not an isolated occurrence. They reflect systemic failures in9Virginia's capital habeas procedures, as the ABA's expert assessment explains in detail.A. The ABA's Assessment Serious Deficiencies In Capital Habeas Procedures.Identifies Virginia'sVirginia, like all other states, provides a collateral, post-conviction corrective process. See Virginia Assessment, at 227 (citing Va. Code §§ 8.01654, 19.2-163.7; Va. S. Ct. R. 5:7, 5:7A). But that process can operate in practice to prevent constitutional violations from being properly identified and remedied. As this case illustrates, the collateral review provided to death-sentenced prisoners in Virginia lacks the basic components of the "adversarial process historically thought essential to the truth-finding function of a court." Gray v. Pearson, No. 1:11-cv-630, 2012 WL 1481506, at *11 (E.D. Va. Apr. 27, 2012). As a result, "inmates are left with a limited record for federal courts to review in subsequent proceedings" and "the substance of habeas claims often go unaddressed." Virginia Assessment, at xxiv­xxv.In cases of prisoners not sentenced to death, Virginia follows traditional norms of adjudication. Prisoners can choose whether to seek collateral review in the state supreme court or in the circuit courts where their cases were tried; they are afforded adequate time to develop and present their petitions for relief; they have access to reasonable discovery, court-appointed experts, investigative services, and evidentiary hearings; and they have the option of appealing decisions of the circuit courts regarding their petitions. See, e.g., Va. Code § 8.01-654; id.10§ 8.01-655.One might expect that theCommonwealth would afford death-sentencedprisoners at least the same options as prisoners notsentenced to death. But in fact none of those optionsare available. See Virginia Assessment, at viii(noting that Virginia's procedures "effectivelyprovide[] less due process to those under a deathsentence than that which is afforded to non-capitalinmates"). Instead, death-sentenced prisoners maybe prevented from developing their constitutionalclaims, no matter how substantial and serious theymay be. See id. at viii­ix, 232­36.One of the more severe problems with the Commonwealth's post-conviction process is that it denies prisoners a meaningful opportunity to develop evidence during pre-petition discovery. See id. at 239­40. Only the Virginia Supreme Court has authority to grant discovery and its exclusive jurisdiction over capital habeas proceedings does not begin until after the initial petition is filed, leaving a critical gap in the process. See id. at 239 (citing Order Denying Motion for Pre-Petition Jurisdiction, In re Gleason, No. 111957 (Va. Oct. 17, 2012)). As a result, "no Virginia court has the jurisdiction or authority to grant pre-petition discovery in capital habeas cases." Id. Nor can prisoners obtain discovery through Virginia's Freedom of Information Act, as Virginia's prosecutors are exempt from the Act's provisions. See id. (citing Connell v. Kersey, 547 S.E.2d 228, 231­232 (Va. 2001)).Prisoners' ability to develop evidence on their own and without compulsory process is also strictly limited. Death-sentenced prisoners are required to11file state habeas petitions within 60 days of this Court's resolution of a petition for writ of certiorari from the petitioner's direct criminal appeal, or within 60 days of the deadline for seeking certiorari if no petition is filed. See Virginia Assessment, at 230­32 (citing Va. Code § 8.01-654.1; Va. S. Ct. R. 5:7A(a)). And that initial petition is the prisoner's only realistic opportunity to present any and all of his constitutional claims. Petitions may be amended only within the 60-day deadline for filing an initial petition, see Va. S. Ct. R. 5:7A(i), and amendments are limited to the claims presented in the initial petition, see Dorsey v. Angelone, 544 S.E.2d 350, 351­ 352 (Va. 2001).Equally troubling and directly relevant here, prisoners are often afforded no reasonable opportunity to present and test evidence in the state court's post-conviction proceedings--a problem that is only exacerbated by the lack of meaningful prepetition discovery opportunities. "[M]any claims that are commonly presented in state habeas proceedings involve complex factual considerations that typically require the court to consider evidence that is not in the trial record and that cannot be fully developed in the absence of an evidentiary hearing, such as claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct." Virginia Assessment, at 233. But evidentiary hearings are almost never granted in Virginia and, as a result, the Virginia Supreme Court routinely decides disputed factual questions without any court receiving evidence, hearing testimony, or making essential credibility determinations. See id. at 234­36.12Remarkably, between 1995, when the Virginia Supreme Court obtained exclusive jurisdiction over capital habeas cases, see S.B. 969, 1995 Virginia Laws Ch. 503 (Va. 1995), and 2012, when the ABA experts completed their assessment, the court granted evidentiary hearings in only five cases--a fraction of the 64 capital habeas petitions it reviewed (only 7%). Virginia Assessment, at 233 (citing cases). (To the ABA's knowledge, the Virginia Supreme Court also has not granted a hearing since 2012 when the ABA experts completed their assessment.) Moreover, "the Court did not explain why it ordered hearings in only these cases, nor does there appear to be a common issue that distinguishes these five cases from the cases in which hearings were not granted." Id.; see also id. at 242. "By making findings of fact and conclusions of law without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing, and instead through review of affidavits," the Virginia Supreme Court has "prevent[ed] adequate development of habeas claims and limit[ed] its own ability to accurately assess the claims presented during capital habeas proceedings." Id. at 234.B. Virginia's Post-Conviction Procedures Violate Both This Court's Instructions And The ABA's Guidelines.While this Court has taken pains to emphasize the importance of state-court fact finding, see Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 182 (2011), Virginia has tacked in the opposite direction. As far as the ABA can determine, the Virginia Supreme Court has not granted any death-sentenced prisoner's request for expert services or assistance, or any kind of discovery13or evidentiary hearing, in almost a decade. See also Virginia Assessment, at 248. Instead, as the ABA's Virginia Assessment determined, "factual disputes" in Virginia's habeas proceedings "appear to be" routinely "resolved based on review of affidavits submitted by the parties rather than through evidentiary hearings." Id. at viii. That is "particularly troublesome because many claims that are commonly presented in state habeas proceedings involve complex factual considerations that typically require the court to consider evidence that is not in the trial record and that cannot be fully developed in the absence of an evidentiary hearing." Id.; cf. 2010 Protocols, ch. 8; 2001 Protocols, at 17­22. Moreover, in the vast majority of cases, the Virginia Supreme Court waited to address and deny petitioners' motions for discovery or evidentiary hearings at the same time it granted the Warden's motion to dismiss--often without any explanation for the denial. See, e.g., Juniper v. Warden, 707 S.E.2d 290, 311 (Va. 2011); Teleguz v. Warden, 688 S.E.2d 865, 879 (Va. 2010).The end result is a combination of procedural deficiencies that in practice deny prisoners any meaningful opportunity to fully and fairly litigate claims of constitutional error. Virginia's restrictions on discovery contrast sharply with this Court's observation that the "pre-application phase of a habeas corpus proceeding" is a time when the "services of investigators and other experts" are "critical" to a petitioner's ability to identify, develop, and provide factual support for constitutional claims. McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 855 (1994); see also ABA Guidelines, 31 HOFSTRA L. REV. at 1079­80.14They are also in irreconcilable tension with this Court's acknowledgement that "the evidentiary basis" for constitutional claims "often turns on evidence outside the trial record" and that proceedings "without evidentiary hearings, may not be as effective as other proceedings for developing the factual basis for the claim." Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309, 1317­18 (2012).Virginia's procedures are also incompatible with "the standards for capital defense work articulated by the [ABA]--standards to which [this Court] long ha[s] referred as `guides to determining what is reasonable.'" Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524 (citation omitted). Those standards instruct post-conviction counsel to "continue an aggressive investigation of all aspects of the case," and emphasize that "collateral counsel cannot rely on the previously compiled record but must conduct a thorough, independent investigation" because "the trial record is unlikely to provide either a complete or accurate picture of the facts and issues in the case." ABA Guidelines, 31 HOFSTRA L. REV. at 1085­86; see also ABA Criminal Justice Standards for Post-Conviction Remedies, Standard 22-4.5(a), available at http://www.american bar.org/publications/criminal_justice_section_archive/ crimjust_standards_postconviction_blk.html ("Discovery techniques, specially adapted for post-conviction proceedings, should be utilized for assistance in advancing a case toward disposition by exploring and narrowing issues of fact.").In short, Virginia's post-conviction procedures for death-sentenced prisoners stymie counsel from fulfilling their duties and prevent courts from15developing adequate evidentiary records. As a result, "[u]nder current collateral review procedures, a `full and fair judicial review' often does not include reviewing the merits of the inmate's constitutional claims." Virginia Assessment, at 226. That raises serious concerns worthy of this Court's attention.II. The Court Should Grant Review To Clarify When Federal Courts Should Not Defer To State Court Habeas Decisions.When states do not provide adequate postconviction procedures, federal courts should not defer to state-court decisions denying post-conviction relief. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1), (d). This petition provides an opportunity both to reinforce that basic principle and to elaborate the circumstances under which a federal court should defer to a state court's factual conclusions.A. Adequate State Habeas Procedures Are The Cornerstone Of Proper Federal Habeas Review.Today, "state courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to state convictions." Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103 (2011). As this Court recently observed, "[t]he federal habeas scheme leaves primary responsibility with the state courts." Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 182 (citations omitted). Federal habeas rules presume that states will provide adequate procedures for resolving disputed questions of fact concerning the deprivation of federal constitutional rights.16In the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ("AEDPA"), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), Congress made clear that federal courts should defer to state courts only if they have fulfilled their obligation to provide adequate process for post-conviction review. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(B)(i) (allowing federal courts to grant a writ of habeas corpus where "there is an absence of available State corrective process"); id. § 2254(b)(1)(B)(ii) (allowing federal courts to grant a writ where the state "process [was] ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant"). A federal court must not defer to a state court's factual conclusions when its decision is "based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented" in the state post-conviction proceedings. Id. § 2254(d)(2); see also Williams, 529 U.S. at 437.This Court, too, has recognized that a state court's determinations are entitled to deference only if "the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a [constitutional] claim." Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 482 (1976). "If federal factfinding is to be avoided" in federal habeas proceedings, "then, in addition to providing a court judgment on the constitutional question, the State must also ensure that its procedures are adequate for the purpose of finding the facts." Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 411 (1986) (finding Florida prisoner entitled to an evidentiary hearing in federal district court because Florida's statutory procedure "fail[ed] to include the prisoner in the truth-seeking process"). Accordingly, although this Court has limited the circumstances under which federal habeas courts may hold evidentiary hearings,17it has done so, in part, to "encourag[e] the full factual development in state court of a claim that state courts committed constitutional error" and to "ensur[e] that full factual development takes place in the earlier, state-court proceedings." Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1, 8­9 (1992), superseded by statute.The adequacy of a state's post-conviction processis especially important in capital cases, wheremeaningful collateral review is essential to the fairadministration of justice and where proper factfinding is crucial to the development of a complete,accurate record on which to base determinations offederal constitutional rights.See VirginiaAssessment, at 225. That is why the ABA'sassessment recommends that Virginia "[p]rovide anevidentiary hearing on any cognizable issue for whichthere is a genuine dispute of fact, thereby ensuringthat factual findings are made after a carefulconsideration of the facts and law and not madesolely by reference to affidavits." Id. at 238; see alsoABA Criminal Justice Standards for Post-ConvictionRemedies, Standard 22-4.6(a) ("A plenary hearing toreceive evidence, by testimony or otherwise, isrequired whenever there are material questions offact which must be resolved in order to determine theproper disposition of the application for relief.")."It cannot be denied that collateral relief proceedings are a central part of the review process for prisoners sentenced to death." Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1, 14 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring). In the vast majority of jurisdictions, including Virginia, post-conviction habeas review is18the sole means for determining whether capital defendants received adequate counsel at trial and on direct appeal. See, e.g., Browning v. Commonwealth, 452 S.E.2d 360, 362, n.2 (Va. Ct. App. 1994) ("Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel may no longer be raised on direct appeal."); see also Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1317­21; Trevino v. Thaler, 133 S. Ct. 1911, 1921 (2013). It is also often the first and only meaningful opportunity to uncover whether convictions or death sentences have been unconstitutionally infected by the misconduct of state agents, including prosecutors, police, jurors, or judges. See, e.g., Wolfe v. Johnson, 565 F.3d 140, 150 (4th Cir. 2009) (death-penalty case where prosecutors coached witnesses and intentionally withheld exculpatory evidence).B. The Virginia Supreme Court's Factual Conclusions Are Not Entitled To Deference.Although the Fourth Circuit was correct to begin with the presumption that a state court's factual conclusions are ordinarily entitled to deference, see, e.g., Harrington, 131 S. Ct. at 785, the absence of an evidentiary hearing and the existence of disputed facts should have prompted the Fourth Circuit to revisit that presumption. Where, as in this case, the state court does not provide any meaningful factual development or any opportunity to test evidence through an adversarial process, the state's factual determinations are unreasonable and the federal court should not defer. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2); see also Brumfield v. Cain, 135 S. Ct. 2269, 2280­81 (2015).19In this case, the Fourth Circuit failed to take account of the many deficiencies in Virginia's postconviction procedures. See Virginia Assessment, at 225­56 (Chapter 8). Instead, it assumed that the Virginia Supreme Court had read and considered petitioner's pivotal evidence undermining the affidavit of his trial counsel merely because the state court denied a motion to strike the relevant affidavit. Gray v. Zook, 806 F.3d 783, 791­92 (4th Cir. 2015). It then speculated why the Virginia Supreme Court might have credited the Commonwealth's evidence over petitioner's, even though the evidence was disputed and had never been tested through a traditional adversarial process. Nowhere did the Virginia Supreme Court discuss the affidavit, explain the implicit credibility findings that the Fourth Circuit assumed had prompted the petition's dismissal, or even attempt to suggest that it "engaged in the difficult process of weighing the credibility of the affiants on a conflicting record." Id. at 802 (Davis, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).The Virginia Supreme Court's resolution ofdisputed facts on the basis of affidavits represents aremarkable departure from both traditionalprocedures and basic understandings of what dueprocess requires. See Honda Motor Co., Ltd. v.Oberg, 512 U.S. 415, 430 (1994) (finding thatOregon's abrogation of well-established common lawprocedures "raises a presumption that its proceduresviolate the Due Process Clause").Properadjudication in this country has always been thoughtto require the application of legal rules to facts that,if disputed, are determined only after the parties are20afforded a fair opportunity to be heard, with the presentation of evidence tested through an adversarial process. Our system does not permit "trial on affidavits." Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986). Instead, "[w]hen evidentiary facts are in dispute, when the credibility of witnesses may be an issue, when conflicting evidence must be weighed, a full trial is clearly necessary regardless of whether it is a bench or jury trial." Federal Judicial Ctr., The Analysis and Decision of Summary Judgment Motions: A Monograph on Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 39 (1991) ("Such disputes are not appropriately resolved on the basis of affidavits. Witnesses should be heard and observed, on direct and cross-examination"); see also ABA Standards for Post-Conviction Remedies, Standard 22-4.6(a).That is why a court's authority to grant summary judgment is limited to motions where there is no "genuine dispute as to any material fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322­23 (1986). That is also why this Court appoints special masters to hear and take evidence in cases falling within its original jurisdiction. See, e.g., Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725 (1981). And it is why appellate courts, which typically are not authorized to take testimony, review evidence, or hear witnesses, generally do not resolve disputed facts in the first instance. See, e.g., Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573­74 (1985).Consistent with these principles, it has long been recognized that "[w]here the facts are in dispute, the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an21evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court." Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 312 (1963), overruled in part on other grounds by Keeney, 504 U.S. at 5 (Keeney did not address Townsend's holding authorizing a federal evidentiary hearing when "the fact-finding procedures employed by the state court [were] not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing," Townsend, 372 U.S. at 313); 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2); Williams, 529 U.S. at 437; cf. Brumfield, 135 S. Ct. at 2277, 2280­81 (finding state court's refusal to grant an evidentiary hearing was unreasonable). If the post-conviction procedures a state elects to provide are not adequate and meaningful, federal courts should not sanitize those flawed procedures in the name of deference. See Gray, 806 F.3d at 802 (Davis, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 346 (2003)).III. There Are Compelling Reasons To Grant Certiorari In This Case.The need for this Court's guidance is especially warranted in light of the important federalism and separation-of-powers concerns raised by Virginia's inadequate post-conviction procedures. Virginia's approach not only harms petitioners with meritorious claims, but it imposes enormous burdens on a federal system that is calibrated to rely on state-court records to evaluate the merits of petitioners' constitutional claims. Federal courts have been left either to defer to inadequate fact-finding and ignore potential constitutional violations (as the court did below), or to put themselves in the position of determining the merits of constitutional claims in the22first instance, contrary to what AEDPA and this Court's precedents generally require.What may be most concerning about Virginia'ssystem is that it affords fewer protections to capitalhabeas petitioners than it does to non-capitalpetitioners. "Death is different" is a reason given forwhy procedures are supposed to be more robust andreview more stringent. See, e.g., Harmelin v.Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 994 (1991). In this Court,death-penalty cases generally receive greaterscrutiny, not less. Virginia appears to take theopposite approach, however, denying capital casesthe careful attention they deserve.TheCommonwealth schedules executions to occur beforethe time allowed for this Court to review petitions forwrits of certiorari in the normal course. See VirginiaAssessment, at 236­37. And it takes other steps toexecute sentences quickly and shield Virginia death-penalty cases from meaningful review. See id. at236­38. Indeed, a 2002 report found that Virginia'serror-detection rate in capital cases was the lowest inthe nation, and two standard deviations below themean for other states with the death penalty. SeeJames S. Liebman, et al., A Broken System, Part II:Why There Is So Much Error in Capital Cases, andWhat Can Be Done About It 68 (2002), available athttp://www2.law.columbia.edu/brokensystem2/report.pdf.The Court should grant review in this case to help restore confidence in the administration of justice in Virginia's death penalty cases. It should take this opportunity to make clear that when a prisoner's life and constitutional rights hang in the23balance, disputed questions of material fact cannot be fairly resolved by a state court without an evidentiary hearing. If a state court resolves disputed material facts without holding an evidentiary hearing, it has failed to make a reasonable determination of the facts, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2), and federal courts should step in to protect the constitutional interests at stake. The problems that infect Virginia's death-penalty procedures, and the court's error below, call for this Court's intervention.24CONCLUSIONThe petition for certiorari should be granted.Respectfully submitted,PAULETTE BROWN Counsel of RecordPRESIDENT AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION 321 North Clark Street Chicago, IL 60654 (312) 988-5000 abapresident@americanbar.orgJune 23, 2016Of Counsel: ASHLEY C. PARRISH MERRITT E. MCALISTER EDMUND T. WANG DAVID P. MATTERN KING & SPALDING LLP
 The American Bar Association respectfully submits that ensuring the full participation of racial and ethnic minorities in the institutions of the legal system of the United States is a compelling state interest, which clearly justifies the use of raceconscious admissions policies.I. THIS COURT HAS SANCTIONED THE USE OF RACE-CONSCIOUS ADMISSIONS POLICIES BY INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION SINCE 1978. This Court sanctioned the use of race-consciousadmissions policies by institutions of higher learning in 1978, when it last addressed the issue in Bakke. In the lead opinion, Justice Powell concluded that under the strict scrutiny test raceconscious admissions served a compelling state interest, although they must not be implemented by a rigid quota system which reserves a "fixed number of places" for persons of a particular race or ethnicity. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316. Justice Powell contrasted such unlawful quotas with permissible policies in which race or ethnicity "may be deemed a `plus' in a particular applicant's file, [but does] not insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats." Id. at 317.1111 In announcing the judgment of this Court, Justice Powell was joined by four Justices who sanctioned race-conscious admissions policies "designed to overcome substantial, chronic minority under-representation<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>8In this Court's most comprehensive recent articulation of the standard for deciding the constitutionality of race-conscious policies, Justice O'Connor, speaking for the Court in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995),12 endorsed the general approach articulated by Justice Powell, holding that all racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny and must be justified by a compelling state interest. Id. at 227. Justice O'Connor went on to explain that the purpose of strict scrutiny is: "to make sure that a governmental classification based on race . . . is legitimate, before permitting unequal treatment based on race." Id. at 228. She concluded:Finally, we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is `strict in theory, but fatal in fact.' The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country, is an unfortunate reality and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.where there is reason to believe that the evil addressed is a product of past racial discrimination." Bakke, 438 U.S. at 366.12 Adarand involved a minority set-aside for public construction projects. Such programs are different in kind from race-conscious admissions policies that are used to ensure that racial and ethnic minorities participate in higher education and in the democratic institutions that are fundamental to our government.<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>9Id. at 237 (citation omitted). Over the past quarter century our nation's law schools, in reliance on Bakke, have used raceconscious admissions policies successfully to foster the inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities in their student bodies.1313 "[A]ny departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification." Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203, 212 (1984); see also Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 443 (2000); Adarand, 515 U.S. at 231 (1995); Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 864 (1992). To determine the existence of special justifications, the Court looks to reliance on the established rule, the workability of that rule and whether the law or the understanding of society has so changed that the rule is plainly indefensible.

ENSURING FULL MINORITY PARTICIPATION IN OUR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IS A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST.The compelling public interest in minority participation in the institutions of our democratic government is beyond dispute. Full participation by racial and ethnic minorities in the institutions of the legal system is especially crucial to our democracy.A. Full Participation by Racial and Ethnic Minorities in the Legal Profession is Necessary to Ensure Adequate Representation of Minority Interests.Ensuring that racial and ethnic minorities are members of the legal profession is a compelling state interest. American society is diverse, and growing more so each year. Full participation in the legal profession by racial and ethnic minorities is a sine qua non for the effective functioning of the legal system and for the legitimacy of our system of government. Twenty-four of our nation's forty-two presidents have been lawyers.14 Twenty-three of our nation's current governors hold law degrees.15 Lawyers have long been the single largest occupational group in the Congress. In the last session of Congress, 53 senators and 162 representatives were14 PresidentialOccupationsathttp://members.aol.com/_ht_a/DOWNINDAPARISH2/president.htm (lastvisited Feb. 6, 2003).15 National Governors Association, Fast Facts on Governors, at http://www.nga.org/governors/1,1169,C_TRIVIA^D__2163,00.html (last visited Feb. 6, 2003).<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>11 lawyers.16 At the point where the legal system impinges upon and often determines the fortunes of its citizens, members of the public can speak effectively only through lawyers, and their fate is often determined by the judiciary.16 Mildred L. Amer, The Library of Congress, Membership of the 107th Congress: A Profile 3 (2001).<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>12Effective representation of our nation's minorities depends upon their full participation in all of the institutions that comprise our legal system. This is not to say that a person's interests are determined by his or her race or ethnicity. Rather, it means that the interests of minority groups cannot be adequately considered or represented without their participation in meaningful numbers in our legal system.17 Lawyers, judges and public officials who share a common membership in a minority group typically share a body of experience that is not shared or fully understood by those who are not members of that minority group.18 It is only through17 See Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493, 503-04 (1972) (plurality opinion) ("[W]e are unwilling to make the assumption that the exclusion of Negroes has relevance only for issues involving race. When any large and identifiable segment of the community is excluded from jury service, the effect is to remove from the jury room qualities of human nature and varieties of human experience, the range of which is unknown and perhaps unknowable. It is not necessary to assume that the excluded group will consistently vote as a class in order to conclude, as we do, that its exclusion deprives the jury of a perspective on human events that may have unsuspected importance in any case . . . .").18 At a time when they numbered fewer than 1,500 throughout the country, it was primarily African-American lawyers who persevered in the decades long litigation required to bring an end to the reign of Jim Crow. Jack Greenberg, the former Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, describes how in 1961, he established "lawyer training institutes" for African-American lawyers, because "[a]lmost no southern white lawyers would then handle civil rights cases." Jack Greenberg, In Memoriam -Marvin E. Frankel, 102 Colum. L. Rev. 1743, 1744 (2002). Fred D. Gray, an African-American attorney for the plaintiffs in Browder v. Gayle, 142 F. Supp. 707 (D.C. Ala. 1956), aff'd, 352 U.S. 903 (1956), and the current President of the Alabama State Bar, described how his experience riding segregated buses in Montgomery, Alabama, directly led to his decision to study law and his commitment to the litigation which ended segregated<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>13the articulation of these diverse experiences and the ensuing give-and-take within the institutions which comprise our legal system and our democracy that racial and ethnic minority interests can be adequately protected and represented.Members of racial and ethnic minorities bring to the bench and bar the unique perspectives that are necessary for effective representation of minority interests. As Justice O'Connor said of former Justice Thurgood Marshall:Although all of us come to the court with our own personal histories and experiences, Justice Marshall brought a special perspective . . . . Justice Marshall imparted not only his legal acumen but also his life experiences, constantly pushing and prodding us to respond not only to the persuasiveness of legal argument but also to the power of moral truth.busing. He states: "I made a secret pledge that I would become a lawyer, return to Alabama, pass the bar exam, and destroy everything segregated I could find." Fred D. Gray, Civil Rights -- Past, Present and Future, Part II, 64 Ala. Law. 8, 8 (2003). Similarly, Eric Yamamoto describes how he and other Japanese-American lawyers reopened the Japanese internment case of Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), despite the advice of former Supreme Court Justice Goldberg to "forget it, you haven't a chance." Eric K.

Sandra Day O'Connor, Thurgood Marshall: The Influence of a Raconteur, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 1217 (1992). Likewise, Judge Leon Higginbotham, Jr. has recognized the importance of judicial diversity, noting that it "creates a milieu in which the entire judicial system benefits from multi-faceted experiences with individuals who came from different backgrounds."1919 A.

Yet, for most of our nation's history that was the state of affairs.2220 U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Dep't of Commerce, U.S. Summary: 20002,tbl.DP-1(July2002)availableathttp://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kprof00-us.pdf.21 U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Demographic Trends in the 20th Century 80 (Nov. 2002) (measuring growth of population in last twenty years).22 The Civil Rights movement highlighted the inherent deficiency of an exclusionary white justice system which failed in its basic mission to protect minorities from racial assaults or to punish their perpetrators.

The march of litigation which led to this Court's landmark decisions in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), and Bakke, began in our nation's law schools. Since Missouri ex. rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. 337 (1938), this Court has recognized the importance of the public interest in enabling racial minorities to participate effectively in our legal system. In Missouri ex. rel. Gaines, this Court held that the Equal Protection Clause required the State of Missouri to provide a legal education to plaintiff Gaines, an African-American, at the Missouri State Law School because such an education was necessary to enable Mr. Gaines to function effectively as a member of the Missouri bar. See id.; see also Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950);24 McLaurin v. Oklahoma State23 In 1950, there were approximately 1450 African-American lawyers inthe United States, out of a total of 221,605 lawyers, servicing a populationof 150.7 million, 10% of whom were African-Americans.

This is even more important for racial minorities in light of this country's history of discrimination and racial exclusion. Many marginalized members of society understandably put their trust more readily in lawyers who possess a shared background or heritage.27 It is not simply that the availability of such lawyers affects the quality of representation that minority clients receive; it may determine whether that person seeks legal assistance at all. "Effective access to legal representation not only must exist in fact, it must also be perceived by the minority law consumer as existent so that recourse to law for27 Social science studies demonstrate that an individual's race affects trust, self-disclosure, and expectations in a relationship where the care-giver is white and the patient or client is African-American.

Full Participation by Racial and Ethnic Minorities in the Legal Profession is Necessary to Ensure the Legitimacy of Our Democracy.Without effective participation by all segments of society, the legitimacy of our legal system will be imperiled. Our nation's founders recognized that a legitimate government depends upon the participation of all the people. "It is essential to [a republican] government that it be derived from the great body of society, not from . . . a favored class of it . . . ."29In particular, the ability of the judiciary to discharge its constitutional responsibilities "ultimately rests" on "public confidence in it." United States v. Johnson, 323 U.S. 273, 276 (1944); see also Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 407 (1989) ("The legitimacy of the Judicial Branch ultimately depends on its reputation for impartiality and nonpartisanship."). Courts must guard against perceptions that "destroy[] the appearance of justice and thereby cast[] doubt on the integrity of the judicial process." Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 555-56 (1979).28 Erwin N. Griswold, Some Observations on the DeFunis Case, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 512, 517 (1975).29 The Federalist No. 39, at 251 (James Madison) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961) (1788).<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>20In its decisions prohibiting the exclusion of minorities from jury service, this Court expressly has recognized the importance of racial inclusiveness to the perceived fairness of the legal system.30 In these cases, the Court has repeatedly held that the perceived fairness of the judicial system rests upon its racial inclusiveness:[B]e it at the hands of the State or the defense, if a court allows jurors to be excluded because of group bias, [i]t is [a] willing participant in a scheme that could only undermine the very foundation of our system of justice -our citizens' confidence in it. Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 49-50 (1992) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Similarly, the Court has found in legislative redistricting cases that there is a30 These cases rest upon two principles of great importance to this case. The first concerns the harm minorities suffer when they are excluded from the "machinery of justice." Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 406, 410 (1991) (discussing "stigma or dishonor" of inability to participate in justice system). The second is that public confidence in the courts depends upon avoiding the perception of unfairness that results from lack of participation. In Powers, the Court concluded that discrimination in jury selection undermines public confidence in the administration of justice and "invites cynicism" regarding the impartiality of the system. Id. at 412; see also Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 87 (1986) ("The harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community.").<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>21compelling interest in the legitimacy and functioning of the government. See Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234 (2001).Unfortunately, many minorities perceive the justice system as exclusionary and unfair; for much of our history, that has been true. As Alexis de Tocqueville observed many years ago:[O]ppressed [African-Americans] may bring an action at law, but they will find none but whites among their judges and although they may legally serve as jurors, prejudice repels them from that office.31 The perception of legal oppression and the reality that caused it has endured through the years. As W.E.B. Du Bois observed at the beginning of the twentieth century, "[t]he Negro is coming more and more to look upon law and justice, not as protecting safeguards, but as sources of humiliation and oppression."32 Half a century later, Gunnar Myrdal observed such distrust to be a continuing reality: The Negroes, on their side, are hurt in their trust that the law is impartial, that the court and the police are their protection, and, indeed, that they belong to an orderly society which has set up this machinery for common security and welfare. They will not feel confidence in, and loyalty toward, a legal order which is entirely out of their control and which they sense to be inequitable and merely part of the system of caste suppression.3331 1 Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 359 (Vintage Books 1990) (1835).32 W.E.B.

In 1987, the Michigan Supreme Court appointed a task force to study racial, gender and ethnic bias, motivated by the belief of34 Recent history has continued to provide examples of troubling court results that shake the confidence of racial and ethnic minorities in our justice system.

The survey found that 68% of African-Americans said that African-Americans were treated worse in the court system than whites; 43% of whites37 See Michigan Report, supra note 35, at 1. 38 Id. at 67. 39 Id. 40 Id. at 57.<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>25 and 42% of Hispanics agreed.41 Even within the bar, one survey found that 92% of African-American lawyers believe the justice system is as racially biased as other segments of society42 and less than 18% of African-American federal judges believe that the justice system treats African-Americans fairly.43C.

Bowen & Derek Bok, The Shape of the River 5 (1998). 45 Id.<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>27By 1971, 4.8% of the law student population was AfricanAmerican and 1.48% was Hispanic.46 Between 1980 and 2000, the impact of race-conscious admissions standards was felt by the legal profession. African-American participation in the legal profession increased from 2.7% to 5.7%, while Hispanic participation increased from 1% to 4.1%.47 The trend of increasing African-American participation in our nation's law schools halted in 1998 when 2,943 degrees were awarded and has fallen in the years since.48 At the same time, the number of African-American and Hispanic citizens has risen to nearly 25% of the 281.4 million people living in the United States.49While the nation's law schools have made great strides in increasing minority participation in the legal profession since 1970, minorities are still not full participants in the legal profession.50 But it is unquestionable that the improvement in46 American Bar Association, Minority Enrollment 1971-2001, at http://www.abanet.org/legaled/statistics/ministats.html (last visited Feb. 10, 2003) (data cited reflects 1971 school year); American Bar Association, Legal Education and Bar Admission Statistics, 1963-2001, at http://www.abanet.org/legaled/statistics/le_bastats.html (last visited Feb. 7, 2003) (data reflects 1971 school year).47 U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2001 380 (2001).48 American Bar Association, Minority Degrees Awarded (by ethnicgroup)1980-2001,athttp://www.abanet.org/legaled/statistics/mindegrees.html (last visited Feb.10, 2003 ).49 U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Census 2000 Summary File 1, at http://www.census.gov/population/cen2000/phct9/tab01.pdf (released Feb. 25, 2002).50 In most cities, less than three percent of law partners are minorities, who are often "partners without power", clustered at the bottom of firm<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>28 minority participation in our law schools, and thus in our legal system, has been achieved largely by the use of race-conscious admissions policies such as those under attack here.During the late 1990s, as demand for legal education rose, interested parties sought judicial and legislative intervention to prohibit the use of race-conscious admissions policies. They succeeded in Texas with the Fifth Circuit's decision in Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th. Cir. 1996), and in California with Proposition 209.51 In the wake of those developments, the law schools of Texas and California were forced to abandon their race-conscious admissions policies. The results were dramatic.management and compensation structures; only 2-8 percent of general counsel in the Fortune 500 companies are minorities.

A precipitous decline in minority participation in the institutions of our legal system, particularly while minority populations are rapidly increasing,54 would damage access by minorities to our legal system, undermine the effectiveness of minority representation and erode the legitimacy of the legal system, which rests upon public perception of inclusivity and fairness.52 Kidder, supra note 23 (manuscript at 31-32). 53 Id. 54 See supra text accompanying notes 20-21.<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>30 For that reason, the ABA, as part of its accreditation process, requires law schools to demonstrate a "commitment to providing full opportunities for the study of law and entry into the profession by qualified members of groups, notably ethnic and racial minorities, which have been victims of discrimination in various forms."55 The ABA's commitment, and the similar commitment by law schools, to consider race as one of many factors affecting admissions decisions rests on its firmly-held "belief that diversity in the student body and the legal profession is important both to a meaningful legal education and to meet the needs of a pluralistic society and profession."5655 American Bar Association, Standards for Approval of Law Schools, Standard 211 (2000 ed.).56 Lawrence Newman, ABA Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, Recommendation on Standard 212 3 (1980).<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>31III. PUBLIC LAW SCHOOLS HAVE A COMPELLING INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES RECEIVE A LEGAL EDUCATION.The constitutions of our nation's fifty states recognize the fundamental importance of education to our republican form of government and impose a duty upon the states to provide public education for their citizens and to ensure that such education is extended to all segments of society. Many of our state constitutions explicitly recognize that universal public education is necessary because "[a] general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence [is] essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people . . . ." Cal. Const. art IX, § 1. To the same effect, see Ind. Const. art. VIII, § 1; Me. Const. art. VIII, § 1; Mass. Const. pt. 2, C. 5, § 2; Mo. Const. art. IX, § 1(a); N.H. Const. pt. 2 art. 83; R. I. Const. art. XII, § 1; Tex. Const. art. VII, § 1.Other constitutions proclaim that because "[t]he stability of a republican form of government depend[s] mainly upon the intelligence of the people, it is the duty of the legislature to establish a general and uniform system of public schools." Minn. Const. art. XIII, § 1; see also Idaho Const. art. IX, § 1; S.D. Const. art. VIII, § 1; N.D. Const. art. VIII, § 1. The Michigan Constitution provides that "knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 1.The diffusion of knowledge is the goal of public education generally. George Washington, an ardent supporter of a national university to educate citizens from all parts of the country and from all backgrounds, said:Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness. . . . To the security of a free Constitution it contributes in various ways: by convincing those who are<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>32entrusted with the public adminstration, that every valuable end of Government is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people and by teaching the people themselves to know, and to value their own rights; to discern and provide against invasions of them; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of lawful authority.57 Benjamin Rush, another eighteenth century proponent of public education, said of the importance of the diffusion of knowledge, "where knowledge is confined to a few people, we always find monarchy, aristocracy, and slavery."58 The diffusion of knowledge through state institutions of higher education must extend to all racial and ethnic groups to help ensure our democracy. Among the many subjects of public education, knowledge of law is of primary importance. Legal education perpetuates the rule of law, upon which the very legitimacy of all governmental decisions depends. Accordingly, when a state such as Michigan seeks to ensure that public legal education is not confined to a few people, it is acting in furtherance of a compelling interest. In Bakke, Justice Powell observed that: [a]cademic freedom . . . long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment. The freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body.57 George Washington, Address to Both Houses of Congress (Jan. 8, 1970), in Annals of Cong. 970 (Gales & Seaton ed., 1790).58 Benjamin Rush, A Plan for the Establishment of Public Schools and the Diffusion of Knowledge in Pennsylvania (1786), reprinted in Essays on Education in the Early Republic 2 (Frederick Rudolph ed., 1965).<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>33438 U.S. at 312. Justice Powell recognized that the University of California had a "countervailing constitutional interest" in deciding its admissions policies, that its race-conscious admissions policy was a matter of "paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission," and that a university must have wide discretion in making the sensitive judgments as to whom should be admitted, so long as those judgments did not result in awarding a "fixed number of places" on the basis of race. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 313, 316.The use of race-conscious admissions policies by public law schools such as the University of Michigan, implemented pursuant to this Court's decision in Bakke, represents a reasonable effort on the part of the law schools to respond to the under-representation of minorities in our legal system. Until recently, such under-representation was the result of deliberate government policies intended to deny racial and ethnic minorities their democratic right to participate in our government.The call now for color-blind admissions policies for public institutions of higher education seeks to shift to racial and ethnic minorities the full burden of our long history of slavery, racial segregation and other official policies intended to exclude racial and ethnic minorities. As Justice Marshall observed in Bakke:Most importantly, had the Court been willing in 1896 in Plessy v. Ferguson, to hold that the Equal Protection Clause forbids the differences in treatment based on race, we would not be faced with this dilemma in 1978. We must remember, however, that the principle that the "Constitution is color blind" appeared only in the opinion of the lone dissenter. The majority of the Court rejected the principle of color blindness, and for the next 60 years, from Plessy to Brown v. Board of Education, ours was a<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>34nation where, by law, an individual could be given `special treatment' based on the color of his skin. 438 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted). Since Brown v. Board of Education, this Court has made great strides in undoing the legacy of Plessy, often by sanctioning narrowly directed raceconscious actions. This has not been done to exclude, but rather to include those previously left out. The goal of the University of Michigan Law School's race-conscious admissions policy -- the education of both majority and minority students to ensure their effective participation in the institutions of government -- is fundamental and compelling; and the law school's good faith efforts to reach this goal is entitled to some measure of deference. Only if law schools are permitted some reasonable latitude to consider race and ethnicity in their admissions decisions will they be able to accomplish one of the fundamental goals of a democratic government, the diffusion of knowledge through a racially and ethnically diverse student body.<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>35CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth herein, the American Bar Association respectfully urges this Court to affirm the Sixth Circuit ruling that the University of Michigan Law School's admissions policy is constitutional.February 18, 2003.Of Counsel: Paul M.

I. This Case Is Exceptionally Important Because the Final Rule Deprives Death Row Prisoners of Competent Representation by Counsel.The Final Rule challenged in this case fails to properly implement Chapter 154. Chapter 154 permits a State to institute expedited capital habeas corpus proceedings if the U.S. Attorney General finds that the State has provided death-sentenced inmates with competent, adequately compensated, and adequately resourced counsel in state post-conviction proceedings.Chapter 154 reflects a legislative compromise: if a State has "established a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State post-conviction proceedings," it may "fast track" habeas litigation by, among other things, shortening the statute of limitations for filing a habeas petition from one year to six months. See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 331 (1997). The Final Rule disrupts that compromise, allowing States to institute "fast track" habeas proceedings even where they fail to provide competent state postconviction counsel.A. Capital Habeas Cases Are Extraordinarily Complex and Demanding Criminal Matters.No one could reasonably dispute that capital habeas cases are among the most complex proceedings in the criminal justice system. These matters require not just the guiding hand of counsel, but an expert and experienced guiding hand.6This Court has explicitly recognized that postconviction and capital representation require expertise beyond the skill set of many appointed counsel. See, e.g., McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 854 n.2 (1994) ("Counsel appointed to represent capital defendants in post-conviction proceedings must meet more stringent experience criteria than attorneys appointed to represent noncapital defendants under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964"); Martel v. Clair, 565 U.S. 648, 659 (2012) ("[Congress has] aim[ed] in multiple ways to improve the quality of representation afforded to capital petitioners and defendants alike . . . [reflecting] a determination that quality legal representation is necessary in all capital proceedings to foster fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty."2Similarly, the Judicial Conference of the United States has recognized the importance of particularized experience when handling postconviction capital cases. See Judicial Conference of the United States, Committee on Defender Services, Subcommittee on Federal Death Penalty Cases, Federal Death Penalty Cases: Recommendations Concerning the Cost and Quality of Defense2 (Internal citation omitted.) See also Hodges v. Epps, No. 1:07CV-66 MPM, 2010 WL 3655851, at *18 n.11 (N.D. Miss. Sept. 13, 2010) (granting habeas relief based on ineffective counsel and noting that defense counsel "was not qualified under the [ABA Guidelines] to take on this representation"); Colvin-El v. Nuth, No. Civ.A. AW 97-2520, 1998 WL 386403, at *6 (D. Md. July 6, 1998) ("Given the extraordinarily complex body of law and procedure unique to post-conviction review, an attorney must, at minimum, have some experience in that area before he or she is deemed `competent'").7Representation 21 (May 1998) (recommending that authorities appointing counsel for death-sentenced inmates "consider the attorney's experience in federal post-conviction proceedings and in capital postconviction proceedings"); see also Jon B. Gould & Lisa Greenman, Report to the Committee on Defender Services, Judicial Conference of the United States: Update on the Cost and Quality of Defense Representation in Federal Death Penalty Cases 88 (Sept. 2010) (recognizing the perspective of postconviction specialists that there is "little time available for inexperienced counsel to `learn the ropes,' and no safety net if they fail"). As a result, the Judicial Conference promulgated Criminal Justice Act guidelines counseling courts to consider postconviction and capital litigation experience when making appointments for death-sentenced defendants under 18 U.S.C. § 3599. See 7A Guide to Judiciary Policy, Appointment of Counsel in Capital Cases, § 620 (2014).Indeed, in enacting AEDPA, Congress made the same finding regarding the need to secure competent counsel in capital cases through post-conviction proceedings. During the legislative process leading to the enactment of AEDPA, the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Habeas Corpus in Capital Cases issued a report stressing that "the provision of competent counsel for prisoners under capital sentence throughout both state and federal collateral review is crucial to ensuring fairness and protecting the constitutional rights of capital litigants." 135 Cong. Rec. S13471-04 (1990).Adequate and experienced counsel in capital cases can, quite literally, mean the difference between life and death. Death penalty counsel must8be aware of frequently changing legal principles, scientific and forensic developments, and psychological concerns. Counsel also must be able to develop and implement strategies that apply existing procedures to the pressure-filled environment of such complex, high-stakes litigation. And counsel must anticipate changes in the law that could result in changes to underlying rulings.The need for qualified counsel exists not only in the context of habeas petitions, but also in the broader realm of post-conviction litigation. Representing a capital defendant requires identifying all statutory deadlines, including those for both postconviction motions and habeas petitions. These are a tangled web, beyond those in other types of cases. And the failure to meet any of these deadlines could result in the dismissal of a death-row inmate's case.Zealous advocacy for a capital defendant requires reinvestigating the case, including a complete examination of the facts underlying the conviction and sentence, as well as possible judicial bias, prosecutorial misconduct, or inadequate performance by trial counsel. Post-conviction attorneys must also search for mitigation evidence that was not presented at trial, including possible mental health defenses. Further, post-conviction counsel has a professional obligation to raise and preserve all meritorious arguments, including challenges to a client's conviction and sentence, as well as constitutional challenges such as possible Eighth Amendment violations.These requirements exist because of the critical role of the post-conviction process as a safeguard against unjust convictions and death sentences. The ABA has a long history of recruiting and training9post-conviction counsel and has observed the life-anddeath difference that qualified counsel makes in a capital case. When post-conviction counsel does not conduct a thorough investigation or does not meet statutory deadlines, the inmate often proceeds to execution without federal court review of some or all of his claims. This has resulted in the execution of individuals who otherwise likely would have been entitled to relief, such as individuals with intellectual disabilities and those who may be actually innocent. For these reasons, the ABA Guidelines make clear that "for post-judgment review to succeed as a safeguard against injustice, courts must appoint appropriately trained and experienced lawyers." ABA Guidelines 1.1, commentary, at 931.The Final Rule essentially ignores these realities.B. The Final Rule Fails to Require Adequate Legal Representation.The Final Rule fails to achieve the promise inherent in the compromise that States, in order to qualify for the fast-track, must provide competent state post-conviction counsel for death-row prisoners. These failings are evident in two critical areas that the district court below noted but the Ninth Circuit failed to consider.1. The Final Rule fails to provide substantive criteria by which the Attorney General can determine that a State's appointment mechanism provides for competent counsel. As the district court noted, "when an agency utterly fails to provide a standard for its decision, it runs afoul of more than one provision of the Administrative Procedures Act." See Pet. App. 59a.10Respondents' failure to adopt substantive criteria is manifest in its inclusion of a so-called "catch-all" provision in the Final Rule, codified at 28 C.F.R. § 26.22(b)(2), which allows the Attorney General to certify a State if the State's mechanism appears to "otherwise reasonably assure a level of proficiency appropriate for State post-conviction litigation in capital cases." Such an open-ended, "we know it when we see it" justification for agency action is a textbook example of arbitrary and capricious conduct. See, e.g., Airmark Corp. v. FAA, 758 F.2d 685, 695 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (concluding it is arbitrary and capricious to fail "to provide a consistent approach that would allow even a guess as to what the decisional criteria would be").Most critically, the Final Rule does incorporate or otherwise reflect well-recognized standards for the appointment of competent post-conviction counsel. For example, the Final Rule fails to reference objective standards such as the ABA Guidelines, which have been widely cited and utilized by courts as guides to important counsel qualifications and reasonable counsel performance in capital cases.33 See, e.g., Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U.S. 4 (2009); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374 (2005); Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175 (2004); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003); Saranchak v. Sec'y, Pa. Dep't of Corr., 802 F.3d 579, 595-96 (3d Cir. 2015); Bemore v. Chappell, 788 F.3d 1151, 1168 (9th Cir. 2015); United States v. Fields, 761 F.3d 443, 453 (5th Cir. 2014) Littlejohn v. Trammell, 704 F.3d 817, 859-60 (10th Cir. 2013); Stephens v. Sec'y, Florida Dep't of Corr., 678 F.3d 1219, 1229 n.2 (11th Cir. 2012); Foust v. Houk, 655 F.3d 524, 534 (6th Cir. 2011); Ortiz v. United States, 664 F.3d 1151, 1163 (8th Cir. 2011); Gray v. Branker, 529 F.3d 220, 229 (4th Cir. 2008);112. The Final Rule also fails to require that a State's own standards have been enforced in a manner that ensures that the State is actually providing indigent capital defendants with competent counsel. The Final Rule focuses on whether a State has competency standards, but not on whether those standards are honored in the breach. As the district court noted, there is a difference between a State adopting standards and ensuring that appointed counsel meet those standards. See Pet. App. 54a-58a. Simply put, "competency standards are meaningless unless they are actually applied in the appointment process." Baker v. Corcoran, 220 F.3d 276, 286 (4th Cir. 2000); see also Spears v. Stewart, 283 F.3d 992, 1002 (9th Cir. 2002).The Ninth Circuit's side-stepping of the merits in this case exposes death-sentenced inmates to a very real possibility of representation by incompetent counsel. These defendants are thus at risk of execution despite viable constitutional claims forStevens v. McBride, 489 F.3d 883, 895 (7th Cir. 2007); Canape v. State, No. 62843, 2016 WL 2957130, at *3 n.7 (Nev. May 19, 2016); In re Welch, 61 Cal. 4th 489, 515 (Cal. 2015); Chatman v. Walker, 297 Ga. 191, 202 (Ga. 2015); State v.

As the district court recognized, under the current Final Rule, even the most qualified counsel will struggle to fulfill their professional responsibilities in the face of uncertain timeframes for filing thorough habeas petitions. Pet. App. 81a. Thousands of prisoners across the country may be subject to expedited deadlines without having been provided the effective assistance of state postconviction counsel, which Congress explicitly intended States to provide in order to institute expedited proceedings under Chapter 154, and upon which the lives of these defendants depend.II. The Ninth Circuit's Decision On Standing Is Wrong.An organization can establish its standing to sue in at least two ways. It can demonstrate representational or associational standing on behalf of its members, where its members would themselves have standing to sue. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975). Additionally, an organization can bring suit on its own behalf based on an injury to the organization itself. Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 n.19 (1982). Demonstrating one of either (1) a direct injury to the lawyer members or (2) injury to the organization itself is sufficient to support an organization's standing to sue.Petitioners established both.A. The Final Rule Directly Injures Petitioners' Lawyer Members.Petitioners have demonstrated standing on behalf of their members because the Final Rule fundamentally alters the procedural landscape in which capital counsel must advise and represent13their current clients. This change presents an "actual or imminent" harm--it is not "conjectural or hypothetical." Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (internal citations omitted).Under the Final Rule, the Attorney General is empowered to grant retroactive certification to a State. The existence of this authority forces capital defense counsel to make strategic decisions under the cloud that any habeas petitions filed outside of the 180-day window may subsequently and retroactively be deemed to be untimely. And because the Final Rule lacks substantive certification criteria, such a determination by the Attorney General is entirely unpredictable. This fundamentally changes the bargain that was struck in Chapter 154. Instead of a reasoned tradeoff between competent counsel and accelerated filing deadlines, the Final Rule creates a high-stakes guessing game.As a result of the Final Rule, counsel must prognosticate whether any current or future Attorney General might decide that a State's mechanism is adequate, without any meaningful guidance as to what an adequate system looks like. Regardless of the actual adequacy of a state mechanism, Counsel for death-sentenced individuals must compress their preparation into an abbreviated timeframe or risk that their clients will forfeit all federal court review of their claims.The Ninth Circuit concluded that Petitioners suffered no injury because "assisting and counseling clients in the face of legal uncertainty is the role of lawyers." Pet. App. 18a. But the impact of the Final Rule is not limited to the type of "legal uncertainty" that is inherent in lawyering, and the Ninth Circuit's14analysis of the Final Rule's impact on Petitioners is far too simplistic.Under the Final Rule, until the Attorney General rules on a State's application for "fast-tracked" habeas proceedings, Petitioners cannot predict whether a petitioner's habeas petition filing window is 365 days or 180 days. This uncertainty affects both state and federal post-conviction proceedings. Although the plain language of Chapter 154 applies only to federal proceedings, the filing of a state petition almost inevitably affects the deadline for the federal petition, because the filing of the state petition tolls the statute of limitations for filing a federal petition, which typically cannot be filed until state proceedings are complete. So if, for example, a state post-conviction counsel uses six months to prepare her client's state habeas petition, absent certification of the relevant State for expedited proceedings, the client will still have six months following the completion of state habeas proceedings to prepare and file the federal petition. However, should the Attorney General certify the relevant State's mechanism during the course of the state habeas proceedings, depending on the extent of retroactivity of the certification, the 180-day statute of limitations period may already have run, eliminating any opportunity for federal court review of the case.The practical impact of the Rule, therefore, is toinject an untenable level of uncertainty into theentire post-conviction process--both at the state andfederal levels. And this uncertainty creates anunresolvable conflict between key professionalobligations of Petitioners.Petitioners are15professionally obligated to use all available time and resources to conduct a thorough factual and legal investigation in support of their clients' petitions, but they also are bound by the deadlines for a timely habeas petition. Of course meeting deadlines is a burden all litigators bear, and preparing a case with those deadlines in mind is part of the art of litigating. But under the Final Rule, capital counsel cannot prepare their cases with any known deadline in mind. Thus, they face an intractable choice: either to forego their responsibilities to conduct the thorough, longer-term investigations that, following the ABA Guidelines, they would undertake under a 360-day deadline, or to undertake such longer-term investigations in service of their clients' life-anddeath interests but risk having petitions retroactively deemed untimely.This dilemma forced upon Petitioners under the Final Rule does not merely require them to sharpen their professional skills in "assisting and counseling clients in the face of legal uncertainty," as the Ninth Circuit opined. Pet. App. 18a. Petitioners are not pursuing this case merely to "make the scope of their clients' rights clearer and their strategies to vindicate those rights more easily selected." Id. 19a. Petitioners challenge the Final Rule because it precludes them from devising any acceptable strategy to fulfill their professional responsibilities as habeas counsel.Consider, for example, an attorney employed by Petitioner Arizona Federal Defender's Office who represents capital clients in post-conviction litigation.16The State of Arizona currently has an application submitted and pending before the Attorney General.4 The Attorney General may grant that application, certifying Arizona for "fast-track" habeas proceedings, which could be applicable retroactively to the date when Arizona first implemented its mechanism for the appointment and compensation of counsel.That the attorney does not know whether her client will have six months or one year to file a habeas petition, or whether the certification for "fasttrack" proceedings will be retroactive, inevitably undermines her ability to represent her client in accordance with the ABA Guidelines. To follow the Guidelines, the attorney must, as an initial matter, thoroughly investigate her client's case before filing a habeas petition. Guideline 10.7 provides that an attorney:ha[s] an obligation to conduct thorough and independent investigations relating to the issues of both guilt and penalty. . . . Counsel at every stage has an obligation to conduct a full examination of the defense provided to the client at all prior phases of the case. . . . Counsel at every stage have an obligation to satisfy themselves independently that the official record of the proceedings is complete and to supplement it as appropriate.4 Habeas Corpus Res. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, No. 13-4517 CW, 2014 WL 3908220, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2014).17The comments to Guideline 10.7 advise counsel to collect all information that could be potentially relevant to the investigation. ABA Guidelines 10.7, commentary, at 1024. Counsel should, for example, "interview the client's family members . . . , and virtually everyone else who knew the client and his family, including neighbors, teachers, clergy, case workers, doctors, correctional, probation, or parole officers, and others." Id. Further, "[c]ounsel should use all appropriate avenues including signed releases, subpoenas, court orders, and requests or litigation pursuant to applicable open records statutes, to obtain all potentially relevant information pertaining to the client, his or her siblings and parents, and other family members . . . ." Id. at 1025. Guideline 10.8 further counsels an attorney to consider and assert all potential legal claims after "thoroughly investigat[ing] the basis for each potential claim before reaching a conclusion as to whether it should be asserted . . . ." ABA Guidelines § 10.8(A)(2), supra.The factual and legal investigations contemplated by the Guidelines are time-consuming. Indeed, this Court has recognized the "time needed by habeas counsel to investigate claims" and "the harms created by last-minute petitions in capital cases." Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314, 330 (1996). As one federal court of appeals judge put it:Federal counsel need adequate time to investigate, research, and prepare proper capital habeas corpus petitions. Prior to even beginning work on the petition, federal counsel must collect and read the record, establish a relationship with the client, assemble a team that includes18mitigation experts and fact investigators, and make preliminary evaluations regarding such matters as client competency, mental retardation, and mental health issues, as well as comply with the ABA Guidelines. . . . [O]ne year is barely sufficient time to file a federal capital habeas corpus petition even when the petitioner is represented by experienced, institutionally-funded, fulltime, federal defender staff well versed in capital habeas litigation.Lugo v. Sec., Fla. Dep't of Corr., 750 F.3d 1198, 1219 (11th Cir. 2014) (Martin, J., concurring) (emphasis and citation omitted).It is virtually impossible for an attorney representing a capital defendant to comply with the competing obligations of meeting an uncertain deadline and submitting a thoroughly investigated and researched petition. She must either voluntarily forfeit half the time allotted to prepare a petition in order to meet a potential statutory deadline, or conduct a full investigation and risk missing an actual deadline. In either situation, the attorney violates a professional obligation and thereby suffers concrete injury.The Ninth Circuit's characterization of the impact of the Final Rule as merely creating "legal uncertainty" erroneously trivializes the impact of the Final Rule on Petitioners. Not all uncertainty in the legal profession is created equal. While Petitioners undoubtedly must often make strategic decisions without the benefit of all relevant facts, and deal with uncertainty as to the applicability of laws to a given case, they face a distinctly different type of19impact--an immediate and concrete injury--when the procedural landscape can be upended in a way that cannot be predicted. Procedural uncertainty that forces Petitioners, right now, to choose among competing professional obligations does not simply require them to change their legal strategies--it causes them distinct and present injury by precluding them from being able to plan so as to fulfill their professional obligations. That is an injury of the first order and the court of appeals should have reviewed the Final Rule on the merits.B. The Final Rule Directly Injures The Defender Organizations.The Final Rule does more than impair individual lawyers' compliance with the professional standards reflected in the ABA Guidelines. The Final Rule also injures defender organizations as they seek to conduct their operations and pursue their organizational missions.As this Court held in Havens, an organization suffers an "injury in fact" when another party's conduct "ha[s] perceptibly impaired" that organization's ability to carry out its objectives. Havens, 455 U.S. at 379. Accordingly, an organization has standing to bring suit where the challenged conduct hinders its activities and forces it to expend additional resources. See id.; Nnebe v. Daus, 644 F.3d 147, 157 (2d Cir. 2011); Sierra Club v. Marita, 46 F.3d 606, 612-13 (7th Cir. 1995); Spann v. Colonial Village, Inc., 899 F.2d 24, 27 (D.C. Cir. 1990); Pacific Legal Foundation v. Goyan, 664 F.2d 1221, 1224 (4th Cir. 1981).The Ninth Circuit effectively ignored the principles established in Havens. There, an20organization whose purpose was "to make equal opportunity in housing a reality," sought to accomplish that objective with "efforts to assist equal access to housing through counseling and other referral services". 455 U.S. at 379. This Court recognized the organization's standing to sue a housing complex that engaged in housing discrimination. Id. The Court's reasoning was straightforward: "Plaintiff . . . has had to devote significant resources to identify and counteract the defendant's . . . racially discriminatory . . . practices." Id. (citing the plaintiff's complaint). Standing existed because there was a "concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization's activities--with the consequent drain on the organization's resources." Id. "[T]here can be no question," the Court emphasized, "that the organization suffered injury in fact" because the discriminatory practices "perceptibly impaired [the organization's] ability to provide counseling and referral services for low-and moderate-income homeseekers." Id.Havens should have been dispositive here. Like the discrimination in Havens, the Final Rule impinges on Petitioners' ability to carry out their organizational missions, which are also reflected in the ABA Guidelines. Guideline 3.1, for instance, calls for the designation of "responsible agencies," which are defined as defender organizations such as Petitioners, that will "ensur[e] that each capital defendant in the jurisdiction receives high quality legal representation." ABA Guidelines 3.1(A)(1), at 944. And Guideline 6.1 urges defender organizations to "implement effectual mechanisms to ensure that the workload of attorneys representing defendants in death penalty cases is maintained at a level that enables counsel to provide each client with high21quality legal representation in accordance with these Guidelines." ABA Guidelines 6.1, at 965. The comments to Guideline 6.1 add that defender organizations should "distribute assignments in light of each attorney's duty under the Rules of Professional Conduct to provide competent representation to a client, which requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation necessary for a complex and specialized area of the law." ABA Guidelines 6.1, commentary, at 969 (internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted).The Final Rule severely undermines Petitioners' ability to distribute their resources in a manner consistent with these Guidelines and Petitioners' organizational missions. In particular, the shortening of the statute of limitations for filing habeas petitions--from one year to a mere 180 days--forces Petitioners into fundamental restructurings of their daily operations. Shortened habeas deadlines naturally affect "the calculation of legal and financial resources available to competently prepare and litigate cases." Pet. App. 132a. The injury is compounded in that this compressed timeline may be applied retroactively. As explained by the Executive Director of Petitioner Habeas Corpus Resource Center ("HCRC"), the threat of retroactively shortened habeas deadlines "requires immediate decisions about whether to commit limited attorney time and financial resources." Pet. App. 137a (emphasis added). Because of the uncertainty created by the Final Rule, Petitioners must immediately begin proceeding along two tracks: in addition to allocating their attorney resources as they would under a one-year habeas deadline, they must simultaneously prepare each case for the possibility that the 180-day deadline might apply.22Petitioners are also prevented by the Final Rule from fulfilling a variety of their other organizational objectives. Petitioner HCRC's activities, for instance, are not limited to representing capital defendants, but also "recruiting members of the private bar to accept death penalty habeas corpus case appointments," Cal. Gov't Code § 68661(c), and "provid[ing] assistance and case progress monitoring as needed," id. § 68661(j). And Petitioner Federal Public Defender for the District of Arizona similarly must provide "assistance, consultation, information and other related services to eligible persons and appointed attorneys regarding federal habeas corpus litigation," United States Dist. Ct. for the Dist. of Ariz., Gen. Order 07-08: Criminal Justice Act Plan § VII(C), and it must "provide training for those attorneys," id. § VII(D).The Final Rule makes carrying out these missions significantly more onerous. Petitioners must expend additional resources, financial and otherwise, providing additional training and counseling to private counsel regarding the added complexities involved in representing a capital defendant on a compressed schedule. Similarly, the uncertainty created by the Final Rule discourages attorneys from stepping up, undermining Petitioners' efforts to recruit counsel to undertake the already imposing task of representing a person sentenced to death. This in turn results in additional expenditures in recruiting.Being forced to undertake such a diversion of resources constitutes concrete organizational harm. See Arcia v. Florida Sec'y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2014) (recognizing voter's rights organization's standing to challenge program purging23ineligible voters from voter rolls because the organization was forced to divert resources to assist incorrectly purged members); Nnebe v. Daus, 644 F.3d at 157 (upholding standing of taxi drivers' union to challenge a procedure for summarily suspending drivers' licenses because the union was forced to divert resources from its core activities to "provid[e] initial counseling, explain[ ] the suspension rules to drivers, and assist[ ] the drivers in obtaining attorneys."); see also e.g., Abigail All. for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. Eschenbach, 469 F.3d 129, 132-33 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Powell v. Ridge, 189 F.3d 387, 404 (3d Cir. 1999).Indeed, the Ninth Circuit itself has relied on the diversion-of-resources theory to confer standing on legal services organizations. See El Rescate Legal Servs., Inc. v. Exec. Off. of Immigr. Rev., 959 F.2d 742 (9th Cir. 1991). In El Rescate, two legal service organizations claimed that the Executive Office for Immigration Review violated the APA by implementing a practice of "using incompetent translators and of not interpreting many portions of immigration court hearings." Id. at 745. The organizations had been "established to assist Central American refugee clients, most of whom are unable to understand English, in their efforts to obtain asylum and withholding of deportation in immigration court proceedings." Id. at 748. The Ninth Circuit held that "[t]he allegation that the EOIR's policy frustrates these goals and requires the organizations to expend resources in representing clients they otherwise would spend in other ways is enough to establish standing." Id. at 748.Petitioners have alleged that the Final Rule has resulted in a large-scale operational restructuring at24the organizational level and further requires them to divert their scarce resources away from other activities central to their organizational mission. When a new action or regulation forces an organization to re-prioritize its activities at the expense of its other initiatives, that organization has suffered a particularized injury.In stark contrast to the decision below, the Second Circuit recently applied Havens to confer organizational standing on groups of lawyers. In N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Authority, an organization of lawyers involved in advocacy and the representation of clients challenged the defendant's policy limiting open-access to its hearings. 684 F.3d 286 (2d Cir. 2015). In holding that the NYCLU had standing on its own behalf as an organization to challenge the policy, the Second Circuit emphasized that the harm to the organization itself is distinct from the harm to the individual members of the organization. Id. at 295 ("[The organization] sues to vindicate its own rights as an organization with goals and projects of its own.") (internal citations omitted). The court tied the organizational injury to the NYCLU's "interest in open access to TAB hearings as a matter of professional responsibility to clients." The court reasoned, "[i]n order to represent clients before the TAB, NYCLU must prepare, in part, by observing TAB hearings. NYCLU has shown that the access policy has impeded, and will continue to impede, the organization's ability to carry out this aforementioned responsibility." Id.In directly contrary reasoning, the Ninth Circuit concluded that Petitioners lack standing to challenge25a rule that forces them to fundamentally alter their operations. Havens commands otherwise.CONCLUSIONThe court below should have addressed the merits of this case of extraordinary, nationwide importance. This Court should grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.Respectfully submitted,LINDA A. KLEIN AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATIONCounsel of Record President American Bar Association 321 N.

Since its inception, the ABA has actively promoted improving the administration of justice and increasing the availability and quality of legal counseling to those who need it. In particular, ensuring that all indigent criminal defendants have appointed counsel has been a cornerstone of the ABA's mission, as reflected in its Goal II: "To promote meaningful access to legal representation and the American system of justice for all persons regardless of their economic or social condition."2The ABA respectfully submits this brief as amicus curiae because this case implicates matters addressed by the Standards for Criminal Justice promulgated by the ABA.3 See generally American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice (2d ed. 1980 & Supp. 1986) (Standards). The Standards have been developed, refined, and approved over more than thirty years by task forces of the ABA made up of prosecutors, judges, defense lawyers, academics, and others, as well as by the wider and diverse membership of the ABA. Although the Standards do not purport to set forth the ABA's views on the requirements of the Constitution, they do represent the consensus of an experienced group of prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges on procedures for a "criminal justice system that is fair, balanced, and constitutionally responsive to the needs of today and the future."4 The Standards have been widely cited, including2 See American Bar Association, ABA Policy and Procedures Handbook 2004-2005, at 1; http://www.abanet.org/about/goals.html.3 The ABA filed an amicus curiae brief directed to the same issue in Kowalski v. Tesmer, 125 S. Ct. 564 (2004), where this Court considered but did not resolve the question presented in this case.4 1 Standards xx; see also Warren E. Burger, Introduction: The ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, 12 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 251, 251-252 (1974) ("The Standards are a balanced, practical work intended to walk the fine line between the protection of society and the protection of the constitutional rights of the accused individual.").3by this Court, as a guide to criminal justice administration.5 Several of the Standards speak directly to the issue inthis case and support the position that all criminal defendants should have counsel on appeal. Most directly, Standard 21-3.2(a), entitled "Counsel on appeal," states:At the first level of appeal, every convicted defendant, appellant or appellee, should have assistance of counsel. For persons without means to obtain adequate legal representation, counsel should be assigned unless the right to counsel is explicitly waived. Assigned counsel should be compensated from public funds.4 Standards at 21.39.The Standards also take the position that denial of appointed counsel on first appeals by indigent defendants represents an unsound deterrent to potentially meritorious appeals. Standard 21-2.3(a), entitled "Unacceptable inducements and deterrents to taking appeals," explains that a system of elective appeals "presupposes that the parties with the right to appeal will choose to do so only when they, with advice of counsel, have identified grounds on which substantial argument can be made for favorable action by the appellate court. The system should not contain factors that induce or deter appeals for other reasons." 4 Standards at 21.25. Standard 21-2.3(c) gives, as a specific example of an unacceptable deterrent to defendants' appeals, "denial of necessary legal assistance and related services at public expense to appellants who cannot afford adequate legal representation." 4 Standards at 21.26.More generally, the ABA opposes restrictions on the ability of convicted criminal defendants to pursue a first ap-5 On several occasions, this Court has found the Standards helpful in ascertaining the proper balance of individual rights and societal interests in the criminal justice system. See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 532 (2003); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 179 (1984); Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 504 (1976).4peal of right. The Standards take the position that all convicted criminal defendants, including those who have pleaded guilty, should have the right to one appeal from a conviction.6 Commentary to the Standards observes that in Anglo-American law, "[t]here is today no dissent from the principle that every convicted defendant should be afforded the opportunity to obtain one judicial review of the conviction by a tribunal other than that in which the defendant was tried." Standard 21-1.1, commentary, 4 Standards at 21.6. That principle is recognized in international law as well. See International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Dec. 16, 1966, art. 14, ¶ 5, 999 U.N.T.S. 171, 177 ("Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law.").Accordingly, the ABA submits this brief in support of the position that a criminal defendant who is required to seek leave to pursue a first appeal from his criminal conviction and who cannot afford appellate counsel should have the assistance of appointed counsel in seeking leave to appeal. Serious problems can arise in the administration of justice when indigent defendants are not assisted by counsel. Those problems are directly implicated in this case. Beyond the obvious harm that would result to indigents who would either have to proceed pro se in seeking leave to appeal or forgo such an opportunity if denied counsel, laws like the6 See Standard 21-1.1(a), 4 Standards at 21.5 ("The possibility of appellate review of trial court judgments should exist for every criminal conviction. It is undesirable to have any class of case in which such trial court determinations are unreviewable."); Standard 21-1.3(a), 4 Standards at 21.10-21.11 ("A defendant should have the right to appeal from any final judgment of a trial court adverse to the defendant, including: (i) a conviction followed by a sentence of probation; (ii) a conviction followed by a sentence suspended as to imposition or execution; or (iii) a conviction based upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere."); Standard 21-2.4, 4 Standards at 21.31 ("At the first level of appeal, procedures intended to eliminate frivolous cases from appellate court dockets without decisions on the merits are impractical and unsound.").5Michigan statute at issue in this case could have a seriously detrimental effect on the indigent defense system as a whole. Ordinarily, the mere potential for an appeal with counsel acts as an effective check on the conduct of all actors in the criminal justice system at the trial level. Eliminating the appointment of appellate counsel for indigent defendants who plead guilty may therefore disadvantage indigent defendants at the trial stage as well as the appellate stage. Because the vast majority of convictions in Michigan and elsewhere result from guilty pleas, these concerns are of pervasive importance to the administration of justice in this country, especially if other States follow Michigan's lead in denying appellate counsel.qsiGpp5Gx¤VuFGxqYiGp0pvFrAny criminal defendant who wishes to pursue a first appeal from his conviction or sentence should have the assistance of counsel in doing so if he so wishes. If the defendant cannot afford counsel, he should be appointed counsel on appeal. An indigent defendant should have such appointed counsel on appeal even if he pleaded guilty, and even if he must seek and obtain leave to appeal.7A. The assistance of counsel is indispensable to a defendant pursuing a first appeal from a conviction or sentence. Appeals are complex, specialized undertakings. They are no less forbidding to the layperson than a criminal trial. Appeals typically require compliance with procedures that are unfamiliar to nonlawyers: filing a notice of appeal, ordering transcripts, preparing and filing briefs. Court rules (including those governing Michigan's leave-to-appeal procedure) generally require defendants to identify the factual7 The Michigan statute under review in this case applies to defendants who have pleaded guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 770.3a(1), (2). For ease of reference, this brief refers to all three kinds of pleas as "guilty pleas." Petitioner apparently pleaded nolo contendere rather than guilty in this case because of concerns about the effect of his plea on a separate civil proceeding. See JA 18.6and legal bases for their appeal. Legal training and skill are needed to identify potentially meritorious claims of error in the record and to ensure that those points of error are properly preserved for appellate review. An unrepresented defendant who fails to discern a point of error, to describe the error properly, or to articulate the correct doctrinal basis for reversal is likely to lose forever any opportunity for reversal of his conviction or sentence.In important respects, a defendant's first appeal from a criminal conviction or sentence (even when leave to appeal is required) is quite different from a discretionary second round of review in a state supreme court, where an indigent defendant does not have a constitutional right to appointed counsel. When a defendant pursues a discretionary second round of review, similar to certiorari in this Court, he ordinarily will have the benefit of briefs that have been filed on his behalf in the intermediate appellate court. An unrepresented defendant seeking to pursue a first appeal from a conviction or sentence will typically not have the benefit of such materials, since many matters are resolved in trial courts without detailed briefing. Moreover, a state supreme court exercising discretionary review can usually determine from the face of the opinion of the lower court whether an issue warrants its review. The same is not true of a court reviewing a defendant's first appeal. Thus, without counsel, a defendant is likely to be adrift on appeal.B. Michigan's decision to deny appointed appellate counsel to indigent defendants who have pleaded guilty lacks a sound basis. Although the State argues that the practice of denying appointed appellate counsel deters meritless appeals, in fact defendants who plead guilty may well have meritorious claims on appeal. For example, the defendant may have pleaded guilty to an offense without having had the nature of the charge accurately explained to him, or the defendant may not have had effective assistance of counsel in the guilty plea process. Without appointed appellate counsel, it is unlikely that such a defendant could obtain relief from such errors in the trial court.7In addition, the Michigan practice inappropriately hobbles defendants who have pleaded guilty in appeals from their sentences. In Michigan, all defendants, whether they have pleaded guilty or were found guilty after trial, are subject to the same sentencing procedures under the State's sentencing guidelines system. There is no justification for deterring indigent defendants who have pleaded guilty, among all defendants, from appealing if the trial court has made an error in construing or applying the guidelines. Moreover, the Michigan guidelines are complex, and opportunities for error abound. A defendant cannot reasonably be expected to discern and pursue claims of sentencing error without the assistance of counsel.C. The ABA recognizes that States have a legitimate interest in reducing and preventing appellate backlog, but the approach chosen by Michigan is neither necessary nor appropriate to that task. The state courts can provide for disposition of particular cases or classes of cases on separate tracks and can use court staff to identify cases to be so treated. The assistance of counsel, however, is not a luxury that can be dispensed with on appeal any more than at trial.It is, rather, an essentiaGl pxaqrtiGopf apvYfar ir system of justice.

This Court has long recognized the critical need that indigent defendants have for the assistance of counsel in defending themselves against prosecution by the State. In cases applying the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees a defendant the assistance of counsel at trial, this Court has explained that "[t]he right [of a defendant] to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not compre-8hend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. . . . He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him." Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68-69 (1932); see also Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963) ("[I]n our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an obvious truth."). The Court's decisions under the Sixth Amendment reflect "the recognition and awareness that an unaided layman ha[s] little skill in arguing the law or in coping with an intricate procedural system." United States v. Ash, 413 U.S. 300, 307 (1973).The same concerns have led this Court to identify a similar right under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses to the assistance of counsel on a first appeal. As the Court has observed, "[t]o prosecute the appeal, a criminal appellant must face an adversary proceeding that--like a trial--is governed by intricate rules that to a layperson would be hopelessly forbidding. An unrepresented appellant--like an unrepresented defendant at trial--is unable to protect the vital interests at stake." Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 396 (1985). Recognizing that nonlawyers generally lack the legal skills and training needed to discern the legally and factually promising bases for appeal, the Court has emphasized that "lawyers are `necessities, not luxuries' in our adversarial system of justice . . . . The defendant's liberty depends on his ability to present his case in the face of `the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public prosecutor.' " Id. at 394 (quoting Gideon, 372 U.S. at 344, and Ash, 413 U.S. at 309).88 Indigent defendants also need the advice of counsel in deciding whether to appeal. In many cases, it may not be in the defendant's best interest to appeal, but a defendant may not recognize that point without the advice of an attorney. If a defendant succeeds in having his plea or sentence overturned on appeal, he may be subject to a longer sentence9An unrepresented defendant faces challenges on appeal that are equally as daunting as those at a trial. For example, anyone pursuing an appeal typically must file a notice of appeal in the proper form and in the proper court, designate the record for appeal, order transcripts, and specify the points to be raised on appeal. In addition, in Michigan, a defendant who must apply for leave to appeal must state the factual and legal basis for any claim of error to be raised on appeal, which presumably requires specific references to the record if such claims are to appear meritorious to the reviewing court. See JA 68-71. All of this must be done within strict deadlines and while the defendant is incarcerated (as is generally the case with defendants who have pleaded guilty). In many cases, the application for leave to appeal may have to be filed before the complete record on appeal will have been prepared. See MCR 7.205 (directing that application for leave to appeal be filed within 21 days after judgment, but noting circumstances in which transcript may not yet be available). Thus, an indigent defendant cannot assume that the record by itself will be sufficient to allow an appellate court to discern the presence of error. 9after retrial, replea, or resentencing. See Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794 (1989). The defendant may not recognize this risk and may not understand that additional, potentially detrimental factors bearing on his sentence may be taken into account on resentencing (such as additional convictions that became final, his record in prison, or errors that were overlooked by the original sentencing court).9 In this case, for example, it appears that the transcript of petitioner's plea hearing was not prepared until more than seven months after sentencing (JA 3-5)--long after the 21-day deadline for filing an application for leave to appeal (MCR 7.205(A)). Thus, the petitioner in this case was effectively forced to file a late application for leave to appeal in order to explain the basis for his claim of error to the appellate court. Convicted defendants in Michigan are allowed to file late applications for leave to appeal within 12 months after the conviction is entered, but the court of appeals must consider the reason for and length of the delay in deciding whether to grant leave to appeal. MCR 7.205(E)(1). Thus, even if the defendant could not apply for leave to appeal within 21 days of his conviction because his transcript had not been prepared, the court of appeals might deny his application for leave to appeal because it concluded that he10Lacking the advice and assistance of counsel, an indigent defendant would be seriously disadvantaged in preparing an application for leave to appeal. For example, a defendant who wished to challenge his guilty plea on the ground that his trial counsel or the trial court had erred in explaining the nature of the charge against him would surely need the assistance of appellate counsel to explain the deficiency, especially if the error involved misconstruction of the elements of the offense. Cf. Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 618 (1998) (guilty plea may be involuntary if court and counsel err in explaining elements of the offense to the defendant). Similarly, a defendant would need the assistance of appellate counsel to understand how to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial-level counsel, which under Michigan law must be raised on direct appeal, absent good cause. See People v. Reed, 499 N.W.2d 441, 445 & n.4 (Mich. Ct. App. 1993), aff'd, 535 N.W.2d 496 (Mich. 1995). And most unrepresented indigent defendants could hardly be expected to mount a successful challenge to a mistake by the trial court in construing and applying the highly technical Michigan sentencing guidelines, or to challenge the validity of those guidelines under Blakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004).If an unrepresented defendant failed to articulate the basis for a challenge to his conviction or sentence in his application for leave to appeal, he would likely lose any opportunity to raise that issue forever in either the state or federal courts.10 Thus, as this Court has recognized, "the ser-had waited too long after the transcript was ready before filing his application.10 See, e.g., People v. Miller, 604 N.W.2d 781, 783 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999) (court will decline review of issue on direct appeal when the issue was not raised in questions presented); MCR 6.508(D)(3) (court may not grant postconviction relief for grounds that could have been raised on appeal, absent good cause and prejudice); Howell v. Mississippi, 125 S. Ct. 856 (2005) (claim not specifically presented to state courts may not raised for first time in United State Supreme Court); Wainwright v. Sykes, 43311vices of a lawyer will for virtually every layman be necessary to present an appeal in a form suitable for appellate consideration on the merits." Evitts, 469 U.S. at 393.Moreover, even if the unrepresented defendant noted a claim of error and stated the facts supporting that claim, that might not be sufficient to preserve his opportunity for further review, especially for a federal claim. Under this Court's decisions, for a defendant to preserve a federal claim for further review in this Court (or on federal habeas corpus), it is not sufficient for the defendant to note a general claim of error (such as claiming "ineffective assistance of counsel"). Rather, the defendant must identify the specific doctrinal basis for his claim and must also make clear that his claim is a federal one--even if he clearly and unmistakably raises a state claim, and even if the federal and state doctrines are similar. See, e.g., Howell v. Mississippi, 125 S. Ct. 856 (2005). 11It is implausible that an unrepresented, indigent defendant would understand that he must specifically identify federal law as the basis of its claim.12 Nor could such a de-U.S. 72 (1977) (claim not timely raised in state court may not be raised on federal habeas corpus absent showing of cause and prejudice).11 See also Baldwin v. Reese, 124 S. Ct. 1347, 1350-1351 (2004) (mere reference to "ineffective assistance" of "appellate court counsel" in state court filing was insufficient to preserve federal ineffective-assistance claim); Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, 163 (1996) ("We have also indicated that it is not enough to make a general appeal to a constitutional guarantee as broad as due process to present the substance of such a claim to a state court." (internal quotation marks omitted)); Anderson v. Harless, 459 U.S. 4, 6 (1982) ("It is not enough that all the facts necessary to support the federal claim were before the state courts, . . . or that a somewhat similar state-law claim was made . . . ." (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).12 Michigan requires that a defendant seeking leave to appeal complete a form stating the factual and legal basis for any claim of error. This form--which the State has defended as nontechnical and easily understood--instructs defendants that they must "[s]tate the issues that you want the Court of Appeals to review, such as how you believe the circuit court erred in accepting your plea or imposing the sentence," and that12fendant be expected to appreciate the doctrinal nuances underlying potential claims. Consider, as an example, a defendant who entered a guilty plea without the benefit of an explanation of the nature of the charge against him, or without an understanding of the constitutional rights that he waived by pleading guilty.13 That defendant might believe that he had a basis for some kind of challenge to the validity of his guilty plea, but not recognize that his claim implicated the federal Constitution. But to preserve the federal claim, it would be insufficient for the defendant simply to state that his plea was not knowing or voluntary. The defendant would also have to invoke the correct specific provision of the federal Constitution and, indeed, would have to invoke the correct federal doctrine to preserve his challenge.It is unrealistic to expect an indigent unrepresented defendant to navigate these shoals with the skill needed to make and to preserve potentially meritorious challenges to his conviction or sentence.14 Moreover, the wrong guessthey must "state the law that supports your position and explain how the law applies to the facts of your case." JA 68-69. The form, however, does not counsel defendants that they must specify whether their claims arise under state or federal law, or both. An unrepresented defendant might believe that his guilty plea or sentence was invalid, but might not know that his claim implicated both state and federal law. Even if he did have such unexpected legal acuity, the defendant might not understand that he should specify whether his claim arose under state or federal law, or both. In this regard, the form's nontechnical nature is a vice rather than a virtue: it does not sufficiently warn defendants that they must carefully identify the precise doctrinal bases for their claims, lest they lose forever the right to pursue those claims.13 See Bousley, 523 U.S. at 618 (holding that guilty plea is not voluntary if defendant does not recognize true nature of charges against him); Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S. 637, 647 (1976) (same).14 For example, a nonlawyer would likely fail to grasp the distinction between arguing that his guilty plea violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because he did not receive adequate notice of the charges against him (see Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S. at 644-646 & n.13) and arguing that his plea violated the Due Process Clause because he did not validly waive his constitutional trial rights (see Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242-243 (1969)).13about the specific doctrinal basis for the defendant's challenge could be catastrophic, for it could bar the defendant from pursuing the most promising avenue for his claim. Compare Holland v. Illinois, 493 U.S. 474, 478, 487 & n.3 (1990) (rejecting white defendant's claim that use of peremptory challenges to strike black jurors violates "fair crosssection" requirement of Sixth Amendment, and declining to reach equal protection claim, which was deemed waived), with Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991) (sustaining similar claim under Equal Protection Clause).To be sure, the Michigan courts might perceive merit in an unrepresented defendant's application for leave to appeal and appoint counsel for plenary briefing. But the far more likely eventuality is that the unrepresented defendant will fail to make his claim with sufficient clarity and precision, the Michigan courts will overlook claims with potential merit, and those claims will be lost forever. Thus, "[t]he indigent, where the record is unclear or the errors are hidden, has only the right to a meaningless ritual, while the rich man has a meaningful appeal." Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 358 (1963).2. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600 (1974), does not control this case. In Ross, this Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did not require that defendants who had already pursued an appeal of their convictions to an intermediate state court of appeals, in which they had had the assistance of appointed counsel, also be appointed counsel to pursue a petition for further discretionary review either in the state supreme court or in this Court. See id. at 610-619.Petitions for discretionary review to a state supreme court in a three-tier court system (as in Michigan) present entirely different considerations from those raised by first appeals, including first appeals where the defendant must seek leave to appeal. As this Court stressed in Ross, a defendant who is seeking a discretionary second round of appellate review of his conviction "will have, at the very least, . . . a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the14Court of Appeals disposing of his case." 417 U.S. at 615. Thus, to apprise a state supreme court (such as the Michigan Supreme Court) of the substance of his claims, the defendant could simply reproduce the brief that was filed on his behalf on the first appeal. Indeed, given that the customary practice in state supreme courts, as in this Court, is not to entertain claims of error that were not specifically raised in or decided by the court from which review is sought, a defendant generally could not go beyond what was filed on his behalf in the intermediate court of appeals or decided by that court on the face of its opinion.15By contrast, when a defendant must seek leave to pursue a first appeal, there often will be no such clean record from the trial court for the appellate court to review. Briefs may well not have been filed in the trial court on the pertinent issues. The relevant motion or objection may have been made orally during a hearing, without citation of case law.16 Even when the claim of error was raised by written motion in the trial court, that motion is likely to have been much less developed than an appellate brief, which lawyers ordinarily have several weeks to prepare. In addition, trial courts often make oral findings or observations that go beyond the points directly addressed by parties in their written motions. That is particularly true of sentencing, where the trial court may make findings on issues that were not specifically addressed in the parties' sentencing memoranda, if indeed any were filed.15 See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 217-224 (1983); Booth Newspapers, Inc. v. University of Mich. Bd. of Regents, 507 N.W.2d 422, 432 & n.23 (Mich. 1993).16 In this case, for example, the only substantive sentencing issue addressed by the parties and the trial court at the sentencing hearing was the question of consecutive or concurrent sentencing, the resolution of which had an enormous impact for petitioner's sentence. The parties do not appear to have made written submissions on that question, and the court gave no explanation on the record for its decision to order consecutive sentences. JA 35.15Thus, unlike an unrepresented defendant who has already had one appeal and who is seeking a further round of review, an unrepresented defendant pursuing a first appeal generally will not have the option of simply relying on what was previously filed by a lawyer on his behalf. A defendant pursuing a first appeal needs the assistance of a lawyer to organize the record, to identify the crucial points in the transcript or written record where the claimed error was committed, and to explain which legal doctrines are implicated by the assignments of error. "There can hardly be any question about the importance of having the appellate advocate examine the record with a view to selecting the most promising issues for review." Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 752 (1983); see Douglas, 372 U.S. at 358 (stressing that an appealing defendant needs "the benefit of counsel's examination into the record, research of the law, and marshalling of arguments on his behalf").3. The purposes served by first appeals are also quite different from those served by discretionary review proceedings at a higher level. The central purpose of first appeals is correction of error in individual cases. Although appeals also often serve the useful function of clarifying legal principles, that is not an essential component of appeals, and most appellate courts are familiar with appeals that raise issues of little interest to anyone other than the parties to the case. That is true, moreover, whether or not the first appeal is of right. Even in Michigan's system under which leave to appeal is required for defendants who have pleaded guilty, the defendant need not show, and the court need not conclude, that the issue on appeal is of broad legal significance for leave to be granted.By contrast, the central purpose of discretionary review in the Michigan Supreme Court--as with certiorari in this Court--is to clarify important legal principles of significant public interest. See MCR 7.302(B) (setting forth grounds for leave to appeal to Michigan Supreme Court); cf. Sup. Ct. R. 10; Ross, 417 U.S. at 615 (discussing similar practice of North Carolina Supreme Court). Especially when lower16courts have reached differing conclusions, a state supreme court (and this Court) may grant discretionary review even when the court believes that the lower court's decision is correct. See id. at 616-617 ("This Court's review . . . depends on numerous factors other than the perceived correctness of the judgment we are asked to review."). In many cases, a state supreme court exercising this discretionary, lawclarifying function can determine from the face of the lower court's opinion (or from a dissent) whether the legal issues warrant plenary consideration. Thus, as this Court observed in Ross, while an attorney would certainly be "helpful" to a defendant pursuing a second or third round of appellate review of his conviction, counsel's function at those stages is not so indispensable as it is on a first appeal, where an unrepresented defendant is likely to be adrift.Yr3r¤22¨¨¨Y2¨ q2 t¢¦e r¤`vGX5w3¨t ¦¨¨s  e¦¨d32¨0yFRY 2yF 2R ¦¦q¨¦ 2¦ P 2q¨F  d¨  2x R2 ¦¦   2uY¨1. The State has suggested that defendants who plead guilty are unlikely to have even potentially meritorious claims for appeal, and so nothing of significance is lost by deterring indigent defendants from appealing by denying them appointed counsel when they seek leave to appeal.17 That submission is seriously incomplete. To be sure, a guilty plea operates as a waiver of many possible claims of error, including many constitutional claims. See Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973); McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 770 (1970). Nonetheless, a defendant who pleads guilty can challenge his conviction or sentence on appeal in at least two important circumstances.First, a defendant may claim that the conviction resulted from a defect in the plea process itself--for example, because the guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary, or be-17 See Pet. Br. 32-34, Tesmer v. Kowalski, 125 S. Ct. 564 (2004) (No. 03-407).17cause the trial court failed to follow the required procedures for taking a guilty plea, or because the defendant received in effective assistance of counsel in the guilty plea process. See In re Guilty Plea Cases, 235 N.W.2d 132 (Mich. 1975) (outlining circumstances in which failure to adhere to plea procedures requires reversal); People v. Rostick, No. 241916, 2004 WL 67551 (Mich. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2004) (per curiam) (reversing conviction based on nolo contendere plea for failure to establish factual basis after initially denying leave to appeal).Second, in Michigan's sentencing system, which resembles the federal sentencing guidelines system in important respects, a defendant convicted on a guilty plea may appeal an error in sentencing. See People v. Hegwood, 636 N.W.2d 127 (Mich. 2001) (per curiam); People v. Miller, No. 240613, 2003 WL 22442992, at *1-2 (Mich. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2003) (per curiam) (finding scoring error and remanding for resentencing in case where defendant pled guilty). Defendants who have pleaded guilty presumably may also raise a challenge to the validity of the Michigan sentencing guidelines system under Blakely.1818 The validity of Michigan's guidelines system after Blakely remains unclear. In People v. Claypool, 684 N.W.2d 278, 286 n.14 (Mich. 2004), the Michigan Supreme Court remarked in dicta that the guidelines were unaffected by Blakely. The dissenting opinion in Blakely itself suggested otherwise, however. See 124 S. Ct. at 2549 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The uncertainty results from the fact that the Michigan guidelines system, though similar to the federal system in its complexity, is different in that judges in Michigan sentence convicted defendants to a sentencing range-- the bottom level of the range being established by application of the guidelines (which themselves yield a range, within which the judge determines the defendant's minimum sentence) and the top level of the range being set by statute. See Claypool, 684 N.W.2d at 286 n.14; Mich. Comp. Laws § 769.8(1). Thus, in this case, petitioner was sentenced to ranges of 24 months to 15 years and 57 months to 15 years for his two convictions (to run consecutively). JA 38, 41. The Michigan Supreme Court suggested in Claypool that the Michigan guidelines system resembles a mandatory minimum sentencing structure, such as that upheld in Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545 (2002). The Michigan guidelines are not identical to the sentencing law upheld in Harris, however. Under the18Defendants who have pleaded guilty, who wish to pursue such claims, and who can afford retained counsel on appeal will have the assistance of counsel in preparing their applications for leave to appeal. Yet the State denies indigent defendants the right to the assistance of counsel in seeking leave to appeal on the very same grounds. For example, an indigent defendant seeking leave to appeal because his guilty plea was involuntary would not fall within any of the categories of persons for whom counsel may be appointed, even in the court's discretion. And an indigent defendant who has pleaded guilty and seeks leave to appeal his sentence because a scoring error by the trial court placed his sentence above the properly applicable guidelines range would also have no right to counsel, but could only have one appointed in the court's discretion. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 770.3a(3).19 Thus, the indigent defendant, unaided by counsel, would have to prove to the court of appeals that his caseMichigan system, judicial factfinding can result in the elevation of the defendant's sentence, which is expressed as a range (e.g., 57 months to 15 years), above the level that would have otherwise been permissible based solely on the jury verdict or facts admitted by the defendant absent the fact found by the judge (e.g., a sentence of 18 months to 15 years). Needless to say, it is highly unlikely that an unrepresented, indigent defendant would have the tools to develop the complex argument that would be needed to persuade the Michigan Court of Appeals not to follow the Michigan Supreme Court's dictum in Claypool, or to preserve that claim of error for further review in the Michigan Supreme Court or this Court.19 The Michigan law under review does not directly address whether counsel may, in the court's discretion, be appointed when a convicted defendant challenges the constitutionality of his sentence under Blakely. Conceivably, such a challenge might fall within Mich. Comp. Laws § 770.3a(3), which authorizes appointment of counsel in the court's discretion for a challenge to an alleged "improper scoring of an offense variable or a prior record variable," where the defendant argues that the sentence imposed represents an upward departure from the upper limit of the appropriate minimum sentencing range. What is clear is that the Michigan law under review does not grant a right to appointed appellate counsel for any challenge to a sentence based on Blakely.19was sufficiently meritorious to warrant a plenary appeal and the appointment of counsel. 202. Michigan's determination that indigent defendants who have pleaded guilty should not have the right to assistance of counsel when seeking leave to appeal raises serious concerns about the fair administration of justice. It is particularly troubling that Michigan prohibits appointment of20 The court is barred from appointing appellate counsel for a defendant seeking leave to appeal his sentence if the defendant did not properly preserve his sentencing issue for appeal. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 770.3a(3). Of course, the question whether a claim of error was properly preserved is itself often not simple. See, e.g., People v. Conway, No. 246026, 2004 WL 787179, at *2 (Mich. Ct. App. Apr. 13, 2004) (per curiam) (assuming error was preserved in complicated circumstances), appeal denied, 688 N.W.2d 82 (Mich. 2004) (table). Cf. Anderson, 459 U.S. at 8 (Stevens, J., dissenting) ("Few issues consume as much of the scarce time of federal judges as the question whether a state prisoner adequately exhausted his state remedies before filing a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus."). A lawyer, familiar with court transcripts, is far more likely to be able to persuade a court that a claim of error was properly preserved than an unrepresented defendant, who may not even have the pertinent transcripts when preparing his application for leave to appeal (see supra p. 9 & n.9).Moreover, even when a claim has not been preserved in the trial court, Michigan law recognizes that a defendant can obtain appellate relief in two circumstances. First, the defendant can obtain plain-error review. See People v. Kimble, 684 N.W.2d 669, 674 (Mich. 2004) (error in guidelines scoring was plain error). Second, the Michigan Court of Appeals has also been willing to review sentencing errors that a defendant failed to properly preserve when the defendant presents the issue in the form of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. See, e.g., People v. Wilson, 652 N.W.2d 488, 490 (Mich. Ct. App. 2002) (per curiam) (holding that consideration of sentencing error was barred for lack of preservation, but nevertheless reviewing an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim regarding the same sentencing error); People v. Dupuis, Nos. 239315, 239316, 2003 WL 22956389, at *3 (Mich. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2003) (per curiam) (same, and finding ineffective assistance and remanding for resentencing). Without the assistance of counsel, however, a defendant would be seriously disadvantaged in presenting such claims in a persuasive manner. Yet these are the cases where the indigent defendant may need appellate counsel the most--to review the sentencing record and present any previously unpreserved sentencing errors for the first time on appeal.20counsel when an indigent defendant seeks leave to persuade an appellate court that his guilty plea was constitutionally defective because it was involuntary or not made with the necessary understanding. An indigent defendant could forever lose the right to relief from even an involuntary guilty plea if he were deterred from seeking leave to appeal because he lacked the right to assistance of counsel, or if he did seek leave to appeal but failed to perceive and preserve the proper doctrinal basis for his appeal.21Similarly, a defendant who failed to appeal based on nonconstitutional errors in the guilty plea process--such as the trial judge's failure to establish on the record that there was a proper factual basis for the plea--would forever lose the right to relief from his invalid plea. Michigan follows the rule of United States v. Timmreck, 441 U.S. 780 (1979), that a nonconstitutional error in the taking of a guilty plea, even if it might provide a basis for reversal on direct appeal, is not cognizable on collateral review (at least absent a showing of a fundamental miscarriage of justice). See People v. Ward, 594 N.W.2d 47, 51-52 (Mich. 1999) (per curiam); People v. Ingram, 484 N.W.2d 241, 243 (Mich. 1992). But that is exactly the kind of error that a defendant is likely not to perceive without help from his trial counsel or the trial judge-- both of whom are likely to have overlooked the error themselves (or else the error would have been rectified).Also troubling is Michigan's broad restriction on appointment of counsel for defendants who seek to appeal an allegedly erroneous sentence. As noted above, the Michigan courts follow a sentencing guidelines system, in which appeals from sentences are a routine and important part. The Michigan guidelines system applies both to defendants who21 This Court has held that a defendant who does not properly raise a constitutional challenge to the validity of his guilty plea on direct appeal generally loses the right to raise such a challenge on collateral habeas corpus review (subject only to a very narrow exception if the defendant can show cause and prejudice for his failure to raise the claim on appeal). See Bousley, 523 U.S. at 621-622.21plead guilty and those who are convicted after full trials. There is no particular reason to believe that courts will make fewer sentencing errors in guilty plea cases as a class than in trial cases. Thus, there does not appear to be any justification for deterring only defendants who have pleaded guilty from appealing from their sentences. Although a defendant's guilty plea does waive numerous claims of error based on incidents antecedent to the defendant's plea, it does not follow (and this Court has never held) that a guilty plea necessarily waives any claim of error arising out of sentencing, especially in a sentencing guidelines system like that in Michigan. Thus, whatever might be said about the effect of a guilty plea in waiving claims of error concerning the defendant's guilt, there is no basis to conclude that such a plea has any significance for a defendant's right to appeal his sentence.Moreover, the sentencing guidelines system in Michigan is complex--no less complex than the federal system (whether before or after United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005)). Under the Michigan system, a defendant's sentence is determined in the following manner. First, based on the particular offense, the court must "score" the statutorily specified "offense variables" and arrive at an "offense variable level" (which is analogous to the offense level under the federal sentencing guidelines). See Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 777.21(1)(a), 777.31. Second, the court must score all of the statutorily specified "prior record variables" to arrive at the defendant's "prior record variable level" (analogous to the criminal history category under the federal sentencing guidelines). See id. §§ 777.21(1)(b), 777.51. The court then must consult a sentencing grid applicable to the specific offense class and determine the "minimum sentence range"-- but in contrast to the federal system, the Michigan guidelines have numerous sentencing grids, each corresponding to one of nine different offense classes. See id. §§ 777.21(1)(c), 777.61-777.69. Finally, the court must impose a sentence, expressed as a sentencing range with a minimum and maximum, with the minimum drawn from the applicable guide-22lines range and the maximum set by statute. See id. § 769.34(2).22Even putting aside the difficult question whether this entire system is consistent with Blakely and Booker--on which a defendant appealing his sentence would surely need the assistance of counsel (see supra, p. 17 n.18)--it is clear that the opportunities for legal and factual error by trial courts in implementation of the Michigan sentencing guidelines are numerous, as the federal courts have discovered in their system. Even in cases involving guilty pleas, the Michigan trial courts do sometimes misapply the guidelines, requiring the Michigan Court of Appeals to remand cases for resentencing. See, e.g., People v. Cook, No. 245018, 2004 WL 576251, at *1 (Mich. Ct. App. Mar. 23, 2004) (mem.) (remanding when trial court erroneously sentenced defendant to prison time rather than probation); Miller, 2003 WL 22442992, at *1-2 (remanding because trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object to scoring error affecting defendant's sentence). But if the Michigan sentencing guidelines occasionally confound even trial courts, they are hardly likely to be pellucid to indigent, unrepresented defendants. In short, legal skill is necessary to effective comprehension of the system and indispensable to pursuing a successful appeal from a sentencing error. Thus, a defendant who has pleaded guilty and who wishes to appeal his sentence is likely to be seriously disadvantaged if he lacks counsel to prepare his application for leave to appeal.22 As the Michigan Supreme Court explained in People v. Babcock, 666 N.W.2d 231, 240-241 (2003):Under the guidelines, offense and prior record variables are scored to determine the appropriate sentence range. Offense variables take into account the severity of the criminal offense, while prior record variables take into account the offender's criminal history. Therefore, the appropriate sentence range is determined by reference to the principle of proportionality; it is a function of the seriousness of the crime and of the defendant's criminal history.233. No state interest suffices to justify a situation, which Michigan has put in place, whereby nonindigent defendants who have pleaded guilty may seek leave to appeal with the assistance of counsel, but indigent defendants may not. There is no basis for believing that indigent defendants as a rule are less likely to have meritorious issues on appeal than nonindigent defendants. For example, there is no reason to believe that indigent defendants are less likely than nonindigent defendants to plead guilty involuntarily or unknowingly, or that trial courts are less likely to commit errors in applying the Michigan sentencing guidelines to indigent defendants than to nonindigents. But whereas a defendant who can afford counsel will have expert assistance in (for example) explicating the particular aspect of the sentencing guidelines at issue in the appeal, the indigent defendant will have no such help. "[O]nly the barren record speaks for the indigent, and, unless the printed pages show that an injustice has been committed, he is forced to go without a champion on appeal." Douglas, 372 U.S. at 356.As a practical matter, therefore, a defendant who can afford counsel will stand a much better chance of persuading the Michigan courts that his claims of error have sufficient merit that leave to appeal should be granted. Once granted leave to appeal, the defendant with means will then proceed to a plenary appeal, assisted by counsel, whereas the indigent defendant, denied leave to proceed further, will have no appeal. As in Douglas, therefore, "the discrimination is not between `possibly good and obviously bad cases,' but between cases where the rich man can require the court to listen to argument of counsel before deciding on the merits, but a poor man cannot." 372 U.S. at 357. Such discrimination is contrary to basic principles of equality and fairness in the Fourteenth Amendment.°Y¢¥ ®¦±¦ ·±2· ¦© ¢ ¡ ¯© ¢¥G£¦£3°Y¨3¤ ¥§¸£2²9¦ £¦¹s³¨ ®2©©¥ª²s¨©®2¢ ¥  ¨£0¥§£2¸3¡¢¦2£¬°Y©5±¦¤«Y±22© ¥¢ ¯ ¯¯ ¢¯s© ¨ ®¦£2©ª ¡¢´©¡ ¢²$ £2¹sµ¨¡¨¯ ¢¦¨0¡¢®¦©¨°Y©ª ª ¨©¯ ©¦ ¥£¦¥¶The State has suggested that its practice of requiring defendants who have pleaded guilty to seek leave to appeal24is justified by its interests in discouraging meritless appeals and reducing the backlog in its courts of appeals.23 The issue before the Court in this case, however, is not whether the State may require any particular class of appealing defendants to seek leave to appeal. As a matter of policy, the ABA opposes the leave-to-appeal device as a method of deterring frivolous appeals and reducing appellate caseload (see supra pp. 3-4 & n.6), but the propriety of that procedure is not at issue here. Rather, the question is whether indigent defendants are entitled to the assistance of counsel in passing that threshold barrier to their ability to pursue any appeal at all.If the leave-to-appeal procedure operates as intended, a court that reviews applications for leave to appeal would be assisted, not harmed, by counsel's skill in identifying the issues that would have potential merit on appeal. If a defendant is represented by appointed counsel on an application for leave to appeal, that counsel will be constrained by ethical and professional norms as well as court rules from seeking leave to pursue meritless issues. See ABA Model R. Prof'l Conduct 3.1 ("A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law."); Mich. R. Prof'l Conduct 3.1 (similar); MCR 7.216(C)(1)(a) (authorizing sanctions when "the appeal was taken for purposes of hindrance or delay or without any reasonable basis for belief that there was a meritorious issue to be determined on appeal"). Even among nonfrivolous arguments, competent appointed counsel is likely to pursue only the most promising claims on appeal (see Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. at 752-753)--unlike unrepresented appellants, who are unlikely to have the legal skill to sift promising from unpromising arguments. Ap-23 See Pet. Br. 3-4, Tesmer v. Kowalski, 125 S. Ct. 564 (2004) (No. 03407).25pointment of counsel therefore advances the State's interest in discouraging meritless appeals.24The ABA recognizes that backlog is a serious problem in many state appellate court systems. State courts have tools to address that problem without sacrificing fundamental requirements of a fair system of justice--including the requirement that a criminal defendant have the assistance of counsel on appeal. For example, the Criminal Justice Standards encourage appellate courts "to select, among diverse procedural paths for hearing and submission of cases to the appellate court and for disposition of cases by the court, the path that is most appropriate for each case." Standard 213.1(b)(iii), 4 Standards at 21.37. The Standards also recommend that appellate courts use court staff in "evaluating new appeals and recommending to the court the procedural path appropriate to each." Standard 21-3.4(c)(1), 4 Standards at 21.47-21.48. Many States also authorize appellate courts to identify cases that are appropriate for decision without oral argument or for summary disposition. If instituted properly, such procedures can ensure that every appealing defendant has the opportunity to make his best claim for reversal and the right to have that claim reviewed. What is not consistent with a fair system of justice, however, is for the State to force an indigent criminal defendant to under-take the burden of appeaºFl w»`i¤th¼¨o½`u¹¨t¦ tºFh»e help of counsel.The judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals should be reversed.Respectfully submitted,24 The State may also adopt appropriate procedures that allow appellate counsel to withdraw when counsel perceives no meritorious claims on appeal, while safeguarding the appealing defendant's right to counsel. See Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 264-265 (2000); Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967).FEBRUARY 200526ROBERT J. GREY, JR. 
 I. APPLICATION OF THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS RULETO A CLIENT'S HOURLY RATE MATTERS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. Clients, and not lawyers or law firms, own their matters. A client's ownership of its hourly rate matters is not altered when the lawyer handling those matters leaves a firm, even when the lawyer must leave because the firm has dissolved and can no longer provide legal services to the client. Under the unfinished business rule, though, a dissolved law firm would have a property interest in a client's hourly rate matters that the firm was handling at the time of dissolution, and would thus be entitled to the profits earned on those matters by new firms that the dissolved firm's partners join. The California Rules and the Rules of Professional Conduct, like the ABA Model Rules, however, impose obligations and restrictions on lawyers and law firms that protect clients' fundamental and unfettered right to select, retain, and change counsel at any time,8and regulate how lawyers and firms may be paid for legal services.6These Rules are inconsistent with the unfinished business rule.This brief discusses the conflict between the unfinishedbusiness rule and the ethical responsibilities that govern the legal feesthat lawyers and firms can charge a client and how lawyers and firmsmay divide those fees. Because of the integral role that legal fees playin the attorney-client relationship, the ABA asserts this discussion issufficient to establish that, consistent with the Rules, the unfinishedbusiness rule cannot be applied to a dissolved firm's former hourlyrate matters that are handled by a former partner and new firm.6 While California has not adopted the ABA Model Rules, they may be "helpful and persuasive in situations where the coverage of our Rules is unclear or inadequate." Frye v. Tenderloin Hous. Clinic, Inc., 38 Cal. 4th 23, 52 (2006); accord City & County of San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc., 38 Cal. 4th 839, 852 (2006); California Rule 1-100(A) ("Although not binding, opinions of ethics committees in California should be consulted by members for guidance on proper professional conduct. Ethics opinions and rules and standards promulgated by other jurisdictions and bar associations may also be considered."); Cal. Formal Op. No. 2013-188 ("[I]n the absence of related California authority, we may look to the Model Rules, and the ABA Formal Opinions interpreting them, as well as the ethics opinions of other jurisdictions or bar associations for guidance.").9A. Application Of The Unfinished Business Rule To A Client's Hourly Rate Matters Would Conflict With The Financial and Ethical Rules Regulating The Legal Fees That The Client Can Be Charged.As the California Supreme Court stated in Fracasse v. Brent, 6 Cal. 3d 784, 791 (1972), "[I]t is a basic term of the [attorney-client] contract, implied by law ... that the client may terminate that contract at will." See also Champion v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 201 Cal. App. 3d 777, 783 (1988) (noting the close relation between "the client's right to retain counsel of choice" and the client's right to discharge counsel). As the State Bar of California stated, "[L]awyers serve at the pleasure of their clients; a client always maintains the right to terminate the services of a lawyer at any time." Cal. Formal Op. No. 1994-135. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 284.Indeed, this Court has held that "[a] client's power to discharge an attorney, with or without cause, is absolute." Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Angell, Holmes & Lea, 838 F.2d 395, 395 (9th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, ABA Model Rule 1.16(a)(3) requires that a lawyer withdraw from representing a client if discharged by the client.The client's absolute right to terminate a lawyer, however, cannot be squared with the unfinished business rule. If the unfinished10business rule were applied, it would give a dissolved law firm the right--after the client has moved the matter and thus has discharged the dissolved firm--to be paid all of the profits on a client's hourly rate matter that are earned by a former partner's new law firm, even though the dissolved firm did not and could not perform any legal services for which those profits were earned. In addition to ignoring the client's absolute right to discharge a firm, the requirement that all profits be paid to the dissolved firm would conflict with the Rules of Professional Conduct, including the California Rules and ABA Model Rules, under which a firm cannot charge fees for legal services that it did not perform.Further, California Rule 4-200 prohibits a lawyer from charging or collecting an illegal or unconscionable fee, and California courts have held that "fees [that] have no relationship whatsoever to the amount of service provided or to be provided by the partnership to the client" are unconscionable. Champion v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 201 Cal. App. 3d 777, 783 (1988). California Rule 3700(D)(2) requires that a discharged attorney "[p]romptly refund any part of a fee paid in advance that has not been earned" (excluding a true retainer paid solely to ensure a lawyer's availability). The11unfinished business rule, therefore, would permit a dissolved firm to charge, collect and retain an unconscionable free, and require the former partner and new firm to acquiesce in its doing so.California courts also have held that when a client discharges a lawyer, the lawyer is only entitled to compensation for the value of work performed. E.g., Jalali v. Root, 109 Cal. App. 4th 1768, 1777 (2003) (when a client exercises "the unilateral right to discharge his or her attorney with or without cause at any time--even on the courthouse steps," the attorney "only has a right to quantum meruit recovery" representing the value of past work); Oliver v. Campbell, 43 Cal. 2d 298, 304 (1954) (discharged attorney entitled only to "the reasonable value of services recoverable by the employee for his past performance").Likewise, under the ABA Model Rules, legal fees must be earned: ABA Model Rule 1.5(a) prohibits a lawyer from charging or collecting an "unreasonable" fee, while Model Rule 1.5(c) provides that "a lawyer shall deposit into a client trust account legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred." In addition, ABA Model Rule 1.16(d) provides that "any advance payment of fee12or expense that has not been earned or incurred" must be refunded upon termination of the representation.The unfinished business rule concerns profits earned by a new firm after a client had no choice but to move its matter to a new firm; the rule does not concern fees that a firm might have earned prior to its dissolution. A requirement that a former partner and the new law firm must pay such profits to the dissolved firm would conflict with the ethics principles under which lawyers and their firms may be paid only for the work they perform.B. Application Of The Unfinished Business Rule To A Client's Hourly Rate Matters Conflicts With The Ethical Rules Regulating The Division Of Legal Fees.It is axiomatic that a law firm that hires a former partner of a dissolved firm cannot be the same firm as the dissolved firm. Thus, the ethics rules on the division of legal fees must apply in the unfinished business context. See Robert W. Hillman, Hillman on Lawyer Mobility: The Law and Ethics of Partner Withdrawals and Law Firm Breakups § 4.11.4 at 4:156 n.40 ("By concluding that the partnership continues during the winding-up phase, these opinions are able to elude ethics restrictions on fee splitting when lawyers are not members of the same firm.") (citing, inter alia, Jewel v. Boxer, 15613Cal. App. 3d 171 (1984). See Heller Ehrman LLP v. Davis, Wright,Tremaine, LLP, Nos. C 14-01236 CRB, C 14-01237 CRB, C 14-01238 CRB, C 14-01239 CRB, 2014 WL 2609743, at *4-5 (N.D. Cal.Jun. 11, 2014) (in which the court below concluded that Jewel isoutmoded and inapplicable to the facts presented in this case).7The Rules of Professional Conduct governing the division oflegal fees require that the client must consent to and understand thebasis for any division of fees between firms, and that the total fee7 Compare Anderson, McPharlin & Connors v. Yee, 135 Cal. App. 4th 129 (2005), in which the court found that California Rule 2200 did not apply to a partnership agreement that contained a liquidated damages provision under which a former partner was required to turn over 25% of the fees he earned for a 24-month period on matters begun at his former firm. Thus, Rule 2-200 did not apply because the construction of a partnership agreement did not involve two firms. See also Cal. Formal Op. No. 1994-38 (no division of fees, and Rule 2-200 did not apply, where a lawyer billed a firm in which he was not a partner or employee for his regular hourly rate, and the firm then re-billed that amount to the client and paid it over to the lawyer when paid by the client; the law firm did not retain any portion of the fee and acted merely as a collection agent).The unfinished business rule, however, is based on the ownership of matters and the Appellant seeks to impose obligations on other law firms, and not former Heller Ehrman LLP ("Heller") partners, to disgorge all profits for an unlimited period of time earned on matters after the clients had moved their matters to another firm. Here, California Rule 2-200 does apply because Heller and the firms the Heller trustee has sued were never partners in the same law firm.14charged must not be increased solely because of the division and cannot be unconscionable. For example, California Rule 2-200(A) provides:A member shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of, associate of, or shareholder with the member unless: (1) The client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that the division will be made and the terms of such division; and (2) The total fee charged by all lawyers is not increased solely by reason of the provision for division of fees and is not unconscionable as that term is defined in rule 4-200. ABA Model Rule 1.5(e), which also requires client consent, provides additional requirements: the division of fees may be made only if "the division [of fees] is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation[.]" Comment [7] to ABA Model Rule 1.5 explains: "Joint responsibility for the representation entails financial and ethical responsibility for the representation as if the lawyers were associated in a partnership." Application of the unfinished business rule, however, would require the new law firm of a former partner of a dissolved firm to (1) pay over profits that are not in proportion to any services performed, (2) make those payments to a firm that, because it15is dissolved, cannot assume ethical responsibility for the representation, and (3) make these arrangements without client consent. See also ABA Formal Opinion 464 (2013) (lawyer entering into an arrangement for division of fees "must reasonably believe that the other lawyers' services will contribute to the competent and ethical representation of the client.") (citing Comment [6] to ABA Model Rule 1.1.)8California Rule 3-310(B)(3) also prohibits a lawyer from accepting or continuing a representation without written disclosure to the client where "[t]he member has or had a legal, business, financial, professional, or personal relationship with another person or entity the member knows or reasonably should know would be affected substantially by resolution of the matter." Contrary to the intention of this Rule, a disclosure that a former partner's new law firm would be required by the unfinished business rule to pay over profits on a client's hourly rate matters to the dissolved firm may affect the trust8 In fact, because a dissolved firm no longer has any ability to perform legal services, California Rule 1-320 is relevant. That Rule prohibits a lawyer from directly or indirectly sharing legal fees with a person who is not a lawyer (except in certain circumstances), even with the client's consent. ABA Model Rule 5.4 similarly prohibits sharing legal fees with nonlawyers except in limited circumstances not applicable here.16necessary to the attorney-client relationship. A client may question the interests of its lawyer after it is informed that the coffers of the lawyer's former law firm, now in dissolution--but not the coffers of the lawyer's new firm--will be increased by payment of the new firm's profits to the dissolved firm. The client also might question whether the lawyer is conducting the representation in a manner that will result in payment of as little as possible to the dissolved firm. See Comment [5] to ABA Model Rule 1.5 ("An agreement may not be made whose terms might induce the lawyer improperly to curtail services for the client or perform them in a way contrary to the client's interest.").9Even a comparison between the unfinished business rule and the requirements for division of fees with the estate of a deceased partner does not support payment of profits to a dissolved firm. California Rule 1-320(A)(2) provides that a member or law firm9 Comment [8] to ABA Model Rule 1.5, however, clearly applies only to payment of fees to a former firm for work done before a lawyer leaves a firm. It states: "Paragraph (e) [of ABA Model Rule 1.5] does not prohibit or regulate division of fees to be received in the future for work done when lawyers were previously associated in a law firm." Comment [8], thus, does not apply to the division of fees earned on work performed on a client's hourly rate matter after a firm's dissolution.17"undertaking to complete unfinished legal business of a deceased member may pay to the estate of the deceased member or other person legally entitled thereto that proportion of the total compensation which fairly represents the services rendered by the deceased member." Thus, a partner's estate does not receive payments for work done after the partner's death. On the other hand, the unfinished business rule requires that a dissolve firm receive the profits on work done by another firm after the dissolved firm, in effect, has died.Finally, under the unfinished business rule, a dissolved firm could seek profits without consideration of the relative amount of work it performed before being discharged and the amount of work performed by the client's new law firm. Thus, even if the client's new firm might spend years defending a lawsuit--for example, a major antitrust matter--and even if the dissolved firm had only just begun representation when it dissolved and had already collected all its fees for the work it undertook, application of the unfinished business doctrine would permit the dissolved law firm to claim years of profits from the client's new firm. Any payment of profits earned by the new firm to the dissolved firm consequently would "have no relationship18whatsoever to the amount of service provided or to be provided by the partnership to the client." Champion, 201 Cal. App. 3d at 783.By requiring a lawyer to pay profits to a dissolved firm, the unfinished business rule would be, in these and other ways, inconsistent with the ethical rules governing the division of fees adopted in California and across the country. II. APPLICATION OF THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS RULETO A CLIENT'S HOURLY RATE MATTERS WOULD ENCOURAGE ATTORNEYS TO LEAVE THEIR FIRMS AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF FINANCIAL TROUBLE AND TO COUNSEL THEIR CLIENTS TO DO THE SAME. As discussed above, the California Rules and the Rules of Professional Conduct as adopted across the nation, as well as the ABA Model Rules, circumscribe a lawyer's ability to charge, collect and divide fees. As also discussed above, application of the unfinished business rule to hourly rate matters that a client has moved to the new firm of a former partner would require payment of the new firm's profits to the dissolved firm. This result would be inconsistent with the ethical responsibilities of the former partner and the new firm. On the other hand, as Heller's trustee conceded below, the unfinished business rule does not apply to matters that a former partner took to a new firm if the former partner left before dissolution.19See Heller Ehrman LLP v. Davis, Wright, Tremaine, LLP, Nos. C 1401236 CRB, C 14-01237 CRB, C 14-01238 CRB, C 14-01239 CRB, 2014 WL 2609743, at *2-3, *6 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 11, 2014). As the New York Court of Appeals stated, "[A]ttorneys who wait too long are placed in a very difficult position. They might advise their clients that they can no longer afford to represent them, a major inconvenience for the clients and a practical restriction on a client's right to choose counsel." In re Thelen LLP, 24 N.Y.3d 16, 32 (2014). Were the client's chosen lawyer no longer able to continue to represent the client, being required to change lawyers may also impose significant costs on the client. Application of the unfinished business rule may thus encourage partners to leave their firms at the first sign of financial trouble.Although leaving a troubled firm would certainly further destabilize the firm, especially if enough partners likewise left, doing so would protect clients from the fee division issues that would arise if the unfinished business rule were to apply. Further, the partners might well reason that if they wait until their firm dissolves before joining a new firm, they might not be able to find a new firm that is willing, or that can financially afford, to finish the matters on which20they are working, especially if a matter would require a significant investment of the new firm's resources, including work by other partners on the matter, or if it would require the new firm to forego other engagements due to conflicts.In fact, the larger the matter, the more difficult it likely would be for a former partner to find a new firm that would take on the client's matter for no profit, and the more costly and potentially detrimental to the client it would be to start over at a firm that includes no former partners of the dissolved firm. Of course, any time a client loses its chosen counsel, the economic reality of the application of the unfinished business rule is that the client endures the cost of bringing new counsel up to speed.Indeed, if the unfinished business rule must be applied to a client's hourly rate matters on dissolution of a law firm--which remains highly disputed at this time--then it would appear that a lawyer should also counsel the client on the ramifications of a dissolution on any hourly rate matters that remain with a firm when it dissolves. In fact, under the ethical rules that apply when a lawyer leaves a law firm, including when a lawyer must leave because of a firm's dissolution, it would appear that the lawyer should counsel a21client that, because of the unfinished business rule, the client should also leave the troubled firm prior to its dissolution.For example, California Rule 3-700(A)(2) provides that a member "shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable laws and rules."10 As explained in State Bar of California Formal Op. No. 2014-190, "The requirements of rule 3-700(A)(2) apply when an attorney's withdrawal is prompted by the dissolution of the attorney's law firm." And, as elucidated in State Bar of California Formal Opinion No. 1985-86, which discussed the predecessor to California Rule 3-700, "[T]he rules in these circumstances act as a regulatory framework, and their provisions dictate that the interests of the clients must prevail over all competing considerations if the practitioner's withdrawal from the firm or the firm's dissolution is to be accomplished in a manner consistent with professional responsibility." See also ABA10 California Rule 3-700(D) similarly requires that a lawyer "promptly release to the client, at the request of the client, all the client papers and property."22Model Rule 1.16(d) ("Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests . . . ."); ABA Formal Opinion 414 (1999) at 5 (departing lawyer and responsible members of the firm must notify the client of the client's alternatives and "must make clear that the client has the ultimate right to decide who will complete or continue the matters.").The ABA respectfully asserts that lawyers should not feel obligated to leave troubled law firms before dissolution to avoid application of the unfinished business rule to their clients' hourly rate matters. Further, lawyers should not need to protect their clients by counseling them that they should also leave. The ABA urges that, because a dissolved law firm--which can perform no legal services-- has no property interest in a client's hourly rate matters, neither law, nor equity, nor policy should require these actions.23CONCLUSION For the reasons set out above, amicus curiae the American Bar Association respectfully requests that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed.Dated: February 24, 2015OF COUNSEL: DAVID G.

Hillman, Hillman on Lawyer Mobility: The Law and Ethics of Partner Withdrawals and Law Firm Breakups § 4.11.4 at 4:156 n.40 ("By concluding that the partnership continues during the winding-up phase, these opinions are able to elude ethics restrictions on fee splitting when lawyers are not members of the same firm.") (citing, inter alia, Jewel v. Boxer, 15613Cal. App. 3d 171 (1984). See Heller Ehrman LLP v. Davis, Wright,Tremaine, LLP, Nos. C 14-01236 CRB, C 14-01237 CRB, C 14-01238 CRB, C 14-01239 CRB, 2014 WL 2609743, at *4-5 (N.D. Cal.Jun. 11, 2014) (in which the court below concluded that Jewel isoutmoded and inapplicable to the facts presented in this case).7The Rules of Professional Conduct governing the division oflegal fees require that the client must consent to and understand thebasis for any division of fees between firms, and that the total fee7 Compare Anderson, McPharlin & Connors v. Yee, 135 Cal. App. 4th 129 (2005), in which the court found that California Rule 2200 did not apply to a partnership agreement that contained a liquidated damages provision under which a former partner was required to turn over 25% of the fees he earned for a 24-month period on matters begun at his former firm. Thus, Rule 2-200 did not apply because the construction of a partnership agreement did not involve two firms. See also Cal. Formal Op. No. 1994-38 (no division of fees, and Rule 2-200 did not apply, where a lawyer billed a firm in which he was not a partner or employee for his regular hourly rate, and the firm then re-billed that amount to the client and paid it over to the lawyer when paid by the client; the law firm did not retain any portion of the fee and acted merely as a collection agent).The unfinished business rule, however, is based on the ownership of matters and the Appellant seeks to impose obligations on other law firms, and not former Heller Ehrman LLP ("Heller") partners, to disgorge all profits for an unlimited period of time earned on matters after the clients had moved their matters to another firm. Here, California Rule 2-200 does apply because Heller and the firms the Heller trustee has sued were never partners in the same law firm.14charged must not be increased solely because of the division and cannot be unconscionable. For example, California Rule 2-200(A) provides:A member shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of, associate of, or shareholder with the member unless: (1) The client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that the division will be made and the terms of such division; and (2) The total fee charged by all lawyers is not increased solely by reason of the provision for division of fees and is not unconscionable as that term is defined in rule 4-200. ABA Model Rule 1.5(e), which also requires client consent, provides additional requirements: the division of fees may be made only if "the division [of fees] is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation[.]" Comment [7] to ABA Model Rule 1.5 explains: "Joint responsibility for the representation entails financial and ethical responsibility for the representation as if the lawyers were associated in a partnership." Application of the unfinished business rule, however, would require the new law firm of a former partner of a dissolved firm to (1) pay over profits that are not in proportion to any services performed, (2) make those payments to a firm that, because it15is dissolved, cannot assume ethical responsibility for the representation, and (3) make these arrangements without client consent. See also ABA Formal Opinion 464 (2013) (lawyer entering into an arrangement for division of fees "must reasonably believe that the other lawyers' services will contribute to the competent and ethical representation of the client.") (citing Comment [6] to ABA Model Rule 1.1.)8California Rule 3-310(B)(3) also prohibits a lawyer from accepting or continuing a representation without written disclosure to the client where "[t]he member has or had a legal, business, financial, professional, or personal relationship with another person or entity the member knows or reasonably should know would be affected substantially by resolution of the matter." Contrary to the intention of this Rule, a disclosure that a former partner's new law firm would be required by the unfinished business rule to pay over profits on a client's hourly rate matters to the dissolved firm may affect the trust8 In fact, because a dissolved firm no longer has any ability to perform legal services, California Rule 1-320 is relevant. That Rule prohibits a lawyer from directly or indirectly sharing legal fees with a person who is not a lawyer (except in certain circumstances), even with the client's consent. ABA Model Rule 5.4 similarly prohibits sharing legal fees with nonlawyers except in limited circumstances not applicable here.16necessary to the attorney-client relationship. A client may question the interests of its lawyer after it is informed that the coffers of the lawyer's former law firm, now in dissolution--but not the coffers of the lawyer's new firm--will be increased by payment of the new firm's profits to the dissolved firm. The client also might question whether the lawyer is conducting the representation in a manner that will result in payment of as little as possible to the dissolved firm. See Comment [5] to ABA Model Rule 1.5 ("An agreement may not be made whose terms might induce the lawyer improperly to curtail services for the client or perform them in a way contrary to the client's interest.").9Even a comparison between the unfinished business rule and the requirements for division of fees with the estate of a deceased partner does not support payment of profits to a dissolved firm. California Rule 1-320(A)(2) provides that a member or law firm9 Comment [8] to ABA Model Rule 1.5, however, clearly applies only to payment of fees to a former firm for work done before a lawyer leaves a firm. It states: "Paragraph (e) [of ABA Model Rule 1.5] does not prohibit or regulate division of fees to be received in the future for work done when lawyers were previously associated in a law firm." Comment [8], thus, does not apply to the division of fees earned on work performed on a client's hourly rate matter after a firm's dissolution.17"undertaking to complete unfinished legal business of a deceased member may pay to the estate of the deceased member or other person legally entitled thereto that proportion of the total compensation which fairly represents the services rendered by the deceased member." Thus, a partner's estate does not receive payments for work done after the partner's death. On the other hand, the unfinished business rule requires that a dissolve firm receive the profits on work done by another firm after the dissolved firm, in effect, has died.Finally, under the unfinished business rule, a dissolved firm could seek profits without consideration of the relative amount of work it performed before being discharged and the amount of work performed by the client's new law firm. Thus, even if the client's new firm might spend years defending a lawsuit--for example, a major antitrust matter--and even if the dissolved firm had only just begun representation when it dissolved and had already collected all its fees for the work it undertook, application of the unfinished business doctrine would permit the dissolved law firm to claim years of profits from the client's new firm. Any payment of profits earned by the new firm to the dissolved firm consequently would "have no relationship18whatsoever to the amount of service provided or to be provided by the partnership to the client." Champion, 201 Cal. App. 3d at 783.By requiring a lawyer to pay profits to a dissolved firm, the unfinished business rule would be, in these and other ways, inconsistent with the ethical rules governing the division of fees adopted in California and across the country. II. APPLICATION OF THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS RULETO A CLIENT'S HOURLY RATE MATTERS WOULD ENCOURAGE ATTORNEYS TO LEAVE THEIR FIRMS AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF FINANCIAL TROUBLE AND TO COUNSEL THEIR CLIENTS TO DO THE SAME. As discussed above, the California Rules and the Rules of Professional Conduct as adopted across the nation, as well as the ABA Model Rules, circumscribe a lawyer's ability to charge, collect and divide fees. As also discussed above, application of the unfinished business rule to hourly rate matters that a client has moved to the new firm of a former partner would require payment of the new firm's profits to the dissolved firm. This result would be inconsistent with the ethical responsibilities of the former partner and the new firm. On the other hand, as Heller's trustee conceded below, the unfinished business rule does not apply to matters that a former partner took to a new firm if the former partner left before dissolution.19See Heller Ehrman LLP v. Davis, Wright, Tremaine, LLP, Nos. C 1401236 CRB, C 14-01237 CRB, C 14-01238 CRB, C 14-01239 CRB, 2014 WL 2609743, at *2-3, *6 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 11, 2014). As the New York Court of Appeals stated, "[A]ttorneys who wait too long are placed in a very difficult position. They might advise their clients that they can no longer afford to represent them, a major inconvenience for the clients and a practical restriction on a client's right to choose counsel." In re Thelen LLP, 24 N.Y.3d 16, 32 (2014). Were the client's chosen lawyer no longer able to continue to represent the client, being required to change lawyers may also impose significant costs on the client. Application of the unfinished business rule may thus encourage partners to leave their firms at the first sign of financial trouble.Although leaving a troubled firm would certainly further destabilize the firm, especially if enough partners likewise left, doing so would protect clients from the fee division issues that would arise if the unfinished business rule were to apply. Further, the partners might well reason that if they wait until their firm dissolves before joining a new firm, they might not be able to find a new firm that is willing, or that can financially afford, to finish the matters on which20they are working, especially if a matter would require a significant investment of the new firm's resources, including work by other partners on the matter, or if it would require the new firm to forego other engagements due to conflicts.In fact, the larger the matter, the more difficult it likely would be for a former partner to find a new firm that would take on the client's matter for no profit, and the more costly and potentially detrimental to the client it would be to start over at a firm that includes no former partners of the dissolved firm. Of course, any time a client loses its chosen counsel, the economic reality of the application of the unfinished business rule is that the client endures the cost of bringing new counsel up to speed.Indeed, if the unfinished business rule must be applied to a client's hourly rate matters on dissolution of a law firm--which remains highly disputed at this time--then it would appear that a lawyer should also counsel the client on the ramifications of a dissolution on any hourly rate matters that remain with a firm when it dissolves. In fact, under the ethical rules that apply when a lawyer leaves a law firm, including when a lawyer must leave because of a firm's dissolution, it would appear that the lawyer should counsel a21client that, because of the unfinished business rule, the client should also leave the troubled firm prior to its dissolution.For example, California Rule 3-700(A)(2) provides that a member "shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable laws and rules."10 As explained in State Bar of California Formal Op. No. 2014-190, "The requirements of rule 3-700(A)(2) apply when an attorney's withdrawal is prompted by the dissolution of the attorney's law firm." And, as elucidated in State Bar of California Formal Opinion No. 1985-86, which discussed the predecessor to California Rule 3-700, "[T]he rules in these circumstances act as a regulatory framework, and their provisions dictate that the interests of the clients must prevail over all competing considerations if the practitioner's withdrawal from the firm or the firm's dissolution is to be accomplished in a manner consistent with professional responsibility." See also ABA10 California Rule 3-700(D) similarly requires that a lawyer "promptly release to the client, at the request of the client, all the client papers and property."22Model Rule 1.16(d) ("Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests . . . ."); ABA Formal Opinion 414 (1999) at 5 (departing lawyer and responsible members of the firm must notify the client of the client's alternatives and "must make clear that the client has the ultimate right to decide who will complete or continue the matters.").The ABA respectfully asserts that lawyers should not feel obligated to leave troubled law firms before dissolution to avoid application of the unfinished business rule to their clients' hourly rate matters. Further, lawyers should not need to protect their clients by counseling them that they should also leave. The ABA urges that, because a dissolved law firm--which can perform no legal services-- has no property interest in a client's hourly rate matters, neither law, nor equity, nor policy should require these actions.23CONCLUSION For the reasons set out above, amicus curiae the American Bar Association respectfully requests that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed.Dated: February 24, 2015OF COUNSEL: DAVID G.

 I. APPLICATION OF THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS RULETO A CLIENT'S HOURLY RATE MATTERS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. Clients, and not lawyers or law firms, own their matters. A client's ownership of its hourly rate matters is not altered when the lawyer handling those matters leaves a firm, even when the lawyer must leave because the firm has dissolved and can no longer provide legal services to the client. Under the unfinished business rule, though, a dissolved law firm would have a property interest in a client's hourly rate matters that the firm was handling at the time of dissolution, and would thus be entitled to the profits earned on those matters by new firms that the dissolved firm's partners join. The California Rules and the Rules of Professional Conduct, like the ABA Model Rules, however, impose obligations and restrictions on lawyers and law firms that protect clients' fundamental and unfettered right to select, retain, and change counsel at any time,8and regulate how lawyers and firms may be paid for legal services.6These Rules are inconsistent with the unfinished business rule.This brief discusses the conflict between the unfinishedbusiness rule and the ethical responsibilities that govern the legal feesthat lawyers and firms can charge a client and how lawyers and firmsmay divide those fees. Because of the integral role that legal fees playin the attorney-client relationship, the ABA asserts this discussion issufficient to establish that, consistent with the Rules, the unfinishedbusiness rule cannot be applied to a dissolved firm's former hourlyrate matters that are handled by a former partner and new firm.6 While California has not adopted the ABA Model Rules, they may be "helpful and persuasive in situations where the coverage of our Rules is unclear or inadequate." Frye v. Tenderloin Hous. Clinic, Inc., 38 Cal. 4th 23, 52 (2006); accord City & County of San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc., 38 Cal. 4th 839, 852 (2006); California Rule 1-100(A) ("Although not binding, opinions of ethics committees in California should be consulted by members for guidance on proper professional conduct. Ethics opinions and rules and standards promulgated by other jurisdictions and bar associations may also be considered."); Cal. Formal Op. No. 2013-188 ("[I]n the absence of related California authority, we may look to the Model Rules, and the ABA Formal Opinions interpreting them, as well as the ethics opinions of other jurisdictions or bar associations for guidance.").9A. Application Of The Unfinished Business Rule To A Client's Hourly Rate Matters Would Conflict With The Financial and Ethical Rules Regulating The Legal Fees That The Client Can Be Charged.As the California Supreme Court stated in Fracasse v. Brent, 6 Cal. 3d 784, 791 (1972), "[I]t is a basic term of the [attorney-client] contract, implied by law ... that the client may terminate that contract at will." See also Champion v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 201 Cal. App. 3d 777, 783 (1988) (noting the close relation between "the client's right to retain counsel of choice" and the client's right to discharge counsel). As the State Bar of California stated, "[L]awyers serve at the pleasure of their clients; a client always maintains the right to terminate the services of a lawyer at any time." Cal. Formal Op. No. 1994-135. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 284.Indeed, this Court has held that "[a] client's power to discharge an attorney, with or without cause, is absolute." Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Angell, Holmes & Lea, 838 F.2d 395, 395 (9th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, ABA Model Rule 1.16(a)(3) requires that a lawyer withdraw from representing a client if discharged by the client.The client's absolute right to terminate a lawyer, however, cannot be squared with the unfinished business rule. If the unfinished10business rule were applied, it would give a dissolved law firm the right--after the client has moved the matter and thus has discharged the dissolved firm--to be paid all of the profits on a client's hourly rate matter that are earned by a former partner's new law firm, even though the dissolved firm did not and could not perform any legal services for which those profits were earned. In addition to ignoring the client's absolute right to discharge a firm, the requirement that all profits be paid to the dissolved firm would conflict with the Rules of Professional Conduct, including the California Rules and ABA Model Rules, under which a firm cannot charge fees for legal services that it did not perform.Further, California Rule 4-200 prohibits a lawyer from charging or collecting an illegal or unconscionable fee, and California courts have held that "fees [that] have no relationship whatsoever to the amount of service provided or to be provided by the partnership to the client" are unconscionable. Champion v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 201 Cal. App. 3d 777, 783 (1988). California Rule 3700(D)(2) requires that a discharged attorney "[p]romptly refund any part of a fee paid in advance that has not been earned" (excluding a true retainer paid solely to ensure a lawyer's availability). The11unfinished business rule, therefore, would permit a dissolved firm to charge, collect and retain an unconscionable free, and require the former partner and new firm to acquiesce in its doing so.California courts also have held that when a client discharges a lawyer, the lawyer is only entitled to compensation for the value of work performed. E.g., Jalali v. Root, 109 Cal. App. 4th 1768, 1777 (2003) (when a client exercises "the unilateral right to discharge his or her attorney with or without cause at any time--even on the courthouse steps," the attorney "only has a right to quantum meruit recovery" representing the value of past work); Oliver v. Campbell, 43 Cal. 2d 298, 304 (1954) (discharged attorney entitled only to "the reasonable value of services recoverable by the employee for his past performance").Likewise, under the ABA Model Rules, legal fees must be earned: ABA Model Rule 1.5(a) prohibits a lawyer from charging or collecting an "unreasonable" fee, while Model Rule 1.5(c) provides that "a lawyer shall deposit into a client trust account legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred." In addition, ABA Model Rule 1.16(d) provides that "any advance payment of fee12or expense that has not been earned or incurred" must be refunded upon termination of the representation.The unfinished business rule concerns profits earned by a new firm after a client had no choice but to move its matter to a new firm; the rule does not concern fees that a firm might have earned prior to its dissolution. A requirement that a former partner and the new law firm must pay such profits to the dissolved firm would conflict with the ethics principles under which lawyers and their firms may be paid only for the work they perform.B. Application Of The Unfinished Business Rule To A Client's Hourly Rate Matters Conflicts With The Ethical Rules Regulating The Division Of Legal Fees.It is axiomatic that a law firm that hires a former partner of a dissolved firm cannot be the same firm as the dissolved firm. Thus, the ethics rules on the division of legal fees must apply in the unfinished business context. See Robert W.

For example, California Rule 2-200(A) provides:A member shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of, associate of, or shareholder with the member unless: (1) The client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that the division will be made and the terms of such division; and (2) The total fee charged by all lawyers is not increased solely by reason of the provision for division of fees and is not unconscionable as that term is defined in rule 4-200. ABA Model Rule 1.5(e), which also requires client consent, provides additional requirements: the division of fees may be made only if "the division [of fees] is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation[.]" Comment [7] to ABA Model Rule 1.5 explains: "Joint responsibility for the representation entails financial and ethical responsibility for the representation as if the lawyers were associated in a partnership."

California Rule 1-320(A)(2) provides that a member or law firm9 Comment [8] to ABA Model Rule 1.5, however, clearly applies only to payment of fees to a former firm for work done before a lawyer leaves a firm. It states: "Paragraph (e) [of ABA Model Rule 1.5] does not prohibit or regulate division of fees to be received in the future for work done when lawyers were previously associated in a law firm." Comment [8], thus, does not apply to the division of fees earned on work performed on a client's hourly rate matter after a firm's dissolution.17"undertaking to complete unfinished legal business of a deceased member may pay to the estate of the deceased member or other person legally entitled thereto that proportion of the total compensation which fairly represents the services rendered by the deceased member." Thus, a partner's estate does not receive payments for work done after the partner's death.

Of course, any time a client loses its chosen counsel, the economic reality of the application of the unfinished business rule is that the client endures the cost of bringing new counsel up to speed.Indeed, if the unfinished business rule must be applied to a client's hourly rate matters on dissolution of a law firm--which remains highly disputed at this time--then it would appear that a lawyer should also counsel the client on the ramifications of a dissolution on any hourly rate matters that remain with a firm when it dissolves. In fact, under the ethical rules that apply when a lawyer leaves a law firm, including when a lawyer must leave because of a firm's dissolution, it would appear that the lawyer should counsel a21client that, because of the unfinished business rule, the client should also leave the troubled firm prior to its dissolution.For example, California Rule 3-700(A)(2) provides that a member "shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable laws and rules."10 As explained in State Bar of California Formal Op. No. 2014-190, "The requirements of rule 3-700(A)(2) apply when an attorney's withdrawal is prompted by the dissolution of the attorney's law firm." And, as elucidated in State Bar of California Formal Opinion No. 1985-86, which discussed the predecessor to California Rule 3-700, "[T]he rules in these circumstances act as a regulatory framework, and their provisions dictate that the interests of the clients must prevail over all competing considerations if the practitioner's withdrawal from the firm or the firm's dissolution is to be accomplished in a manner consistent with professional responsibility." See also ABA10 California Rule 3-700(D) similarly requires that a lawyer "promptly release to the client, at the request of the client, all the client papers and property."22Model Rule 1.16(d) ("Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests . . . ."); ABA Formal Opinion 414 (1999) at 5 (departing lawyer and responsible members of the firm must notify the client of the client's alternatives and "must make clear that the client has the ultimate right to decide who will complete or continue the matters.").The ABA respectfully asserts that lawyers should not feel obligated to leave troubled law firms before dissolution to avoid application of the unfinished business rule to their clients' hourly rate matters. Further, lawyers should not need to protect their clients by counseling them that they should also leave. The ABA urges that, because a dissolved law firm--which can perform no legal services-- has no property interest in a client's hourly rate matters, neither law, nor equity, nor policy should require these actions.23CONCLUSION For the reasons set out above, amicus curiae the American Bar Association respectfully requests that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed.Dated: February 24, 2015OF COUNSEL: DAVID G.

 I. APPLICATION OF THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS RULETO A CLIENT'S HOURLY RATE MATTERS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. Clients, and not lawyers or law firms, own their matters. A client's ownership of its hourly rate matters is not altered when the lawyer handling those matters leaves a firm, even when the lawyer must leave because the firm has dissolved and can no longer provide legal services to the client. Under the unfinished business rule, though, a dissolved law firm would have a property interest in a client's hourly rate matters that the firm was handling at the time of dissolution, and would thus be entitled to the profits earned on those matters by new firms that the dissolved firm's partners join. The California Rules and the Rules of Professional Conduct, like the ABA Model Rules, however, impose obligations and restrictions on lawyers and law firms that protect clients' fundamental and unfettered right to select, retain, and change counsel at any time,8and regulate how lawyers and firms may be paid for legal services.6These Rules are inconsistent with the unfinished business rule.This brief discusses the conflict between the unfinishedbusiness rule and the ethical responsibilities that govern the legal feesthat lawyers and firms can charge a client and how lawyers and firmsmay divide those fees. Because of the integral role that legal fees playin the attorney-client relationship, the ABA asserts this discussion issufficient to establish that, consistent with the Rules, the unfinishedbusiness rule cannot be applied to a dissolved firm's former hourlyrate matters that are handled by a former partner and new firm.6 While California has not adopted the ABA Model Rules, they may be "helpful and persuasive in situations where the coverage of our Rules is unclear or inadequate." Frye v. Tenderloin Hous. Clinic, Inc., 38 Cal. 4th 23, 52 (2006); accord City & County of San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc., 38 Cal. 4th 839, 852 (2006); California Rule 1-100(A) ("Although not binding, opinions of ethics committees in California should be consulted by members for guidance on proper professional conduct. Ethics opinions and rules and standards promulgated by other jurisdictions and bar associations may also be considered."); Cal. Formal Op. No. 2013-188 ("[I]n the absence of related California authority, we may look to the Model Rules, and the ABA Formal Opinions interpreting them, as well as the ethics opinions of other jurisdictions or bar associations for guidance.").9A. Application Of The Unfinished Business Rule To A Client's Hourly Rate Matters Would Conflict With The Financial and Ethical Rules Regulating The Legal Fees That The Client Can Be Charged.As the California Supreme Court stated in Fracasse v. Brent, 6 Cal. 3d 784, 791 (1972), "[I]t is a basic term of the [attorney-client] contract, implied by law ... that the client may terminate that contract at will." See also Champion v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 201 Cal. App. 3d 777, 783 (1988) (noting the close relation between "the client's right to retain counsel of choice" and the client's right to discharge counsel). As the State Bar of California stated, "[L]awyers serve at the pleasure of their clients; a client always maintains the right to terminate the services of a lawyer at any time." Cal. Formal Op. No. 1994-135. See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 284.Indeed, this Court has held that "[a] client's power to discharge an attorney, with or without cause, is absolute." Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Angell, Holmes & Lea, 838 F.2d 395, 395 (9th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, ABA Model Rule 1.16(a)(3) requires that a lawyer withdraw from representing a client if discharged by the client.The client's absolute right to terminate a lawyer, however, cannot be squared with the unfinished business rule. If the unfinished10business rule were applied, it would give a dissolved law firm the right--after the client has moved the matter and thus has discharged the dissolved firm--to be paid all of the profits on a client's hourly rate matter that are earned by a former partner's new law firm, even though the dissolved firm did not and could not perform any legal services for which those profits were earned. In addition to ignoring the client's absolute right to discharge a firm, the requirement that all profits be paid to the dissolved firm would conflict with the Rules of Professional Conduct, including the California Rules and ABA Model Rules, under which a firm cannot charge fees for legal services that it did not perform.Further, California Rule 4-200 prohibits a lawyer from charging or collecting an illegal or unconscionable fee, and California courts have held that "fees [that] have no relationship whatsoever to the amount of service provided or to be provided by the partnership to the client" are unconscionable. Champion v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 201 Cal. App. 3d 777, 783 (1988). California Rule 3700(D)(2) requires that a discharged attorney "[p]romptly refund any part of a fee paid in advance that has not been earned" (excluding a true retainer paid solely to ensure a lawyer's availability). The11unfinished business rule, therefore, would permit a dissolved firm to charge, collect and retain an unconscionable free, and require the former partner and new firm to acquiesce in its doing so.California courts also have held that when a client discharges a lawyer, the lawyer is only entitled to compensation for the value of work performed. E.g., Jalali v. Root, 109 Cal. App. 4th 1768, 1777 (2003) (when a client exercises "the unilateral right to discharge his or her attorney with or without cause at any time--even on the courthouse steps," the attorney "only has a right to quantum meruit recovery" representing the value of past work); Oliver v. Campbell, 43 Cal. 2d 298, 304 (1954) (discharged attorney entitled only to "the reasonable value of services recoverable by the employee for his past performance").Likewise, under the ABA Model Rules, legal fees must be earned: ABA Model Rule 1.5(a) prohibits a lawyer from charging or collecting an "unreasonable" fee, while Model Rule 1.5(c) provides that "a lawyer shall deposit into a client trust account legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred." In addition, ABA Model Rule 1.16(d) provides that "any advance payment of fee12or expense that has not been earned or incurred" must be refunded upon termination of the representation.The unfinished business rule concerns profits earned by a new firm after a client had no choice but to move its matter to a new firm; the rule does not concern fees that a firm might have earned prior to its dissolution. A requirement that a former partner and the new law firm must pay such profits to the dissolved firm would conflict with the ethics principles under which lawyers and their firms may be paid only for the work they perform.B. Application Of The Unfinished Business Rule To A Client's Hourly Rate Matters Conflicts With The Ethical Rules Regulating The Division Of Legal Fees.It is axiomatic that a law firm that hires a former partner of a dissolved firm cannot be the same firm as the dissolved firm. Thus, the ethics rules on the division of legal fees must apply in the unfinished business context. See Robert W. Hillman, Hillman on Lawyer Mobility: The Law and Ethics of Partner Withdrawals and Law Firm Breakups § 4.11.4 at 4:156 n.40 ("By concluding that the partnership continues during the winding-up phase, these opinions are able to elude ethics restrictions on fee splitting when lawyers are not members of the same firm.") (citing, inter alia, Jewel v. Boxer, 15613Cal. App. 3d 171 (1984). See Heller Ehrman LLP v. Davis, Wright,Tremaine, LLP, Nos. C 14-01236 CRB, C 14-01237 CRB, C 14-01238 CRB, C 14-01239 CRB, 2014 WL 2609743, at *4-5 (N.D. Cal.Jun. 11, 2014) (in which the court below concluded that Jewel isoutmoded and inapplicable to the facts presented in this case).7The Rules of Professional Conduct governing the division oflegal fees require that the client must consent to and understand thebasis for any division of fees between firms, and that the total fee7 Compare Anderson, McPharlin & Connors v. Yee, 135 Cal. App. 4th 129 (2005), in which the court found that California Rule 2200 did not apply to a partnership agreement that contained a liquidated damages provision under which a former partner was required to turn over 25% of the fees he earned for a 24-month period on matters begun at his former firm. Thus, Rule 2-200 did not apply because the construction of a partnership agreement did not involve two firms. See also Cal. Formal Op. No. 1994-38 (no division of fees, and Rule 2-200 did not apply, where a lawyer billed a firm in which he was not a partner or employee for his regular hourly rate, and the firm then re-billed that amount to the client and paid it over to the lawyer when paid by the client; the law firm did not retain any portion of the fee and acted merely as a collection agent).The unfinished business rule, however, is based on the ownership of matters and the Appellant seeks to impose obligations on other law firms, and not former Heller Ehrman LLP ("Heller") partners, to disgorge all profits for an unlimited period of time earned on matters after the clients had moved their matters to another firm. Here, California Rule 2-200 does apply because Heller and the firms the Heller trustee has sued were never partners in the same law firm.14charged must not be increased solely because of the division and cannot be unconscionable. For example, California Rule 2-200(A) provides:A member shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of, associate of, or shareholder with the member unless: (1) The client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that the division will be made and the terms of such division; and (2) The total fee charged by all lawyers is not increased solely by reason of the provision for division of fees and is not unconscionable as that term is defined in rule 4-200. ABA Model Rule 1.5(e), which also requires client consent, provides additional requirements: the division of fees may be made only if "the division [of fees] is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation[.]" Comment [7] to ABA Model Rule 1.5 explains: "Joint responsibility for the representation entails financial and ethical responsibility for the representation as if the lawyers were associated in a partnership." Application of the unfinished business rule, however, would require the new law firm of a former partner of a dissolved firm to (1) pay over profits that are not in proportion to any services performed, (2) make those payments to a firm that, because it15is dissolved, cannot assume ethical responsibility for the representation, and (3) make these arrangements without client consent. See also ABA Formal Opinion 464 (2013) (lawyer entering into an arrangement for division of fees "must reasonably believe that the other lawyers' services will contribute to the competent and ethical representation of the client.") (citing Comment [6] to ABA Model Rule 1.1.)8California Rule 3-310(B)(3) also prohibits a lawyer from accepting or continuing a representation without written disclosure to the client where "[t]he member has or had a legal, business, financial, professional, or personal relationship with another person or entity the member knows or reasonably should know would be affected substantially by resolution of the matter." Contrary to the intention of this Rule, a disclosure that a former partner's new law firm would be required by the unfinished business rule to pay over profits on a client's hourly rate matters to the dissolved firm may affect the trust8 In fact, because a dissolved firm no longer has any ability to perform legal services, California Rule 1-320 is relevant. That Rule prohibits a lawyer from directly or indirectly sharing legal fees with a person who is not a lawyer (except in certain circumstances), even with the client's consent. ABA Model Rule 5.4 similarly prohibits sharing legal fees with nonlawyers except in limited circumstances not applicable here.16necessary to the attorney-client relationship. A client may question the interests of its lawyer after it is informed that the coffers of the lawyer's former law firm, now in dissolution--but not the coffers of the lawyer's new firm--will be increased by payment of the new firm's profits to the dissolved firm. The client also might question whether the lawyer is conducting the representation in a manner that will result in payment of as little as possible to the dissolved firm. See Comment [5] to ABA Model Rule 1.5 ("An agreement may not be made whose terms might induce the lawyer improperly to curtail services for the client or perform them in a way contrary to the client's interest.").9Even a comparison between the unfinished business rule and the requirements for division of fees with the estate of a deceased partner does not support payment of profits to a dissolved firm. California Rule 1-320(A)(2) provides that a member or law firm9 Comment [8] to ABA Model Rule 1.5, however, clearly applies only to payment of fees to a former firm for work done before a lawyer leaves a firm. It states: "Paragraph (e) [of ABA Model Rule 1.5] does not prohibit or regulate division of fees to be received in the future for work done when lawyers were previously associated in a law firm." Comment [8], thus, does not apply to the division of fees earned on work performed on a client's hourly rate matter after a firm's dissolution.17"undertaking to complete unfinished legal business of a deceased member may pay to the estate of the deceased member or other person legally entitled thereto that proportion of the total compensation which fairly represents the services rendered by the deceased member." Thus, a partner's estate does not receive payments for work done after the partner's death. On the other hand, the unfinished business rule requires that a dissolve firm receive the profits on work done by another firm after the dissolved firm, in effect, has died.Finally, under the unfinished business rule, a dissolved firm could seek profits without consideration of the relative amount of work it performed before being discharged and the amount of work performed by the client's new law firm. Thus, even if the client's new firm might spend years defending a lawsuit--for example, a major antitrust matter--and even if the dissolved firm had only just begun representation when it dissolved and had already collected all its fees for the work it undertook, application of the unfinished business doctrine would permit the dissolved law firm to claim years of profits from the client's new firm. Any payment of profits earned by the new firm to the dissolved firm consequently would "have no relationship18whatsoever to the amount of service provided or to be provided by the partnership to the client." Champion, 201 Cal. App. 3d at 783.By requiring a lawyer to pay profits to a dissolved firm, the unfinished business rule would be, in these and other ways, inconsistent with the ethical rules governing the division of fees adopted in California and across the country. II. APPLICATION OF THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS RULETO A CLIENT'S HOURLY RATE MATTERS WOULD ENCOURAGE ATTORNEYS TO LEAVE THEIR FIRMS AT THE FIRST SIGNS OF FINANCIAL TROUBLE AND TO COUNSEL THEIR CLIENTS TO DO THE SAME. As discussed above, the California Rules and the Rules of Professional Conduct as adopted across the nation, as well as the ABA Model Rules, circumscribe a lawyer's ability to charge, collect and divide fees. As also discussed above, application of the unfinished business rule to hourly rate matters that a client has moved to the new firm of a former partner would require payment of the new firm's profits to the dissolved firm. This result would be inconsistent with the ethical responsibilities of the former partner and the new firm. On the other hand, as Heller's trustee conceded below, the unfinished business rule does not apply to matters that a former partner took to a new firm if the former partner left before dissolution.19See Heller Ehrman LLP v. Davis, Wright, Tremaine, LLP, Nos. C 1401236 CRB, C 14-01237 CRB, C 14-01238 CRB, C 14-01239 CRB, 2014 WL 2609743, at *2-3, *6 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 11, 2014). As the New York Court of Appeals stated, "[A]ttorneys who wait too long are placed in a very difficult position. They might advise their clients that they can no longer afford to represent them, a major inconvenience for the clients and a practical restriction on a client's right to choose counsel." In re Thelen LLP, 24 N.Y.3d 16, 32 (2014). Were the client's chosen lawyer no longer able to continue to represent the client, being required to change lawyers may also impose significant costs on the client. Application of the unfinished business rule may thus encourage partners to leave their firms at the first sign of financial trouble.Although leaving a troubled firm would certainly further destabilize the firm, especially if enough partners likewise left, doing so would protect clients from the fee division issues that would arise if the unfinished business rule were to apply. Further, the partners might well reason that if they wait until their firm dissolves before joining a new firm, they might not be able to find a new firm that is willing, or that can financially afford, to finish the matters on which20they are working, especially if a matter would require a significant investment of the new firm's resources, including work by other partners on the matter, or if it would require the new firm to forego other engagements due to conflicts.In fact, the larger the matter, the more difficult it likely would be for a former partner to find a new firm that would take on the client's matter for no profit, and the more costly and potentially detrimental to the client it would be to start over at a firm that includes no former partners of the dissolved firm. Of course, any time a client loses its chosen counsel, the economic reality of the application of the unfinished business rule is that the client endures the cost of bringing new counsel up to speed.Indeed, if the unfinished business rule must be applied to a client's hourly rate matters on dissolution of a law firm--which remains highly disputed at this time--then it would appear that a lawyer should also counsel the client on the ramifications of a dissolution on any hourly rate matters that remain with a firm when it dissolves. In fact, under the ethical rules that apply when a lawyer leaves a law firm, including when a lawyer must leave because of a firm's dissolution, it would appear that the lawyer should counsel a21client that, because of the unfinished business rule, the client should also leave the troubled firm prior to its dissolution.For example, California Rule 3-700(A)(2) provides that a member "shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable laws and rules."10 As explained in State Bar of California Formal Op. No. 2014-190, "The requirements of rule 3-700(A)(2) apply when an attorney's withdrawal is prompted by the dissolution of the attorney's law firm." And, as elucidated in State Bar of California Formal Opinion No. 1985-86, which discussed the predecessor to California Rule 3-700, "[T]he rules in these circumstances act as a regulatory framework, and their provisions dictate that the interests of the clients must prevail over all competing considerations if the practitioner's withdrawal from the firm or the firm's dissolution is to be accomplished in a manner consistent with professional responsibility." See also ABA10 California Rule 3-700(D) similarly requires that a lawyer "promptly release to the client, at the request of the client, all the client papers and property."22Model Rule 1.16(d) ("Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests . . . ."); ABA Formal Opinion 414 (1999) at 5 (departing lawyer and responsible members of the firm must notify the client of the client's alternatives and "must make clear that the client has the ultimate right to decide who will complete or continue the matters.").The ABA respectfully asserts that lawyers should not feel obligated to leave troubled law firms before dissolution to avoid application of the unfinished business rule to their clients' hourly rate matters.

SeeIn re Shelby R., 148 N.H. 237, 239 (2002)). In making this decision, the Court must weighthree factors: (1) the private interests that will be affected: (2) the risk of erroneousdeprivation of the liberty interest through the procedures used and the value, if any, ofadditional or substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the state's interest, including thefunction involved and fiscal and administrative burdens that additional or substituteprocedural requirements would entail. Id at 240; see also In re Father, 155 N.H. 93, 95(2007).This Court has previously concluded as to the first factor that adversary child custody proceedings implicate a fundamental liberty interest--the right to parent. See In re Shelby R., 148 N.H. at 239; In re Nelson, 149 N.H. 545, 547 (2003). In this case, the central question thus becomes whether that right is sufficiently protected, as a matter of due process under the New Hampshire Constitution, if counsel to indigent parent-defendants is denied. The ABA respectfully suggests that, in abuse and neglect proceedings, the conclusion that counsel must be provided is so compelling in most, if not all cases, that a case-by-case balancing of the factors should be rejected in favor of a rule requiring the appointment of counsel for lowincome parent-defendants in all such proceedings.'A.When Indigent Parent-DefendantsErroneous Deprivation Inherent InAre Unrepresented, The RiskAbuse And Neglect ProceedingsToo Great To Be Constitutionally Acceptable.ofIsi,Most Indigent Parent-Defendants Are Incapable Of PerformingThe Advocacy Functions Required In Abuse and NeglectProceedings.Despite the relaxed evidentiary standards in abuse and neglect proceedings, most unrepresented parents cannot perform the advocacy functions--including investigating facts, making an orderly factual presentation, and cross-examining witnesses--that are required.*Cases throughout the country demonstrate that the need for and manner in which evidence must be presented remains beyond the understanding of many indigent parent-defendants.See, ¢.g., In re Hudson, 763 N.W.2d 618, 626 (Mich. 2009) (Weaver, J., concurring) (no evidence presented by unrepresented parent, even though rules of evidence did not apply); Danforth v. State Dep't of Health and Welfare, 303 A.2d 794, 799 (Me. 1973) ("The average parent would be at a loss when faced with problems of procedure, evidence, or crossexamination."); see also in re the Matter of SS, 90 P.3d 571, 576 (Ok.

See, e.g., Jn re Emily A. v. Ebrahim A., 12 Cal. Rptr. 2d 294 (Cal. Ct. App.1992) ("Few lay people are equipped to respond to the legal complexity of [custody] proceedings, particularly when .. . they are dealing with the emotionally devastating potential loss of all of, or significant aspects of, their relationship with their children."); see also Floresv.

In State v.

In adopting its 2006 Resolution, the ABA, too, found that "studies consistently show that legal representation makes a major difference in whether a party wins in cases decided by courts." ABA Report at 10."The recent Michigan case of In re Hudson demonstrates the risk of error in abuse and neglect proceedings involving unrepresented indigent parent-defendants. In re Hudson, 763 N.W.2d 618, 619-20 (Mich. 2009). There, the parental rights of Melanie Morgan, mother of three, were terminated. As described in a concurring opinion, this occurred despite the fact that witnesses for the Department of Human Services ("DHS") "indicated that [she] was making progress, and that termination was neither appropriate nor in the children's bestinterest." Jd. at 626 (Weaver, J., concurring). In fact, less than three months prior to thetermination irial, a DHS caseworker testified at a permanency planning hearing that Mrs, Morgan's therapist "did not support termination and believed that `if this case were on the front end without having removal,' removal would not even have taken place." Id.Termination nevertheless occurred as a result of errors that could have been avoided if Mrs. Morgan had been represented by counsel. As a threshold matter, Mrs. Morgan, "without full information and understanding the consequences," admitted to several allegations in the initial petition brought by DHS, id. at 624, which "pervaded" the entire proceeding, id at 627. "Had [Mrs. Morgan] been represented by counsel during the preliminary hearing, counsel could have fully advised her of the consequences of a plea of admission." Id at 624.This error was compounded by Mrs. Morgan's failure to challenge the evidence presented by DHS. There was no cross-examination, no challenge to hearsay testimony" See, e.g., Barbara Bzedek, Silence in Tenants' Voices in the Legal Process, 20 of Legal Counsel on Outcomes for Poor ofA Randomized Experiment, 36 Law &the Court: Participation and Hofstra L. Rev. 533 (1992); Tenants in New York City's Soc. Rev. 419 (2001).Subordination Seron et al., The Housing Court:of Poor Impact Results-10-presented by DHS, and no evidence presented on Mrs. Morgan's behalf. Id. at 625-26. "Although the rules of evidence do not apply at dispositional and permanency planninghearings .. . , counsel for respondent could have challenged the evidence presented by theDHS and could have called and cross-examined the individuals who prepared the manyreports DHS witnesses referenced in their testimony at these hearings." Jd. at 625. In fact, "there is a real possibility that counsel could have prevented the removal of the children from the home [at the initial hearing]." Jd. at 626.Case law demonstrates that the risk of error when indigent parent-defendants are forced to proceed unrepresented is a real risk with grave consequences. Some reviewingcourts have been able to pinpoint those consequences with specificity. See In re "A" Children, 193 P.34 1228, 1257-58 (Haw. Ct. App. 2008) (detailing "chain of events that could have been broken if Father had had counsel"); 2.V. v. Commonwealth, 242 S.W.3d 669, 673(Ky. Ct. App. 2007) ("At the very hearing in district court at which [parents] were unrepresented, . . . the court made an erroneous finding of fact . . . ."); Jamison, 444 P.2d at17 (finding that, if both sides had been represented, "most, if not all, of the alleged errors would have been avoided"). A case-by-case approach requires the trial court to determine,before the presentation of evidence, whether legal representation is required, but under thisstandard, it is often nearly impossible for reviewing courts to determine whether the lack ofcounsel resulted in the parent suffering an unconstitutional deprivation. This is because "Ttihepleadings and transcript . . . at most will show the obvious blunders and omissions of the defendant parent. Determining the difference legal representation would have made becomes possible only through imagination, investigation and legal research focused on a particular case." Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 51 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).-li-Because indigent parent-defendants are unlikely to understand what is required tocomply with their due process right to a fair hearing, and will often be too intimidated to ask,a case-by-case approach to the appointment of counsel creates an unacceptable risk that theywill be erroneously deprived of their children and that the deprivation may escape review. See id, at 50 (case-by-case approach to appointment of counsel "entails serious dangers for theinterests at stake and the general administration of justice."); In the Matter of K.L.J., 813 P.2d at 282 n. 2 (expressly rejecting a case-by-case approach to the appointment of counsel inadoption proceedings because of the difficulties and costs associated with such an approach).This risk can be avoided by a categorical right to the appointment of counsel when indigentparents are defendants in abuse and neglect proceedings.B.Providing Indigent Parent-Defendants With Legal Representation ServesThe Interests Of Both The Parents And The State.The appointment of counsel for indigent parents in child custody proceedings not onlyprotects the fundamental interest of the parents, but also serves the state's interests. Althoughthe state's primary interest in dependency proceedings is the "best interest of the child," italso has an umbrella interest in "providing all parties a fair hearing." In re Shelby R., 148N.H. at 241 (emphasis added). See also Watson y. Div. of Family Srvs., 813 A.2d 1101, 1110(Del. 2002) ("The State has an interest in the welfare of children and in fostering an accuratedecision."). As demonstrated above, legal representation for the indigent parent-defendants inabuse and neglect proceedings will necessarily result in more correct outcomes for parentsand their children and, thus, serves the state's interest in fair hearings for all. In re Jay R., 197© The ABA notes that in the criminal context, the United States Supreme Court recognized that applying a case-by-case approach to the right to counsel question in criminal cases was unworkable and, thus, overturned it in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963).-12-Cal. Rptr. 672, 681 (Cal. Ct. App. 1983) (appointing counsel "will make the fact-finding process more accurate.").In addition, the state has an interest in conserving funds. See In re Jay R., 197 Cal.Rptr. at 681 ("The state's interest is largely financial."). This interest, too, is benefited by appointing counsel for indigent parent-defendants.'* The Supreme Court of West Virginia expressly considered the savings in judicial efficiency associated with the appointment ofcounsel to indigent parent-defendants:The ultimate benefit should justified by the law and thebe earlier evidence.finality of whatever Financial economydispositional follows fromorder is the trueachievement of judicial economy because of the timely prosecution,. . . Real savings are likely to be realized defense and disposition of these cases, thatis to say, lower public the relatively few casesexpense overall, more than enough to compensate in which counsel may be appointed .. . .forIn the Matter of Lindsay, 473 S.E.2d 110, 124 (W.

In fact, legislation to expand the right to counsel inother states has been "premised on a belief that providing counsel would decrease the numberof children taken from their parents and speed the return of children to their parents, thusbenefiting the individual children and saving the government money." Laura K. Abel, Keeping Families Together, Saving Money, and Other Motivations Behind New Civil Right to Counsel Laws, 42 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 1087, 1110 (2009) (emphasis added)."

Boyer, Justice, Access to the Courts, and the Right to Free`Counsel for Indigent Parents, 36 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. 363, 368 & n. 30 (2005) (collecting cases and stating that throughout the country "most indigent parents continue to be entitled to free counsel when they are forced to respond to charges of parental unfitness brought by thestate."). In fact, the liberty interest in the parent-child relationship is held in such esteemunder the Florida state constitution that "the only civil proceeding in which a person isentitled to free public counsel in Florida is a proceeding to terminate parental rights."

Inaddition, federal laws provide for counsel to specific types of individuals, including NativeAmerican parents in any removal, placement, or termination proceeding. See Indian ChildWelfare Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1912.~14-Moreover, the right to counsel for indigent litigants in certain civil cases--including child custody cases--has long been accepted in other industrial nations. For example, thirty years ago in a case involving an indigent litigant in a child custody dispute, the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights determined that the guarantee of a "fair hearing" required that the government provide counsel to an indigent mother in a separation proceeding. Airey y. dreland, 2 E.ALHLR. 305 (Eur. Ct. H.R. 1979) (finding mother denied effective access to courtin Violation of Article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rightsand Fundamental Freedoms where Irish government refused to appoint her counsel), See alsoJAG. v. New Brunswick, 177 D.L.R. (4th) 124 (1999), available at 1999 WL 1556609(Supreme Court of Canada held that a mother "needed to be represented by counsel for thereto have been a fair determination of the child's best interests"). As Justice Lewis Powell, Jr. stated, when he was president of the ABA, "[Equal|justice under law is not merely a caption on the facade of the Supreme Court building, it isperhaps the most inspiring ideal of our society." ABA Report, at 2. The ABA's long historyof examining whether counsel should always be provided when indigent parents are faced with state-initiated abuse and neglect proceedings and the ramifications, including a risk of erroneous deprivation of their fundamental right to parent when they are unrepresented, has led the ABA to join with the majority of states and other industrial nations in concluding that fair and equal access to justice requires the appointment of counsel for indigent parentdefendants in these cases.-15-CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae the American Bar Association urges this Court to find that the Due Process Clause of New Hampshire Constitution requires that counsel be appointed for indigent parent-defendants in all abuse or neglect proceedings brought by the State seeking custody of their minor child.DATED th. is {2 tho day of December, 2011.By: eQ_ Doreen F.

I. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PERSONS BECAUSE OF THEIR MINORITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR TRANSGENDER STATUS OCCURS BECAUSE OF SEX AND VIOLATES TITLE VIIAs this Court has observed, Congress enacted Title VII for the plainly prophylactic purposes of achieving "equality of employment opportunities," removing historical barriers, Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429-430 (1971), and making persons whole for injuries suffered from unlawful employment discrimination, see Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 418 (1975).Consistent with these broad remedial purposes, Title VII's prohibition on discrimination "because of" an individual's sex encompasses three concepts of special relevance here. First, Title VII forbids "treatment of a person in a manner which but for that person's sex would be different." Los Angeles Dep't of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 711 (1978). Second, Title VII precludes employers from evaluating employees on the basis of stereotypes associated with their sex (or ascribed sex) or their perceived non-conformity with gender stereotypes. See id. at 707; accord Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250-251 (1989) (plurality). Third, Title VII prohibits discrimination based on the interaction of a protected aspect of an employee's identity with the protected aspect of another person with whom the employee associates. See Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. Coll. of Ind., 853 F.3d 339, 349 (7th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (holding that Title VII prohibits11associational discrimination on the basis of race as well as color, national origin, religion, and sex); cf. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1967) (finding that associational discrimination violates the Equal Protection Clause).Sexual orientation and transgender status discrimination constitute classic forms of sex discrimination under the first two pillars of Title VII's protections, and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation equally qualifies as associational discrimination.A. Sexual Orientation And Transgender Status Discrimination Only Occur "Because Of" The Individual's "Sex"Title VII prohibits, in straightforward fashion, discrimination "because of * * * sex." 42 U.S.C. 2000e2(a)(1)-(2). Interpreting this plain language, this Court adopted a "simple test" for determining whether an employment practice constitutes sex discrimination: "whether the evidence shows treatment of a person in a manner which but for the person's sex would be different." Manhart, 435 U.S. at 711 (emphasis added)."When the words of a statute are unambiguous, * * * [the] `judicial inquiry is complete.' " Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 462 (2002). The Court's inquiry should "begin and end" with Title VII's unambiguous text. Star Athletica v. Varsity Brands, 137 S. Ct. 1002, 1010 (2017). The Court has repeatedly emphasized "the basic and unexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written," Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U.S. 469, 476 (1992), and eschewed interpretations that12stray from the statutory text, see, e.g., Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 334 (2010) ("We cannot replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress' intent.").Title VII's express text controls the resolution of these cases. Adherence to Title VII's "because of * * * sex" language supports only one conclusion--that Title VII encompasses discrimination because of the sex of the employee whose sexual orientation or transgender status does not conform to the employer's sex-based stereotypes.Sexual orientation discrimination inherently involves sex-based differentiation. The employee's sex constitutes an essential--but for--element of the discrimination itself, because identifying an individual's sexual orientation requires two key considerations: the individual's sex and the sex of the individual's partners. Therefore, sexual orientation fundamentally constitutes a function of sex--both in terms of the employee's sex and the employee's sexual attraction to individuals of the same sex. See Hively, 853 F.3d at 350 ("It would require considerable calisthenics to remove the `sex' from `sexual orientation.' ").Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation thus easily satisfies the Court's "but for" test for determining whether an employment practice constitutes sex discrimination. Manhart, 435 U.S. at 711. In the context of sexual orientation discrimination, the employee's sex plainly provides the impetus, at least in part, for the differential treatment. For example, a male employee terminated because of his sexual attrac-13tion to, or relationship with, another male would not have been terminated if he had been a woman attracted to, or in a relationship with, the same male partner-- and that differential treatment only occurs because of (and would not have occurred "but for") the male employee's sex. Under the Court's own inquiry, sexual orientation discrimination qualifies as "paradigmatic sex discrimination." Hively, 853 F.3d at 345 (describing the same sort of hypothetical as "paradigmatic sex discrimination").Analogously, an employer cannot fire an employee on the basis of transgender status without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee's sex. Transgender status discrimination, like discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, presents a classic form of sex discrimination because the employee's sex assigned at birth, as opposed to the sex to which the employee identifies, necessarily affects the employment decision.An employer that refuses to hire a transgender woman because of her gender transition subjects the woman to differential treatment because of the sex the employer ascribes to the employee. Therefore, transgender status discrimination necessarily entails treatment that would have been different "but for" the employee's sex. See EEOC v. R.G. &. G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc., 884 F.3d 560, 575 (6th Cir. 2018) ("[I]t is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee's status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee's sex."), cert. granted, 139 S. Ct. 1599 (2019).14These "simple" conclusions remain true, regardless of whether Congress' precise intent at the time of Title VII's enactment encompassed discrimination against persons because of their minority sexual orientation or transgender status. As this Court has explained, Title VII's protections extend far beyond the "principal evil" envisioned by Congress at the time of enactment. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998).The Court has repeatedly declined to construe Title VII's protections in a narrow, parsimonious fashion. The Court has recognized, for example, that sexual harassment, see Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 66-67 (1986), and a "hostile work environment" can violate Title VII, even though those specific practices nowhere "appear in the statutory text," Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 752 (1998). And, in Oncale, this Court found that sex discrimination encompassed same-sex harassment claims, even though recognizing "male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace" "was assuredly not the principal evil" that concerned Congress at enactment. 523 U.S. at 7980. Time and again, the Court has given full effect to the language Congress chose in Title VII. The present cases are as much at the core of Title VII's proscription as those other claims the Court has recognized.The enactment of subsequent legislation that specifically list "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" as prohibited grounds of discrimination does not undermine the plain meaning of the broad language used by Congress in Title VII. To be sure, over thirty years after passage of Title VII, Congress enacted the Hate15Crimes Act, which prohibits violence because of "actual or perceived religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability," 18 U.S.C. 249(a)(2)(A), and amended the Violence Against Women Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of "sexual orientation" and "gender identity," 34 U.S.C. 12291(b)(13)(A). But such belt and suspenders language in later legislation provides little insight into the meaning of the unqualified phrase used in Title VII, "because of * * * sex." The "Constitution puts Congress in the business of writing new laws, not interpreting old ones." United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. 517, 536 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring). "[L]ater enacted laws * * * do not declare the meaning of earlier law." Ibid.The absence of an amendment to Title VII to include expressly sexual orientation and transgender status similarly "lacks `persuasive significance' because `several equally tenable inferences' may be drawn from such inaction," including the simple understanding that the existing legislation already incorporated the new language. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990). Simply put, "Congress cannot express its will by a failure to legislate." Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. at 536 (Scalia, J., concurring).The Court should give effect to the words of Title VII, which prohibit adverse employment "because of * * * sex." Each employee in the cases at bar suffered discrimination that would not have occurred but for the employee's sex; Title VII's plain and express language precludes precisely that.16B. Sexual Orientation And Transgender Status Discrimination Necessarily Rest On Sex StereotypesDiscrimination against persons whose sexual orientation or transgender status diverges from the characteristics society ascribes to them on the basis of sex inherently implicates impermissible stereotyping.Beginning in 1978, this Court described the "well recognized" notion that "employment decisions cannot be predicated on mere `stereotyped' impressions about the characteristics of males or females." Manhart, 435 U.S. at 707. As the Court explained, employment decisions cannot be rooted in "[m]yths and purely habitual assumptions," ibid., because "[i]n forbidding employers to discriminate against individuals because of their sex, Congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes," id. at 707 n.13 (citation omitted).In 1989, a plurality of this Court built upon that precedent, by taking Title VII's proscription against discrimination "because of * * * sex" "to mean that gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions." Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 240 (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). According to the plurality, "an employer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she must not be, has acted on the basis of gender," because "we [have moved] beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group." Id. at 250-251.17A plurality of this Court, joined by two concurring Justices, therefore concluded that a female employee who faced an adverse employment decision because she failed to "walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry," Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 235 (plurality opinion), stated a claim for sex discrimination under Title VII, even though she did not experience discrimination for being a woman per se, but instead for failing to be womanly enough, see id. at 250252 (plurality opinion); see also id. at 259 (White, J., concurring in the judgment); id. at 272-273 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment).The Court's more recent cases continue to condemn reliance on outdated sex-based stereotypes, albeit in slightly different contexts. Indeed, this Court recently restated its longstanding "suspicion" of laws that rely on "overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females," particularly those reliant on "fixed notions" of gender "roles and abilities." Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 137 S. Ct. 1678, 1692 (2017). "Laws according or denying benefits" based on "stereotypes" about traditional roles, this Court reasoned, create a "self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination" and prove "stunningly anachronistic." Id. at 1693.Discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and transgender status rests precisely on the sort of "[m]yths," "purely habitual assumptions," and "stunningly anachronistic" stereotyped impressions condemned in Manhart, Price Waterhouse, and Sessions.18Indeed, sexual orientation discrimination rests on a classical gender stereotype--the belief that men should only be attracted to women and that women should only be attracted to men. Under either scenario, the employees in question have rebuffed the stereotypical roles ascribed to their sex, and any adverse employment decision based on the fact that the employee (whether male or female) walks differently, talks differently, dresses differently, or dates or marries a same-sex partner, represents nothing more than a reaction to the individual's sex. Sexual orientation discrimination squarely falls within the purview of Title VII's proscription against sex discrimination. See Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., 883 F.3d 100, 120-121 (2d Cir. 2018) ("Applying Price Waterhouse's reasoning to sexual orientation, we conclude that when, for example, `an employer * * * acts on the basis of a belief that [men] cannot be [attracted to men], or that [they] must not be,' but takes no such action against women who are attracted to men, the employer `has acted on the basis of gender.' "), cert. granted, 139 S. Ct. 1599 (2019).Discrimination on the basis of transgender status violates these norms in the same way. Indeed, an individual identifies as transgender precisely because his or her behavior transgresses stereotypes of genderappropriate behavior and appearance. But just like a female employee could not be discriminated against based on long-held gender stereotypes (as in Manhart) or for failing to be womanly enough (as in Price Waterhouse), a transgender woman cannot be discriminated against for failing to be manly enough, or, alternatively, for being too feminine. See Ilona M. Turner, Sex Stere-19otyping Per Se: Transgender Employees and Title VII, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 561, 590 (2007) ("If we conceded that Title VII was enacted to protect women from being judged unfairly according to gender stereotypes, we must also agree that Title VII's protections should extend to transgender individuals who are discriminated against because of their perceived violation of gender norms."). In other words, Title VII proscribes discrimination against women for failing to act womanly enough, and against people perceived as men who do. Smith v. City of Salem, 378 F.3d 566, 574 (6th Cir. 2004).Under any circumstances, this Court plainly recognizes that discrimination on the basis of stereotypical impressions about the characteristics of males or females constitutes sex discrimination, see Manhart, 435 U.S. at 707, and sexual orientation and transgender status discrimination cannot be disentangled from discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes. Consequently, just like the Court's sexual harassment precedent required the conclusion that Title VII includes "sexual harassment of any kind that meets the statutory requirements," Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80, the Court's sex stereotyping precedent compels a holding that Title VII encompasses all forms of sex stereotyping, including those on the grounds that the employee's sexual orientation or transgender status does not conform to the employer's stereotypes for the employee's ascribed sex.For these reasons as well, discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and transgender status neces-20sarily fall within Title VII's proscription against sex discrimination.C. Sexual Orientation Discrimination Constitutes Impermissible Associational DiscriminationFinally, where an employer discriminates based on sexual orientation, the employer's motivation necessarily includes opposition to romantic association between persons of particular sexes.In 1967, this Court recognized that "restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause." Loving, 388 U.S. at 12. In Loving, the Commonwealth of Virginia argued that anti-miscegenation statutes comported with the Equal Protection Clause because such laws applied equally to white and black citizens. See id. at 7-8. But "equal application," this Court reasoned, could not save a statute based "upon distinctions drawn according to race." Id. at 10-11. Accord McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 189-191 (1964) ("Judicial inquiry under the Equal Protection Clause * * * does not end with a showing of equal application among the members of the class defined by the legislation.").The same analysis applies to the protections of Title VII. There is a widespread consensus among the courts of appeals that associational discrimination is a form of discrimination that violates Title VII. See, e.g., Holcomb v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2008); Tetro v. Elliott Popham Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, & GMC Trucks, Inc., 173 F.3d 988, 994-995 (6th Cir.211999); Deffenbaugh-Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 156 F.3d 581, 589 (5th Cir. 1998), vacated in part on other grounds by Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 182 F.3d 333 (5th Cir. 1999) (en banc); and Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co., 791 F.2d 888, 892 (11th Cir. 1986). Although Loving and many of the aforementioned cases involved associations between persons of different races, many courts have recognized that the principles of associational discrimination apply equally to all of Title VII's protected classifications, including sex. See, e.g., Hively, 853 F.3d at 345; Barrett v. Whirlpool Corp., 556 F.3d 502, 512 (6th Cir. 2009).In Holcomb, a white male sued Iona College, alleging that his former employer terminated him because of his interracial marriage. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that "an employer may violate Title VII if [the employer] takes action against an employee because of the employee's association with a person of another race." 521 F.3d at 138. In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeals emphasized that, where an employee suffers "adverse action because an employer disapproves of interracial association, the employee suffers discrimination" within the ambit of Title VII's proscription against discrimination "because of * * * race." Id. at 139.More recently, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit extended that reasoning to all protected classifications under Title VII. See Hively, 853 F.3d at 347-349. Because the statute "draws no distinction" between discrimination based on race and that based on sex, the court found no basis to limit associational discrimination claims to discrimination because of the em-22ployee's race. Id. at 349. Title VII precludes, without equivocation, adverse employment action "because of [an] individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)-(2). Thus, to the extent Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of the race of an individual with whom the employee associates, Title VII necessarily encompasses discrimination on the basis of the national origin, color, religion, or sex of the employee's associate.In all events, the fundamental crux of the claim remains the same: the plaintiff would not have suffered an adverse employment action if his or her sex, race, color, national origin, or religion had been different. For example, if an employer disapproves of same-sex marriage and terminates a male employee married to a man, the employee suffers associational discrimination based on his own sex (and the sex of those with whom he associates). Discrimination of that form strikes at the heart of Title VII's protections by impermissibly making an employee's sex a motivating factor for an adverse employment action.For these reasons, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation falls within Title VII's proscription against sex discrimination.23II. SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND TRANSGENDER STATUS DISCRIMINATION IMPOSE A CONSIDERABLE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLEDiscrimination against persons because of their minority sexual orientation or transgender status creates profoundly negative consequences that reverberate across all aspects of society, particularly in terms of access to employment opportunities and public accommodations. Indeed, numerous recent studies have quantified the particularly pronounced institutional discrimination experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LBGTQ) Americans. These are precisely the types of societal costs that Congress sought to stamp out through its adoption of Title VII.The extent of discrimination against persons on the basis of their sexual orientation is staggering. According to a recent study published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, at least one in five LGBTQ people report being personally discriminated against because of their sexuality or transgender status in the contexts of job applications, obtaining equal pay, and consideration for advancement. See Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Discrimination in America: Experiences and Views of LGBTQ Americans (Nov. 2017) (Discrimination in America).That number reflects the fact that in many areas of the country LGBT people have no express protection from discrimination. The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA School of Law has confirmed the consistently greater discrimina-24tion confronted by LGBT people. According to their findings, an estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers live in the United States, and 51% of those workers live in states without explicit statutory protections against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and transgender status. See UCLA School of Law Williams Institute, LGBT People in the U.S. Not Protected by State Nondiscrimination Statutes (Mar. 2019). The reported employment experiences of these individuals readily reflect the absence of such protection--the Williams Institute estimates that nationwide unemployment for LBGT persons rests at 9% (as compared to 5% for non-LGBT people), and that roughly 25% of LGBT people have incomes lower than $24,000 per year (as compared to 18% of non-LGBT people). See Jocelyn Samuels, LGBT workers should be protected from discrimination. Let's hope the Supreme Court agrees, CNN Business (Apr. 24, 2019). In one survey alone, 60% of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people reported being fired from a job or denied employment (as compared to 40% of non-LGB respondents), and 48% of LGB people indicated that they had been denied a promotion or received a negative evaluation (as compared to 32% of Non-LGB respondents). See Ilan H. Meyer, Experiences of Discrimination among Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual People in the US, UCLA School of Law Williams Institute (Apr. 2019).Research related to transgender status discrimination provides an even bleaker depiction of the economic disparities confronted by transgender people. In 2015, the National Center for Transgender Equality reported the unemployment rate of transgender people at 15%--25over three times higher than the national average. See Sandy E. James, et al., The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, National Center for Transgender Equality (Dec. 2016). In addition, the study found that 29% of transgender people live below the poverty line, more than twice the national average. Ibid. And, in one earlier study, 90% of transgender people reported some form of harassment or workplace mistreatment, while 47% of those individuals experienced some form of adverse workplace outcome. See Jerome Hunt, A State-by-State Examination of Nondiscrimination Laws and Policies, Center for American Progress Action Fund (June 2012).6Even those staggering figures paint an incomplete picture, because LGBTQ Americans report significant personal experiences of discrimination in spheres beyond the workplace as well. According to the Harvard study, a majority of all LGBTQ people have personally experienced slurs (57%) or offensive comments (53%) about their sexual orientation or transgender status. See Discrimination in America. Likewise, over half of LGBTQ people report experiencing threats or nonsexual harassment, sexual harassment, or violence, because of their sexual orientation or transgender status,6 The legal profession offers no immunity to these issues. See The Massachusetts Lesbian and Gay Bar Association, The Prevalence of Sexual Orientation Discrimination in the Legal Profession in Massachusetts (Mar. 1994) (explaining that 75% "of lesbian and gay attorneys responding to a [bar] survey have either experienced discrimination based on sexual orientation or heard antigay remarks by colleagues in the office or in court").26and 34% report having been harassed or questioned about their presence in a bathroom. Ibid.The consequences of these far-reaching experiences of discrimination can hardly be overstated. Sexual orientation and transgender status form part of the immutable essence of an individual's being. Discrimination on that basis is destructive both of the individual and to society, especially one built upon the ideal of equal protection under the laws.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed, and the judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Sixth Circuits should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER ROBERT M.

I. The ABA's Mental Health Standards Project.The ABA is well-known for its intensive study of the history, tradition, and policies of the American criminal justice system and its common law roots. One facet of the ABA's work in this area is its landmark Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards Project. Beginning in71981, the ABA brought together an expert group of scholars, practitioners, and scientists to articulate mental health standards based on a review of the history and values of the American criminal law, as well as the best science available. The ABA then comprehensively revisited the Mental Health Standards from 2012 to 2016.A. The 1984 Mental Health Standards.While the criminal law had confronted mental health issues for centuries, the ABA recognized in the late 1970s that its criminal standards had not yet dealt with that subject in detail. In 1981, the ABA established the Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards Project to address the effects of mental illness on criminal defendants, to propose interdisciplinary solutions for tackling unjust prosecutions and convictions of the mentally ill, and to formulate standards for addressing issues at the intersection of mental health and the criminal law. Included as part of this review was an assessment of the insanity defense, or the "defense of mental nonresponsibility" as it is referred to in the Standards.To address that issue and others, the ABA assembled a total of six task forces made up of forty-eight nationally recognized psychiatrists, psychologists, other mental health professionals, prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges, and legal academics. Within a year, a total of seventy-nine legal and mental health experts joined the new Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards Project. The task forces also established formal liaisons with several other leading professional organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association, the8American Psychological Association, the American Orthopsychiatric Association, and the National Sheriffs' Association to ensure adequate interdisciplinary involvement from the medical, professional, and law enforcement communities. These task forces engaged in a comprehensive examination of legal history, social science research, empirical evidence, and best practices over the ensuing five years.Shortly after the Mental Health Standards development process had begun, John Hinckley Jr. was found not guilty by reason of insanity after being tried for his assassination attempt of President Reagan. That verdict prompted a national discussion surrounding the insanity defense throughout the early 1980s. This "new round of controversy over the defense rival[ed] the M'Naghten experience" of the 1840s and led to a spate of state legislation that reflected a "hostile public mood" toward the defense. ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 323-24 (1989).The ABA saw in these developments a need to better understand the history and interdisciplinary scope of the insanity defense, and placed a renewed emphasis on that subject in its Mental Health Standards Project. The task force considering nonresponsibility for crime (the topical area that included the insanity defense) consisted of prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges, professors, psychiatrists, and psychologists. Although it received interdisciplinary input, the task force's review with respect to the scope of the insanity defense was principally guided by the principle that "`mental nonresponsibility' is a jurisprudential, not a medical, concept." Id. at 329. "[T]he decisionmaking function in9criminal trials properly falls to jury and judge," and thus the historical treatment given to the subject by those actors in England and America was central to this inquiry. Id. at 329, 331.Guided by this rich history, described in detail in Part II below, the task force on mental nonresponsibility produced draft Standards, which were adopted by the ABA's House of Delegates in 1984. To implement the age-old principle of moral accountability in black-letter law, the task force formulated--and the ABA adopted-- Standard 7-6.1, which stated that:A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of such conduct, and as a result of mental disease or defect, that person was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of such conduct.Id. at 330. Following the adoption of this and the other ninety-five Standards, the Standards Committee undertook the final and painstaking task of updating and editing the lengthy Commentary that illuminates these comprehensive guidelines for criminal justice reform. Id. at xxii. That effort led to the publication of the original Standards in 1986.The Commentary that accompanied Standard 7-6.1 reflected the ABA's careful consideration of history, precedent, policy, and language in studying the insanity defense. It also explicitly considered, and squarely rejected, a new type of statute that a handful of states had recently adopted: a "mens rea approach" that replaced the affirmative insanity defense with a mens rea inquiry. Id. at 336-38.10B. The 2016 Mental Health Standards.Since their initial adoption, the ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards have been relied upon by many courts, including this Court. See, e.g., Metrish v. Lancaster, 569 U.S. 351, 367 (2013); United States v. Preston, 751 F.3d 1008, 1016-17 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc); Robidoux v. O'Brien, 643 F.3d 334, 339 (1st Cir. 2011); Watts v. Singletary, 87 F.3d 1282, 1286 n.4 (11th Cir. 1996). With the passage of time and new insights into the clinical understanding of mental illness, the Standards Committee of the ABA's Criminal Justice Section launched a new Task Force in August 2012 to reexamine the Mental Health Standards in their entirety. The Task Force's charge was to "draft proposed revisions to reflect current law and best practices." Christopher Slobogin, The American Bar Association's Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards: Revisions for the Twenty-First Century, 44 Hastings Const. L.Q. 1, 2 (2016).The Task Force's membership included three law professors, one judge, two prosecutors, two defense attorneys, two psychiatrists, and two psychologists. Id. The Task Force consulted widely with liaisons from the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Department of Justice, and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. After more than three years of deliberations, the Task Force recommended revisions to some aspects of the Standards. The ABA's House of Delegates approved the updated Standards in August 2016, and the process of drafting commentary is ongoing.While the 2016 Standards revised the 1984 edition in some respects, the ABA left unchanged Standard 7-6.1's11core conclusion: "A person is not responsible for criminal conduct" if that person "was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of such conduct" as a result "of mental disorder."5II. The Insanity Defense Reflects The Core Values And Long Historical Tradition Of Anglo-American Criminal Law.About a decade before Kansas adopted § 22-3220, the ABA's painstaking historical research demonstrated that moral blameworthiness is an indispensable principle of Anglo-American criminal law. Throughout the ages, English and American courts have reserved punishment for those defendants whose criminal acts have earned society's moral condemnation. The corollary to that principle--that individuals without moral culpability should be excused from legal punishment--is equally entrenched in the history and tradition of our justice system. These historical findings were the5 Compare ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 330 (1989) with ABA Criminal Justice Standards on Mental Health 47 (2016). The updated 2016 version of Standard 7-6.1 is:Standard 7-6.1. The defense of mental nonresponsibility [insanity] (a) A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if, at thetime of such conduct, and as a result of mental disorder, that person was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of such conduct. (b) When used as a legal term in this Standard, mental disorder refers to any disorder that substantially affected the mental or emotional processes of the defendant at the time of the alleged offense, unless it was a disorder manifested primarily by repeated criminal conduct or was attributable solely to the acute effects of voluntary use of alcohol or other drugs.12central reason why the ABA's expert-driven Standards process rejected mens rea approach statutes as inconsistent with our justice system's core values.Early Anglo-American Tradition. The ABA found that well before our Constitution was drafted AngloAmerican law rejected the proposition that the concurrence of intent and conduct alone ends the criminal inquiry. Instead, consistent with moral notions stretching back to Greece, Rome, and the Hebrew scriptures about "harmful acts traceable to fault and those that occur without fault," and the capability of individuals to weigh "the moral implications of personal behavior," English kings and juries as far back as the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries refused to punish mentally ill defendants, even if their actions had otherwise been criminal. See ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards at 324-25 & n.8.By the seventeenth century, the ABA noted, jurist Sir Matthew Hale summarized this legal principle as: "where there is a total defect of the understanding there is no free act of the will" that can be considered morally culpable. See id. at 325 (citation omitted). Hale and others justified this principle by comparing adults afflicted with mental disorders that affect moral awareness to minors, or others who did not possess the requisite "understanding and memory" to "know what he is doing." Id. at 331.Even at that early date, and although different formulations of the exact test existed back then, the general principle of moral accountability was widely accepted. The ABA found that "[a]t about the same time" as Hale explored the meaning of moral13understanding for criminal punishment, "other English courts" excused from criminal liability "those who lacked the capacity to distinguish `good from evil' or `right from wrong.'" Id.6 Courts of this period often treated "good and evil" as a synonym for "right and wrong," and used this test in cases involving people with mental disorders. See id. (citing Anthony Platt & Bernard L. Diamond, The Origins of the `Right and Wrong' Test of Criminal Responsibility and Its Subsequent Development in the United States, 54 Cal. L. Rev. 1227, 1236-37 (1966)); see also Platt & Diamond, The Origins of the `Right and Wrong' Test, 54 Cal. L. Rev. at 1235-37 ("By the end of the sixteenth century, the courts had begun to apply the test of `knowledge of good and evil' to the insane. ... In the eighteenth century, the `good and evil' test was regularly used in both insanity and infancy cases.").76 In contrast, and as the decision under review freely admits, Kan. Stat. Ann. § 22-3220 "abandons lack of ability to know right from wrong as a defense" and "allows conviction of an individual who had no capacity to know that what he or she was doing was wrong." J.A. 243-44 (citing in part Delling v. Idaho, 568 U.S. 1038, 1041 (2012) (Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari)).7 In 1716, a legal treatise explained that "Guilt of offending against any Law whatsoever, necessarily supposing a willful Disobedience thereof, can never justly be imputed to those who are ... uncapable of understanding it" and thus "those who are under a natural Disability of distinguishing between Good and Evil, as Infants under the Age of Discretion, Ideots and Lunaticks, are not punishable by any criminal Prosecution whatsoever." I William Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, 1-2 (1716) (cleaned up). Not long after, a judge in 1724 instructed the jury to consider whether the defendant "knew what he was doing, and was able to distinguish whether he was doing good or evil, and understood what he did." Rex v. Arnold, 16 How. St. Tr. 695, 765 (1724). Cf. Rex v. Lord14The Defense in the Nineteenth Century. By the nineteenth century, the "right and wrong" test for gauging a defendant's capacity for moral reasoning was firmly entrenched in both English and American law. See, e.g., Clark's Case, 1 City-Hall Recorder (New York City) 176, 177 (1816) ("The principal subject of inquiry . . . is whether the prisoner, at the time he committed this offence, had sufficient capacity to discern good from evil."); see also United States v. Clarke, 25 F. Cas. 454 (C.C.D.C. 1818) (No. 14,810) (asking jury to decide whether "at the time of committing the act charged" the defendant was "conscious of the moral turpitude of the act"). The classic formulation, as the ABA recognized, came from the House of Lords in M'Naghten's Case, which declared in 1843 that a defendant who did not "know the nature and quality of the act he was doing" or who "did not know what he was doing was wrong" would not be held criminally liable. ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 336 (1989) (quoting M'Naghten's Case, 8 Eng. Rep. 718, 722 (H.L. 1843)); see also Clark v. Arizona, 548 U.S. 735, 747­48 (2006) (explaining the M'Naghten rule). Underlying the M'Naghten formulation was the premise that a defendant must "possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes," 8 Eng. Rep. at 722, a presumption to which the insanity defense responds, and a presumption that, in the vast majority of criminal prosecutions, goes unrebutted.Ferrers, 19 How. St. Tr. 885, 947-48 (1760) (prosecution urging conviction of the defendant because he could "discern the difference between moral good and evil" and had both "the capacity and intention" needed for guilt).15The M'Naghten test soon "became the accepted standard in both [England and America] within a short period of time," as many American jurisdictions accepted it as the governing formulation of the insanity defense. ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 331­34 (1989). States, commentators, and nongovernmental organizations such as the ABA have since offered a wide variety of formulations for the black-letter test, several of which derive at least in part from M'Naghten, see id.; Clark, 548 U.S. at 748-53, but at bottom the insanity defense remains grounded in the same basic logic articulated long ago: that a lack of moral culpability for criminal actions should be a defense to punishment for those actions, see ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 324 (1989) ("The basis for the nonresponsibility defense is a moral one"); see also People v. Schmidt, 110 N.E. 945, 947 (N.Y. 1915) (Cardozo, J.) ("...it is the knowledge of wrong, conceived of as moral wrong, that seems to have been established by [M'Naghten] as the controlling test. That must certainly have been the test under the older law ... [which involved] a capacity to distinguish between good and evil as abstract qualities.").Modern Formulations. By the turn of the twentieth century, approximately two-thirds of the States had adopted the M'Naghten rule, thus ratifying its underlying moral precepts. ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 332 (1989). Nearly all of the others had adopted "nonresponsibility tests consisting of M'Naghten and the irresistible impulse rule." Id. The latter test "posited that persons who could not control their actions should not be held criminally responsible16for them." Id.That state of affairs remained the same until the 1950s when the American Law Institute defined the defense in the Model Penal Code. That definition was also rooted in the notion of moral accountability: a person is not responsible for criminal conduct "if ... as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law." Id. at 333 (quoting Model Penal Code §4.01). The Model Penal Code definition was adopted by more than 20 States, id., and more than a dozen subscribed to it a half-century later, see Clark, 548 U.S. at 751 & n.15. Only a very small minority of states have departed from this longstanding tradition and taken the "no affirmative insanity defense" position that Kansas seeks to defend here. Id. at 752 & n.20.Empirical research. In addition, in its Commentary, the ABA responded to and discredited the common misconception that the insanity defense is systematically abused. ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 342 (1989). At that time, statistics showed that among invocations of the defense "that are successful, most are the result of plea bargain arrangements and many more are resolved at uncontested bench trials." Id. The notion that the defense often leads to a "`battle of the experts' before `impressionable' juries" was mistaken. Id.Indeed, empirical studies have shown that the insanity defense is raised in less than 1% of felony cases nationwide, and is successful in only a fraction of those17cases. Randy Borum & Solomon M. Fulero, Empirical Research on the Insanity Defense and Attempted Reforms: Evidence Toward Informed Policy, 23 Law & Human Behav. 375, 378 (1999); see also Gary Melton et al., Psychological Evaluations for the Courts: A Handbook for Mental Health Professionals and Lawyers 200 & 795 n.11 (4th ed. 2018).8 Research also indicates that forensic evaluators seldom conclude that defendants referred for evaluation qualify for the defense. See Melton et al., Psychological Evaluations for the Courts at 200 & 795 n.14. And just as the ABA found, most insanity adjudications involve a plea bargain or bench trial and not a jury verdict. Melton et al., Psychological Evaluations for the Courts 200 & 795-96 n.19 (citing multistate study that found that less than 15% of adjudications involving insanity claims were conducted by jury trial).After canvassing this history from the early seventeenth century onwards, the ABA concluded that "a defense of mental nonresponsibility [insanity] is necessary to the fair administration of criminal justice." ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 338 (1989). While no "bright line exists between the responsible and the nonresponsible" from a medical or8 Other studies echo this conclusion, finding that only the "most disturbed" were successful in invoking the insanity defense. Lisa A. Callahan et al., The Volume and Characteristics of Insanity Defense Pleas: An Eight-State Study, 19 Bull. Am. Acad. Psychiatry & L. 331, 337 (1991) (reporting results from an eight-state study and finding that "the popular concept that the insanity defense is an `easy out' for defendants who are either feigning mental illness or who claim temporary insanity is clearly untrue.").18clinical perspective, the study concluded that it is necessary for criminal factfinders as a matter of "moral imperative" to consider whether each individual defendant can be held culpable for their actions and subsequently punished. See id. at 338, 342.III. Kansas's `Mens Rea Approach' Is Incompatible With the History and Tradition of the AngloAmerican Criminal Justice System.In this case, Kansas contends that its mens rea approach is an acceptable substitute for the traditional affirmative insanity defense. The ABA has long rejected that proposition, because the mens rea approach contravenes the core rationale of the insanity defense: that criminal punishment is inappropriate for a defendant who, due to their mental disorder, cannot appreciate that their actions are morally blameworthy. A person may intend to perform an act that is criminal (and thus have the requisite mens rea for the crime), yet not understand that the act is wrong because of mental incapacity. To impose criminal punishment for conduct that, by definition, is not morally blameworthy, represents "a jarring reversal of [the] hundreds of years of moral and legal history" sketched above and it "inhibits if not prevents the exercise of humane judgment that has distinguished our criminal law heritage." Id. at 337-38.The Commentary explained that at common law the concept of mens rea "originally was regarded as a generalized requirement of moral blameworthiness" that must be proven in order to impose "criminal liability." Id. at 337. But here, Kansas admits that it makes no such finding anymore in its mens rea19consideration, at least with respect to the crime at issue in this appeal (also the classic crime associated with the insanity defense)--murder.9Indeed, as the ABA also explained, in the last hundred years "mens rea terminology has come to refer to the specific state of mind required for the conviction of particular criminal offenses." Id.10 If the elements of a particular crime do not contain any consideration of moral blameworthiness, as Kansas confirms with respect to its crime of murder, then defendants would be "convicted ... as long as they knew what they were doing at the time of an offense and possessed the intent to commit it." Id."[F]or example, a defendant who knowingly and intentionally killed his son under the psychotic delusion9 See State v. Bethel, 66 P.3d 840, 850 (Kan. 2003) ("In a case similar to the present one where a defendant has stated that he or she thought about it ahead of time and intended to kill his or her victims, a jury's deliberation would need to go no further than those two elements and there would be no consideration of whether wrongfulness was inherent in the defendant's intent" -- thus "the range of the jury's consideration has been significantly narrowed"). As the decision under review confirms, Kan. Stat. Ann. § 22-3220 "allows conviction of an individual who had no capacity to know that what he or she was doing was wrong." J.A. 244.10 See also Francis Bowes Sayre, Mens Rea, 45 Harv. L. Rev. 974, 1016-17 (1932) (until "modern" times, the "mental factors necessary for criminality were based upon a mind bent on evil-doing in the sense of moral wrong," in contrast to modern mens rea formulations that focus on "protecting social and public interests"); Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 251-52 (1952) (under American common law, crime "generally constituted only from concurrence of an evilmeaning mind with an evil-doing hand").20that he was the biblical Abraham, and his son the biblical Isaac, could be held criminally responsible." Id. In short, a Kansas murder jury is no longer called upon to perform any moral calculus as to a psychotic defendant's culpability, provided the defendant knew (at least in the abstract), that he or she was killing a human being. That policy is inconsistent and irreconcilable with the AngloAmerican criminal law tradition, which is what led the ABA to reject mens rea statutes "out of hand." Id. at 336­37.Another moral problem that the ABA commentary identified with laws like Kansas's is rooted in presentday concerns: "the mens rea limitation forces judges and juries confronted with defendants who are uncontrovertibly psychotic either to return morally obtuse convictions" by punishing those who are not responsible moral agents, "or to acquit in outright defiance of the law" and its obligation to uphold order and provide justice. See id. at 338.By forcing a strictly binary choice of guilty/not guilty upon a situation in which reprehensible acts may have been committed without clear moral responsibility, the Kansas mens rea approach leaves criminal factfinders to select between two equally unpalatable and unjust results. See id. A system that provides only two unjust options to its key decisionmaker cannot be said to respond to the "moral imperative" of providing the humane and "fair administration of criminal justice." See id.The ABA thus concluded in its Commentary that the mens rea approach also constitutes "an unfortunate and unwarranted overreaction to the problems typified by21the Hinckley verdict" and popular reaction to it, see id. at 337, because it leads to unjust results while also failing to meaningfully advance the integrity of the legal process or the criminal justice system. Indeed, our system only punishes those who should be held morally accountable.That basic logic of moral culpability--what the ABA has called the "moral basis of the mental nonresponsibility [insanity] defense"--is "undeniable and has been reaffirmed throughout the history of western civilization." Id. at 336. That moral logic persists today, as is evident in the sentencing context. See Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 149 (1987) ("The heart of the retribution rationale is that a criminal sentence must be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal offender."); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 568 (2005) ("Capital punishment must be limited to those offenders ... whose extreme culpability makes them `the most deserving of execution'" (citation omitted)).As the ABA concluded in its Commentary, from a moral perspective, mentally disordered and morally blameless defendants "should not be punished as criminals," and should "be confined only upon a showing that they are dangerous." ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards 330 (1989). While there are "various formulations of the defense" that set forth different tests, all of them "respond[] to [the] moral imperative" of punishing only those defendants who have earned society's condemnation. See id. at 338. After another round of comprehensive review, the ABA's updated 2016 Standards retain that same core focus on22moral culpability, see supra at 11 & n. 5, a concept which from early Anglo-American legal history up through the present day has been recognized as "critical to our shared notions of justice," Jane Campbell Moriarty, Seeing Voices: Potential Neuroscience Contributions to a Reconstruction of Legal Insanity, 85 Fordham L. Rev. 599, 600 (2016).CONCLUSIONThis Court should reverse the decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas.Respectfully submitted,MATTHEW S. HELLMAN JASON T.

I. To Avoid Serious Due Process Concerns, The Immigration Detention Statutes At Issue Must Be Read To Require A Hearing To Justify Detention Within A Reasonable PeriodThe ABA will not repeat issues more thoroughly addressed by the parties and the Court of Appeals below. The ABA notes that the Government does not appear to dispute that immigrants detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226(c) and 1226(a) are entitled to due process protections. See, e.g., Petr. Br. at 29, 47. This Court held that immigrants are entitled to freedom from excessive detention in Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690-96 ("the Due Process Clause applies to all `persons' within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent"). In enacting11these three statutes, however, Congress did not identify a mechanism for securing those rights. Although each of the statutes contains different provisions directed at different categories of immigrants, none expressly state the manner in which an individual may vindicate the constitutional right to an individualized hearing before a neutral decision maker to test the reasonableness of prolonged detention. The canon of constitutional avoidance requires therefore that the courts interpret the statutes to allow a workable means of conducting such a hearing, because to interpret the statutes otherwise "would raise serious constitutional problems." INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 299-300 (2001); see also Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 695 (employing the constitutional avoidance canon in interpreting 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6)). As set forth below, the means employed by the Court of Appeals--though less stringent than those recommended and adopted by the ABA--adequately secure those rights by ensuring administrative review with clear standards within a fixed period of time. By contrast, ABA practitioners' and federal courts' experience has demonstrated that the case-by-case habeas petitions immigrants would be forced to file under the Government's interpretation would not adequately secure the important rights at stake here.II. A Temporal Bright-Line Rule Is Necessary And Appropriate To Provide Uniformity And Clear Instruction On When The Government Must Conduct A Bond HearingTo ensure that immigrants subject to prolonged detention pending removal proceedings may test the basis for their detention, the Ninth Circuit appropriately adopted a bright-line temporal approach, providing a clear12and consistent mechanism for such determinations. The bright-line approach is consistent with the ABA Detention Standards and related policies, which call for a prompt detention determination based on objective findings that the immigrant presents a danger to the community or a substantial flight risk.3 These standards further provide that such review should take place within a set period of time and be regularly reviewed thereafter.4A bright-line approach most appropriately ensures compliance with due process obligations and addresses the well-founded concerns of ABA members with the case-bybase approach--particularly that it produces needlessly prolonged detention periods and has caused inconsistent application of the law, resulting in arbitrary detention3. Report 107E (showing that the ABA supports "a prompt hearing" before an immigration judge for immigrants denied release, "including meaningful administrative review and judicial oversight"); Detention Standards, § II.G ("A noncitizen should only be detained based upon an objective determination that he or she presents a threat to national security or public safety or a substantial flight risk that cannot be mitigated through parole, bond, or a less restrictive form of custody or supervision.").4. Detention Standards, § III.A(1) ("The intake, classification, and placement process should be used by DHS/ICE to determine whether a noncitizen should be released, placed in an alternative-todetention (ATD) program or detained."); id. at § III.D ("In addition to assessing individuals in the initial intake process, DHS/ICE should regularly review its placement and classification decisions to ensure that residents are (a) Detained for the minimum time necessary; (b) Not detained indefinitely; (c) Reclassified and, if appropriate, transferred to another kind of facility; and (d) Released if detention is no longer appropriate. The initial review of a resident's classification and placement should be performed no more than four weeks after a resident has entered a facility.").13determinations.5 By contrast, the bright-line approach similar to the one adopted by this Court in Zadvydas and Clark, and as adopted by the Ninth Circuit, is better suited to achieve due process requirements, and is consistent with this Court's precedent.Jurisdictions that have applied a case-by-case, multifactor test have experienced inconsistent and irreconcilable results that compound, rather than resolve, due process concerns. By contrast, the experience of lower courts and this Court in analogous contexts has demonstrated that a bright-line temporal rule is easier to administer and monitor, and gives both the Government and the immigrant fair opportunity to be heard by an administrative officer with appropriate expertise.5. In addition to preventing arbitrary detention, a brightline rule helps prevent the normalization of prolonged detention, which itself compounds delays by producing institutional apathy. See Institute of Judicial Administration, American Bar Association, Juvenile Justice Standards: Standards Relating to Interim Status 12 (1979) (recognizing that delay in juvenile courts "tend[s] to institutionalize and legitimate the unwarranted detention that already exists") (citing Patricia Wald, Pretrial Detention for Juveniles, in Pursuing Justice for the Child 119, 126-27 (Margaret K. Rosenheim ed., 1976)), available at http:// w w w.americanbar.org /content/dam /aba/migrated /sections/ criminaljustice/PublicDocuments/JJ_Standards_Interim_Status. authcheckdam.pdf. Indeed, administrators often favor a bright-line system because it compels them to address demands that would otherwise go unmet. Id. ("Deadlines and absolute bars to detention may seem arbitrary, yet it is striking how frequently detention personnel ask for such limitations, realizing that they cannot cope with an unending stream of detainees.") (quoting Wald, Pursuing Justice for the Child at 126-27).14A. Because The Case-By-Case Approach Gives Rise To Inconsistent Determinations, It Results In Arbitrary DetentionThe ABA's position in this proceeding draws upon the actual experience of federal courts that have employed the case-by-case approach in habeas proceedings to test the reasonableness of immigrants' lengthy detention. In those situations, district courts have been instructed by their respective circuit courts to evaluate various factors, including: (1) the total length of detention; (2) the likely duration of future detention; (3) the likelihood that the proceedings will end in a final removal order; (4) whether any delay in the proceedings can be attributed to the Government or the immigrant; and (5) in the context of a criminal noncitizen, a comparison between the length and nature of the current detention and the detention in prison for the crime that rendered the immigrant removable.6 If the immigrant prevails in the federal court on his habeas petition by demonstrating that the length of his detention was indeed unreasonable, he is then entitled to a bond hearing by an immigration judge to determine whether he nonetheless poses a flight risk or danger to the community.The standard of "reasonableness" as determined by these factors provides no uniform guidance as to when a bond hearing is required. Because of the systemic problem of prolonged detention, challenges to detention have repeatedly arisen in the federal courts, requiring them6. Sopo v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 825 F.3d 1199, 1217-19 (11th Cir. 2016); Reid v. Donelan, 819 F.3d 486, 500 (1st Cir. 2016); see also Farrin R. Anello, Due Process and Temporal Limits on Mandatory Detention, 65 Hastings L.J. 363, 396-98 (2014) (listing factors courts consider to determine "reasonableness" of detention).15to determine when detention has become "unreasonable." Not surprisingly, this has led to widespread confusion and inconsistent application. See Lora v. Shanahan, 804 F.3d 601, 615 (2nd Cir. 2015) (compiling cases of inconsistent determinations of reasonableness and concluding "the pervasive inconsistency and confusion exhibited by district courts in this Circuit when asked to apply a reasonableness test on a case-by-case basis weighs, in our view, in favor of adopting an approach that affords more certainty and predictability"); Reid, 819 F.3d at 497 ("the approach has resulted in wildly inconsistent determinations"); Sopo v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 825 F.3d 1199, 1226 (11th Cir. 2016) (Pryor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("despite the best efforts of judges, courts have been unable to apply flexible reasonableness standards in a manner that generates predictable, consistent, and fair outcomes"); Farrin R. Anello, Due Process and Temporal Limits on Mandatory Detention, 65 Hastings L.J. 363, 395-400 (2014) (analyzing the disparate application of reasonableness factors in district courts).7Additionally, under this approach, courts have expressly expanded the "reasonable" period for detention to accommodate the size of their immigration dockets. See Ly v. Hansen, 351 F.3d 263, 271 (6th Cir. 2003) ("A7. A survey of district courts' habeas decisions reveals disparate handling of a number of factual determinations bearing on reasonableness, including: (i) the effect of applications or appeals the immigrant files in good faith, Anello, 65 Hastings L.J. at 398-99 nn. 193-94, (ii) the effect of administrative appeals by the Government, id. at 399-400 nn. 196-201, (iii) the relevance of the expected duration of future detention, id. at 400 nn. 202-03, and (iv) the relevance of the immigrant's likelihood of success in removal proceedings, id. at 400-01 nn. 204-07.16bright-line time limitation, as imposed in Zadvydas, would not be appropriate for the pre-removal period; hearing schedules and other proceedings must have leeway for expansion or contraction as the necessities of the case and the immigration judge's caseload warrant."); see also Lora, 804 F.3d at 615-16 ("[W]hile a case-by-case approach might be workable in circuits with comparatively small immigration dockets, the Second and Ninth Circuits have been disproportionately burdened by a surge in immigration appeals and a corresponding surge in the sizes of their immigration dockets."); Reid, 819 F.3d at 498 ("Moreover, the federal courts' involvement is wastefully duplicative. . . . This inefficient use of time, effort, and resources could be especially burdensome in jurisdictions with large immigration dockets."). The constitutional reasonableness of spending a year or more in an immigration detention facility, without being deemed dangerous or a flight risk, cannot depend on the location of the detention or the caseload of any particular judge. See Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972) (holding that due process requires that "the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose").Some federal courts applying these factors have gone so far as to deem routine extensions, such as to pursue appeals or seek relief from other agencies, to be grounds to deny habeas relief. Anello, 65 Hastings L.J. at 399 n.194 (collecting cases). Penalizing an immigrant for his attorney's need for additional time to prepare or to pursue other meritorious relief offends ABA policies promoting the right to effective assistance of counsel. See ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.1 ("Competent representation requires the . . .17thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation."); see also id., Rule 1.3 cmt. 1 ("A lawyer should . . . take whatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client's cause or endeavor.").To add even further uncertainty, unpredictability, and inconsistency, the circuits have noted that the factors articulated are not exhaustive and that there may be "other factors that bear on the reasonableness of categorical detention." Reid, 819 F.3d at 501; Sopo, 825 F.3d at 1218. Without clarifying to some degree of certainty what constitutes "unreasonable detention," courts will continue to apply manifestly inconsistent, unpredictable, and seemingly arbitrary standards, see Anello, 65 Hastings L.J. at 398-401, depriving immigrants of the "`protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,'" which this Court "ha[s] emphasized time and again [is] `the touchstone of due process.'" County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845 (1998) (quoting Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 558 (1974)); Antonin Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175, 1179 (1989) (unpredictability and inconsistency are "incompatible with the Rule of Law"); Sopo, 825 F.3d at 1225 (Pryor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[T]he risk that the case-by-case approach will result in unpredictable, inconsistent, or arbitrary outcomes itself raises serious due process concerns") (quoting Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992)).In short, experience of the federal courts, like that of ABA practitioners, has confirmed that employing a case-by-case approach to test the reasonableness of immigration detention periods actually compounds,18rather than resolves, due process concerns. The need for consistency, certainty, and the fair administration of constitutional guarantees thus favors a bright-line rule that allows a Government official to determine with confidence whether a detainee is entitled to a bond hearing.8 Cf. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 56 ("[I]t is important to provide some degree of certainty so that States and counties may establish procedures with confidence that they fall within constitutional bounds."); see Sopo, 825 F.3d at 1226 (Pryor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("The clarity of [a six-month bright-line rule] would benefit not only detained aliens . . . , but also courts, which would not have to engage in a weighing of multiple factors merely to decide whether and when a hearing must be provided.").B. The Court Has Recognized That Bright-Line Rules Best Protect Detainees' Constitutional RightsConsistent with Zadvydas and Clark, this Court has favored bright-line rules when determining the constitutionality of the continued and prolonged detention of immigrants. In Zadvydas, applying the canon of constitutional avoidance to post-removal detention, this Court found it necessary "for the sake of uniform8. The Government's concern that a bright-line rule will result in the filing of frivolous appeals or deliberately dilatory tactics is unwarranted. The immigration judge can always consider whether the strength of the detainee's claim or the detainee's litigation conduct affects the reasonableness of granting a bond. See Sopo, 825 F.3d at 1226-28 (Pryor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (recognizing that "[u]nder the bright-line approach, criminal aliens are not automatically released after six months").19administration" to set a "presumptively reasonable period of detention" of six months. Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 699-701. The Court found six months to be appropriate because "Congress previously doubted the constitutionality of detention for more than six months." Id. at 701 (adopting presumption that detention beyond six months constitutes an unreasonable period of post-removal detention of removable noncitizens) (citing Juris. Statement of United States in United States v. Witkovich, O. T. 1956, No. 295, pp. 8-9); see Clark, 543 U.S. at 386 (2005) (extending Zadvydas to inadmissible noncitizens).In Demore, the Court rested its decision upholding mandatory detention of criminal noncitizens pending removal proceedings on the limited duration of the detention. See Demore, 538 U.S. at 513 (authorizing "that persons such as respondent be detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings") (emphasis added); see id. at 526 ("[G]overnment may constitutionally detain deportable aliens during the limited period necessary for their removal proceedings") (emphasis added). One Justice in Demore noted that a detainee "could be entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention became unreasonable or unjustified." Id. at 532 (Kennedy, J., concurring). The Court therefore left open whether the statute authorized prolonged mandatory detention.In Demore, the Court assumed removal proceedings last, on average, "roughly a month and a half in the vast majority" and "about five months in the minority of cases in which the alien chooses to appeal." 538 U.S. at 530. In fact, the Government now acknowledges these assumptions were erroneous, and that a true analysis of20the data would have shown that, when there is an appeal, the immigrant spends an average of more than a year in detention--more than double what the Court assumed in Demore. Petr. Br. 34-35 n.10. Over a decade later, the Government has failed to decrease detention time, forcing a detainee pursuing relief to face a significant probability of spending a year or more in detention. See Rodriguez v. Robbins, 804 F.3d 1060, 1072 (9th Cir. 2015). Despite the Government's failure to rectify the problem, the current process in place does little to ensure prolonged detention is met with a required bond hearing. Such categorical unreasonableness requires a Zadvydas-style categorical safeguard. See Sopo, 825 F.3d at 1230 (Pryor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).A bright-line rule, as opposed to a case-by-case approach, would also be consistent with--and would meaningfully enforce--this Court's directive that, under the canon of constitutional avoidance, courts should apply a definite standard that avoids the serious constitutional problem altogether. See Clark, 543 U.S. at 384 (noting that the Court is not "free to `interpret' statutes as becoming inoperative when they `approach constitutional limits'"). Simply adopting a reasonableness standard, without definitive bright-line guidance, amounts to interpreting the statutes to "`authorize detention until it approaches constitutional limits,'" precisely the approach this Court rejected in Clark. Id.Even outside the context of Due Process Clause requirements, this Court has implemented temporal bright-line rules and presumptions to limit the need for judicial oversight and to ensure government officials act within constitutional limits. See McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at2156 (creating a presumption that a probable cause hearing within 48 hours of arrest will generally comply with the Fourth Amendment); Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. at 380 (interpreting the Sixth Amendment to require a jury trial where more than six months of imprisonment is imposed).In McLaughlin, the Court found it necessary to clarify a previous holding that the Fourth Amendment requires a "prompt" judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to further pretrial detention after a warrantless arrest. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 47 (citing Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975)). The Court recognized that its previous standard was too "vague" to be effective because it failed to provide "sufficient guidance" to enforce the Fourth Amendment, resulting in "systemic challenges," and, in turn, requiring federal judges to "oversee[] local jailhouse operations." Id. at 55-56 ("Although we hesitate to announce that the Constitution compels a specific time limit, it is important to provide some degree of certainty so that States and counties may establish procedures with confidence that they fall within constitutional bounds."). Therefore, relying on processingtime data from the Court of Appeals, the Court held that 48 hours is the presumptive time limit for a probable cause hearing. Id. at 56-57; accord Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. at 380 (holding bright-line six-month sentence rule was required for "effective administration" of the "petty offense" exception to the constitutional right to jury trial).99. The dissent in Zadvydas suggested that the six-month rule in Schnackenberg was only "proper `under the peculiar power of the federal courts to revise sentences in contempt cases.'" Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 712 (Kennedy, J. dissenting) (quoting Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. at 380). Since Schnackenberg, however, the Court has held the right to jury trial applies to the states through the Fourteenth22Similar to the vague standards of "promptness" in McLaughlin and "petty offense" in Schnackenberg, a "reasonableness" standard for detentions under the statutes at issue without a bright-line rule fails to identify when a bond hearing is constitutionally required. As demonstrated by the record before this Court, a reasonableness standard results in ineffective administration of constitutional rights, and inconsistent, unpredictable, and arbitrary detention determinations. The lower courts and the ABA both recognize the need and appropriateness of a bright-line rule, and such a rule would be consistent with due process and this Court's precedent. The Government has been unable to resolve the problem of prolonged detention, and a multifactor reasonableness test will do little to guide the Government's compliance with its due process obligations. Therefore, the ABA urges this Court to adopt a bright-line temporal rule for when immigration officials must afford a bond hearing on flight risk and dangerousness.III. Possible Habeas Relief Does Not Ameliorate The Government's Due Process ViolationsThe Government acknowledges that the Due Process Clause imposes some temporal limit on detention: "[B]ecause longer detention imposes a greater imposition on an individual, as the passage of time increases a court may scrutinize the fit between the means and the endsAmendment, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 162 (1968), and later applied the same six-month rule to state courts, Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 73-74 (1970), over which federal courts have no supervisory power to revise sentences. Therefore, as applied to the states, the six-month rule embodies the Court's broader authority to set bright-line rules for effective enforcement of constitutional rights.23more closely." Petr. Br. at 47 (citing Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690, 701). Having failed over several years to ensure that detention of immigrants does not extend for an unwarranted period, the Government now proposes to use individual habeas claims as a means to test the reasonableness of the period of detention. Id. Although the Government asserts unconstitutional applications of the statutes are rare and could be addressed through habeas proceedings (see Petr. Br. at 12, 14), neither the actual experience of courts nor the practical realities of habeas procedure suggest that such cases are rare, or that the habeas procedure provides an adequate substitute for a timely bond hearing before an administrative hearing officer. Indeed, the experience of ABA member practitioners has been that the only way to ensure fair and timely review is through "a prompt hearing before an Immigration Judge for any alien in removal proceedings who is denied release with or without bond, including meaningful administrative review and judicial oversight." Report 107E at p. 1.A. Government Administrative Proceedings Must Afford Due Process Regardless Of Whether Habeas Is Also AvailableThis Court has already recognized that, even where federal habeas corpus is available, administrative processes must still safeguard due process rights. For example, in the context of civil commitment, this Court has held that due process requires an administrative process to protect against unreasonable detention, notwithstanding the availability of habeas review to challenge such civil commitment. See, e.g., McNeil v. Director, Patuxent Inst., 407 U.S. 245, 257 (1972) ("It is24elementary that there is a denial of due process when a person is committed or, as here, held without a hearing and opportunity to be heard."); Jackson, 406 U.S. at 738 ("At the least, due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed."); Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 608-17 (1979); see Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 176 (2001) (observing "federal habeas corpus review may be available to challenge the legality of a state court order of civil commitment").Most recently, in the context of scrutinizing the purpose and duration of detaining enemy combatants, this Court directed use of proceedings with full due process rights, despite the fact that habeas proceedings remained available. Thus, in cases relating to detention at Guantanamo, the Court required an improved set of due process protections in military trials, notwithstanding the availability of the writ of habeas corpus to determine the availability of constitutional protections for these detainees. See, e.g., Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 525 (2004) (acknowledging that the Due Process Clause "informs the procedural contours of [habeas corpus] in this instance," but nonetheless setting forth requirements for hearings separate and apart from habeas, even though "[a]ll agree suspension of the writ has not occurred here"); cf. Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 785 (2008) (holding that habeas must remain available even if detentions satisfy due process requirements); see also Habeas Corpus and Due Process, Brandon L. Garrett, 98 Cornell L. Rev. 47, 54 (2012) (discussing the "longstanding and consistent treatment of habeas process as independent of due process"); Lee Kovarsky, Custodial and Collateral Process: A Response to Professor Garrett, 98 Cornell L. Rev. Online 1, 1 (2013).25Following this Court's lead, the circuits have recognized that habeas review "is in no way the type of periodic review that due process requires." J.R. v. Hansen, 803 F.3d 1315, 1326 (11th Cir. 2015) ("Habeas can be at most a backstop--a failsafe mechanism, not the sole process available.") (citations omitted); Doe v. Gallinot, 657 F.2d 1017, 1023 (9th Cir. 1981) ("No matter how elaborate and accurate the habeas corpus proceedings . . . may be once undertaken, their protection is illusory when a large segment of the protected class cannot realistically be expected to set the proceedings into motion in the first place. . . . [¶] The bare existence of optional habeas corpus review does not, of itself, alleviate due process concerns.").B. Habeas Has Proved To Be An Ineffective RemedyEven if, in some contexts, a habeas proceeding could theoretically satisfy the Due Process Clause, an alternative procedure is required where, as here, habeas does not afford effective due process for a substantial number of detainees.Habeas has proved inadequate as a practical matter for a number of reasons. As discussed above, the case-bycase "reasonableness" factors that courts apply in habeas review are nonexclusive and, when applied in isolation, different courts have produced wildly inconsistent, unpredictable, and seemingly arbitrary applications. See Section II.A supra. Apart from the arbitrariness inherent in case-by-case determinations, in the ABA's experience, the federal habeas process is inherently illsuited to prevent immigrants from suffering unreasonably prolonged detention. First, the A BA's experience26and federal court data confirm that the complexity of habeas presents an insurmountable barrier to many detained immigrants, who would effectively be denied any opportunity for review. Second, habeas procedures inevitably compound--rather than relieve--the period of prolonged detention. Third, these petitions consistently languish on crowded federal court dockets due in part to the fact that virtually all expertise about the nature and purpose of confinement reside with administrative officials, leading courts themselves to question their current role in the process.As a preliminary matter, requiring a habeas petition in federal court creates nearly insurmountable hurdles for the detained immigrant. An unrepresented detainee unfamiliar with the American legal system and who may not speak the language is poorly situated to navigate the complicated procedures of a habeas petition. Reid, 819 F.3d at 498 ("federal habeas litigation itself is both complicated and time-consuming, especially for aliens who may not be represented by counsel"); Lora, 804 F.3d at 615 ("Adopting a six-month rule . . . avoids the random outcomes resulting from individual habeas litigation in which some detainees are represented by counsel and some are not, and some habeas petitions are adjudicated in months and others are not adjudicated for years."); Sopo, 825 F.3d at 1226 (Pryor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[C]larity and predictability is particularly critical in the immigration context, where detainees frequently lack knowledge of the American court system; the resources, financial and otherwise, to obtain an attorney; and the language skills required to navigate the legal thicket.") (internal quotations omitted).27Detained immigrants also lack meaningful access to legal assistance while confined. Based on its members' experience in this context, the ABA has observed that special efforts are required for immigrants even to "be able to meet with current or prospective legal representatives and other legal personnel." Detention Standards, § VII.A(1). From 2007 through 2012, in approximately 1.2 million removal cases, only 14% of detained immigrants were represented by counsel, compared to 66% of nondetained immigrants. Ingrid V. Eagly & Steven Shafer, 164 U. Pa. L. Rev. at 32; see also EOIR Yearbook 2015, at E3 ("Many individuals who appear before EOIR are indigent and cannot afford a private attorney."). Under the Government's approach, the vast numbers of immigrants who do not or cannot file habeas petitions because of the real and daunting challenges facing detained immigrants--whether in the form of language barriers, literacy barriers, lack of access to legal resources, or otherwise--will be denied their due process rights altogether.The Government's approach also necessarily increases and compounds the period of prolonged detention among those already held beyond a reasonable period. Justiciability requirements can prevent immigrants from even starting the lengthy habeas process until after their detention has already become unreasonably prolonged, and may foreclose any relief entirely if the immigrant files too early. Reid, 819 F.3d at 498 ("[F]ederal courts are faced with a `moving target' in such cases because petitioners presumably cannot challenge their detention until it becomes unreasonable, but, even if the petitioner prematurely lodges a challenge, the detention may become unreasonable during the pendency of the claim.") (citing28Diop v. ICE/Homeland Sec., 656 F.3d 221, 227 (3d Cir. 2011)). Thus, a petition may not properly be initiated until after the detention has exceeded reasonable limits, and, even if successful, merely initiates the administrative procedure for review of the reasonableness of detention that the Government should have provided long before.Once filed, a federal court's case-by-case analysis of the overly complex reasonableness factors drains significant time and resources, translating into further prolonged detention. Experience operating under habeasbased regimes shows that such cases are lengthy, and add significantly to already unreasonably prolonged detentions. See, e.g., Khalafala v. Kane, 836 F. Supp. 2d 944, 947 (D. Ariz. 2011) (showing approximately two years and ten months from filing of habeas petition to district court decision adopting magistrate judge's recommendation); Casas-Castrillon v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 535 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 2008) (two years from filing to district court's decision); see also Amicus Brief of Americans for Immigrant Justice, et al., in Support of Respondents, Argument, § III.B (detailing how, after this Court's decision in Demore, the mean decision time for a prolonged detention habeas case was nearly 19 months in the Eleventh Circuit, over seven and a half months in the First Circuit, and almost 14 months in the Sixth Circuit). Moreover, the prevalence of judicial emergencies in federal courts presiding over immigration detention centers confirms that immigrant habeas petitions are not being timely heard. Compare Detention Facility Locator, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, https://www. ice.gov/detention-facilities with Judicial Emergencies, United States Courts (showing correlation of judicial emergencies with concentrations of immigration detention29centers, including the Eastern District of Texas, which contains two detention centers and faces three judicial vacancies and 1,261 weighted filings per judgeship per year).Indeed, the Sixth Circuit has raised "a question of institutional competence" in a system requiring that "federal courts undertake to supervise the reasonability of detention only via the habeas process." See Ly, 351 F.3d at 272. The court observed that immigration officials are "best situated to know which criminal aliens should be released, and federal courts are obviously less well situated to know how much time is required to bring a removal proceeding to conclusion." Id.The unworkable habeas regime's inherent impediments to a timely bond hearing regarding flight risk and danger are incompatible with due process demands. The ABA has devoted decades to helping the courts provide "a fair and efficient immigration removal and detention system." Detention Standards, § II.E. Having studied the practical experience of courts and litigants, the ABA has overwhelmingly endorsed an administrative approach to safeguarding against unreasonable detention. To that end, the ABA has adopted standards--more strict than the Ninth Circuit's--calling for the Government to (i) initially assess whether an immigrant "should be released, placed in an alternative-to-detention (ATD) program or detained" (Detention Standards, § III.A(1).2); (ii) perform this initial assessment "no more than four weeks after a resident has entered a facility" (id. at § III.D); and (iii) "regularly review its placement and classification decisions to ensure that residents are . . . [d]etained for the minimum time necessary . . . and . . . [r]eleased if detention is no longer appropriate" (id.).30A requirement that immigration judges determine at a bond hearing held at a fixed point in time whether an immigrant is dangerous or presents a flight risk is an effective and efficient means of vindicating immigrants' due process rights. A periodic bond hearing requirement ensures that habeas fulfills its traditional role as a failsafe--rather than the initial means--to prevent unlawful detention.10The ABA in short concludes that the remedy proposed by the Court of Appeals falls within an appropriate range of remedies to address the constitutional problems posed by excessive detention of the immigrants in this case. In contrast, the Government's own figures confirm that it has systematically failed over decades to ensure timely review of the basis for immigrants' detention, notwithstanding the theoretical availability of habeas corpus. Accordingly, the ABA--whose members have wrestled with immigrant detention issues for decades--has concluded that an administrative bond proceeding conducted within some fixed time period to assess danger and flight risk is necessary to ensure fidelity to due process principles.10. See Boumediene, 553 U.S. at 732, 777 (citing instances in which Congress provided habeas substitutes but still "preserve[d] habeas review as an avenue of last resort"); Martin-Trigona v. Shiff, 702 F.2d 380, 388 (2d Cir. 1983) (recognizing "[a] habeas corpus petition is the avenue of last resort, always available to safeguard the fundamental rights of persons wrongly incarcerated").31 CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, amicus ABA urges the Court to affirm the decision below.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: Jeffrey L.

THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT STANDARD APPLICABLE WHEN A CAPITAL PRISONER RAISES A CLAIM OF INCOMPETENCY TO BE EXECUTED IS IN URGENT NEED OF CLARIFICATION.In Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930 (2007), the Court clarified that the execution of a person must have retributive value and that the Eighth Amendment is not satisfied by a test that asks merely whether a capital prisoner is aware that he7 faces the death penalty and recognizes that the penalty is connected to his crime. This retributive value is not served "if the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole." Id. at 958-59. "A prisoner's awareness of the State's rationale for an execution is not the same as a rational understanding of it." Id. at 959.Since Panetti, however, several state courts-- including the Florida Supreme Court in Petitioner's case--have concluded that Panetti made no change in their governing legal standards. These courts continue to limit their examination to whether a prisoner who raises a claim of incompetency to be executed is aware of his sentence, and fail to ask whether the prisoner appreciates its import. Other courts have conflated the Panetti test with their own statutory "awareness" tests. Finally, as the Eleventh Circuit's decision in this case demonstrates, the federal courts are in urgent need of guidance as to the proper scope of the constitutional standard they must apply.The ABA urges this Court to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari in order to clarify the Eighth Amendment standard that is to be applied.A. Under Panetti, An Execution Must Have Retributive Value.In Panetti, this Court revisited the issue of competence for execution under the Eighth8 Amendment that it had addressed decades earlier in Ford v. Wainright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986). Acknowledging that the Ford plurality and concurring opinions "did not set forth a precise standard for competency," the Panetti Court recognized that "the majority did reach the express conclusion that the Constitution places a substantive restriction on the State's power to take the life of an insane prisoner.'" Id. at 957, quoting Ford, 477 U.S. at 405. The Panetti Court concluded, "'[T]oday, no less than before, we may seriously question the retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out and stripped of his fundamental right to life.'" Id., quoting Ford at 405.In Panetti, the Court considered whether, under the Eighth Amendment, a prisoner is competent to be executed if he is aware that the state intends to execute him for his crimes, but "suffers from a severe, documented mental illness that is the source of gross delusions [that] prevents him from comprehending the meaning and purpose of the punishment to which he has been sentenced." Id., 551 U.S. at 960. The Court found no support in Ford "for the proposition that a prisoner is automatically foreclosed from demonstrating incompetency once a court has found he can identify the stated reason for his execution." Id. at 959. Indeed, "[a] prisoner's awareness of the State's rationale for an execution is not the same as a rational understanding of it." Id. Thus, it is "error to derive from Ford, and the substantive standard for incompetency its opinions broadly identify, a strict test for competency that treats delusional beliefs as irrelevant once the prisoner is aware the State has9 identified the link between his crime and the punishment to be inflicted." Id. at 960.Considering the retributive purpose of capital punishment, the Panetti Court stated:[I]t might be said that capital punishment is imposed because it has the potential to make the offender recognize at least the gravity of his crime and to allow the community as a whole, including the surviving family and friends of the victim, to affirm its own judgment that the culpability of the prisoner is so serious that the ultimate penalty must be sought and imposed. The potential for a prisoner's recognition of the severity of the offense and the objective of community vindication are called in question, however, if the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole.551 U.S. at 958-959.While the Panetti Court did "not attempt to set down a rule governing all competency determinations," id. at 960-61, it made clear that courts must ascertain whether a capital prisoner is mentally capable of understanding his sentence in a10 meaningful way if the retributive goal of punishment is to be served.B. The Lower Courts Need Guidance as to the Mental Competency Standard Set Forth in Panetti.Since Panetti, lower courts have reached varying results, reflecting the difficulty some of these courts have had in determining the proper standard to be applied. The Eleventh Circuit, for example, acknowledged in this case that, under Panetti, "a convicted murderer cannot be executed unless he has a rational understanding of the fact that he is going to be put to death and of the reason for his execution." Ferguson v. Sec'y Florida Dep't of Corr., 716 F.3d 1315, 1318 (11th Cir. 2013). The Eleventh Circuit went on to state, however, that "the [United States Supreme] Court did not decide what rational understanding means [but] preferred to leave `a question of this complexity' to be addressed in a fuller manner and on a better record by the district court and the court of appeals in that case." Id. The Eleventh Circuit then opined, "The decision not to decide more is, unfortunately, the last word from the [United States] Supreme Court on the `question of this complexity,' one variation of which is presented by the facts in our case." Id.The Eleventh Circuit then upheld the Florida Supreme Court's determination that Petitioner is competent to be executed, stating that the Florida Supreme Court "correctly found that Panetti did not materially alter the competency standard that it had announced in Provenzano [v. State, 760 So.2d 13711 (Fla. 2000)], which itself adopted the formulation endorsed by Justice Powell in Ford." Ferguson, 716 F.3d at 1335. The Eleventh Circuit thus concluded that "Panetti did not abrogate or otherwise reject the awareness standard articulated by Justice Powell, nor did it impose a new, more rigorous standard for assessing competency to be executed," but rather, that Panetti rejected "an overly narrow interpretation of Ford that deems a prisoner's mental illness and delusional beliefs irrelevant to whether he can understand the fact of his impending execution and the reason for it." Id. 8In contrast, the Supreme Court of Tennessee ruled that Panetti requires that courts consider more than mere awareness: "[T]he test for competence to be executed requires a prisoner to have a rational understanding of his conviction, his impending execution, and the relationship between the two." State v. Irick, 320 S.W.3d 284, 295 (Tenn. 2010). The Tennessee Court explicitly overruled previous opinions that were inconsistent with Panetti. Id. The Court then properly applied the Panetti test to a prisoner who claimed he was innocent, but who8 The Provenzano court, however, concluded that the "Eighth Amendment only requires that defendants be aware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it." 760 So.2d at 140, citing Ford, 477 U.S. at 422 (Powell, J., concurring). On this basis, the Provenzano court concluded that the prisoner was competent even though the trial judge had found by clear and convincing evidence that he harbored a delusional belief that he was being executed because he was Jesus Christ. Provenzano, 760 So. 2d at 140 (Anstead, J., dissenting).12 understood the nature of the crime for which he had been convicted and the reason for the sentence attaching to the crime. Id. at 295-97.The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania also established a more fulsome test based on Panetti. In Commonwealth v. Banks, 29 A.3d 1129 (Pa. 2011), the Pennsylvania Court ruled that, "it is clear that the Eighth Amendment requires a petitioner not only to have a factual understanding of the penalty and the reasons for it, but also a rational understanding of it." Id. at 1144-45. Applying this test where a prisoner "had fixed delusions regarding police involvement in the original murders as well as delusions related to a supposed Department of Corrections conspiracy against him" and "believed that he was `supposed to be exempt' from the sentence of death or that someone or some higher being had `vacated' his sentence of death," the Pennsylvania Court determined that the prisoner had some understanding of his crimes and the penalty he faced but was not competent to be executed because he did not understand the rational connection between them. Id.On the other hand, at least three other state courts--Texas, Ohio, and Indiana--have, like Florida, acknowledged the Panetti test, but concluded that it left prior law undisturbed. As a result, these courts have applied a variety of the factual awareness standard that is unduly limited under Panetti.The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, for example, ruled that Panetti "merely reiterated the13 established requirements of Ford" and concluded that the Texas statute codifying Ford remained unchanged post-Panetti. See Green v. State, 374 S.W.3d 434, 443 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). Under current Texas law, therefore, an inmate is competent for execution if the inmate understands "(1) that he or she is to be executed and that the execution is imminent; and (2) the reason he or she is being executed." Id. at 442.9The Court of Appeals of Ohio similarly recognized that this Court "expressly rejected that Ford stands for the proposition that a prisoner's delusional belief system is irrelevant" and held "that the inquiry into whether a capital defendant is insane is whether the prisoner is able to understand the reasons for his punishment or whether he is unaware of why he is to suffer it." State v. Brooks, Nos. 97455, 97509, 2011 WL 5517300, at *3 (Ohio Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2011) (citing Panetti, 551 U.S. at 958-59). The Ohio court nevertheless applied a state law standard defining "the term `insane' ... to mean `that the convict in question does not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of the death penalty and why it was imposed upon the convict.'" Brooks, 2011 WL9 Arizona, Georgia, and Kentucky also have competency statutes defining mental competence in terms of awareness, while Alabama retains a statute that predates Ford. ARIZ. REV. STAT. ANN. § 13-4021(B) (2013); GA. CODE ANN. § 17-10-60 (2012); KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 431.2135 (West 2011); ALA. CODE § 15-16-23 (2013). It appears the courts of these states have not applied these statutes post-Panetti in cases involving claims of mental incompetency to be executed.14 5517300, at *4. Using this standard, the court found the prisoner competent for execution despite evidence that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and delusions. Id. at *5.Finally, the Supreme Court of Indiana acknowledged the Panetti test, but failed to apply it. The Indiana court first stated that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed if "(1) he or she suffers from a severe, documented mental illness; (2) the mental illness is the source of gross delusions; and (3) those gross delusions prevent[] the prisoner from comprehending the meaning and purpose of the punishment." Overstreet v. State, 87 7 N.E.2d 144, 172 (Ind. 2007). Although the prisoner met the first two criteria because he suffered from gross delusions resulting from a severe mental illness, and believed that demons and devils were responsible for the murder, the Indiana court nevertheless found that he was competent to be executed because "there is no evidence that indicates he questions the reality of the crime occurring or the reality of his punishment by the State for the crime committed." Id. at 173-74.Although each of these state courts recognized that Panetti was to be applied, and although Tennessee and Pennsylvania appear to have then properly applied Panetti's rational understanding test, the four other courts ultimately applied Ford's factual awareness standard and failed to recognize that Panetti requires a prisoner to comprehend the retributive nature of his sentence. And without further clarification from this Court, federal courts ­ like the Eleventh Circuit here ­ may defer to state15 court decisions that, in rejecting competency claims, have failed to properly consider Panetti.10If, as this Court has stated, the primary purpose of requiring prisoners to be competent to be executed is to ensure the retributive aim of punishment, then the ABA urges that offenders "not only must be `aware' of the nature and purpose of punishment but also must `appreciate' its personal application in the offender's own case."11 That is, "[h]olding a person accountable is intended to be an affirmation of personal responsibility. Executing someone who lacks a meaningful understanding of the nature of this awesome punishment and its retributive purpose10 Legal scholars have likewise observed that Panetti left the lower courts with insufficient guidance. See, e.g., Jacob M. Appel, Capital Punishment, Psychiatrists and the Potential "Bottleneck" of Competence, 24 J.L. & Health 45, 69 (2010) (Panetti left the lower courts with less guidance on what constitutes competence for execution); Lauren E. Perry, Hiding Behind Precedent: Why Panetti v. Quarterman Will Create Confusion for Incompetent Death Row Inmates, 86 N.C. L. Rev. 1068, 1069 (2008) (explaining that the Panetti standard "will likely create confusion and variance in application"); Chris Koepke, Panetti v. Quarterman: Exploring the Unsettled and Unsettling, 45 Hous. L. Rev. 1383, 1404 (2008) (noting that "Panetti leaves a tremendous number of issues for lower courts to resolve"); Robert A. Stark, There May or May Not Be Blood: Why the Eighth Amendment Prohibition Against Executing the Insane Requires a Definitive Standard, 41 Creighton L. Rev. 763, 786-89 (2008) (Panetti's lack of a clear standard would lead to arbitrary application of the death penalty)11 Brief Amicus Curiae of the American Bar Association in Support of the Petitioner in Panetti v. Quarterman, February 21, 2007, at 6, 2007 WL 579237, citing ABA Policy #122A, Report at 16.16 offends the concept of personal responsibility rather than affirming it."12 Thus, when "a death row inmate attributes his pending execution to reasons that only someone suffering from a significant mental disability could espouse--such as a delusion that he is to be executed because of his faith in God--he cannot be said to have the capacity to accept responsibility for his crimes."13The ABA believes that this formulation is consistent with Panetti. The state and federal courts, however, have been unable to apply Panetti in a uniform manner. The Court should grant the petition and clarify the standard courts must apply in determining whether a capital prisoner is competent to be executed.12 Id. at 6-7. 13 Id. at 8.17CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the ABA respectfully urges that the petition for a writ of certiorari be granted.Of Counsel: L.

I. The Avena Judgment is binding as to the rights of the 51 named defendants and Mexico.By ratifying the Vienna Convention, the United States committed itself to the consular notification and access provisions of Article 36. That commitment is binding federal law which, under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, takes precedence over any contrary state law. U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2 ("all Treaties made . . . under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and judges in every State shall be bound thereby."); United States v. Belmont, 301 U.S. 324, 331 (1937).99 The United States Department of State, realizing the importance of ensuring reciprocal compliance by other nations, recently confirmed the Executive Branch's commitment to securing the rights created by Article 36. See United States Department of State Announcement: All Consular Notification Requirements(Cont'd)8The United States also committed, by ratifying the accompanying Optional Protocol, to submit Vienna Convention disputes to ICJ jurisdiction and to comply with the ICJ's judgment in those cases. See Optional Protocol, art. I (providing that disputes "arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice."). That obligation is reinforced by the U.N. Charter, which requires U.N. Members to abide by any decision duly entered by the ICJ to which they are parties. U.N. Charter Article 94(1), 59 Stat. 1031, T.S. 993 ("Each Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the [ICJ] in any case to which it is a party."). Thus, throughout the period when the United States was a party to the Optional Protocol, disputes over interpretation of the Vienna Convention were subject to the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction, and enforceable pursuant to federal law in cases where the United States was a party. While decisions of the ICJ have a more narrow precedential effect than those of domestic courts, an ICJ judgment is binding with regard to the specific parties that are the subject of the judgment. Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S. Ct. 2669, 2684 (2006) (ICJ Judgments' binding force applies to "the parties and in respect of that particular case") (quoting Statute of the International Court of Justice, Art. 59, 59 Stat. 1062, T.S. No. 993 (1945)).Because Mr. Medellin is one of the Mexican nationals whose rights were determined by the Avena Judgment, that judgment binds courts in the United States adjudicating the lawfulness of Mr. Medellin's detention. That legal obligation is not affected by the later decision of the United States to(Cont'd) Remain in Effect, available at http://travel.state.gov/news/ news_2155.html ("The U.S. is fully committed to compliance with our international legal obligations under the [Vienna Convention], and actively works to improve compliance nationally.").9withdraw from the Optional Protocol, which has prospective effect only. Thus, any state procedural bar or other state law rule that would prevent consideration of Mr. Medellin's consular notification claims would necessarily conflict with the federal law unless such an exception is permitted by the Vienna Convention itself. No such exception exists here.On the contrary, the ICJ specifically held that the Vienna Convention forbids application of domestic procedural default rules to preclude review or relief for Vienna Convention violations. Avena Judgment ¶ 113 (holding application of procedural default rule would prevent "`full effect [from being] given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this article are intended', and thus violate[s] paragraph 2 of Article 36.").The Avena Judgment, as applied to Mr. Medellin, thus prohibits Texas's procedural rules from acting as a bar to review of Mr. Medellin's claim that the violation of the Vienna Convention rendered his conviction invalid. See id. ¶ 139 (stressing the importance to the "review and reconsideration process [of] the existence of a procedure which guarantees that full weight is given to the violation of the rights set forth in the Vienna Convention"). Indeed, to allow Texas to deprive Mr. Medellin of his right to present that claim would violate supremacy principles and effectively permit a state court to defy a federally recognized judgment.1010 Roughly 70 U.S. treaties now in force contain obligations comparable to those in the Optional Protocol for submission of treatybased disputes to the ICJ. See Fred L. Morrison, Treaties as a Source of Jurisdiction, Especially in U.S. Practice, in THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE AT A CROSSROADS 58­81 (Lori F. Damrosch ed., 1987). The United States has been involved in more ICJ cases than any other state. See ICJ, Contentious Cases Ordered by Country Involved, available at http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/ index.php?p1=3&p2=3&p3=1. Texas's failure to carry out the Avena(Cont'd)10The supremacy of treaty law over state law requires that treaty obligations be given their natural effect and not be narrowly construed in deference to states. See Nielsen v. Johnson, 279 U.S. 47, 52 (1929) ("[T]he meaning of treaty provisions . . . is not restricted by any necessity of avoiding possible conflict with state legislation. . . ."). As such, this Court has expressly disclaimed attempts to adopt a canon of avoidance when interpreting treaties in potential conflict with state law, because doing so would permit individual states effectively to shape and modify interpretation of binding federal treaty obligations. Id.Portending this Court's long history of acting to prevent or remedy treaty violations by the states, in an early case in American history, Ware v. Hylton, the Court struck down a state statute rather than a U.S. treaty. 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199, 237 (1796) ("If a law of a State, contrary to a treaty, is not void, but voidable only, by a repeal or nullification by a State legislature, this certain consequence follows, that the will of a small part of the United States may control or defeat the will of the whole."); see also Neilsen v. Johnson, 279 U.S. 47 (1929); Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U.S. 483 (1879); Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (Wheat.) 304 (1816). Likewise, states cannot withdraw from treaties, nor are they free to abrogate United States's obligations. Indeed, it was the failure of states to observe the treaties made by the Continental Congress that was one of the practices that lead to the calling of the Constitutional Convention. See THOMAS ANDREW BAILEY, A DIPLOMATIC HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ch. V (8th ed. 1968); see also The Federalist No. 15 at 106 (Hamilton) (Benjamin Fletcher Wright ed., 1961); No. 22 at 144­55 (Hamilton); No. 42 at 265 (Madison).(Cont'd) Judgment with respect to the 51 named Mexican nationals could prejudice the ability of the United States to hold other states to their dispute settlement obligations.11The United States Government has determined that, in light of the nation's foreign policy interests, "there is a pressing need for expeditious compliance with [the Avena] decision." Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Respondent at 42, Medellin v. Dretke, 544 U.S. 660 (2005) (No. 04-5928). The President has characterized the Avena Judgment as an "international obligation" to be discharged "by having State courts give effect to the decision in accordance with general principles of comity in cases filed by the 51 Mexican nationals addressed in the decision." President George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005). Accordingly, the decision of the Texas courts to disregard the binding nature of the Avena Judgment, and to interpose domestic procedural rules inconsistent with that judgment, is a violation of the Supremacy Clause and an improper intrusion on the federal government's exclusive treaty-making and implementation authority. See United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 233 (1942) ("Power over external affairs is not shared by the States; it is vested with the national government exclusively.").II. The goal of the procedural default doctrine is to reduce the burdens that habeas proceedings place on state and federal courts is not applicable in the context of the federal government's plenary power over foreign relations.A. The federal government's exclusive power regarding foreign relations requires that United States courts consistently enforce federal treaties regardless of contrary state procedural rules.In matters of international relations, federal interests are both paramount and exclusive of state interests. See, e.g., American Ins. Ass'n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 413 (2003) ("concern for uniformity in this country's dealings with foreign nations .. . animated the Constitution's allocation12of the foreign relations power to the National Government") (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast, the procedural default doctrine is a jurisprudential rule crafted to protect the integrity of trial court proceedings.11 A principal goal of the doctrine is to reduce the burdens habeas cases place on state and federal courts.12 Because of the need for the United States to assure treaty partners that its treaty obligations will be uniformly enforced, conflicting procedural default rules must yield to this paramount federal interest.The Constitution entrusts the federal government with "full and exclusive responsibility for the conduct of affairs with foreign sovereignties." Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 63 (1941). As this Court has emphasized, "[o]ur system of government is such that the interest of the cities, counties and states, no less than the interest of the people of the whole nation, imperatively requires that federal power in the field affecting foreign relations be left entirely free from local interference." Id.; see also Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill. v. United States, 289 U.S. 48, 59 (1933) ("In international11 See Dretke v. Haley, 541 U.S. 386, 394 (2004) (referring to the exceptions to the procedural default doctrine as "judge-made rules"); Patrick E. Higginbotham, Reflections on Reform of § 2254 Habeas Petitions, 18 HOFSTRA L. REV. 1005, 1014 (1990) ( "[R]espect for state procedural default rules is a judge-made doctrine, not directly drawn from any express statutory provision.").12 See Murray v . Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 487-88 (1986) (refining the procedural default doctrine with the explicit goal of minimizing the burden on federal habeas courts). Federal-state comity also motivated the federal procedural default doctrine. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90-91 (1977); Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 11 (1984) (explaining that considerations of comity and concerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice motivate the procedural default doctrine); Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 730-32 (1991) (explaining that "concerns of comity and federalism" underlie procedural default rules).13relations and with respect to foreign intercourse and trade the people of the United States act through a single government with unified and adequate national power."); The Federalist No. 80, at 500 (Alexander Hamilton) (Benjamin Fletcher Wright ed., 1961) ("[T]he peace of the whole ought not to be left at the disposal of a part").It is precisely because of the importance of ensuring that the entire country speak with one voice in international relations and that the United States be able to fulfill its international obligations, that the Constitution explicitly makes treaties "the supreme Law of the Land," overriding "any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary." 13 U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2. "It is the declared duty" of both state and federal judges, under the Supremacy Clause, "to determine any Constitution, or laws of any State, contrary to [a] treaty .. . made under the authority of the United States, null and void." Ware v. Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199, 237 (1796); see also Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U.S. 483, 489 (1879) ("It is the declared will of the people of the United States that every treaty made by the authority of the United States shall be superior to the Constitution and laws of any individual State.").When a state arrests or prosecutes a citizen of a country that is a signatory to the Vienna Convention and fails to comply with the Convention's requirements, that failure violates not only the defendant's rights, but also the rights of the defendant's home country. See, e.g., LaGrand ¶ 74 ("[W]hen the sending State is unaware of the detention of its nationals due to the failure of the receiving State to provide13 The United States signed the Vienna Convention and its Optional Protocol on April 24, 1963, and the Senate unanimously ratified both instruments on October 22, 1969. See 115 CONG . REC. 30,997 (Oct. 22, 1969). Accordingly, the Vienna Convention has the force of a treaty under the Constitution.14the requisite consular notification without delay, . . . the sending State has been prevented for all practical purposes from exercising its rights under Article 36"); Avena Judgment ¶ 102 (describing the United States as precluding Mexico "from exercising its right" under one provision of the Convention). Those rights include the rights "to visit a national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation." Vienna Convention, art. 36 ¶ 1(c).Permitting Texas to preempt enforcement of the United States's commitment to implement the Avena Judgment would allow an individual state--through use of its own procedural bar--to impair the exclusive federal power to conduct relations with foreign sovereigns. When this is permitted, it is the federal government, not the State, that must contend with the resulting tension which, as this very case demonstrates, can substantially undermine the oftendelicate relations between nations.The impact on international relations distinguishes cases involving the Avena Judgment from other federal rights in which a state's interest in its procedural default rules is entitled to deference. Generally, if an American defendant violates a state procedural rule in attempting to assert an individual federal right, only that individual's rights are affected. In such situations, this Court has determined that broader policy concerns dictate that, absent cause and prejudice, the individual may forfeit that federal right. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90-91 (1977).15This balancing of interests is not applicable, however, when the right at issue belongs not just to the defendant, but also to his home country, through federally established treaty obligations. It would violate the federal government's exclusive power to conduct international relations to apply a conflicting balancing test that permits, and would effectively impose on another sovereign nation, obligations that are contrary to its treaty rights. Accordingly, this Court should give effect to the Avena Judgment's holding that, as to the 51 named individuals, Mexico's right to adjudication of certain issues may not be affected by domestic procedural rules.B. Giving effect to the Avena Judgment would not create a significant burden for state or federal courts.Giving effect to the Avena Judgment would not open the floodgates to state or federal habeas claimants. Avena Judgment claims would be limited to those individuals affected by the judgment and such claims would be litigated first in state court. Litigation in state court would reduce the need for federal courts to evaluate the claims in the first instance, without the benefit of state court consideration. Cf. Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 89-90 (explaining that if state appellate courts know that federal issues "raised for the first time in the proceeding before them may well be decided in any event by a federal habeas tribunal[,]" they will have to choose "between addressing the issue notwithstanding the petitioner's failure to timely object, [and] fac[ing] the prospect that the federal habeas court will decide the question without the benefit of their views"). Any impact on state and federal courts' workload created by giving effect to the Avena Judgment would be de minimis and would have no long term effect on the state judicial systems.16III. There are no structural barriers to implementing the Avena Judgment.In Medellin v. Dretke, 544 U.S. 660 (2005), this Court noted several potential problems with reconciling the ruling of the ICJ in the Avena Judgment with the procedural requirements in federal habeas proceedings. For example, the Court cited the likely difficulty in showing that a violation of consular access provisions was more than a "nonconstitutional lapse[] [the Court had] held not to be cognizable in a [federal] postconviction proceeding." Id. at 664 (quoting Reed v. Farley, 512 U.S. 339, 340 (1994)). The Court also noted that the non-constitutional nature of the treaty violation could impede the grant of a certificate of appealability, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c). Id.The structural source of these difficulties is the "full parity" between treaties and federal statutes. Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 18 (1957) (plurality opinion). These types of treaties and federal laws have the same status under Art. VI of the Constitution--they are the "supreme Law of the Land." Reconciling countervailing commands from coequal sources of law can give rise to problems of interpretation that may ultimately alter the scope of treaty obligations, but that interpretation remains firmly in the province of the federal government. It is an entirely different situation when a treaty and state law contain conflicting commands; in that instance, the treaty trumps state law. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 212 (1962) ("Though a court will not undertake to construe a treaty in a manner inconsistent with a subsequent federal statute, no similar hesitancy obtains if the asserted clash is with state law.").Moreover, the Constitution imposes an independent obligation on states to enforce federal law in their own courts17absent an express exemption from Congress. See Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 469-70 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring) ("`[t]he laws of the United States are laws in the several States, and just as much binding on the citizens and courts thereof as the State laws are. . . . The two together form one system of jurisprudence, which constitutes the law of the land for the State. . . .'") (quoting Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U.S. 130, 136-37 (1876)). Accordingly, a State must recognize and implement treaties even if they are inconsistent with its laws. United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 230-31 (1942) ("[S]tate law must yield when it is inconsistent with, or impairs . . . the superior Federal policy evidenced by a treaty or international compact or agreement.").In sum, because the Vienna Convention is a treaty to which the U.S. remains a party, and the United States was a party to Optional Protocol when the Avena Judgment was handed down, the several states and their courts are bound to honor that decision. Thus, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals should not be permitted to alter the scope of the United States's treaty obligations by invoking its state procedural bar to dispose of Mr. Medellin's Article 36 claims in a manner inconsistent with the Avena Judgment.IV. Giving effect to the Avena Judgment promotes the international rule of law.As this Court has observed: "One of the most important and delicate of all international relationships, recognized immemorially as a responsibility of government, has to do with the protection of the just rights of a country's own18nationals when those nationals are in another country." Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 64 (1941). The Vienna Convention is designed to enable countries to help their own nationals when those nationals are abroad, in part by agreeing to allow other countries to take similar steps where their citizens are concerned.The United States used the dispute resolution mechanism provided by the Optional Protocol to enforce the protections specified in the Vienna Convention to protect its own citizens when it brought an application against Iran concerning U.S. diplomatic and consular personnel who were held hostage in 1979. Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (U.S. v. Iran), 1979 I.C.J. 7 (Dec. 15), 1980 I.C.J. 3 (May 24). In bringing that application, the United States relied on the Optional Protocol's establishment of the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Vienna Convention. When the ICJ ruled in favor of the United States provisionally in 1979 and then finally in 1980, 1979 I.C.J. 7, 1980 I.C.J. 3, the United States insisted that Iran was bound to comply with the court's judgment. U.S. Urges the Iranians to Obey Court Decision, N.Y. Times, May 25, 1980, at 9 ("The State Department said today that the decision by the International Court of Justice ordering Iran to release the American hostages and pay compensation to the United States was binding on Iran, and it called on the Tehran Government to carry out its provisions.").Allowing state courts to refuse to abide by an ICJ judgment that was rendered while the United States was a party to the Optional Protocol would compromise important structural protections established by the Constitution to ensure that the federal government alone controls when the United States will consent to treaties and other international agreements. The President's signature on the Optional19Protocol, the Senate's ratification of that treaty, and the United States's submission to proceedings before the ICJ through to judgment, all reflect decisions committed exclusively to the federal government in the conduct of foreign affairs, superior to any state law. But they also reflect a fundamental commitment to the rule of law. Although President George W. Bush has now withdrawn the United States from the Optional Protocol, the President himself has expressed the importance of honoring this federal commitment, and his expectation that the courts of the United States would comply with the Avena Judgment in this case. See Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Respondent at 41-42, Medellin v. Dretke, 544 U.S. 660 (2005) (No. 04-5928). This commitment to honor treaty obligations, even when they are potentially inconvenient or contrary to individual state interests, reflects the essence of the rule of law.20CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above, and consistent with its commitment to promoting the rule of law, the ABA respectively submits that the Court should reverse the decision of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:JEFFREY L. BLEICH MICHELLE T. FRIEDLAND ADAM B. BADAWIKAREN J. MATHIS* President American Bar Association 321 N. Clark Street Chicago, IL 60610 (312) 988-5000* Counsel of Record
THE ABA REQUESTS THAT THE COURT CONTINUE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PROSECUTORS' BRADY OBLIGATIONS AND THEIR BROADER ETHICAL PRE-TRIAL DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONSIn the present case, Petitioner contends that his conviction should be overturned because the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence at trial, in violation of Brady.11 While Petitioner's Brady claims must be determined under the constitutional materiality standards established by this Court, the ABA requests that the Court again make clear that a prosecutor's pre-trial ethical disclosure obligations are established by the attorney regulatory codes of the prosecutor's state or jurisdiction, and are separate from and broader than the constitutional standards that control a court's post-trial determination of Brady claims.A. Prosecutors Are Bound by the Ethics Rules Established in the Attorney Regulatory Codes of their States and Jurisdictions.While the post-trial constitutional determination of Brady claims must consider the materiality of a nondisclosure, this Court has noted on several occasions that the prosecutor's ethical obligations are broader11 In this amicus brief, the ABA does not address the merits of Petitioner's assertions of substantial Brady violations. This should not be seen as an endorsement of Respondent's arguments. Rather, it is solely because the ABA has limited this brief, as a "friend of the court" brief, to consideration of ethics rules and standards applicable to prosecutors.7than those set out in Brady and that the "prudent prosecutor will err on the side of transparency, resolving doubtful questions in favor of disclosure." Cone, 129 S. Ct. at 1783 n.15; see also United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 108 (1976) (there is a "significant practical difference between the pretrial decision of the prosecutor and the post-trial decision of the judge").A prosecutor's pre-trial ethical obligations to disclose exculpatory and mitigating evidence are established by the attorney disciplinary rules of the state or jurisdiction in which the prosecutor practices. Most of these rules are patterned on Rule 3.8(d) of the ABA Model Rules,12 which provides that "[t]he prosecutor in a criminal case shall":(d) make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal[.]Model Rule 3.8(d) reflects the legal community's long-standing consensus, first expressed in the ABA's 1908 CANONS OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS ("ABA 1908 Canons"), that it would be "highly reprehensible" to allow prosecutors to withhold evidence that might establish a defendant's innocence.13 Model Rule12 See Appendix B.13 ABA 1908 Canons, Canon 5 ("The primary duty of a lawyer engaged in public prosecution is not to convict, but to see that justice is done. The suppression of facts or secreting of83.8(d)'s widespread acceptance is reflected in the fact that 49 states, as well as the District of Columbia, the United States Virgin Islands, and Guam have adopted ethics rules that include a provision identical or substantially similar to it.14Louisiana, where Petitioner was convicted, was one of the first states to adopt the ABA 1908 Canons, and was "at the forefront of the wave of adoptions" of the ABA's 1969 CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY. Dane S. Ciolino, Lawyer Ethics Reform in Perspective: A Look at the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct Before and After Ethics 2000, 65 LA. L. REV. 535, 539-41 (2005). In 1987, the Louisiana Supreme Court made effective a version of the ABA Model Rules. Id. at 542. Rule 3.8(d) of the Louisiana Rules of Conduct provides in pertinent part that "[t]he prosecutor in a criminal case shall":(d) make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that the prosecutor knows, or reasonably shouldwitnesses capable of establishing the innocence of the accused is highly reprehensible").14 See Appendix B, Jurisdictional Survey. The current rule of the 50th state, California, differs from the Model Rule. However, the Board of Governors of the California Bar has adopted an almost identical version of Model Rule 3.8(d), which is pending approval of the Supreme Court of California. See The State Bar of California, Proposed Rules of Professional Conduct, Adopted by the Board of Governors on July 24, 2010 and September 22, 2010, http://ethics.calbar.ca.gov/LinkClick.aspx? fileticket=J2Mhg5NSNdk%3d&tabid=2669. In Puerto Rico, the Cánones de Ética Profesional, available at http://www.rama judicial.pr/leyes/imp-canones-etica-profesional.html, include a rule that is modeled on the 1908 Canon 5, relating to suppression of evidence capable of establishing innocence.9know, either tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense . . . .To the extent Louisiana has modified Rule 3.8(d), it has done so (like three other jurisdictions) only to impose more rigorous disclosure obligations on prosecutors.15 The Louisiana rule thus requires not only disclosure of evidence that the prosecutor "knows" to be exculpatory but also disclosure of evidence that the prosecutor "reasonably should know" is exculpatory.16 Id.15 The District of Columbia and Louisiana require prosecutors to disclose not only exculpatory evidence actually "known" to them, but also evidence that they "reasonably should know." Similarly, North Carolina and Maine require that prosecutors make a "reasonably diligent inquiry" prior to disclosure. Three jurisdictions that have rules based on ABA Model Rule 3.8(d), however, note in accompanying comments or judicial decisions that prosecutors who comply with their constitutional obligations under the Brady line of cases are not subject to discipline under the rule. See Appendix A, Formal Opinion 09-454 at 11a, n.18 (citing In re Attorney C, 47 P.3d 1167 (Colo. 2002) (en banc) (court deferred to disciplinary board finding that prosecutor did not intentionally withhold evidence); D.C. Rule Prof'l Conduct 3.8, cmt. 1 ("[Rule 3.8] is not intended either to restrict or to expand the obligations of prosecutors derived from the United States Constitution, federal or District of Columbia statutes, and court rules of procedure.")); see also Disciplinary Counsel v. Kellogg-Martin, 124 Ohio St.3d 415 (Ohio 2010).16 In In re Jordan, the Louisiana Supreme Court found, in addition to Brady violations, the same prosecutor who later handled Smith's trial had violated Louisiana Rule 3.8(d) by failing to disclose a homicide eyewitness' statement that conflicted with other statements, and thus "negate[d] her ability to positively identify the defendant in a lineup." 913 So.2d 775, 782 (La. 2005). Noting that this was its first decision involving Louisiana Rule 3.8(d), the court imposed a deferred three-month suspension from the practice of law on the condition that the10The present case involves numerous substantial allegations of non-disclosure that fit squarely within the requirements of Louisiana Rule 3.8(d) and Model Rule 3.8(d). For example, Petitioner contends that the prosecution failed to disclose pre-trial statements by its key eyewitness--who was also the only witness to identify Petitioner--that he was unable to identify any of the perpetrators. These statements would contradict his trial identification of Petitioner. The prosecution also allegedly failed to provide statements from other witnesses that the men who entered the house were all wearing masks, which would contradict the one eyewitness' testimony that he could see Petitioner's face. Compare ABA Formal Ethics Opinion 09-454 at 14a (Model Rule 3.8(d) (requires disclosure of statements from eyewitnesses who claim the defendant is not the culprit, even if the prosecutor believes the eyewitness lacked the opportunity to make an accurate identification, and even if other witnesses identify the defendant).A prosecutor's ethical duty to make disclosures such as these, however, does not depend on their materiality. Louisiana Rule 3.8(d), like Model Rule 3.8(d), does not consider the materiality of the evidence or information. ABA Formal Opinion 09454 at 11a explains:Rule 3.8(d) is more demanding than the constitutional case law, in that it requires the disclosure of evidence or information favorable to the defense without regard to the anticipated impact of the evidence or information on a trial's outcome. The rule thereby requires prosecutors toprosecutor refrain from further misconduct for the period of one year. Id. at 784.11steer clear of the constitutional line, erring on the side of caution.As ABA Formal Opinion 09-454 notes, the constitutional materiality limitation under the Brady jurisprudence also is absent from the National District Attorneys' Association's disclosure standard. Id. at n.22, quoting NATIONAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS' ASSOCIATION, NATIONAL PROSECUTION STANDARDS § 53.5 (2d ed. 1991) ("The prosecutor should disclose to the defense any material or information within his actual knowledge and within his possession which tends to negate or reduce the guilt of the defendant pertaining to the offense charged.").By requiring prosecutors to disclose more than material exculpatory evidence, the ABA Model Rules seek to avoid pitfalls that might arise if a prosecutor attempts to determine materiality before making a disclosure. As commentators have highlighted, assessing materiality pre-trial requires prosecutors to "anticipate what the other evidence against the defendant will be by the end of the trial, and then speculate in hypothetical hindsight whether the evidence at issue would place `the whole case' in a different light." Alafair S. Burke, Improving Prosecutorial Decision Making: Some Lessons of Cognitive Science, 47 WM. & MARY L. REV. 1587, 1609 (2006). In addition, "compared to a neutral decision maker, the prosecutor will overestimate the strength of the government's case against the defendant and underestimate the potential exculpatory value of the evidence whose disclosure is at issue. As a consequence, the prosecutor will fail to see materiality where it might in fact exist." Burke, id. at 1612; see also Bruce A. Green & Ellen Yaroshefsky, Prosecutorial Discretion and Post-Conviction Evidence of Innocence,126 OHIO ST. J. CRIM. L. 467, 488 (2009) ("Tunnel vision has had an obvious impact in the pretrial stage: having formed an initial judgment that a particular defendant is guilty of a crime, prosecutors and police will tend to discredit or discount the significance of new exculpatory evidence or fit it into their preexisting theory.").Indeed, some lower courts have required pre-trial disclosure of favorable evidence without a determination of materiality. For example, the federal district court in United States v. Safavian, 233 F.R.D. 12, 16 (D.D.C. 2005), asserted that "the government must always produce any potentially exculpatory or otherwise favorable evidence without regard to how the withholding of such evidence might be viewed-- with the benefit of hindsight--as affecting the outcome of the trial." See also United States v. Sudikoff, 36 F. Supp. 1196, 1199 (C.D. Cal. 1999) (Brady's post-trial "analysis obviously cannot be applied by a trial court facing a pretrial discovery request"). But see Boyd v. United States, 908 A. 2d 39, 61 (D.C. 2006) ("Materiality is an issue at the time that the prosecutor makes a determination regarding what he must disclose to the defense . . . .").In short, a prosecutor's ethical pre-trial disclosure obligations under Model Rule 3.8(d), like its state and jurisdictional counterparts, are separate from and broader than the constitutional Brady obligations. Model Rule 3.8(d) "requires disclosure of evidence and information favorable to the defense without regard to the anticipated impact of the evidence or information on the trial's outcome." Formal Opinion 09-454 at 12a (footnotes omitted).13B. The ABA Criminal Justice Standards, which Reflect the Consensus Views of Criminal Justice Practitioners, Also Promote the Goals of the Ethics Rules.The ABA Criminal Justice Standards reflect the consensus views of broadly representative task forces of criminal justice practitioners.17 These standards, like Model Rule 3.8(d) and the ethics rules patterned on it, promote the broad disclosure of all exculpatory evidence, without regard to the materiality standard set forth in Brady. For example, Standard 3-3.11(a) of the Prosecution Function Standards states:A prosecutor should not intentionally fail to make timely disclosure to the defense, at the earliest feasible opportunity, of the existence of all evidence or information which tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigate the offense charged or which would tend to reduce the punishment of the accused.As the Commentary to Standard 3-3.11 explains, "[t]his [disclosure] obligation, which is virtually identical to that imposed by ABA model ethical codes, goes beyond the corollary duty imposed upon prosecutors by constitutional law." Id. (internal footnote omitted) (citing United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97 (1976)).18 The basis for this obligation is that "a prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice17 See footnote 8, supra.18 The Commentary to Standard 3-3.11 also notes, "The National District Attorneys Association similarly requires prosecutors to `disclose the existence or nature of exculpatory evidence pertinent to the defense.'" Id., (citing NATIONAL PROSECUTION STANDARDS § 25.4); see also discussion of absence of materiality limitation in NDAA Prosecution Standard 53.5, supra.14and not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to see that the accused is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence, including consideration of exculpatory evidence known to the prosecution." Id. (internal footnotes omitted); see also Standard 3-1.2(b) (prosecutor is an "administrator of justice, an advocate, and an officer of the court"); Standard 3-1.2(c) (prosecutor's duty is to "seek justice, not merely to convict").19In addition to Standard 3-3.11's disclosure obligations, Standard 3-5.6(a) states: "A prosecutor should not knowingly offer false evidence, whether by documents, tangible evidence, or the testimony of witnesses, or fail to seek withdrawal thereof upon discovery of its falsity." As stated in the Commentary to Standard 3-5.6, the obligation to not knowingly offer or fail to seek withdrawal of false evidence "applies to evidence that bears on the credibility of a witness as well as to evidence on issues going directly to guilt." Id. (citing Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959)). This Commentary continues: "Even if false testimony is volunteered by the witness and takes the prosecutor by surprise, if the prosecutor knows it is false, it is the prosecutor's obligation to see that is it corrected."In the present case, Petitioner contends that prosecutors allowed a police investigator to testify at trial19 Reflecting these same concerns, Comment [1] to Model Rule 3.8 recognizes that the prosecutor's responsibility as a "minister of justice" carries with it "specific obligations to see that the defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence," and "that special precautions are taken to prevent . . . the conviction of innocent persons."15that an injured perpetrator was in a "vegetative state" and unable to communicate, while the investigator's undisclosed notes reflected communications by that perpetrator that indicated that Petitioner was not involved in the crimes. Not only would this implicate Standard 3-5.6(a), as well as the ethical disclosure obligations of Model Rule 3.8(d) and Standard 3-3.11, it would also be contrary to Louisiana Rule 3.3 and ABA Model Rule 3.3, which mandate counsel's candor to the tribunal.20 ABA Model Rule 3.3(a)(3) states in pertinent part that a lawyer shall not knowingly:(3) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If the lawyer, the lawyer's client, or a witness called by the lawyer has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to know its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.Finally, as stated in Prosecution Function Standard 3-1.2(e), in pertinent part, "It is the duty of the prosecutor to know and be guided by the standards of professional conduct as defined by applicable professional traditions, ethical codes, and law in the prosecutor's jurisdiction."21 This duty "to know and20 Rule 3.3 of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct is substantially identical to ABA Model Rule 3.3. See LOUISIANA RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT R. 3.3 (2011).21 The ABA notes that, because of the critical importance of a prosecutor's knowledge of both pre-trial ethical and constitutional Brady disclosure obligations, the ABA recently adopted policy that encourages trial courts to foster compliance through pretrial conferences with the parties to "ensure that they are fully aware of their respective disclosure obligations under applicable discovery rules, statutes, ethical standards and the federal and state constitutions, and to offer the court's assis-16be guided by" includes not only the constitutional Brady disclosure standards but also, in the ABA's view, the ethical pre-trial disclosure obligations of the prosecutor's state or jurisdiction.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae American Bar Association requests that the Court continue to distinguish between a prosecutor's separate and broader pre-trial ethical disclosure obligations, as established by that prosecutor's attorney regulatory codes, and a prosecutor's constitutional post-trial Brady obligations.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:WM.

I. The Teaching-Suggestion-Motivation Inquiry Is Deeply Rooted in the Law and Has Succeeded in Providing Objectivity and Predictability in Obviousness Determinations.The requirement that there be some suggestion in the art to combine or modify prior art teachings dates back more than five decades to early decisions of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.4 Numerous subsequent decisions of that court, both before and after Graham, firmly established the requirement for a suggestion to combine prior art disclosures.5 The Federal Circuit, created with a primary4 See, e.g., In re Williams, 223 F.2d 291, 293-94 (C.C.P.A. 1955); In re Demarche, 219 F.2d 952, 956 (C.C.P.A. 1955). 5 See, e.g., In re Hill, 284 F.2d 955 (C.C.P.A. 1960); In re Bergel, 292 F.2d 955, 956-57 (C.C.P.A. 1961); In re Imperato, 486 F.2d 585, 587 (C.C.P.A. 1973); In re Regel, 526 F.2d 1399, 1403 n.6 (C.C.P.A. 1975).4purpose of achieving greater uniformity in the application of patentability standards,6 subsequently developed the teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry more fully.A. This Court Has Recognized the Need to Avoid Hindsight and the Need for Objectivity and Predictability in Determining Obviousness.This Court has recognized that hindsight is not germane to obviousness and must be kept out of the obviousness analysis. Graham, 383 U.S. at 36; Dennison Mfg. Co. v. Panduit Corp., 475 U.S. 809, 810 (1986) ("in addressing the question of obviousness a judge must not pick and choose isolated elements from the prior art and combine them so as to yield the invention in question if such a combination would not have been obvious at the time of invention.").In the Graham opinion, this Court established a framework for evaluating obviousness under Section 103. In particular, inquiry is made into three objective factual matters: the scope and content of the prior art, the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention, and the level of skill in the art. This Court also invited scrutiny of "subtests" of nonobviousness, which it called "secondary considerations," including commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, and the failures of others. Only after all these factors are weighed and evaluated is the court to determine whether the invention as a whole would have been obvious. 383 U.S. at 13-18.This Court then acknowledged the difficulties in applying the nonobviousness test because:6 See H.R. REP. NO. 97-312, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. at 11 (1981).5What is obvious is not a question upon which there is likely to be uniformity of thought in every given factual context. The difficulties, however, are comparable to those encountered daily by the courts in such frames of reference as negligence and scienter, and should be amenable to a case-by-case development.383 U.S. at 18 (emphasis added). While the Graham framework does not specifically prescribe all relevant factors in the obviousness determination, it looks to objective criteria and provides the basic framework for the analysis. The teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry, as articulated by the Federal Circuit and one of its predecessor courts, is just the type of "case-by-case development" in the law of obviousness called for in Graham. Id.B. The Teaching-Suggestion-Motivation Inquiry Is A Useful and Appropriate Method for Determining Patentability While Avoiding Hindsight.The Graham framework provides useful guidance to address the final and ultimate inquiry of whether an invention would have been obvious. In following this Court's guidance in Graham and Dennison, and as a safeguard against the "insidious effect of a hindsight syndrome," In re Fine, 837 F.2d 1071, 1075 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the Federal Circuit has consistently required a showing of a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine elements in the prior art. See, e.g., In re Dembiczak, 175 F.3d 994, 999 (Fed. Cir. 1992).The question of whether there is a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine prior art teachings is a component of Graham's inquiry into the scope and content of the prior art. SIBIA Neurosciences, Inc. v. Cadus Pharmaceutical Corp., 225 F.3d 1349, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2000).6Other Graham factors, particularly the level of skill in the art and the differences between the invention and the prior art, also may speak to whether it would have been obvious to combine elements in the prior art. McGinley v. Franklin Sports, Inc., 262 F.3d 1339, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry, in short, is an evidentiary-based methodology to ensure that the Graham framework is properly followed.The teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry has been widely approved of by knowledgeable commentators. The inquiry has been described as a "well-established obviousness guideline"7 and "an established element in the obviousness determination."8 One commentator identifies the characteristic objectivity of the teaching-suggestionmotivation inquiry, ensuring "the decision-maker will not substitute her own judgment" for that of the hypothetical person skilled in the art.9In an October 2003 report,10 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) likewise "urges" that, in assessing whether it would have been obvious to combine or modify prior art references, consideration should not be limited to "concrete suggestions or motivations" but also include "suggestions implicit from the prior art as a whole, suggestions from the nature of the problem to be solved, and7 John B. Sganga, Jr., Litigating Obviousness: A New Approach for Using Expert Witnesses, 81 J. PAT. & TRADEMARK OFF. SOC'Y 181, 182 (1999). 8 Irah H. Donner, Combating Obviousness Rejections under 35 U.S.C. Section 103, 6 ALB. L.J. SCI. & TECH. 159, 183 (1996).9 Joseph P. Meara, Ph.D., Notes & Comments, Just Who is the Person Having Ordinary Skill in the Art? Patent Law's Mysterious Personage, 77 WASH. L. REV. 267, 275 (2002).10 FED. TRADE COMM'N, To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law & Policy (2003) at 4 ­9 to 4­15.7the ability and knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art." Id. at 4­15.C. The Teaching-Suggestion-Motivation Inquiry Provides Ample Flexibility to Consider Factors in Addition to Explicit Prior Art Teachings.In the opinion on review, the Federal Circuit remanded to the district court to make a specific factual finding of the "specific understanding or principle within the knowledge of the skilled artisan that would have motivated one with no knowledge of [the] invention to make the combination." In a subsequent decision, the Federal Circuit elaborated on the point, holding that ­ consistent with the FTC recommendation ­ the motivation to combine prior art elements may be found explicitly in the prior art or "may be implicit from the prior art as a whole . . . The test for an implicit showing is what the combined teachings, knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art, and the nature of the problem to be solved as a whole would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art." In re Kahn, 441 F.3d 977, 987-88 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting In re Kotzab, 217 F.3d 1365, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2000)); see also Alza Corp. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., No. 06-1019, slip. op. at 5-7 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 6, 2006).Various other Federal Circuit decisions illustrate the flexibility of the teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry, as well as the importance of considering implicit evidence in the analysis. See, e.g., Pro-Mold and Tool Co., Inc. v. Great Lakes Plastics, Inc., 75 F.3d 1568, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Ruiz v. A.B. Chance Co., 357 F.3d 1270, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2004); National Steel Car Ltd. v. Canadian Pacific Railway, Ltd., 357 F.3d 1319, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Such a flexible8approach enables a court or patent examiner11 to evaluate the evidence and properly reach a conclusion of obviousness whenever an inventor's solution to a problem would have been evident to persons skilled in the art, even if the relevant knowledge of the skilled artisan was not reduced to writing.II. Reducing Objectivity and Predictability in Obviousness Determinations Would Burden the Courts, the Patent and Trademark Office, Inventors, Litigants, and the Public as a Whole.Members of the bar need predictability to counsel clients in matters involving patent validity. Abandoning the teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry would result in a more subjective approach with far less certainty, and ultimately would provide less guidance to the bar. If some elusive method not based on evidence were to be substituted for the present inquiry, hundreds of thousands of patents granted under the teaching-suggestion-motivation methodology would be immediately placed under a cloud.Without a teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry, the courts, patent examiners, and litigants would be left with little guidance as to the manner in which the Graham factors should be weighed when combination issues arise. As the ultimate issue of obviousness is a question of law12 warranting de novo review on appeal, if this Court reverses firmly established precedent, the Federal Circuit could expect a flood of appeals from district courts and from the Patent and Trademark Office. Such an environment also would11 The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, § 2144.03, permits patent examiners to take official notice of common knowledge in the art or "well known" prior art. See, e.g., In re Beasley, 117 Fed. Appx. 739, 744 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 12 Graham, 383 U.S. at 17; Sakraida v. Ag Pro, Inc., 425 U.S. 273, 280 (1976).9increase the frequency and expense of patent litigation because parties would be hard put to predict how a court would rule on validity.Because most inventions involve combinations of old elements, appellate review of obviousness rejections made by the Patent and Trademark Office often hinges on the issue of whether it would have been obvious to combine individual prior art elements. This Court has held that evidentiary findings of the Patent and Trademark Office must be reviewed using the standard in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706. Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U.S. 150, 163 (1999). Under the APA standard of review, there must be substantial evidence to support the factual underpinnings of a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103. In re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Abandoning the teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry would frustrate appellate review of Patent and Trademark Office decisions because the appellate court would have far less evidentiary basis on which to review the agency's conclusions.III. Significant Changes in the Application of the Obviousness Standard Should Be Reserved to the Congress.The application of the obviousness standard by the courts and by the Patent and Trademark Office has profound economic and technological policy implications. The fact that the Congress has not intervened during several decades ­ decades that have witnessed unprecedented technological advancement ­ should be taken into consideration by this Court.Even if this Court considers the patent system to be in need of change, there is no basis to conclude that abandoning the teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry would be beneficial. The part of the patent system to which the10teaching-suggestions-motivation inquiry applies seems to be working well, and certainly no less well than other parts of the system. A recent study found that the Federal Circuit affirmed lower court decisions featuring a teachingsuggestion-motivation inquiry just as often (65.3%) as it affirmed decisions not featuring the inquiry (65.0%). In the cases featuring the teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry, a result of obviousness (52.4%) was reached more often than a result of non-obviousness (47.6%).13Congress, rather than the courts, is in the best position to determine whether significant change is warranted in the longstanding methodology for determining obviousness. It is also worth noting that although the teaching-suggestionmotivation inquiry has existed in one form or another for more than 50 years, neither the U.S. Government in general nor the Patent and Trademark Office in particular has ever sought Supreme Court review or statutory modification.13 Lee Petherbridge and R. Polk Wagner, The Federal Circuit and Patentability: An Empirical Assessment of the Law of Obviousness, The Berkeley Electronic Press, http://lsr.nellco.org/upenn/wps/papers/103 at 46 (2006).11CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above, the ABA respectfully submits that this Court should affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:MARK T.

Rasul v. Bush, 542US. 466, 474 (2004).The Suspension Clause reflects recognition of the lessons taught by English principle established in Magna Carta "thatthe Founders' history, from the the king is andshall be below the law" (Frederick Pollock & Frederic W.Maitland, 1 The History of English Law 173 (2d ed. 1923)),to the efforts by Parliament in the 17th century to preventmonarchs from evading the writ of habeas corpus.For example, during the Protectorate period that followed the English Civil War, prisoners were moved between jails to prevent service of habeas corpus petitions, or sent to overseas prisons to avoid the reach of the courts altogether. See William F. Duker, A Constitutional History of Habeas Corpus 48-53 (1980). Parliament, however, refused to accept these practices. In 1667, Parliament impeached Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, because, among other things:he hath advised and procured divers of his majesty's subjects to be imprisoned against law, in remote islands, garrisons, and other places, thereby to prevent them from the benefit of the law, and to produce precedents for imprisoning any other of his majesty's subjects in like manner.Duker, againstsupra, Edwardat 53 (quoting Proceedings Earl of Clarendon, Lord Highin Parliament Chancellor ofEngland, (1663-1667) 6 St. Tr. 291).To curb such practices, Parliament enacted theaAiHcbmatupbsoeerasitstasnewltCiftohrdtpihudrisensgnpoAetccttthecutorofAech1ta6abl7le9da,isdde3f1ciwocariCspeaurn.scitoe2ws,,o.uc.l.2"d[.p(]1ndJo6eet7rm9ho)ban.epssttroWatlhhteieerlaetmeotdhts.aht"teR.J. Sharpe, The Law of Habeas Corpus 19 Thus, the Act "established the principle that(2d theed. 1989). efficacy ofhabeas corpus is not to be thwarted." Jd. at 20.It was with the knowledge of the Great Writ's history that the Founders adopted the Suspension Clause. The Founders recognized habeas corpus to be an essential pillar of the rule of law. Thomas Jefferson identified habeas corpus as one of the "essential principles of our Government" (Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural (Mar. 4, 1802), reprinted in Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States, S. Doc. No. 101-10, at 16 (1989)), stating that the new Constitution must protect "the eternal & unremitting force of the habeas corpus laws" (Letter from Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (Dec. 20, 1787), reprinted in 8 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 250 (1988)). James Madison extolled the writ as a "sacred" principle in the "administration of preventative justice." 4 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal8Constitution, as Recommended by the General Convention atPhiladelphia in 1787 Alexander Hamilton555 (Jonathan Elliot ed., 2d ed. 1881). declared that "the practice of arbitraryimprisonments, [has] formidable instrumentbeen, in all ages, the favorite of tyranny." The Federalistand No.most 84, at474 (Isaac Kramnick ed. 1987).The English monarch's repeated attempts tocircumvent the writ and the frequent suspension of habeas byParliament exceptions recognizeditself' made the Founders wary of creating to the protections of habeas corpus. They that the writ would come under assault,any also oftenwhen the rule of law was most at risk. Thus, they not onlyrefused to give the Executive Branch power to restrict thewrit but also tightly limited Congress' power to do so.At the Constitutional Convention, Charles Pinckney introduced proposed language providing that "the Writ ofHabeas corpus . . . shall not be suspended by the Legislature except upon the most urgent and pressing occasions, and for a limited period not exceeding .. . months." 2 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 341 (Max Farrand ed., 3d ed. 1966). Objecting that this language was not strong enough, Edward Rutledge proposed that habeas corpus be declared "inviolable" as he could envision no justification for its suspension. Jd. at 438. Finally, Gouveneur Morris offered the compromise that became the Suspension Clause (with some minor changes in capitalization): "The privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless where in cases of Rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it." Jd. Thus the Founders considered, but refused to allow, exceptions to the writ even for "the most urgent and10 See, e.g, Rex A. Collings, Jr., Habeas Corpus for Convicts -- Constitutional Right or Legislative Grace?, 40 Cal. L. Rev. 335, 33940 (1952).pressing occasions," instead restricting suspensions to "Rebellion or invasion."liberties RightsTellingly, while specific were added to the original and later amendments, theguarantees ConstitutionSuspensionof individual by the Bill ofClause is aguarantor of liberty found in the original Constitution. Its placement there, together with prohibitions on ex post factolaws and bills of attainder, reflects its role as one of theprincipal bulwarks against Executive and Legislativetyranny. Like the separation of powers and judicialindependence, the Suspension Clause is part of thefundamental structure of the Constitution intended topreserve the rule of law.This Court has "constantly emphasized the fundamental importance of the writ of habeas corpus in our constitutional scheme." Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 485 (1969) (citation omitted). As this Court once observed: "It must never be forgotten that the writ of habeas corpus is the precious safeguard of personal liberty and there is no higher duty than to maintain it unimpaired." Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U.S. 19, 26 (1939) (citation omitted).II.The Denial of Habeas Corpus to GuantanamoDetainees Is Inconsistent with the Constitutionand the Rule of Law.The Court of Appeals' holding that Petitioners may be denied habeas corpus because Guantanamo is not a "sovereign territory" of the United States is the very kind of limitation of the writ the Founders intended to prevent when they adopted the Suspension Clause. Such a distinction creates an area where individual rights are not judicially enforceable, thus undermining the most fundamental attribute of the rule of law. Moreover, it is difficult to assert that10developing government recognized.countries should follow the rule of law can create an area where the writ Affirmance of Petitioners' right toif our is not habeascorpus will not only be consistent with the original intent ofthe Founders, but will also commitment to promotingbe consistent with our nation's the rule of law in the worldcommunity.A.A "Sovereign Territory" Limitation IsInconsistent with the Constitutional Role ofthe Writ of Habeas Corpus and the Rule ofLaw.for andaThe Writ of Habeas Corpus provides the searching review by an impartial tribunalopportunity of the legalfactual basis for detention.''

(court required to "fully examine[] and attentively consider[]" the facts and testimony on which the habeas petitioners were imprisoned); see also Harris v.Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 298 (1969) ("Petitioners in habeas corpus proceedings, as the Congress and this Court have emphasized . . . are entitled to careful consideration and plenary processing of their claims including full opportunity for presentation of the relevant facts."). See also, e.g., United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ("ICCPR"), art. 9, § 4, entered into force Mar. 23, 1976, 999 U.N.T.S. 717 (ratified by the United States on June 8, 1992).See Harris, 394 U.S. at 298 (petitioners in habeas proceedings are entitled to seek and introduce evidence); Al Odah v.

It constitutes the very type of evasion of the writ thatthe Suspension Clause was designed to prevent.The ABA recognizes the pressures on the ExecutiveBranch to consider every measure possible to protect thenation in times of peril. just such pressures and basic liberties essentialHistory cautions, however, that it is just such times that can undermine to the rule of law. It was preciselyfor that reason that the Founders, in framing the SuspensionClause, rejected language that would have given Congresspower to suspend the writ in "the most pressing and urgentconditions" and limited such power solely to cases ofrebellion and invasion. See pp. 8-10, supra.This Court's analysis in Rasul confirms that the availability of the historic function of the writ as a safeguard of individual liberty should not turn on geographical niceties such as those relied upon here. As the Court explained:before the Court and in the interest of justice."); ef Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 49 (2004) ("[I]t is a rule of the common law, founded on natural justice, that no man shall be prejudiced by evidence which he had not the liberty to cross examine.") (citation omitted).12As Lord Mansfield wrote in 1759, even if aterritory was "no doubt" as"no part of the realm," to the court's power tothere issuewas writsof habeas corpus if the territory was "under thesubjection of the Crown." King v. Cowle, 2Burr. 834, 854-855, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 598-599(K.B.) Later cases confirmed that the reach ofthe writ territorialdepended not on formal sovereignty, but rather onnotions of the practicalquestion of "the exact extent and jurisdiction or dominion exercisednature in factof bythe theCrown." Ex parte Mwenya [1960] 1 Q.B. 241,303 (C.A.) (Lord Evershed, M.R.).Rasul, 542 U.S. at 482.The Judiciary aneously with theAct of 1789, enacted contemporConstitution, demonstrates that theFounders did not rely on such "formal notions of territorial sovereignty" but on the practical realities of governmentdetention. Thus the 1789 Act provided that federal courts are authorized to entertain petitions for the writ of habeas corpusfrom prisoners "where they are in custody, under or bycolour of the authority of the United States... ."

Justice Kennedy, in his concurrence in Rasul, statedthat for purposes of determining application of the writ,[w]hat matters is the unchallenged and indefinite contro] that the United States has long exercised over Guantanamo Bay. From a practical perspective, the indefinite lease of Guantanamo Bay has produced a place that belongs to the United States, extending the "implied protection" of the United States to it.Id. at 487 (Kennedy, J., concurring), quoting Eisentrager, 339 U.S. at 777-78.

It allows friends and foes alike to remain in detention. It suggests a weaker case of military necessity and much greater alignment with the traditional function of habeas corpus. Perhaps, where detainees are taken from a zone of hostilities, detention without proceedings or trial would be justified by military necessity for a matter of weeks; but as the period of detention stretches from months to years, the case for continued detention to meet military exigencies becomes weaker.Id. at 488.The language and history of the Suspension Clause and its essential role in maintaining the rule of law create a heavy presumption against limits on the judicial power to "protect persons from unlawful detention ...."

CHEUNG JANA RAMSEYCOUNSEL FOR AMICUS CURIAE* 
I. In Prohibiting Judicial Candidates From Personally Soliciting Campaign Contributions, Canon 7C(1) Is A Permissible Campaign Contribution Regulation That Does Not Violate The First Amendment.a. Canon 7C(1) of the Florida Code of Judicial Conduct provides, in relevant part:A candidate, including an incumbent judge, for a judicial office that is filled by public election between competing candidates shall not personally solicit campaign funds, or solicit attorneys for publicly stated support, but may establish committees of responsible persons to secure and manage the expenditure of funds for the candidate's campaign and to obtain public statements of support for his or her candidacy.Pet. App. 6-7a. See also Williams-Yulee, 138 So. 3d at 385.8By its plain language, Canon 7C(1) does not limit judicial candidates' political speech. They remain free to put forward their qualifications for office and their positions on issues, whether in person or by mail. Nor does it limit contributions that can be made to judicial candidates. It regulates only the solicitation of those contributions by requiring that such solicitations be made by campaign committees and not by the judicial candidates personally.Because Canon 7C(1) does not restrict actual "speech," it should be analyzed under the "closely drawn" scrutiny standard, rather than under strict scrutiny. However, even under the strict scrutiny analysis that the Florida Supreme Court applied, Pet. App. 10a, Williams-Yulee, 138 So. 3d at 384, its narrow personal solicitation ban does not violate the First Amendment.b. In McConnell, this Court upheld a similar solicitation ban that barred federal candidates and officeholders from soliciting soft money in connection with federal elections because "[l]arge soft-money donations at a candidate's or officeholder's behest give rise to all the same corruption concerns posed by contributions made directly to the candidate or officeholder." McConnell, 540 U.S. at 182. The McConnell Court thus applied the "closely drawn" scrutiny review that it had applied to campaign contribution regulations in Buckley. Id. at 141-42.The Buckley Court had recognized that states have a compelling interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in elections through campaign finance regulation. The Court stated that "the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness9of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions" was "[o]f almost equal concern as the danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements." Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27. Concluding that contribution limits impose a lesser restraint on political speech, the Buckley Court applied the less rigorous "closely drawn" scrutiny. Id. at 25. Likewise, the McConnell Court concluded that strict scrutiny should not be applied to the soft-money solicitation ban.Applying Buckley, the McConnell Court concluded that a legitimate interest "extends beyond preventing simple cash-for-votes corruption to curbing `undue influence on an officeholder's judgment, and the appearance of such influence.'" McConnell, 540 U.S. at 150, quoting Fed. Election Comm'n v. Colo. Republican Fed. Campaign Comm., 533 U.S. 431, 441 (2001). The danger that officeholders would decide issues based on the desires of contributors, and not on the merits or wishes of their constituents, was just as troubling as quid pro quo corruption. McConnell, 540 U.S. at 153. Because this danger "is neither easily detected nor practical to criminalize[, t]he best means of prevention is to identify and remove the temptation." Id. The McConnell Court also stated that "it is irrelevant that Congress chose ... to regulate contributions on the demand rather than the supply side." McConnell, 540 U.S. at 138.Republican Party of Minn. v. White (White I), 536 U.S. 765 (2002), is not to the contrary. In White I, this Court applied strict scrutiny to Minnesota's "announce clause," because that canon prohibited judicial candidates from expressing their views on legal and political issues that might come before the court. White I, 536 U.S. at10768. Further, that canon regulated judges "only when and because they are candidates." Id. at 796 (Kennedy, J., concurring). A candidate could "say the very same thing, however, up until the very day before he declares himself a candidate, and may say it repeatedly (until litigation is pending) after he is elected." Id. at 779-80.Unlike the announce clause at issue in White I, Canon 7C(1) does not burden speech that is "'at the core of our First Amendment freedoms'--speech about the qualifications of candidates for public office." White I, 536 U.S. at 774. Further, the limitation imposed by Canon 7C(1) applies any time the request is for a campaign contribution, but limits only requests made by the person who is or will be the judicial candidate. Canon 7C(1), therefore, should be considered under the "closely drawn" scrutiny review that this Court applied to campaign contribution regulations in McConnell.c. Florida's personal solicitation ban survives McConnell's "closely drawn" standard. The interest identified in McConnell--that officeholders would decide issues not on the merits or their constituents' wishes but, instead, because of donations made "at a candidate's or officeholder's behest," id. at 182--is even more compelling in the context of our judicial system, with its fundamental postulate that cases be decided on their merits, and not based on the identity of the litigants or their lawyers.Canon 7C(1) is properly aimed at eliminating the pressures of appeasing donors from whom a judicial candidate has personally asked for a contribution. And the pressure to appease a donor may be present even when that donor is not a litigant before the judge, if11the judge's decision will nevertheless benefit or hinder the interests of the non-party donor. Barring judicial candidates from personally soliciting contributions avoids even the appearance of this kind of quid pro quo simply by removing judicial candidates from asking for the quid.Successful judicial candidates sitting as judges may know that a lawyer or party appearing before them contributed to their campaigns, and may, of course, feel a debt of gratitude toward these contributors. Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 882 (2009). But it is one thing to feel a debt of gratitude because of a contribution, and another thing for the judge to know that the contribution was made by that litigant because of the judge's personal request--a request that the litigant may well have felt she could not refuse. See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 303 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("one of the handful of Senators on whom the Government relies to make its case candidly admits the pressure of appeasing soft-money donors derives from the Members' solicitation of donors, not from the donors' otherwise giving to their party.").The fact that Petitioner's solicitation was a mailing, rather than an in-person solicitation, does not change the analysis. Even a printed mass-mailed request for contributions coming from a judge or judicial candidate is likely to have a profound effect on a litigant or lawyer who appears before, or is interested in a matter before, the judge. A mass-solicitation letter may avoid the intimacy of a personal request, but applying the ban to all forms of personal solicitation is a "valid anticircumvention measure[,]" McConnell, 540 U.S. at 182, that avoids the need for fact-specific determinations as to whether any particular litigant or lawyer was or felt coerced by any12particular contribution request. It avoids the necessity of determining, for instance, whether a small-volume "mass mailing" is actually a personal letter directed to specific potential donors, or to people known to represent well-funded potential donors, who are included among the recipients. Additionally, the objective ban avoids the difficulty of distinguishing whether a campaign event should be considered a large mass event or, for example, one for several dozen carefully chosen potential donors.The solicitation ban on judicial candidates was imposed by the Florida Supreme Court, the entity responsible for the ethical regulation of Florida's judicial branch. In McConnell, the Court stated that applying the "closely drawn" scrutiny standard to the solicitation ban at issue showed "proper deference to Congress' ability to weigh competing constitutional interests in an area in which it enjoys particular expertise." Id. at 137. The Florida Supreme Court, similarly, has weighed the competing constitutional interests, including the due process concerns, that are implicated by personal solicitations for contributions in Florida judicial campaigns. See Caperton, 556 U.S at 885 ("Due process requires an objective inquiry into whether the contributor's influence on the election under all the circumstances `would offer a possible temptation to the average ... judge to ... lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true[,]'' quoting Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 532 (1927)). In fact, every state supreme court that has considered whether its solicitation ban violates the First Amendment has held it does not. See Williams-Yulee, 138 So. 3d at 384 (citing Simes, 247 S.W.3d at 881; In re Dunleavy, 838 A.2d 338, 351 (Me. 2003); In re Fadeley, 310 Or. 548, 802 P.2d 31, 41 (Or. 1990)).13This Court should apply McConnell's "closely drawn" scrutiny standard and conclude that Canon 7C(1)'s personal solicitation ban is closely drawn to avoid the appearance of quid pro quo corruption by removing the judicial candidate from the fundraising process. Balancing Florida's interest in judicial integrity against a judicial candidate's ability to personally solicit campaign contributions weighs heavily in the State's favor.II. Even Under The Strict Scrutiny Standard, Canon 7C(1) Is The "Rare Case" That Survives.Even under the rigorous strict scrutiny standard, Canon 7C(1)'s personal solicitation ban presents "the rare case in which...a law survives[.]" Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 211 (1992).To survive strict scrutiny, Canon 7C(1) must (1) be narrowly tailored to (2) serve a compelling state interest. White I, 536 U.S. at 774-75. Florida Canon 7C(1) satisfies both requirements. There is no question Florida has a compelling interest in a fair and impartial judiciary free from the appearance of corruption. Every court to apply strict scrutiny to a similar solicitation ban has found the states have a compelling interest in the appearance and actuality of an impartial judiciary. See, e.g., Wolfson v. Concannon, 750 F.3d 1145, 1156 (9th Cir. 2014). And, as discussed above, Canon 7C(1) is narrowly tailored because it does not "unnecessarily circumscrib[e] protected expression." White I, 536 U.S. at 775 (quoting Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U.S. 45, 54 (1982)). It limits only a judicial candidate's ability to personally solicit campaign contributions.14The solicitation at issue in this case was a solicitation letter personally signed by Petitioner. This Court has upheld bans on solicitation letters for campaign contributions under quid pro quo concerns. Fed. Election Comm'n v. Nat'l Right To Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197, 210 (1982). This Court has also recognized the states' interest in preventing the appearance of quid pro quo corruption. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27; McCutcheon v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 134 S. Ct. 1434, 1441 (2014); Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 359. See also Siefert v. Alexander, 608 F.3d 974, 989 (7th Cir. 2010) (contributions made at a judicial candidate's request carry greater potential for the appearance of quid pro quo than those made at a non-candidate's request).Canon 7C(1)'s personal solicitation ban is neither overinclusive nor underinclusive. It removes judicial candidates from the appearance of quid pro quo, but does not limit a candidate's ability to communicate her views or qualifications. It does not prohibit a candidate from soliciting other forms of support, like asking for votes or putting up yard signs. Nor does it bar her from sending mailings under her signature, or from giving campaign speeches to a crowd or an intimate group; it only bars the judicial candidate from including a personal request for a contribution in her campaign communications.Petitioner is incorrect that recusal offers a less restrictive alternative to the solicitation ban. Pet. Br. 23. In the first place, recusal of judges imposes serious costs on a state's judicial system when judges become unavailable to decide cases. Second, asking judges to recuse themselves places the parties and lawyers before them in an often-confrontative position before the judge. Third, recusal often requires that a judge subjectively15determine whether a litigant's contribution has or has not resulted in bias or the appearance of bias, which can be difficult despite a judge's most sincere efforts. "[J]udges who are deeply committed to the appearance and reality of impartial justice are called upon to acknowledge in the context of specific cases, that despite their best efforts to preserve impartiality, they are either partial or appear to be so. That is a hard thing to ask of our judges."10 See also Caperton, 556 U.S. at 883 ("[t]he difficulties of inquiring into actual bias, and the fact that the inquiry is often a private one, simply underscore the need for objective rules."). And, a judge's subjective conclusion as to whether the contribution resulted in actual bias or the appearance of bias does nothing to address the public perception created when a judge is asked to recuse because he personally solicited a litigant now before him for a campaign contribution. After-the-fact recusal is simply not a sufficient alternative to an objective solicitation ban.Canon 7(1) addresses Florida's concern that personal solicitation by judicial candidates creates the perception of either actual or apparent quid pro quo corruption, but it does not limit the candidates' ability to communicate their views or qualifications for office, or to form campaign committees to solicit funds to support their election efforts. The rule is thus narrowly tailored to Florida's10. Examining the State of Judicial Recusals after Caperton v. A.T. Massey: Hearing before Subcomm. on Courts and Competition Policy of the H.

The Cost of Judicial Elections Makes The Prohibition On Personal Solicitation By Judicial Candidates More Important Today.In 1812, Georgia became the first state to provide for the election of judges. White I, 536 U.S. at 785. Today, although the forms of judicial elections vary, 39 states provide for the election of at least some of their judges. While judicial elections were once seen as sleepy affairs, they have attracted ever increasing amounts of money and attention in the past few decades, and the need for judges and judicial candidates to raise ever-increasing sums of money has had a corrosive effect on the public's perception of the integrity of our state judicial systems. "As interest-group spending rises, public confidence in the judiciary declines."1211. In White I, this Court left open the question of whether states may "restrict the speech of judges because they are judges--for example, as part of a code of judicial conduct" under the rationale of Pickering v. Bd. of Educ. of Twp. High Sch. Dist. 205, Will Cnty, 391 U.S. 563 (1968) and Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983). White I, 536 U.S. at 796 (Kennedy, J., concurring). See also Wolfson, 750 F.3d at 1163 (Berzon, J., concurring) ("I suggest that the analogy to the Pickering line of cases has much to commend it."). The ABA asserts that, under Pickering, the solicitation ban should also be upheld.12. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (Ret.), Opinion, Justice for Sale: How Special-Interest Money Threatens the Integrity of Our Court, WALL ST. J., Nov. 15, 2007, at A25.17As revealed in a 2009 Gallup poll, 89 percent of voters believed that the influence of campaign contributions on a judge was a problem.13 Equally troubling is a 2002 poll, in which 46 percent of state court judges polled believed campaign donations had at least "a little influence" on judicial decisions.14And the effect campaign contributions have on the public's perception of judicial integrity and independence is a concern no longer limited to states that hold partisan, contested judicial elections, but extends to states that hold non-partisan, uncontested elections as well. For example, despite Iowa's adoption of the Missouri plan for merit selection of its supreme court justices--a system designed to "reduce[] threats to judicial impartiality," White I, 536 U.S. at 791 (O'Connor, J., concurring)--three Iowa supreme court justices were defeated in an uncontested retention election in 2010 after an out-of-state group mounted an anti-retention campaign that focused on the justices' votes in a single, unanimous opinion.15If the solicitation ban is invalidated, judges facing retention or reelection, having the benefit of the Iowa example, may well begin to build their campaign coffers by personally asking for contributions from those likely to support a decision, perhaps as soon as the decision is rendered. Moreover, when faced with a controversial13. Joan Biskupic, Supreme Court Case with the Feel of a Best Seller, USA TODAY, Feb. 16, 2009.14. Greenberg Quinland Rosner et al., JUSTICE AT STAKE STATE JUDGES FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE, Q. 12 at 5 (2002).15. Grant Schulte, Iowans Dismiss Three Justices, DES MOINES REGISTER, Nov. 3, 2010.18decision, judges may consider the potential level of campaign financial support--for or against them as candidates.If this happens, judges may begin to be perceived as little different from their legislative and executive branch counterparts. But while legislators and executive branch officials should be expected to consider the views of their constituents when making policy decisions, "[j]udges are not political actors. They do not sit as representatives of particular persons, communities or parties; they serve no faction or constituency. `[I]t is the business of judges to be indifferent to popularity.'" White I, 536 U.S. at 806 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (quoting Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U.S. 380, 401 n.29 (1991)). Furthermore, judicial races, unlike legislative and executive races, have due process implications. See Caperton, 556 U.S. 868.As the pressure to spend more on judicial campaigns increases, rules like Florida's Canon 7C(1), which restrict a candidate's ability to personally ask for campaign contributions, become more important in the avoidance of the actuality and appearance of quid pro quo. The amount of money spent on judicial races more than doubled between the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.16 And in the 2014 election cycle, spending on television advertising in state supreme court races increased by $2 million from 2010.17 As discussed above, when adopting Code of Judicial16.

Joseph Tanfani, Judicial Elections Getting More Political with New Campaign Spending, LA TIMES, Nov 23, 2014,19Conduct in 1972, the ABA concluded that most citizens were not interested in helping finance a campaign for judicial office, and that the sources for judicial campaign finances were "the coffers of a political organization, lawyers, and those persons who are, or are likely to be, involved in litigation."18 Today, however, large out-of-state groups must be added as important sources, and without the personal solicitation ban, judicial candidates are likely to be faced with the decision of whether to personally solicit them for contributions, regardless of the effect on public perception.Whether judicial elections are the best form of judicial selection is a topic that has been the subject of much debate, and the debate will no doubt continue after this case has been decided. "[T]he struggle to balance independence and accountability has played itself out over the course of more than two centuries [resulting in] distinct methods of selecting judges--each striking a balance in different ways."19 But 39 states have chosen some form of elections to select at least some of their judges.20 And those states have the right to make that choice, for it is "[t]hrough thehttp: // w w w.lati mes.com /nation /pol itics / la-na-jud icia l- elections20141123-story.html#page=1 (last visited Dec. 19, 2014).18.

Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991).The ABA does not, "even by inadvertence, `impute to judges a lack of firmness, wisdom, or honor,'" White I, 536 U.S. at 796 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (quoting Bridges v. Cal., 314 U.S. 252, 273 (1941)). Still, the fact remains that "[t]he power and the prerogative of a court to perform [its] function rest[s], in the end, upon the respect accorded to its judgments." White I, 536 U.S. at 793 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also Bauer v. Shepard, 620 F.3d 704, 712 (7th Cir. 2010) ("The judicial system depends on its reputation for impartiality; it is public acceptance, rather than the sword or the purse, that leads decisions to be obeyed and adverts vigilantism and civil strife.").Florida's Canon 7C(1) and the similar personal solicitation bans adopted by 29 other states are consistent with the First Amendment in their limitation of only the personal solicitation of campaign funds by judicial candidates. The choice of these narrowly tailored vehicles to protect the integrity of their judicial branches by avoiding the appearance of corruption, therefore, should be left to the states to make. As this Court has stated, "[T]he preservation of the States, and the maintenance of their governments, are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National government. The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States." Gregory, 501 U.S. at 457 (quoting Tex. v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725, 19 L.Ed. 227 (1869)).21The personal solicitation ban embodied in Florida's Canon 7C(1) should be upheld.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set out above, amicus curiae American Bar Association respectfully requests this Court affirm the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.Dated: December 24, 2014Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: THOMAS P.

I. THE PTO'S PROPOSED INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 145 WOULD ERECT AN INSURMOUNTABLE ROADBLOCK TO JUSTICE FOR MANY PATENT APPLICANTS.Section 145 provides important rights to a patent applicant that are otherwise unavailable under the Patent Act, including de novo review of the denial of their applications and the ability to introduce new evidence in district court. Adoption of the PTO's position will close the Section 145 avenue to many, if5not most, individuals, small businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The implications of doing so are of significant concern to the ABA.Equal access to justice is not merely an aspiration; it is the cornerstone of the American justice system. As Justice Powell noted in an August 10, 1976, speech:Equal justice under law is not merely a caption on the façade of the Supreme Court building. It is perhaps the most inspiring ideal of our society. It is one of the ends for which our entire legal system exists . . . . [I]t is fundamental that justice should be the same, in substance and availability, without regard to economic status.Quoted in Michael A. Mogill, Professing Pro Bono: To Walk the Talk, 15 NOTRE DAME J.L. ETHICS & PUB. POL'Y 5, 7 (2001).Critical to the notion of equal access is that those with fewer resources not be dissuaded from seeking redress from the courts by financial impediments to justice. To that end, courts waive filing and transcript fees for the indigent. See, e.g., Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17-18 (1956) ("Plainly the ability to pay costs in advance bears no rational relationship to a defendant's guilt or innocence and could not be used as an excuse to deprive a defendant of a fair trial."); Jafar v. Webb, 303 P.3d 1042, 1047 (Wash. 2013) (requiring waiver of all court fees and local surcharges for indigent litigants).6Fee shifting is used in similar fashion in federal law; it is designed to increase access to justice, rather than limit it. When Congress has provided for fee shifting, it generally has done so to correct an imbalance of power by permitting a successful plaintiff to collect attorneys' fees. Robert V. Percival & Geoffrey P. Miller, The Role of Attorney Fee Shifting in Public Interest Litigation, 47 LAW & CONTEMP. PROBS. 233, 241 (Winter 1984) ("Fee shifting is designed to remove some of the disincentives facing public interest litigants, thus increasing access to the courts for groups who otherwise might be unrepresented or underrepresented."). For example, provisions in civil rights statutes, such as the Equal Access to Justice Act, allow prevailing plaintiffs to obtain fees in litigation against the government. See Act of Oct. 21, 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-481, §§ 202, 204, 94 Stat. 2321, 2325 (1980) (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. § 2412 and 5 U.S.C. § 504). That Act levels the litigation playing field between the government, on the one hand, and individuals and small businesses, on the other. See H.R. Rep. No. 99-120 (I), at 4 (1985) ("The Act reduces the disparity in resources between individuals, small businesses, and other organizations with limited resources and the Federal Government."). Indeed, Congress has expressly articulated its concern that well-funded governmental agencies not target small businesses because of their inability to pay for expensive litigation. See H.R. Rep. No. 96-1418, at 10 (1980) ("In fact, there is evidence that small businesses are the target of agency action precisely because they do not have the resources to fully litigate the issue" with the wellfunded government.).7The interpretation advocated by the PTO is contrary to these foundational principles. It would shut the door to the congressionally created Section 145 pathway for all except those who can afford to pay not only their own legal fees but also those of the federal government--even if the government loses.The government's attorneys' fees in de novo actions can be substantial. A recent decision from the Eastern District of Virginia imposed attorneys' fees of $51,472.53 in a 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(3) trademark case--a case in which the applicant was successful. Booking.com B.V. v. Matal, No. 1:16-cv-425 (LMBIDD), 2017 WL 4853755, at *9 (E.D. Va. Oct. 26, 2017) (basing its award on a salary chart prepared by the PTO). Another decision required the applicant to post a "conservative bond of $40,000" before permitting a Section 145 action to proceed, based partly on the PTO's estimate that it would spend $45,000 in attorney time on the case. See Taylor v. Lee, Nos. 1:15-cv-1607(LMB/JFA), 1:15-cv-1684(LMB/JFA), 1:16-cv-12(LMB/JFA), 2016 WL 9308420, at *2 (E.D. Va. July 12, 2016). Under that decision, the patent applicant must essentially pre-pay the government's fees even before conducting any aspect of the litigation.Those fees would be on top of the already-high expenditures required of applicants to pursue actions to overcome adverse PTO decisions in district court. Plaintiffs generally opt for the Section 145 pathway so they can introduce new evidence; thus, they must already pay for their experts and other expenses, as well as their own attorneys' fees.8An additional hurdle of reimbursing the PTO for potentially tens of thousands of dollars in fees will be insurmountable for many applicants and a significant deterrent to even more of them. Applicants lacking sufficient wealth to pay for their adversaries' lawyers would be blocked from the benefits of the Section 145 pathway--including de novo review of the denial of their applications and the ability to introduce new evidence in district court--solely because of their inability to pay. This will disproportionately affect individuals, small businesses, and non-profit organizations.4 Meanwhile, those benefits would remain open to large corporations and affluent individuals able to shoulder the burden of paying for the government's lawyers.What is more, Section 145 appellants have no control over the PTO's staffing of a matter, let alone how many hours the Office spends on it. Rarely does a client tell its own lawyer to proceed regardless of cost. Yet the PTO's interpretation would mean that Section 145 appellants must essentially write the government a blank check before proceeding. Absent a clear directive from Congress, no applicant should be exposed to such financial uncertainty.Here, the PTO's position implicates more than just a statutory right. The First Amendment encompasses a right of access to the judicial system. See4 See U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, FY 2018 PerformanceandAccountabilityReport188,https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USPTOFY18PAR.pdf (last visited April 29, 2019) (showing over 20% ofU.S. utility patents were issued to small and micro entities ineach year from 2014­2018).9Cal. Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 510 (1972). Specifically, "the right of access to the courts is an aspect of the First Amendment right to petition the Government for redress of grievances." Bill Johnson's Rests., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 461 U.S. 731, 741 (1983). By rejecting the PTO's reading of Section 145, the Court can avoid the constitutional concerns implicated by that reading. See, e.g., Carter v. United States, 733 F.2d 735, 737 (10th Cir. 1984) (holding that required payment of fees unduly burdened indigent prisoner's constitutional right of access to the courts).One court has suggested that Congress enacted the expense provision "to discourage applicants from undertaking this type of proceeding, which enables them to introduce new evidence ... thereby raising the potential for gamesmanship." Taylor, 2016 WL 9308420, at *1. But there is no evidence that the potential for such "gamesmanship" was animating Congress to act. In fact, this Court in Kappos v. Hyatt, 566 U.S. 431 (2012), was not persuaded by the proposition that an applicant would intentionally withhold evidence from the PTO with the goal of presenting that evidence for the first time to a nonexpert judge at the district court: "An applicant who pursues such a strategy would be intentionally undermining his claims before the PTO on the speculative chance that he will gain some advantage in the § 145 proceeding by presenting new evidence to a district court judge." Id. at 445. Nothing in Kappos (nor in the PTO's 2010 submissions in that case) suggests that Congress intended to deter the risk of gamesmanship by expanding the understanding of "expenses" to include attorneys' fees.10Nothing in Kappos (nor in the PTO's 2010 submissions in that case) suggests that the risk of gamesmanship should also be deterred by expanding the understanding of "expenses" to include attorneys' fees. Imposing the costs of experts and transcripts on applicants is one thing; exponentially increasing the cost of exercising a statutory right is quite another. Without clear congressional authorization, this Court should not permit the PTO to set the price of admission so high that many appellants will be forced to choose not to exercise their rights.Congress made the civil action mechanism available to patent applicants for a reason--to allow them to persuade a district court, in a trial setting and limited only by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence, that they deserved patents denied by the PTO. Congress surely did not provide this route to patent applicants and then erect a roadblock that would eliminate its use. A decision favoring that roadblock would have an unjust chilling effect on small businesses, sole inventors, and others who cannot afford the additional costs of the agency's fees, regardless of the merits of their inventions and civil actions. These implications must be avoided; the doors of justice must be open to all, regardless of individual prosperity. This is particularly true here, where, as set forth below, the language does not compel the opposite conclusion.11II. SECTION 145 DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR AWARDS OF ATTORNEYS' FEESA. The American Rule Governs Absent "Clear" and "Explicit" Congressional Intent to Deviate From ItThe process of considering whether a statute shifts attorneys' fees must begin with the foundational presumption that fees are not shifted. As the Court has explained, "[o]ur basic point of reference when considering the award of attorney's fees is the bedrock principle known as the `American Rule': Each litigant pays his own attorney's fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise." Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 252­53 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The American Rule intentionally departs from the English rule, which authorizes fee awards to prevailing parties in litigation, i.e., "loser pays." Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714, 717 (1967). Early in our history, the Court explained that the rule is "entitled to the respect of the court, till it is changed, or modified, by statute." Arcambel v. Wiseman, 3 U.S. 305, 306, 3 Dall. 306 (1796).Congress codified the American Rule in 1853, explicitly permitting only the shifting of docket fees up to twenty dollars, absent other statutory authorization. See John F. Vargo, The American Rule on Attorney Fee Allocation: The Injured Person's Access to Justice, 42 AM. U. L. REV. 1567, 1578 (1993) (citing Act of Feb. 26, 1853, ch. 80, 10 Stat 161 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. § 1923)). The 1853 Act was12enacted to overcome the "unequal, extravagant, and often oppressive system" of fee-shifting, when there were no constraints on the amounts lawyers could charge for services. Id. Since then, this Court has reaffirmed the American Rule many times. See Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421 U.S. 240, 250 (1975) (citing cases from 1852, 1872, 1873, 1879, 1967, and 1974 in which the "Court has consistently adhered to [the] early holding [of Arcambel]).The Court has recognized departures from the American Rule only in "specific and explicit provisions for the allowance of attorneys' fees under selected statutes." Baker Botts, LLP v. ASARCO LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2158, 2164 (2015) (quoting Alyeska, 421 U.S. at 260). The Court has made clear that there should be no deviation from the American Rule unless "explicit statutory authority" exists to do so. Id. (quoting Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001)).This principle is consistent with the underlying rationale of the American Rule itself--promoting fair access to the legal system. As this Court has explained, "one should not be penalized for merely defending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and ... the poor might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights ...." Fleischmann Distilling Corp., 386 U.S. at 718. As Justice Goldberg noted in Farmer v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 379 U.S. 227 (1964), it is "[no] accident that the American litigant must bear his own cost of counsel and other trial expense save for minimal court costs, but a deliberate choice to ensure that access to the courts be13not effectively denied those of moderate means." Id. at 237 (Goldberg, J., concurring).Courts must therefore look carefully at statutory language before departing from the American Rule, and a party seeking such a departure bears a heavy burden to overcome the "deeply rooted" adherence to it. Roadway Exp., Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 760-61 (1980) (examining legislative history and finding "nothing" to support the inclusion of attorneys' fees in the "taxable costs" of litigation); Alyeska, 421 U.S. at 271 (declining to depart from American Rule because it "is deeply rooted in our history and in congressional policy"); F.D. Rich Co. v. U.S. for Use of Indus. Lumber Co., 417 U.S. 116, 12831 (1974) (declining to interpret "costs" and "sums justly due" to include "attorney's fees").B. No Reading of "All the Expenses of the Proceeding" Supports Shifting of Attorneys' FeesAs the en banc court of appeals explained, neither the text nor the legislative history of Section 145 supports the proposition that Congress intended the mere word "expenses" to require an unprecedented departure from the American Rule by shifting the PTO's attorneys' fees to the patent applicant in every case.The issue here is whether the phrase "all the expenses of the proceeding" "expressly" and "clearly" provides for that reimbursement. Courts construing terms in a statute must give those terms their ordinary, contemporary, common-law meaning: "[W]here Congress uses a common-law term in a statute, we14assume the `term ... comes with a common law meaning, absent anything pointing another way.'" Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P'ship, 564 U.S. 91, 101 (2011) (alteration in original) (quoting Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 58 (2007)). Moreover, "[t]hat a definition is broad enough to encompass one sense of a word does not establish that the word is ordinarily understood in that sense." Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.S. 560, 568 (2012).5This proposition is apparent even in Rimini Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 873 (2019), upon which the PTO improbably relies throughout its brief. That opinion interpreted Section 505 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 505, which gives district courts discretion to award "full costs" to the prevailing party in a copyright infringement action. Contrary to the PTO's suggestion, the Court did not expand the definition of that phrase to include such litigation-related expenditures as expert witness, ediscovery, and jury consulting fees. Instead, the Court restricted that definition to sweep in only the six categories of costs that may be awarded against the losing party under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1821 and 1920. See Rimini St., 139 S. Ct. at 878.Here, when Congress first adopted language identical to that in Section 145 in 1839, the words "expense," "cost," and "damage" were considered5 Despite the PTO's citation to it, Taniguchi does not support the PTO's interpretation of Section 145. That opinion held nothing more than that the word "interpreter" in 28 U.S.C. § 1920 does not include costs of a "translator." 566 U.S. at 568. It did not interpret the word "expenses."15synonymous. Nantkwest, Inc. v. Matal, 860 F.3d 1352, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (Stoll, J., dissenting) (citing Peter Mark Roget, Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases 227 (Barnas Sears ed., 1856)). The PTO did not then read "expenses of the proceeding" in that statute as including the pro rata cost of the PTO's staff. Nor did it or anyone else advance that reading after Congress amended the Patent Act in 1870, 1927, or 1952. Not until 2013--nearly 200 years after its original enactment--did the PTO reinterpret Section 145 to include staff salary reimbursement. The PTO's longstanding prior interpretation was the one that fits more naturally with the common understanding of "expenses" as reaching out-of-pocket costs tied to the litigation, not the government-employee salaries.Whenever Congress believed the term "expenses" should include attorneys' fees, it has made that distinction apparent. Indeed, over 200 federal statutes and almost 2000 state statutes provide for shifting of attorneys' fees, Vargo, supra, at 1588, and neither the PTO nor the courts have located a single one that does so by referring only to "expenses." See also NantKwest, Inc. v. Iancu, 898 F.3d 1177, 1188 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (listing twenty independent examples of statutes distinguishing between "expenses" and "attorney's fees"); see also id. at 1195 (noting that the PTO could not identify a single statute that awards to the government prorated portions of its attorneys' salaries without using the phrase "attorneys' fees"). Adopting the PTO's position would16therefore make Section 145 unique among all feeshifting laws.6C. The Mandatory Nature of Section 145 Weighs Against the PTO's Interpretation of the StatuteThat Congress did not design Section 145 to shift fees from one party to the other is also evident from the statute's provision of an award of "the expenses" whether the patent applicant wins or loses. This non-discretionary feature of the statute undermines the proposition that Congress intended the term "expenses" to encompass attorneys' fees. As the Court has explained, "generations of American judges, lawyers, and legislators, with [the American Rule] as the point of departure, would regard it as quite `inappropriate' to award the `loser' an attorney's fee from the `prevailing litigant.'" Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680, 683-84 (1983). Moreover, Section 145 and its predecessors have had this feature from the 1800s. See, e.g., Butterworth v. Hill, 114 U.S. 128, 129-30 (1885) (citing § 4915 Rev.6 Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.S. 369 (2013), relied upon by the PTO throughout its brief, is not to the contrary. In contrast to Section 145's reference to "expenses," the statutory framework at issue in Cloer expressly authorized a permissive award of reasonable attorneys' fees to an unsuccessful petitioner for compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99­660, 100 Stat. 3743 (1986). See 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-15 (providing that "the special master or court may award an amount of compensation to cover [an unsuccessful] petitioner's reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs ... if ... the petition was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought").17Stat.). Yet a Section 145 civil action, as with its predecessor "bill in equity," has long been known as "a suit according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure." Kappos, 566 U.S. at 44 n.4 (quoting Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U.S. 50, 61 (1884)); see also P.J. Federico, Evolution of Patent Office Appeals, 22 J. PAT. OFF. SOC'Y 838, 844 (1940) (explaining the equitable nature of Section 145's predecessor statute). There has been no change to the language of Section 145 that would justify a departure from this longstanding interpretation.As the Court noted in Baker Botts, departures from the American Rule "tend to authorize the award of `a reasonable attorney's fee,' `fees,' or `litigation costs,' and usually refer to a `prevailing party' in the context of an adversarial `action.'" 135 S. Ct. at 2164. By contrast, Section 145: (1) requires only the payment of "expenses," not "fees"; (2) provides for payment only of the government's expenses, never the applicant's; and (3) does so in every Section 145 action, regardless of which party prevails. Any one of these features makes Section 145 unlike any other fee-shifting provision. The presence of all three compels interpreting the provision to exclude attorneys' fees.D. The PTO's Funding and Historical Interpretation of Section 145 Evidence a Lack of Explicit Congressional Authorization of Fee-ShiftingAs explained above, statutes allegedly deviating from the American Rule must "speak directly,"18be "clear and explicit," and "clearly express" how they are meant to stray from the common law. That deviation also must be "evident." Cf. Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952) ("Statutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of longestablished and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident."). It is not enough that the phrase "all the expenses of the proceeding" may be read to include the reimbursement of the pro rata share of PTO staff salaries or could mean that PTO staff salaries are included; rather, the intent to include repayment of staff salaries must be evident.The PTO's own changing interpretation of this language in Section 145 shows that such intent is not clear and explicit. For nearly two centuries, the phrase "expenses of the proceedings" in Section 145 has been understood to mean that the applicant must pay only the PTO's out-of-pocket expenses for the proceedings. The PTO itself has historically not interpreted "expenses" in Section 145 to include attorneys' fees but only typical expenses, such as agency travel costs, expert witness fees, and the like. As the PTO has acknowledged, it did not seek reimbursement of the salaries of its legal staff under Section 145 or its predecessor until 2013. Shammas v. Focarino, 784 F.3d 219, 230 n.4 (4th Cir. 2015). Throughout this time, the PTO sought to recover its actual "expenses," such as travel expenses that its employees incurred travelling to depositions, e.g., Robertson v. Cooper, 46 F.2d 766, 769 (4th Cir. 1931), and expenses for printing briefs and joint appendices on appeal. E.g., Watson v. Allen, 274 F.2d1987, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1959); see also Aktiebolag v. Samuels, No. 89-3127-LFO, 1991 WL 25774, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 1991) (expert witness fees); Cook v. Watson, 208 F.2d 529, 531 (D.C.C. 1953) (printing expenses).If Section 145's requirement that "all the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the party bringing the case" "clearly expressed" an obligation to repay the Office for staff time, the PTO would have come to that understanding well before 2013. Whatever arguments the PTO may employ today to conclude that Section 145 requires applicants to pay staff wages, the fact remains that for over 100 years the PTO read the same words and thought otherwise.That the provision shifts only the PTO's expenses and never the applicant's, also strongly suggests it is not a fee-shifting statute. The PTO is designed to be a self-funding agency that pays its staff without resort to reimbursement of attorneys' fees. It therefore is not a typical litigant that requires an award of attorneys' fees to be made whole. The agency's annual appropriations are determined in accordance with its collection of user fees, which it uses to pay its attorneys and other employees and cover other overhead costs, including those related to litigation. 35 U.S.C. § 42(c)(3)(A). The issue presented by the PTO's interpretation of Section 145 therefore is not the recovery of its investment in an appeal brought under that statute but instead a double recovery from appellants under that section, who already have shouldered their share of the PTO's expenses through payment of their filing fees. Because the PTO already funds virtually all its annual opera-20tions, including attorney and staff expenses, by collecting user fees, such a double recovery is unwarranted.E. The Fourth Circuit Erred in its Shammas DecisionBefore its vacatur, the panel decision below that "expenses" includes attorneys' fees rested heavily on the Fourth Circuit's holding to that effect in Shammas v. Focarino, 784 F.3d 219 (4th Cir. 2015). In interpreting the substantively identical wording of Section 21(b) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b), the Shammas court expressed doubt that the American Rule applies where, as here, the relevant statutory language makes no reference to "prevailing parties." Id. at 222-24. But that does not follow. Fee-shifting statutes generally contain a reference to the "prevailing party." Baker Botts, 135 S. Ct. at 2164. The absence of "prevailing parties" in Section 145 is strong indication that it is not a feeshifting statute at all.Moreover, fundamental principles of statutory construction, including those recognized by the Court as generally applicable to the Lanham Act render Shammas's holding that "expenses" includes attorneys' fees under Section 21(b) of the Lanham Act clear error. In Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714 (1967), this Court held that the then-extant version of the Lanham Act did not contemplate fee awards in litigation brought under it. Specifically, the Court rejected the claim that the ability of prevailing parties to recover "the21costs of the action" under Section 35 of the Act allowed recovery of their attorneys' fees as well:[I]n the Lanham Act, Congress meticulously detailed the remedies available to a plaintiff who proves that his valid trademark has been infringed.... When a cause of action has been created by a statute which expressly provides the remedies for vindication of the cause, other remedies should not readily be implied.... We therefore must conclude that Congress intended § 35 of the Lanham Act to mark the boundaries of the power to award monetary relief in cases arising under the Act. A judicially created compensatory remedy in addition to the express statutory remedies is inappropriate in this context.Id. at 719-21 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted) (citations omitted).Congress responded to Fleischmann Distilling by enacting Pub. L. No. 93-600, 88 Stat. 1955 (1975), which accomplished two things relevant to the issue at hand. The first made certain procedural amendments to Section 21(b), which Congress did while retaining the "all the expenses of the proceeding" language contained in that section. In so acting nearly four decades before the PTO adopted its current position, Congress knew that the PTO historically had not interpreted "all the expenses of the proceeding" to include PTO staff salaries but did nothing to change this language. If Congress sought to expand22the definition of "expenses," it would have said so: "Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change ...." Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978).Second, Pub. L. No. 93-600 amended Section 35 of the Act--the provision identified by Fleischmann as "mark[ing] the boundaries of the power to award monetary relief in cases arising under the Act"--to authorize the imposition of fees upon the losing party in "exceptional cases." 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a). Likewise, following congressional passage of the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1837 (1984), Section 35(b) has made such an award virtually mandatory in cases in which a defendant has been found liable for trafficking in goods or services associated with counterfeit marks. 15 U.S.C. § 1117(b). The Lanham Act's treatment of monetary relief therefore is considerably more "meticulously detailed" now than at the time of Fleischmann Distilling, yet the Act still does not expressly contemplate awards of fees in Section 21(b) appeals. Shammas's extrastatutory recognition of such a remedy therefore flies in the face of the methodology mandated by Fleischmann Distilling.Shammas is also inconsistent with other case law of this Court. The Court has held when interpreting the Lanham Act that "where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same23Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion." KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc., 543 U.S. 111, 118 (2004) (alteration omitted) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)). Here, Congress chose to make attorneys' fees available under the express text of Section 35(a) and Section 35(b) of the Lanham Act but did not make the same choice with respect to Section 21(b)(3). That choice has consequences fatal to the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of the latter statute and the one at issue here: As this Court has observed in interpreting another provision of the Lanham Act, "a court cannot apply its independent policy judgment to recognize a cause of action that Congress has denied ...." Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 128 (2014).24CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, "all the expenses of the proceedings" in 35 U.S.C. § 145 should be interpreted as not authorizing an award of the United States Patent and Trademark Office's attorneys' fees.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: Theodore H.

A.The Copyright Clause Gives Congressthe Power to Restore CopyrightsThe Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution provides that: "The Congress shall have Power to... Promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries..." U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8.The plain language of the Copyright Clause does not limit Congress's power to grant copyrights only to works that are outside the public domain. Petitioners rely on the phrase "for limited times" in support of the proposition that such a meaning should be read into the Copyright Clause. However, it is undisputed that under Section 514 a restored work will receive copyright protection for a limited time since the end point of such protection cannot extend beyond the date on which copyright protection would have expired had the work been protected all along.The historical record shows that Congress -- including the First Congress -- has repeatedly extended copyright protection to works in the public domain. This Court in Eldred v. Ashcrott, 537 U.S. 186, 196 n.3 (2003), after analyzing the historical record surrounding the enactment in 1790 of the first federal copyright statute, concluded that: "the First Congress clearly did confer copyright7protection on works that had already been created." & In 1790, at least some of these works were in the public domain. See Luck's Music Library, Inc. v. Ashcrott, 321 F. Supp. 2d 107, 113-14 (D.D.C. 2004),affd on other grounds, 407 F.3d 1262 (D.C. Cir. 2005); Thomas B. Nachbar, Intellectual Property andConstitutional Norms, 104 COLUM. L. REV. 272, 338 n.284 (2004) ("Nachbar") ("Of the general copyright laws passed by the States during the years of the Articles of Confederation, the laws of two of the States (Maryland and Pennsylvania) never even came into effect; they included reciprocity clauses that were never fulfilled because one State, Delaware, never enacted a general copyright law...").Indeed, the 1790 Act provided federal copyright protection to works that previously were unprotected and in the public domain in at leastthree important ways. First, several states had no operative copyright statutes and therefore nocopyright protection at all.?7 Nachbar at 338 n. 284. Second, seven out of the ten states that did have operative copyright statutes did not protect "maps"6 The Copyright Act of 1790 states: "That from and after the passing of this act, the author and authors of any map, chart, book or books a/ready printed in these United States, being a citizen or citizens thereof... shall have the sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing and vending such map, chart, book or books, for the term of fourteen years." Copyright Act of 1790, ch. 15, 1 Stat. 124, § 1 (emphasis added). 7 This Court has held that no common law post-publication copyright existed before the first Copyright Act. Wheaton v. Peters, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591, 661 (1834).8or "charts," which the 1790 Act did protect. Resp. Br. at 19 n. 7. Third, the 1790 Act extended federal copyright protection even to works previously unprotected for failure to comply with the requisite formalities of state law. Resp. Br. at 19 n. 9. The parallel between the 1790 Act and Section 514 is striking: both provided copyright protection to previously unprotected works as part of an effort to create a more encompassing system of copyright protection.Subsequent Congresses continued to extend copyright protection to works already in the public domain on several occasions. In particular, Congress has enacted two statutes that allowed the President to restore copyrights through proclamations, which allowed the President to restore copyrights to foreign authors for works published within specific time periods even though they were already in the public domain. See Act of Dec. 18, 1919 Pub. L. No. 66-102, 41 Stat. 368 (1919 Amendment") and Emergency Copyright Act of 1941, Pub. L. No. 77-258, 55 Stat. 732 ("Emergency Copyright Act").The 1919 Amendment provided retroactive copyright protection for war-time works from Austria, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy and New Zealand. Presidents Wilson and Harding issued proclamations that restored copyrights to British and German works published during World War I in 1920 and 1922 respectively. See Proclamations of Woodrow Wilson, 41 Stat. 1790 (1920) and Proclamations of Warren Harding, 42Stat. 2271-278 (1922).Similarly, under theEmergency Copyright Act, proclamations wereissued that restored copyright protection to works inthe public domain. See, e.g., Proclamation No. 2608,3 C.F.R. § 2608 (1944) (restoring copyright to UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irelandauthors); Proclamation No. 2722, 3 C.F.R. § 2722(1947) (France); Proclamation No. 2729, 2 C.F.R. §2729 (1947) (New Zealand); Proclamation No. 2863,3 C.F.R. § 2683 (1949) (Australia); Proclamation No.2953, 3 C.F.R. § 2953 (1951) (Finland); Proclamation No. 2958, 3 C.FR. § 2958 (1951) (Italy);Proclamation No. 2963, 3 C.F.R. § 2963 (1952)(Denmark); Proclamation No. 3792, 3 C.F.R. § 3792(1967) (Germany).8Furthermore, in 1993, the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act® restored copyright protection for Canadian and Mexican motion pictures created between January 1, 1978 and February 28, 1989 that had been in the public domain because of a failure to provide the required copyright notice. See Paul Goldstein, GOLDSTEIN ON COPYRIGHT § 18.5 (rev. 3d ed. Supp. 2011).8 Petitioners dismiss these acts of Congress as reflecting Congress's recognition that it would be inappropriate to deny protection to authors who were "temporarily unable to comply with" formalities because of wartime events. Pet'rs' Br. at 40. Similar reasoning would, of course, apply to Section 514's restoration of copyright protection to those works that had fallen into the public domain because the United States and the work's home country did not have copyright relations.9 Pub. L. No. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057 (1993).10In Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. at 212, thisCourt described the importance of such a historicalrecord in the context of its analysis of theconstitutionality of a statute extending the copyrightterm of existing works.Such consistentcongressional practice is entitled to:"very great weight, and when it is remembered that the rights thus established have not been disputed during a period of [over two] centurlies], it is almost conclusive." Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.S. at57, 4 S.Ct. 279. Indeed, "[t]his Courthas repeatedly laid down the principle that a contemporaneous legislative exposition of the Constitution when the founders of our Government and framers of our Constitution were actively participating in public affairs, acquiesced for a long term of years, fixes the construction to be given [theConstitution's] provisions." Myers v.United States, 272 U.S. 52, 175, 47 S.Ct.21, 71 L.Ed. 160 (1926).Eldredv. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. at 218.41B.Section 514 Does Not Violate the FirstAmendment1.Deferential Review -- NotIntermediate Scrutiny -- is theAppropriateStandard of ReviewThis Court's ruling in Eldred provides significant guidance as to the level of scrutiny applicable to Section 514.19 In that case, this Court held that when "Congress has not altered the traditional contours of copyright protection, further First Amendment scrutiny is unnecessary." Eldred v. Asheroft, 537 U.S. at 521. As Hidred makes clear, the reference to the "traditional contours of copyright protection" describes the two First Amendment accommodations built into copyright law: the "idea/expression dichotomy" (We. the principle that federal copyright law "distinguishes between ideas and expression and makes only the latter eligible for copyright protection") and the doctrine of "fair use." Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. at219-220; see 17 U.S.C. §§ 102(b), 107. See also10 Petitioners argued in the court below that a heightenedstandard of review for their First Amendment claims waswarranted because Section 514 exceeded the "traditionalcontours of copyright," citing E/dred, 537 U.S, at 521. DespiteRespondents' arguments to the contrary, the Tenth Circuit heldthat heightened scrutiny was appropriate. Golan v. Gonzales,501 F.3d 1179 (10th Cir. 2007). On remand, the parties agreedthat Section 514 is content neutral, so the court below appliedintermediatescrutinyinassessingthestatute'sconstitutionality. Golan v.

Gonzales, 487 F.3d 697, 700 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that Congress did not transgress constitutional limitations in placing existing and future copyrights in parity, and the two traditional First Amendment safeguards are sufficient to vindicate the speech interests affected); Silvers v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc., 402 F.3d 881, 893 (th Cir. 2005) (Berzon, J., dissenting) (the two built-in First Amendment protections achieve a balance between the free flow of ideas and copyright, and are embedded in the traditional contours ofcopyright protection); Satava v. Lowry, 323 F.3d 805, 807 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that the contours of copyright include Congress's carefully drawnexpression/idea dichotomy); accord Luck's Music Library, 321 F. Supp. 2d at 118-19 (D.D.C. 2004).As this Court further explained, "when speakers assert the right to make other people's speeches . . . , copyright's built-in free speech safeguards are generally adequate to address" any resulting First Amendment concerns. idred, 537 U.S. at 221. Thus, as long as Congress preserves theidea/expression dichotomy and the established "fair use" defense, any incidental burden on expression that copyright protection entails raises no First Amendment concern. It is these two free speech safeguards that define the "traditional contours of copyright protection."The Eldred jurisprudence is consistent with prior case law that has concluded that the Framers of our Constitution intended for copyright protection13 to encourage the creation of First Amendment protected speech:In our haste to disseminate news, it should not be forgotten that the Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression. By establishing a marketable right to the use of one's expression, copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas. Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 558 (1985); see also Eldredy. Ashcroft, 5387 U.S, at 219 (partial quotation); New York Times Co., Ine. v. Tasini, 533 U.S. 488, 495 n.3 (2001)(internal citation omitted) ("Congress' adjustment ofthe author/publisher balance is a permissible expression of the `economic philosophy behind the [Copyright Clausel]' ie, `the conviction that encouragement of individual effort [motivated] by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare.").Section 514 serves precisely these First Amendment goals by protecting the interests of authors who had created works that prior to its enactment were, for a variety of reasons, not protected in the United States. Such core First Amendment concerns are not outweighed by the First Amendment interests of those who do not wish to create their own speech, but only to use, or to continue using, the speech of others. Hidred, 53714 U.S. at 221 (copyright's built-in free speech safeguards are generally adequate to protect the rights of speakers who merely assert the right to make other people's speeches). Section 514 is fully consistent with the idea/expression dichotomy and the doctrine of fair use. Nothing in Section 514 prevents anyone from expressing the ideas found in the copyrighted works in their own words. Nothing in Section 514 prevents anyone from making "fair use" of the copyrighted materials ~ or availing themselves of other exceptions in the copyright law geared towards educational, scholarly and other uses.11 People routinely teach musical works still under copyright: copyrighted musical compositions are played by student bands, orchestras and soloists and sung by choruses and ensembles. There are several exceptions for public performance in Section 110 of the copyright statute, including for in-classroom use and distance education. Eg., 17 U.S.C. Sections 110(1), 110(2). Even where an exception does not apply, there is a flourishing licensing market that enables use of such works on reasonable terms. Public performance of most copyrighted musical works is licensed in the United States by ASCAP and BMI (and, to a lesser extent, SESAC) for their entire repertoire, and such licenses are often taken on an annual basis by performance venues. But no one can be denied such a license. Those licenses tend to be reasonable, as ASCAP and BMI licenses are overseen by rate courts. ASCAP and BMI also license performance of foreign musical compositions (including restored works) on behalf of their foreign counterparts. See Paul Goldstein, GOLDSTEIN ON COPYRIGHT § 7.9 (rev. 3d ed. Supp. 2011). Moreover, Section 115 of the copyright law provides for a statutory license (at a set rate) to make and distribute new sound recordings of restored musical works. Finally, Section 104A(d)(3) assures that reliance parties can continue to use any derivative works (like sound recordings) that they made prior to restoration. Thus, the traditional152.Section 514 Is Narrowly Tailoredto Meet Important GovernmentalObjectivesEven if a heightened level of constitutional scrutiny is applied to Section 514, the statute does not violate the First Amendment because it is a content-neutral statute that "will be sustained under the First Amendment if it advances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests." Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S.180, 189 (1997).The U.S. government actively sought the TRIPS Agreement because it perceived that TRIPS would provide significant advantages for the United States.!2 International piracy was undermining key U.S. industries that relied on intellectual property: the rapid advance of digital technology threatened to exacerbate this problem in an increasingly global market; and the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism for existing treaties "greatly hampered"contours of copyright are fully preserved even with the passage of Section 514, and the incentive to create new material is advanced by restoring copyright protection to those works that have lost protection for reasons such as failure to comply with formalities or national ineligibility. 12 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ("TRIPS"), April 15, 1994, 33 I-L.M. 1199. The goal of the TRIPS Agreement was to incorporate protection for intellectual property within the framework of the principal international trade treaties, relying largely on standards of protection in existing intellectual property treaties.16their effectiveness.Ralph Oman, IntellectualProperty After the Uruguay Round, 42 J.

The agreement was amilestone in international intellectual propertyprotection, providing multilateral protection forintellectual property under a framework thatprovided for minimum standards and a means ofenforcement.Daniel Gervais, THE TRIPSA(3GdREedE.ME2N0T08:). DRAFTING HISTORY AND ANALYSIS § 1.01TRIPS, however, incorporates the standards of protection in the Berne Convention.'3 While the United States had joined the Berne Convention in 1989, it still had not restored copyrights in foreign works, even though the weight of authority indicated that Berne Article 18 required restoration. See, e.g., Silke von Lewinski, INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT LAWAND POLICY 183-84 (2008); Sam Ricketson and JaneC. Ginsburg, INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT AND NEIGHBOURING RIGHTS: THE BERNE CONVENTION AND BEYOND § 6.117 (2d ed. 2006). The United States' position had been roundly criticized by our trading partners. See, eg., Olivia Regnier, Who Framed Article 18? The Protection of pre-1989 Works in the USA Under the Berne Convention, 15 Eur. INTELL.Prop. REV. 400 (1993).Continued adherence to this position threatened to harm the interests of U.S. authors and13 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works art. 18, adopted on Sept. 9, 1886, S. TREATY Doc. No. 9927 (1986), 1161 U.N.T.S. 3 (revised at Paris July 24, 1971).17copyright owners. At a time when digital technologywas taking off and markets were becomingincreasingly international, the U.S. government wasnegotiating new IP agreements, but countries withwhich the United States previously had no priorcopyright relations wanted to protect only those U.S.works newly created after these agreements tookeffect, not existing works.See, eg., GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): IntellectualProperty Provisions: Joint Hearing on H.R. 4894 andS. 2368 Before the Subcomm. on IntellectualProperty and Judicial Admin. of the H. Comm. onthe Judiciary and the Subcomm. on Fatents,Copyrights and Trademarks of the S. Comm. on theJudiciary, 103d Cong., 2d. Sess. 120 (1994)(hereinafter Joint Hearings on the URAA)(statement of Bruce Lehman, Assistant Secretary ofCommerce and Commissioner of Patents andTrademarks).There was also concern that, with theratification of TRIPS, U.S. compliance with theBerne Convention could be successfully challengedin the World Trade Organization. /oint Hearings onthe URAA at 131 (statement of Ira Shapiro, GeneralCounsel, Office of the United States TradeRepresentative) ("it is likely that other WTOmembers wouldchallengethecurrentimplementation of Berne [Article 18] if it is notenlarged."); Katherine 8S. Deters, Retroactivity andReliance Rights Under Article 18 of the BerneCopyright Convention, 24 VAND. J. TRANSNAT'L L.971, 996 (1991) (an international tribunal would18likely find U.S. in violation of its obligations under Berne Article 18).Congress thus faced a landscape in which theconsiderations supporting copyright restoration hadshifted dramatically. Recognizing that TRIPS wouldincorporate the Berne standards of protection and beenforceable through the WTO, Congress and theAdministration had two interrelated goals: ensuringcompliance with Berne Article 18, and thereby withTRIPS, and strengthening protection for U.S.copyright owners abroad.These are clearlylegitimate governmental objectives, and Section 514was narrowly tailored to meet them.Section 514 also protects the interests of reliance parties by providing a significant but limited grace period.!4 The limitation on this grace14 The legislative record indicates that Congress was concerned about copyright restoration and the provisions concerning reliance parties, and scrutinized them carefully. See, e.g., Joint Hearings on the URAA at 3 (statement of Chairman Hughes); Id. at 81-82 (statement of Senator DeConcini). During the legislative process, those provisions were expanded, most notably to preserve the right of derivative works owners to continue to use the underlying works whose copyrights had been restored upon payment of reasonable compensation. Compare H.R. 4894, 103d Cong. 2d Sess. (1994) (proposedSection 104A(d)) with 17 U.S.C. § 104A(d). Legal scholarsindicated that such a change would respond in a significant way to concerns they identified with the draft bills. Joint Hearings on the URAA at 209-10 (statement of Shira Perlmutter, Professor, Catholic University School of Law); id. at 186 (statement of Eugene Volokh, Acting Professor of Law, University of California at Los Angeles).19period is consistent with the opinions of experts ininternational law, who concluded that adheringcountries may not, consistent with Berne Article 18,allow reliance parties to continue their activitieswith respect to restored works indefinitely withoutlimitation.#ig., Sam Ricketson and Jane C.Ginsburg,INTERNATIONALCOPYRIGHTANDNEIGHBOURING RIGHTS: THE BERNE CONVENTION ANDBEYOND § 6.128 (2d ed. 2006) (the transitionalprovisions should be "of limited duration" andeventually the work must be "protected in relation toall persons"); Silke von Lewinski, INTERNATIONALCOPYRIGHT LAW AND POLIcy § 5.248 at 184 (2008).The term for which Section 514 protects reliance interests is well within the mainstream views of our trading partners of appropriate protection for reliance interests when copyrights are restored. See Report of Dr. Mihaly Ficsor at 4 100, Golan v. Gonzales, No. 01-B-1854(BNB), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6800 (D. Colo. 2005) (J.A. at 159-60). In some respects, provisions of Section 514 are more protective of reliance parties than the laws of many other countries; for example, it requires notice to reliance parties before restored copyrights can beenforced against them. 17 U.S.C. § 104A(d)(2). Thisrequirement ensures that reliance parties will not be blindsided by right holders who unexpectedly come forward, and that users will continue to be able to use orphan works. Reliance parties have a year after notice to continue use of the works, id, and they can continue throughout the term of the restored copyright to use any derivative works they20previously created (such as sound recordings based on restored musical compositions) under the terms of the statute. 17 U.S.C. § 104A(d)(3).Congress's objective was to implement Berne and the TRIPS Agreement in a manner that would put U.S. compliance beyond question, so that the United States could obtain the benefits sought from the TRIPS agreement. There was a reasonable basis for Congress to believe that if the United States provided weak and grudging protection for reliance parties with respect to foreign works whose copyrights were restored, so too would other countries with respect to U.S. works, contrary to U.S. economic interests. See, e.g., Joint Hearings on the URAA at 136-7 (statement of Ira Shapiro, General Counsel, Office of the United States TradeRepresentative).Whether or not in hindsight Congress couldhave complied with Berne Article 18 with a provisiongranting broader rights for reliance parties -- and itis not at all clear that it could have done so -- theUnited States was facing a new regime under whichTRIPS compliance could potentially be assessed byan international tribunal, U.S. non-compliance withArticle 18 had received international criticism, andCongress believed compliance with Article 18 byother countries was in the best interests of theUnited States.U.S. compliance with itsinternational treaty obligations is of greatimportance.Congress's decision to comply byadopting a law that is squarely within accepted21 norms for protection of reliance parties, after hearing from the Administration and from experts, was a quintessential legislative decision entitled to substantial deference.CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae American Bar Association requests that the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed, and that a deferential standard of review should be applied with respect to Petitioner's claims.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel STEVEN M.

THE TEXAS HOMOSEXUAL CONDUCT LAW IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE IT INFRINGES INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND IRRATIONALLY SINGLES OUT A DISCRETE GROUP FOR SECOND-CLASS TREATMENT.A. Laws That Criminalize Private, Noncommercial Sexual Conduct Between Consenting Adults Contravene The Rule Of Law.The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law, Tex. Pen. Code § 21.06, and other statutes that criminalize private, noncommercial sexual behavior between consenting adults contravene the rule of law. Conceptually, the "rule of law" is a broad term that encompasses both procedural and substantive limitations on government power. At its core, it requires evenhanded and neutral enforcement of rules that respect the rights of individuals as autonomous beings to live their lives free from arbitrary governmental restraints. See generally Richard H. Fallon, Jr., "The Rule of Law" as a Concept in Constitutional Discourse, 97 Colum. L. Rev. 1 (1997). The American Bar Association (ABA) is committed to advancing the rule of law in the United States and throughout the world. See American Bar Ass'n, Policy & Procedures Handbook 2, Goal VIII (2002).1. The ABA's policies urging the repeal of sodomy laws and prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination reflect a growing consensus that the rule of law does not tolerate intrusions into private, noncommercial sexual conduct between consenting adults or invidious distinctions based on sexual orientation.In 1973, the ABA adopted a policy urging States "to repeal all laws which classify as criminal conduct any form8of noncommercial sexual contact between consenting adults in private, saving only those portions which protect minors or public decorum." App., infra, 1a. That policy represented the culmination of decades of study by States and the legal profession regarding the tension between protecting individual liberty and using the criminal law to regulate noncommercial sexual behavior between consenting adults in the privacy of their homes, particularly when such laws often were enforced arbitrarily to target gay men and lesbians.Beginning after World War II, several state commissions studying criminal sexual offenses, including those in New Jersey, New York, Illinois, and California, published influential reports arguing that private, noncommercial consensual same-sex sexual conduct is not the proper concern of the law. See William N. Eskridge, Jr., Hardwick and Historiography, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 661-662. One well-known report concluded that state laws should distinguish between conduct that merely may offend community morals (e.g., homosexual conduct), and dangerous, aggressive conduct that is an actual threat to the community. See Paul Tappan, The Habitual Sex Offender: Report and Recommendations of the [New Jersey] Commission on the Habitual Sex Offender 17-18 (1950). Those reports were relied and expanded upon by the American Law Institute (ALI) in 1955 in the course of drafting its Model Penal Code. See Model Penal Code § 207.5(1) commentary at 277-278 (Tentative Draft No. 4, 1955).The ALI, under the direction of Herbert Wechsler as Chief Reporter, determined that statutes criminalizing consensual adult sexual conduct undermine the rule of law in at least three ways. First, the ALI concluded that no legitimate government interest warrants criminalizing private conduct between consenting adults that does not harm other people, particularly in light of the intrusive police investigations that would be necessary if the statutes were to be enforced. Id. § 207.5 commentary at 277, 278, 279. As Judge Learned Hand explained during the debate on the question whether to recommend the decriminalization of consensual sodomy: "I think it is a9matter of morals, a matter very largely of taste, and it is not a matter that people should be put in prison about." American Law Institute, Transcript of Proceedings 129 (May 19, 1955). Second, the ALI concluded that sodomy laws criminalize conduct in which many Americans (both heterosexual and homosexual) engage and that respect for the law is undermined by such widespread disregard for a criminal prohibition. See Model Penal Code §§ 207.1, 207.5 commentary at 206, 276 (Tentative Draft No. 4, 1955). Third, it concluded that sodomy laws were being enforced arbitrarily. The large majority of offenders escaped detection, and those who were criminally prosecuted and imprisoned tended to be drawn from racial minority groups. Id. at 205, 278.5 Moreover, sodomy laws created a significant risk of blackmail. Id. at 278-279; see also National Inst. of Mental Health Task Force on Homosexuality, Final Report and Background Papers 6 & n.5 (1972) (estimating more than ten percent of gay men subjected to blackmail).The 1973 ABA policy stemmed from rule-of-law concerns similar to those that motivated the ALI. The ABA policy recommended the repeal of all laws that regulated noncommercial sexual contact between consenting adults in private. App., infra, 1a. The Report supporting adoption of the policy specifically relied upon the ALI's assessment of the high cost that the laws imposed on personal autonomy and the lack of any corresponding benefit to the State. See App., infra, 12a, 14a. The Report also pointed to decisions of this Court, including Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and stated that "there is a serious question of the constitutionality of such statutory prohibitions against5 Historically, the enforcement of criminal sodomy laws often was tainted by racial considerations. See Eskridge, supra, at 649 (in 1880 more than half the people imprisoned for sodomy were people of color in the South); cf. Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 226-227, 232 (1985) (reliance on sodomy convictions was a mechanism for disenfranchising black men).10consensual sodomy." Id. at 13a. The Report noted that another reason for repealing the sodomy laws was that they were "most often applied against homosexuals, both in enforcement of the statutes themselves and as a basis for discrimination against homosexuals on the ground that they are most likely violating the law." Id. at 12a.At the time the ABA adopted the 1973 policy, nine States (Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oregon) already had repealed their criminal laws prohibiting consensual adult sodomy; in another two States (Alaska and Florida), state courts had partially invalidated their laws. See Eskridge, supra, at 686 tbl. In the 30 years since then, such laws have been legislatively repealed or judicially invalidated in all but 13 States. Pet. 4, 24.Since 1973, the ABA has also adopted many policies urging the elimination of sexual orientation discrimination. See pages 2-3, supra. Many leading law firms have implemented nondiscrimination policies that parallel the recommendations of the ABA.6 Law schools likewise have proscribed sexual orientation discrimination in compliance with ABA policy.7 The success of nondiscrimination policies6 For example, a review of forms submitted by law firms to the National Association for Law Placement (NALP) reveals that 81 of the nation's 100 top revenue-producing law firms indicated that they have nondiscrimination polices that expressly apply to sexual orientation. See, e.g., App., infra, 17a-19a. Moreover, several other major law firms, whose responses on their NALP forms did not so indicate, specify on their websites that they have such policies. Cf. Human Rights Campaign Foundation, The State of the Workplace for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Americans 2001, at 5 (59% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted policies to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination); E.J. Graff, Welcoming the Invisible Bar: Lesbian and Gay Attorneys, Diversity & the Bar, June 2002, at 13 (collecting examples, including Texas-based Gardere Wynne Sewell LLP, in which openly gay and lesbian lawyers serve in key management positions in law firms).7 See American Bar Ass'n, Standards for Approval of Law Schools, Standard 210(a) (2002) (requiring ABA-accredited law schools to "foster(Continued on following page)11adopted by legal employers and law schools demonstrates the irrationality of discrimination based on sexual orientation.Finally, state courts across the nation have determined that qualified gay men and lesbians should not be denied admission to the legal profession because of their sexual orientation. In the past, a number of States had excluded known gay men and lesbians from the bar on the rationale that their presumed violation of criminal sodomy laws meant that they did not meet the "good moral character" requirement. See, e.g., Florida v. Kimball, 96 So.2d 825 (Fla. 1957); In re Boyd, 307 P.2d 625 (Cal. 1957); cf. Donald T. Weckstein, Recent Developments in the Character and Fitness Qualifications for the Practice of Law, 40 B. Examiner 17, 20 (1971) (in anticipation of bar's "moral character" requirement, about one-third of law schools would "take a hard look at . . . homosexual activity before admitting an applicant"). But state bars all across the nation, even in States that still criminalize sodomy, have since rejected that rationale and revised their rules and policies to permit gay and lesbian applicants to become licensed attorneys based on the determination that whether one engages in consensual same-sex sodomy does not affect whether one is of "good moral character." See, e.g., Florida Bd. of Bar Exam'rs re N.R.S., 403 So.2d 1315 (Fla. 1981); XIV La. Sup. Ct. R. XVII, § 5(G)(1) (2002). Indeed, not only have all States ceased the practice of excluding gay men and lesbians from the legal profession, but a majority of state courts have adopted policies to protect lesbian and gay lawyers, litigants, and courtand maintain equality of opportunity in legal education . . . without discrimination or segregation on ground of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or sexual orientation" in admissions and hiring); Law School Admission Council, Out & In: Information for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgendered Law School Applicants 3, 6-11 (2001) (reporting that all 178 laws schools that responded to survey had policy prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination and listing 118 law schools with openly gay and lesbian faculty members).12personnel from manifestations of bias and prejudice, in keeping with the ABA's Model Code of Judicial Conduct.82. Despite the improved treatment of many gay men and lesbians in society, and within the legal profession in particular, the retention of criminal laws that single out same-sex conduct continues to encourage irrational discrimination.Laws that criminalize private same-sex intimate conduct, even those not regularly enforced, serve to legitimize discrimination, hatred, and even violence against gay men and lesbians. By branding gay and lesbian citizens as lawbreakers, such laws impose a government-sanctioned stigma that impedes the efforts of gay men and lesbians to obtain equal justice under law. See generally Christopher R. Leslie, Creating Criminals: The Injuries Inflicted by "Unenforced" Sodomy Laws, 35 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 103 (2000); Hillary Greene, Undead Laws: The Use of Historically Unenforced Criminal Statutes in Non-Criminal Litigation, 16 Yale L. & Pol'y Rev. 169 (1997).Despite the progress that has been made in eliminating discrimination within the legal profession and society as a whole, criminal sodomy laws are still cited as a justification for discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans. In a recent study, one law firm in Virginia explained that it does "not employ and would not knowingly employ a homosexual attorney" because sodomy "is a8 More than 30 States, including seven of the States that make sodomy a criminal offense, expressly prohibit judges from manifesting bias or prejudice based on sexual orientation in the performance of their judicial duties. See, e.g., Fla. C.J.C. Canon 3(5) (2002); Idaho C.J.C. Canon 2(C) (2002); Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 601A Canon 3(B)(5) (2002); Miss. C.J.C. Canon 3(B)(5) (2002); Okla.

Report of the District of Columbia Bar Task Force on Sexual Orientation and the Legal Workplace App. C, at 39 cmt. 166 (Mar. 1999). Similarly, the Texas Homosexual Conduct Law has been used to justify opposition to the candidacy of an openly gay justice of the peace. As one member of the candidate's own party argued, "whether you like it or not, there is a state law that prohibits sodomy in the state of Texas, and having a judge who professes to have a lifestyle that violates state law . . . is wrong." Penny Weaver, Pro-Gay Danburg Ousted by Wong, Houston Voice, Nov. 8, 2002, at 1; cf. Childers v. Dallas Police Dep't, 513 F. Supp. 134, 138 (N.D. Tex. 1981) (in suit for employment discrimination, supervisor in Dallas Police Department testified that he told a gay applicant that he would not be hired in part "because his sexual practices violated state law"), aff 'd mem., 669 F.2d 732 (5th Cir. 1982).Criminal sodomy laws are also viewed by some members of society, including some participants in the legal system, as a justification for setting gay men and lesbians apart as second-class citizens not entitled to the same government protections as other members of society. See Leslie, supra, at 123-124. Such attitudes have been exhibited by some members of the judiciary in States that have such laws. For example, in 1988, a Texas judge explained his refusal to impose a life sentence on a defendant convicted of killing two gay men on the ground that "I don't much care for queers cruising the streets [and] . . . [I] put prostitutes and gays at about the same level . . . and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute." Robert B. Mison, Comment, Homophobia in Manslaughter, 80 Cal. L. Rev. 133, 163 (1992). Similarly, a Florida judge presiding over a pre-trial hearing of defendants charged with beating a gay man to death in 1987 asked the prosecutor "That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?" and14when told that it was, responded, "Times really have changed." Ibid.9 Because the existence of sodomy laws reinforces those attitudes, many gay men and lesbians who are crime victims are reluctant to come forward for fear that the focus will be on their status as putative lawbreakers rather than as victims. See Leslie, supra, at 125. That reluctance, in turn, contributes to the fact that gay men and lesbians are frequent victims of hate crimes. See id. at 122; Peter Finn & Taylor McNeil, The Response of the Criminal Justice System to Bias Crime: An Exploratory Review 2, 17 (1987).Thus, even when not enforced, sodomy laws encourage irrational and arbitrary treatment of gay men and lesbians. Declaring Texas's Homosexual Conduct Law unconstitutional will remove that untenable justification for such conduct and will vindicate the rule of law.B. Petitioners' Criminal Convictions Under The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law Violate Liberty and Privacy Interests Protected By The Due Process Clause And Bowers v. Hardwick Therefore Should Be Overruled.The ABA's policy urging repeal of criminal sodomy statutes applies to all such statutes, whether they are facially neutral or targeted at homosexual conduct alone. That 30-year-old policy reflects the principle that intimate,9 See also Sherri Williams, Judicial Reprimand Suggested, ClarionLedger, Dec. 21, 2002, at 2B (reprimand recommended for Mississippi judge who wrote a letter to a newspaper stating "[i]n my opinion, gays and lesbians should be put in some type of mental institute"); State Bar of Arizona Web site, http://www.azbar.org/Sections/Committees/SOGI/ summary.asp (state bar study found that 13% of judges and attorneys have observed negative treatment by judges in open court toward those perceived to be gay or lesbian, 45% have heard negative remarks about a lesbian or gay person in the context of a particular case, and 8% have heard court personnel indicate a preference not to work with a lawyer because he or she is perceived to be gay or lesbian).15sexual conduct between two consenting adults that occurs in the privacy of the home should not be the basis of a criminal conviction absent some truly compelling government interest.10 In Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), however, a sharply divided Court held that "homosexual sodomy" was not protected by the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.Although the doctrine of stare decisis should generally be followed, it "is not an inexorable command," Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 828 (1991) (overruling Booth v. Maryland (1987), and South Carolina v. Gathers (1989)), particularly in constitutional cases, see Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 63 (1996) (overruling Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. (1989)).11 Overruling a prior decision is particularly warranted when "facts, or an understanding of facts, [have] changed from those which furnished the claimed justifications for the earlier constitutional resolution[ ]." Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 863 (1992) (discussing rationale for overruling Lochner v. New York and Plessy v. Ferguson). Viewed in the proper factual context, Bowers' holding is inconsistent with more recent precedents that reaffirm the Constitution's special protections for intimate association, bodily integrity, and activities that occur in the home. Moreover, Bowers rested on an incomplete account of the history surrounding the right at issue and10 In the present case, Texas conceded that it could establish no interest that would meet that requirement. Pet. App. 76a (at oral argument in the state appellate court, respondent's counsel could not "even see how he could begin to frame an argument that there was a compelling State interest").11 See also Ring v.

Ball (1985)); United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688 (1993) (overruling Grady v. Corbin (1990)); Payne, 501 U.S. at 828 n.1 (collecting cases from prior 20 Terms overruling 33 constitutional decisions).16inaccurate factual assumptions about the lives and family relationships of gay men and lesbians. Finally, Bowers cannot be reconciled with the Court's more recent decision in Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996). For all these reasons, Bowers should be overruled.1. Bowers should be overruled because the weight of this Court's modern precedents supports the conclusion that the right of consenting adults to engage in intimate human conduct implicates a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause and a more complete account of the history of sodomy laws supports that view.In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), this Court identified two "lines of decisions" in which the Court, for more than a hundred years, has recognized that the substantive component of the Due Process Clause protects "liberty relating to intimate relationships" and "personal autonomy and bodily integrity." Id. at 857; see also Cruzan v. Missouri Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 287-288 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (citing, inter alia, Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891)). In determining whether an adult's right to engage in private consensual, intimate conduct is a component of liberty protected as a substantive matter by the Due Process Clause, the Court need only look to those lines of decisions, particularly to Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), and Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977).In Griswold, the Court held that the State could not prohibit married couples from using contraception and thus concluded that the State could not require married couples to refrain from non-procreative sexual activity. Carey extended that holding to unmarried persons. While the majority in Carey framed that right in terms of the "right to decide to prevent conception" and disclaimed any17broader holding, 431 U.S. at 688 n.5, the Court's ruling did not protect merely a right to abstain from sexual relations. Rather, that decision and Griswold mean that adults have a right to be free of state interference in deciding whether and how to conduct their intimate sexual relationships. Justice Powell acknowledged as much in describing the right at issue as "the constitutionally protected privacy in decisions concerning sexual relations." Id. at 711 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).By characterizing Griswold and Carey as involving only the right not to procreate, Bowers failed to capture the full scope of the right at issue in those cases. As the Court has since explained in Casey, those opinions and their predecessors were rooted in the second Justice Harlan's conclusion that the Due Process Clause includes "a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints." 505 U.S. at 848 (quoting Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds)). The same ruleof-law principles of individual autonomy and privacy that informed the recommendations of the ALI and ABA to repeal criminal sodomy laws are reflected in the Casey Court's conclusion that matters "involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment." Id. at 851. Because Griswold and Carey establish that substantive due process protects the right of consenting adults to engage in intimate sexual conduct in the privacy of their homes, this Court should overrule Bowers and hold that the Texas Homosexual Conduct Law violates the Constitution.Bowers sought to distinguish those lines of cases by describing the interest at stake as the right to engage in "homosexual sodomy" and by suggesting that the long history of sodomy laws militates against constitutional protection of that right. But Bowers did not address the significance of the fact that it was not until the mid-20th Century that sodomy laws singled out same-sex intimate conduct. Historically, States prohibited certain forms of18sexual conduct among all adults, including both homosexual and heterosexual, both married and single. In 1868, the year of the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification, 32 of the then-37 States criminalized sodomy. See Bowers, 478 U.S. at 193. In all but one of those States, the criminal prohibition of sodomy included conduct engaged in by different-sex couples.12 The laws were focused on particular conduct, rather than the identity of the participants. Indeed, under those laws, even the conduct of married couples could be punished. See John May, The Law of Crimes § 203 (2d ed. 1893) ("Sodomy . . . may be committed . . . by a man with a woman ­ his wife, in which case, if she consent, she is an accomplice."); Honselman v. People, 48 N.E. 304, 305 (Ill. 1897) ("this is a crime committed between two persons both of whom consent, and it may even be committed by husband and wife").Bowers provided no reasoned basis for disregarding that history of equivalent treatment of same-sex and different-sex sodomy and redefining the liberty interest at issue in a way that excludes intimate sexual conduct engaged in by persons of the same sex. More fairly viewed, the historical practice of criminalizing sodomy between consenting adults in private is essentially incompatible12 Between 1791 and 1868, no State enacted a law that "singled out sexual acts between men for special prohibition." Anne B. Goldstein, History, Homosexuality, and Political Values, 97 Yale L.J. 1073, 1084 (1998). Sodomy laws enacted prior to 1791 in Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, arguably prohibited only male-male conduct. See id. at 1082 n.60. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, however, two of those three States had amended their criminal sodomy laws so that they applied to male-female couples as well. See id. at 1084 nn.66 & 68 (laws of Connecticut and Massachusetts were amended in 1821 and 1805, respectively, in ways that made clear that sodomous conduct was proscribed for all couples). Indeed, there is some indication that the laws in those States had always prohibited male-female sodomy, as similar prohibitions had been interpreted to include sodomous conduct between a man and a woman. See The King v. Wiseman, 92 Eng. Rep. 774, 775 (K.B. 1716).19with the two "lines of decisions" identified in Casey, 505 U.S. at 857, and exemplified by Griswold and Carey. The holdings of those cases should control here.2. Bowers should be overruled because it relied upon an improper narrowing of the Constitution's special protections for family and the home.To deny same-sex couples constitutional protection from criminal prosecution for their private sexual conduct is also inconsistent with the decisions of the Court that recognize the heightened protection that the Constitution provides for conduct that takes place in the home. See Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 37 (2001) ("In the home, our cases show, all details are intimate details, because the entire area is held safe from prying government eyes."); Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 630 (1886) ("[i]t is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes the essence of the [constitutional] offence, but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty, and private property"); see also Griswold, 381 U.S. at 485-486; Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 565 (1969). The precincts of the home are no less inviolate when those residing within are gay or lesbian.Bowers also relied upon inaccurate factual assumptions about the family relationships of gay men and lesbians. In so doing, Bowers discounted the effect on families of laws criminalizing private, consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex. In Bowers, the Court said that "[n]o connection between family, marriage, or procreation, on the one hand, and homosexual activity, on the other, has been demonstrated." 478 U.S. at 191. But since Bowers was decided, that connection has been well documented.It is now known that hundreds of thousands of gay men and lesbians have stable relationships, are parents, and raise their children in a family setting. See D'Vera Cohn, Count of Gay Couples Up 300%, Wash. Post, Aug.2022, 2001, at A3 (Census Bureau reports 1.2 million people indicated in 2000 census that they live with a same-sex "unmarried partner"); Dan Black et al., Demographics of the Gay and Lesbian Population in the United States: Evidence from Available Systematic Data Sources, 37 Demography 139, 150 (May 2000) (estimating, based on 1990 census data, that about 22% of partnered lesbians and 5% of partnered gay men are raising children in their home); cf. American Academy of Pediatrics, Technical Report: Coparent or Second-Parent Adoption by Same-Sex Parents, 109 Pediatrics 341 (Feb. 2002) (at least one million children in the United States, and likely many more, have at least one gay or lesbian parent). The Constitution protects families from state interference, see Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), even when the family in question is not a "traditional" one. See id. at 98 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 506 (1977) (plurality) (overturning criminal conviction on substantive due process grounds because "the Constitution prevents East Cleveland from standardizing its children ­ and its adults ­ by forcing all to live in certain narrowly defined family patterns").Through its policies urging nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in adoption, child custody, and visitation, the ABA has repeatedly acknowledged the importance of ensuring that the laws do not undermine the stability of families formed by gay and lesbian couples. See page 2, supra; see also American Law Institute, Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution § 2.12(d) & (e) (2002) (recommending that States prohibit judges from considering sexual orientation or extramarital sexual conduct in determining legal custody of children); id. § 2.12 cmt. f reporter's notes (collecting studies showing that "there is no correlation between a parent's sexual identity and that of the child, and no diminution in measures of self-esteem or social adjustment" based on the sexual orientation of the parents; that "being raised by a homosexual parent is no worse for a child than being raised by a heterosexual parent"; and that "gay men and lesbians are no more likely to molest children than heterosexual adults"). Similarly, the21legal profession and corporate America now provide health and other benefits (including adoption leave) to gay men and lesbians for their domestic partners and their children.13 Local governments have established domestic partnership registries and offer a range of benefits to gay and lesbian families, even in States with sodomy laws.14As noted above, when the facts upon which a decision is premised have changed, or new information is brought to light, it is appropriate for the Court to revisit that decision. See p. 15, supra. Thus, as Justice Brandeis explained, "in cases involving [the application of the substantive component of the Due Process Clause], this court must, in order to reach sound conclusions, feel free to bring its opinions into agreement with experience and with facts newly13 For example, 57 of the nation's top revenue-producing law firms that reported to NALP that they prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, see note 6, supra, and App., infra, 17a-19a, also indicated that they provide benefits to the same-sex partners of their employees. Moreover, as is the case with policies of nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation, see note 6, supra, a number of other major law firms provide more detailed information on their websites specifying that they offer such benefits. See also Two Firms Rated Best for Working Moms, N.Y. Lawyer, http://www.nylawyer.com/news/02/10/ 100102r.html, Oct. 1, 2002 (discussing firms offering adoption leave that affirmatively includes gay and lesbian attorneys); Mark Hansen, Bolstering Benefits, 84 A.B.A.J. 32 (1998) (before offering health and other benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees, the Houston firm of Vinson & Elkins "surveyed other firms it regards as its peers, only to learn that many already offer such coverage"). Law schools likewise are providing such benefits to their employees and students. See Law School Admission Council, supra, at 6-11. Those actions reflect a more general trend in corporate policies. See Human Rights Campaign Foundation, supra, at 18 (reporting that 4,285 employers in all 50 States provide domestic partner health insurance benefits to same-sex partners).14 See, e.g., Human Rights Campaign Foundation, supra, at 11-12, 15 (listing cities and counties that offer domestic partner health benefits and/or have domestic partner registries in Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas, all of which have sodomy laws).22ascertained." Burnet v. Coronado Oil Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), quoted with approval in Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 266 (1986).3. Bowers should be overruled because it is inconsistent with Romer v. Evans.In Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), the Court held that a State violated the Equal Protection Clause by enacting a provision that was justified solely by a desire to deny gay men and lesbians the rights enjoyed by other citizens. Romer's holding that the mere desire "to make [gay men and lesbians] unequal to everyone else" was not a legitimate governmental interest, id. at 635, is inconsistent with Bowers' holding that the "belief of a majority of the electorate in Georgia that homosexual sodomy is immoral and unacceptable" was sufficient to justify a criminal sodomy law, 478 U.S. at 196. As the dissenting Justices in Romer observed, the majority's decision in Romer cannot be reconciled with the decision in Bowers. See 517 U.S. at 640-642 (Scalia, J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Thomas, J.). Respondent admits as much when it asserts that Bowers permits a State to fine or imprison a homosexual for engaging in sodomy, but concedes (Br. in Opp. 19) that Romer would not permit a State to discourage an individual from engaging in sodomy by denying a "practicing homosexual[ ]" the opportunity to attend a public university. Given the inconsistency between Bowers and the subsequent decision in Romer, Bowers should be overruled. See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 235-236 (1997) ("[S]tare decisis does not prevent us from overruling a previous decision where there has been a significant change in or subsequent development of our constitutional law.").Romer applied long-settled Equal Protection Clause principles and has been cited with approval by the Court in a variety of settings. See, e.g., Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 799 (1997); Columbia Union Coll. v. Clark, 527 U.S. 1013, 1015 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting from the denial of certiorari).23Bowers has not fared as well. Lower courts have struggled with the scope of Bowers' holding, particularly after Romer. See, e.g., Marcum v. McWhorter, 308 F.3d 635, 645 (6th Cir. 2002) (Clay, J., concurring in judgment); Sterling v. Burough of Minersville, 232 F.3d 190, 194-195 (3d Cir. 2000); Stemler v. City of Florence, 126 F.3d 856, 873-874 (6th Cir. 1997); Nabozny v. Podlesny, 92 F.3d 446, 458 & n.12 (7th Cir. 1996); James v. Douglas, 941 F.2d 1539, 1543 (11th Cir. 1991). A number of state courts have rejected the reasoning of Bowers as inconsistent with ruleof-law norms. See Jegley v. Picado, 80 S.W.3d 332 (Ark. 2002); Powell v. State, 510 S.E.2d 18 (Ga. 1998); Gryczan v. State, 942 P.2d 112 (Mont. 1997); Campbell v. Sundquist, 926 S.W.2d 250 (Tenn. Ct. App.), appeal denied (Tenn. 1996); Commonwealth v. Wasson, 842 S.W.2d 487 (Ky. 1992).Indeed, the majority opinions of this Court have not embraced Bowers. In addition to the notable absence of any reference to Bowers in the Court's opinion in Romer, Bowers' analysis has not been relied upon in any majority opinion in a case involving the definition of "liberty" for purposes of substantive due process. Cf. Casey, 505 U.S. at 855 (discussing constitutional decisions that were overruled by the Court because related principles of law had developed that "left the old rule no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine"). Nor has the holding of Bowers given rise to any individual or societal reliance that would warrant its retention despite its flaws. Cf. id. at 856, 858 (declining to overrule Roe v. Wade, "[e]ven on the assumption that the central holding of Roe was in error," because, in part, "people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail"). In the years since Bowers was handed down, its reasoning has been steadily undermined by subsequent legal developments in the States. Numerous States have repealed or invalidated24their criminal sodomy laws. See Pet. 24.15 Thirteen States and hundreds of localities have enacted civil rights protections for gay men and lesbians in their stead.In light of the Court's more recent decision in Romer holding that a desire to deny gay men and lesbians the rights enjoyed by other citizens is not a legitimate government interest, as well as the actions by States verifying the conclusion of Romer ­ decriminalizing sodomy, protecting gay men and lesbians from discrimination, and providing health and other benefits for the families of gay men and lesbians ­ Bowers should be overruled. That is particularly so because Bowers was "decided by the narrowest of margins, over spirited dissents challenging the basic underpinnings" of that decision, has "been questioned by Members of the Court in later decisions and [has] defied consistent application by the lower courts." Payne, 501 U.S. at 828-830.15 Similar developments have taken place at the international level. Article 17(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits signatories from engaging in "arbitrary or unlawful interference with [a person's] privacy, family, home or correspondence." 999 U.N.T.S. at 177. That provision is construed by the United Nations Human Rights Committee to prohibit a signatory from criminalizing consensual sodomy. See Toonen v. Australia, U.N. GAOR, Hum. Rts. Comm., 50th sess., 448th mtg. ¶¶ 8.2-8.6, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/50/D/ 488/1992 (1994). Moreover, Article 26 of the Covenant, which requires that each country's law "guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status," 999 U.N.T.S. at 179, is construed to proscribe discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. See Toonen ¶ 8.7. The Covenant was ratified by the United States in 1992. See 138 Cong. Rec. 8070-8071 (1992). A determination that the Texas Homosexual Conduct Law violates the Constitution would, in addition to comporting with rule-of-law principles underlying American jurisprudence, also bring the United States into compliance with its international commitments.25C. Petitioners' Criminal Convictions Under The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law Violate The Equal Protection Clause.Even if the Court determines that Bowers should not be overruled, the judgment of the Texas Court of Appeals should be reversed because the Texas Homosexual Conduct Law is based on a classification that is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and thus violates the Equal Protection Clause. This issue was not addressed in Bowers, see 478 U.S. at 196 n.8, but is particularly pertinent in this case because, unlike the facially neutral law in Bowers, the Texas Homosexual Conduct Law expressly applies only to homosexual conduct.1. The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law discriminates against gay men and lesbians by criminalizing conduct by same-sex couples that is not criminal when engaged in by different-sex couples.The Equal Protection Clause is designed to prevent legislative excesses by requiring "the democratic majority to accept for themselves and their loved ones what they impose on you and me." Cruzan v. Missouri Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 300 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring); see also Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New York, 336 U.S. 106, 112 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring) ("[T]here is no more effective practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable government than to require that the principles of law which officials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally."). The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law violates that fundamental tenet of the rule of law by substantially limiting gay and lesbian couples from engaging in sexual intimacy but permitting heterosexuals (married or single) to engage in intimate acts that Texas concedes are the "same act[s]" that are prohibited for homosexuals. Br. in Opp. 18. Those acts are defined by Texas law as "deviate sexual intercourse" regardless of who engages in them, see Tex. Pen. Code § 21.01(1), but26Texas criminalizes the conduct only when it is engaged in by same-sex couples.That disparate treatment of homosexual and heterosexual sodomy is a modern development that reflects the unwillingness of the majority to be subject to the same strictures imposed upon the minority. See p. 18, supra. In 1962, when the ALI recommended the repeal of all criminal sodomy laws involving consenting adults, every State had a criminal law that prohibited all sodomy, regardless of the sex or sexual orientation of the couples involved. See Christopher R. Leslie, Creating Criminals: The Injuries Inflicted by "Unenforced" Sodomy Laws, 35 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 103, 111 (2000). It was only in 1969, in response to that recommendation, that a State (Kansas) decriminalized sodomy for heterosexuals but not for same-sex couples. Seven other States (Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas) then followed suit and redefined their sodomy laws to single out same-sex conduct. See William N. Eskridge, Jr., Hardwick and Historiography, 1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 664, 691.16The partial repeals in those eight States thus attempted to cure the ALI's rule-of-law objection that the State was regulating private intimate conduct ­ conduct that was "anything but uncommon" among the heterosexual majority. American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries § 213.2 cmt. at 363 (1980). In singling out gay men and lesbians, however, those States violated another rule-of-law requirement articulated by the ALI,16 Besides the Texas statute, only two States (Kansas and Missouri) still have in effect sodomy statutes that, on their face, criminalize only same-sex sodomy. Nevada repealed its same-sex sodomy statute in 1993; courts in Arkansas, Kentucky, Montana, and Tennessee invalidated their same-sex sodomy laws on state constitutional grounds after Bowers. See Eskridge, supra, at 633 n.11, 686 tbl. The sodomy law in Oklahoma, although written to encompass both heterosexual and homosexual sodomy, currently applies only to homosexual sodomy due to the judicial invalidation of the statute as it applied to heterosexual couples. See Post v. State, 715 P.2d 1105 (Okla. Crim. App. 1986).27namely the evenhanded application of the criminal law. The discriminatory intent behind those changes was clear. For example, Arkansas repealed its general sodomy law in 1975 as part of a comprehensive criminal code revision (as recommended by the ALI's Model Penal Code and the ABA), but in 1977 enacted a new law prohibiting only same-sex sodomy. See Eskridge, supra, at 664, 687 tbl. The chief sponsor of the law claimed at the time that the new law was "aimed at weirdos and queers." Petition for Certiorari in Limon v. Kansas, No. 02-583, at 5 (Oct. 2002).2. Under the Equal Protection Clause, the desire to harm and stigmatize members of a group, such as gay men and lesbians, is not a legitimate governmental interest.The Equal Protection Clause provides that the State may not treat an individual differently from similarly situated individuals absent a rational basis for the differential treatment. See Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam). The classification created by the Texas Homosexual Conduct Law is not rationally related to any legitimate governmental objective. Respondent suggests that the law encourages "marriage" and "biological reproduction." Br. in Opp. 18. But there is no relationship between those interests and the classification at issue, which allows some unmarried people (heterosexuals) to engage in non-procreative intimate relationships while prohibiting other unmarried people (gay and lesbian couples) from engaging in the very same conduct. Cf. Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 447 n.7, 453-454 (1972) (even if State had power to prohibit distribution of contraceptives to all persons, State has no rational basis for prohibiting distribution of contraceptives only to unmarried persons).Respondent also invokes tradition and history. Br. in Opp. 18-19. But those arguments cannot sustain the classification embodied in Texas's law, which criminalizes only homosexual sodomy and permits the heterosexual28sodomy that had, as a historical matter, been equally disfavored by the law. See page 18, supra. Rather than justifying the classification under the Equal Protection Clause, this deviation from historical practice should trigger a more "careful consideration" to determine whether it is "obnoxious to the constitutional provision." Romer, 517 U.S. at 633 (quoting Louisville Gas & Elec. Co. v. Coleman, 277 U.S. 32, 37-38 (1928)).Ultimately, the only rationale relied upon by Texas for prohibiting homosexuals from engaging in "the same act" that is lawful for heterosexuals is the "communal belief that the [homosexual] conduct is wrong and should be discouraged." Br. in Opp. 18, 19.17 But that belief is not sufficient. As the Court held in Romer, mere disapproval of homosexuality does not constitute a "legitimate governmental purpose" for "singling out a certain class of citizens for disfavored legal status or general hardships." 517 U.S. at 634, 633. "[I]f the constitutional conception of `equal protection of the laws' means anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest." Ibid. (quoting Department of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973)); see also City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985). Indeed, exercises of government power based on considerations "such as17 Respondent also describes this "communal belief " in terms of "public morality." Br. in Opp. 15, 16, 18. But respondent's use of that label to describe the government interest does not negate the Court's obligation to determine whether the statutory classification is rooted in bias or prejudice. Experience teaches that prejudice sometimes is clothed in moral terms. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 3 (1967) (lower court relied upon the "fact that [God] separated the races" to "show[ ] that he did not intend for the races to mix" in upholding antimiscegenation law); Moreno, 413 U.S. at 535 n.7 (adverse treatment of households of unrelated persons originally defended on moral grounds). In this case, from its origins and effects, the Texas Homosexual Conduct Law leaves little doubt that the State's asserted interest in serving "public morality" is in reality nothing more than a desire to express its disapproval of gay people through the criminal law.29caprice, passion, bias, and prejudice are antithetical to the rule of law." TXO Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Res. Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 475 (1993) (O'Connor, J., dissenting).18Texas thus has failed to articulate a legitimate governmental interest that is served by its Homosexual Conduct Law. Yet even if such an interest could be identified, Texas's conceded practice of "rarely, if ever, enforc[ing]" the law criminally, State v. Morales, 826 S.W.2d 201, 203 (Tex. App. 1992), rev'd on jurisdictional grounds, 869 S.W.2d 941 (Tex. 1994), undermines any claim that the law actually furthers that interest. See Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 312-313 (1972) (White, J., concurring) ("common sense and experience tell us that seldomenforced laws become ineffective measures for controlling human conduct" and thus the decision to apply law to only a few individuals makes the government's interest "too attenuated"); id. at 310 (Stewart, J., concurring) (similar); cf. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. v. Browning, 310 U.S. 362, 369 (1940) ("Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy . . . are often . . . truer than the dead words of the written text.").The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law renders gay men and lesbians strangers to the law and brands them criminals for engaging in the same intimate consensual conduct that is lawful for the majority. Such misuse of the criminal18 The criminal sodomy law at issue here shares another common feature with the state enactment held unconstitutional in Romer. The provision in Romer barred localities from enacting statutes protecting gay men and lesbians from discrimination; state sodomy laws can serve as a functional bar to the enactment of laws prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination or hate crimes, particularly at the local level. As petitioners recount (Pet. 14-16), the existence of sodomy laws skews the political process by permitting opponents of these laws to label gay men and lesbians as criminals who should not be entitled to invoke the protections of the government and thus interferes with normal democratic processes. Cf. United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152-153 n.4 (1938); Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 737 (1997) (O'Connor, J., concurring).30sanction is antithetical to the rule of law, which "implies equality and justice in its application." Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 171 (1972). The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law should be declared unconstitutional.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the Texas Court of Appeals should be reversed.Respectfully submitted,ALFRED P.

Under Section 45 of the federal Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1127 (2012), "[t]he term `trademark' includes any word, name, symbol . . . to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique4product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown"; the same statute contains a substantively identical definition of "service mark."4 Pursuant to the Act, the owner of either type of mark may seek to register it on one of two "registers" maintained by the USPTO, namely, the Principal Register and the Supplemental Register--often referred to as "federal registration" of a trademark. This case arises from an application to register a service mark on the Principal Register.Section 2 of the Lanham Act, id. § 1052, prohibits the registration on the Principal Register of certain marks and certain claimed marks.5 Of great-4 Courts, practitioners, and commentators typically use "marks" as shorthand references to both trademarks and service marks.5 Among the most commonly invoked grounds for unregistrability under Section 2 are that the claimed mark is deceptive, 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a), is likely to be confused with another party's prior-registered or prior-used mark, id. § 1052(d), is merely descriptive and lacks acquired distinctiveness, id. § 1052(e)(1), or is functional. Id. § 1052(e)(5). A claimed mark may be found unregistrable under these or the other provisions of Section 2 in three contexts: (1) an examiner assigned to an application to register the mark can reject the application, in which case the applicant can appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (the "Board"), an administrative tribunal within the USPTO, 15 U.S.C. § 1070; (2) another party can challenge the application in an "opposition proceeding" before the Board, id. § 1063; and (3) even if the application matures into a registration, the registration can be canceled by a court or the Board for any reason that would have prevented its issuance in the first place, id. § 1064(1); after that, it can be canceled "[a]t any time if the registered mark becomes the generic name for the goods or services, or a portion thereof, for which it is registered, or is5est significance to this case, Section 2(a) prohibits the registration of any mark that "may disparage . . . persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute." Id. § 1052(a). But that prohibition is only one of many found in Section 2.The court of appeals' opinion in this case confuses the distinguishable concepts of mark validity, on the one hand, and mark registrability, on the other. The court properly acknowledged its past holdings that a determination of unregistrability on the Principal Register does not restrict a mark owner's ability to use that mark in commerce, but its treatment of the issue in this case may improperly suggest the question is an open one: It is not. Likewise, the court of appeals erred in suggesting such a determination necessarily renders an otherwise valid mark wholly ineligible for protection under the Lanham Act and the common law. Finally, although the court of appeals properly held that nonregistrants are disadvantaged in litigation to protect their marks vis-à-vis their registrant counterparts, it understated those disadvantages in certain respects.functional, or has been abandoned, or its registration was obtained fraudulently or contrary to . . . [Section 2(a)-(c)] . . . ." Id. § 1064(3).6I. THE UNREGISTRABILITY OF A MARK DOES NOT RESTRICT THE MARK OWNER'S ABILITY TO USE THE MARK IN COMMERCEBeginning with In re McGinley, 660 F.2d 481 (C.C.P.A. 1981), the court of appeals and its predecessor, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, have long recognized that the ineligibility of a mark for registration does not prevent the mark's use in commerce. See id. at 484 ("[I]t is clear that the PTO's refusal to register appellant's mark does not affect his right to use it. No conduct is proscribed, and no tangible form of expression is suppressed."); see also In re Fox, 702 F.3d 633, 635 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("[A] refusal to register a mark has no bearing on the applicant's ability to use the mark . . . ."). Nevertheless, after citing McGinley favorably for this point, the court of appeals immediately noted that "[m]ore than thirty years have passed since the decision in McGinley, and in that time both the McGinley decision and our reliance on it have been widely criticized." In re Tam, 808 F.3d 1321, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (en banc), as corrected (Feb. 11, 2016), cert. granted sub nom. Lee v. Tam, No. 15-1293, 2016 WL 1587871 (U.S. Sept. 29, 2016). This observation could be misread as suggesting that commentators have criticized this particular aspect of McGinley, rather than McGinley's ultimate constitutional holding. In fact, as the court of appeals acknowledged later in its opinion, the universally accepted actual rule remains that "a trademark owner may use its mark in commerce even without federal registration . . . ." Id. at 1340; see also Patsy's Italian Rest. v. Banas, 658 F.3d 254, 267 (2d Cir. 2011) ("[T]he lack7of a federal registration does not prevent [the parties] from expanding as they so desire, so long as they respect each other's existing rights."); Drew Jurgensen, When All You Have is a Hammer, Everything Looks Like a Nail In Re Tam and the Federal Circuit's Conflation of Federal Trademark Registration and the First Amendment, 98 J. PAT. & TRADEMARK OFF. SOC'Y 512, 515 (2016) ("[D]enial of federal registration does not prevent a mark owner from using their mark."). Thus, despite the court of appeals' apparent hesitation about the continued viability of the McGinley rule, a mark owner whose mark cannot be registered on account of Section 2(a) is not deprived of the ability to use its mark in commerce.II. ONLY INVALID MARKS ARE BOTH UNREGISTRABLE AND UNPROTECTABLEReferring to the cause of action available to protect unregistered marks provided by Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) (2012), the court of appeals observed that "it is not at all clear that [an applicant denied registration under Section 2(a)] could bring a § 43(a) unfair competition claim." 808 F.3d at 1344 n.11. Indeed, one member of the court of appeals would have gone still further to hold that "§ 43(a) protection is only available for unregistered trademarks that could have qualified for federal registration." In re Tam, 785 F.3d 567, 576 (Fed. Cir.) (additional views of Moore, J.) (citations omitted), reh'g en banc granted, opinion vacated, 600 F. App'x 775 (Fed. Cir. 2015), rev'd, 808 F.3d 1321, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (en banc), as corrected (Feb. 11, 2016), cert. granted sub nom. Lee v. Tam, No. 15-81293, 2016 WL 1587871 (U.S. Sept. 29, 2016). Both propositions are incorrect.A. The Grounds for Mark Unregistrability and Mark Invalidity are Not Coextensive, and the Mere Absence of a Federal Registration Does Not Unleash the Mark to Public UseSome grounds for the denial or cancellation of a federal registration of a mark also render the mark ineligible for protection as a mark. For example, if the registration of a mark is canceled because the underlying mark has become generic, the rights to the mark are invalidated along with the registration. See Park `N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 194 (1985) ("Generic terms are not registrable, and a registered mark may be canceled at any time on the grounds that it has become generic."); Del. & Hudson Canal Co. v. Clark, 80 U.S. 311, 323 (1871) ("Nor can a generic name . . . be employed as a trade-mark and the exclusive use of it be entitled to legal protection."). Moreover, the same is true if the ground for cancellation is that the underlying mark is functional or if it has been abandoned. See, e.g., Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co., 514 U.S. 159, 164 (1995) ("The functionality doctrine prevents trademark law, which seeks to promote competition by protecting a firm's reputation, from instead inhibiting legitimate competition by allowing a producer to control a useful product feature."); Specht v. Google Inc., 747 F.3d 929, 934-35 (7th Cir. 2014) (affirming finding of abandonment as a matter of law for mark not used for over a decade).9Nevertheless, a determination that an otherwise valid mark is unregistrable does not in and of itself disqualify that mark for protection under the Lanham Act, the common law, or state law causes of action such as the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act.6 For example, because federal registration is not a prerequisite for a cause of action under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, courts have routinely recognized the eligibility for protection under that statute of certain designations not qualifying for federal registration. Those include trade names, the unregistrability of which is well established, but which, as this Court has recognized, are still protectable against infringement. See Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc., 537 U.S. 418, 428 (2003) ("Traditional trademark infringement law is a part of the broader law of unfair competition. That law broadly prohibits uses of trademarks, trade names, and trade dress that are likely to cause confusion about the source of a product or service." (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).7 They likewise include the titles of indi-6 See, e.g., Eckles v. Atlanta Tech. Grp., 485 S.E.2d 22, 24 (Ga. 1997) ("In Georgia, [an unregistrable-in-the-USPTO] trade name is protected by the common law and by several statutes. One of those statutes is the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA) . . . .").7 See also Accuride Int'l, Inc. v. Accuride Corp., 871 F.2d 1531, 1534 (9th Cir. 1989) ("The major legal distinction between trademarks and trade names is that trade names cannot be registered and are therefore not protected under 15 U.S.C. § 1114. However, analogous actions for trade name infringement can be brought under section 43(a)." (citation omitted)); Walt-W. Enters. v. Gannett Co., 695 F.2d 1050, 1054 n.6 (7th Cir. 1982) ("Although trade names . . . are not registrable under the Lanham Act, an action for trade name infringement is nonetheless proper under [Section 43(a)]." (citation omitted)).10vidual creative works, which are similarly unregistrable but can be protected under Section 43(a).8 And, as an additional example, they encompass reproductions of the United States flag, which are barred from the Principal Register by Section 2(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1052(b), but infringements of which are actionable. See Bros. of the Wheel M.C. Exec. Council, Inc. v. Mollohan, 909 F. Supp. 2d 506, 542 (S.D. W. Va. 2012) (noting availability of protection under Section 43(a) for flag design even if design unregistrable).Moreover, it is well established that the cancellation of an existing registration does not in and of itself invalidate all rights in the underlying mark. 3 J. THOMAS MCCARTHY, MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION § 19:3 (4th ed.). As the Tenth Circuit has explained in a case presenting a fraudbased challenge to a registration:Unlike the registration of a patent, a trademark registration of itself does not create the underlying right to exclude. Nor is a trademark created by registration. While federal8 See, e.g., Herbko Int'l, Inc. v. Kappa Books, Inc., 308 F.3d 1156, 1163 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("While titles of single works are not registrable, they may be protected under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act upon a showing of secondary meaning."); Sugar Busters LLC v. Brennan, 177 F.3d 258, 269 (5th Cir. 1999) ("The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has consistently interpreted [prior authority of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals] as prohibiting the registration of single book titles as trademarks. The descriptive nature of a literary title does not mean, however, that such a title cannot receive protection under § 43(a).").11registration triggers certain substantive and procedural rights, the absence of federal registration does not unleash the mark to public use. The Lanham Act protects unregistered marks as does the common law.San Juan Prods., Inc. v.

Cancellation of registration strips an owner of `important legal rights and benefits' that accompany federal registration, but it `does not invalidate underlying common law rights in the trademark.'"

THOMAS MCCARTHY, MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION §§ 20:40, 20:68 (4th ed.)).The theory that otherwise valid marks become unprotectable because they are unregistrable also cannot be reconciled with Section 43(c) of Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c) (2012), which protects the distinctiveness of famous marks against likely dilution. Under that statute, whether or not a mark is registered is merely one of four nonexclusive factors used to determine whether a mark is sufficiently famous to qualify for protection. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2). The nonexistence of a registration therefore does not preclude actions brought under that statute. See, e.g., New York City Triathlon, LLC v. NYC Triathlon Club, Inc., 704 F. Supp. 2d 305, 321-22 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (finding unregistered marks famous and likely to be diluted in violation of Section 43(c)).B. Federal and State Causes of Action are Available to Protect Unregistered, but Otherwise Valid, MarksAlthough certain causes of action for the misappropriation of marks are reserved to federal registrants, others are available to protect unregistered, but otherwise valid, marks. This Court therefore13previously has recognized that Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), provides a remedy against the misappropriation of unregistered, but otherwise valid, marks. See generally Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763 (1992); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., 529 U.S. 205 (2000). It therefore is "wrong to conflate registrability under §2 with protectability under §43(a) [of the Lanham Act]." Jason Rantanen & Mark P. McKenna, Guest Post by Prof. McKenna: The Implications of Blackhorse v. Pro-Football, Inc., Patentlyo, http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/06/implicationsblackhorse-football.html (June 19, 2014).Moreover, common-law trademark rights cansupport infringement and unfair competition claims,as well as challenges to pending trademark applica-tions before, and registrations with, the USPTO.Thus, for example, Section 2(d) of the Lanham Actrecognizes a cause of action against a claim of rightsin the USPTO to a mark "which so resembles a markregistered in the Patent and Trademark Office, or amark or trade name previously used . . . by anotherand not abandoned, as to be likely, when used on orin connection with the goods of the applicant, tocause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive."15 U.S.C. § 1052(d) (emphasis added). In fact, as theUSPTO has noted, there are some circumstances inwhich common-law rights in a mark may be deemed"stronger than those based on a [federal] registra-tion." U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, ProtectingYour Trademark, Enhancing Your Rights ThroughFederalRegistration,https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/BasicFacts.pdf (Jan. 2016).14There are other federal causes of action available to the owners of unregistered marks. On this issue, the court of appeals stated that "[w]ithout federal registration, a trademark user cannot stop importation of goods bearing the mark . . . ." 808 F.3d at 1343. In fact, however, and in addition to a Section 43(a) cause of action, the owner of an unregistered mark can file a complaint pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act, 19 U.S.C. § 1337 (2012), before the International Trade Commission ("ITC") to stop the importation of goods bearing the mark that violates those common-law rights. In re Certain Digital Multimeters, & Prods. With Multimeter Functionality, Inv. No. 337-TA-588, USITC Pub. 4210, 2010 ITC LEXIS 2867 (Int'l Trade Comm'n Dec. 1, 2010) (issuing general exclusion order to protect unregistered trade dress). The ITC may issue an exclusion order enforcing trademark rights and requiring U.S. Customs and Border Protection to stop the importation of goods bearing infringements of the mark. See Gamut Trading Co. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 200 F.3d 775, 783 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("An exclusion order is the Commission's statutory remedy for trademark infringement.").Unregistered, but valid, marks may also be protected against cybersquatting under the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d): "[A] trademark need not be registered to be entitled to protection under the ACPA." DaimlerChrysler v. Net Inc., 388 F.3d 201, 205 (6th Cir. 2004); see also 5 J. THOMAS MCCARTHY, MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS AND UNFAIR COMPETITION § 25A:49 (4th ed.) ("[T]here is no requirement that the pro-15tected `mark' be registered: unregistered common law marks are protected by the Act.").Finally, state law often offers causes of action to the owners of unregistered marks. These include likelihood-of-confusion-based causes of action for infringement, unfair competition, and deceptive trade practices. See generally INT'L TRADEMARK ASS'N, STATE TRADEMARK AND UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW, http://applications.inta.org/apps/states/full_report/ (2016) (follow login directions for members) (describing availability of causes of action on state-by-state basis). They also include statutory causes of action to protect the fame and distinctiveness of marks against likely or actual dilution, see generally id., which are extant in more than half the states and most of which do not require federal or state registration as a prerequisite for relief. See, e.g., 765 ILL. COMP. STAT. 1036/6 (no registration requirement for protection against likely dilution). The owners of unregistered but otherwise valid marks therefore have a variety of causes of action available to enforce the rights to their marks.C. Under Certain Circumstances, Protection Against Unfair Competition is Available to the Owners of Claimed, but Invalid, MarksIf a claimed mark is unregistrable because it is invalid, that circumstance will not necessarily preclude the availability of protection against misleading uses of the claimed mark. This Court previously has recognized that "the common law of trademarks is but a part of the broader law of unfair competi-16tion." Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 413 (1916); accord Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, Inc., 537 U.S. 418, 428 (2003). It also has held that Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act in particular "goes beyond trademark protection." Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 29 (2003).A claimant to even an invalid mark therefore can receive protection via Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, state unfair competition law, or passing off claims against the bad-faith and confusing use of that claimed mark.10 For example, this Court has required defendants to "use reasonable care to inform the public of the source of its product" so to avoid confusion arising from their use of a claimed mark that had been found generic. See Kellogg Co. v. Nat'l Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 119 (1938); accord Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co., 163 U.S. 169, 203-20410 RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF UNFAIR COMPETITION § 15 (1995) ("Use of a generic term in a manner likely to deceive or mislead a significant number of prospective purchasers as to the source of the goods or services, however, may subject the user to liability under the general rule proscribing misrepresentations of source"); id. § 30 ("[U]se of an abandoned designation in a manner likely to deceive or mislead a significant number of prospective purchasers may subject the user to liability to the former owner under the general rule proscribing misrepresentations of source."); see also Browning King Co. of N.Y. v. Browning King Co., 176 F.2d 105, 107 (3d Cir. 1949) (holding anyone is entitled to use an abandoned mark "subject to the highly important qualification that in such use there must not be any deception of the public as to the identity of the merchant with whom customers do business").17(1896).11 The Court reached similar conclusions in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U.S. 225, 232 (1964), and Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U.S. 234, 238 (1964), holding in both of which the right to copy a unpatented and functional product did not excuse the defendants from taking affirmative steps to reduce mistakes and confusion in the marketplace. Therefore, even unregistrability triggered by the invalidity of a claimed mark does not necessarily foreclose all protection under federal and state unfair competition law.III. UNREGISTRABILITY ON THE PRINCIPAL REGISTER DEPRIVES A MARK OWNER OF VALUABLE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE ADVANTAGESEchoing this Court's observation that "[t]he benefits of registration are substantial," B & B Hard-11 See also Murphy Door Bed Co. v. Interior Sleep Sys., Inc., 874 F.2d 95, 97 (2d Cir. 1989) ("We hold that `Murphy bed' is a generic term, having been appropriated by the public to designate generally a type of bed . . . . [W]e agree with the district court that defendants engaged in unfair competition by passing off beds of their own manufacture as beds of the Murphy Co. Accordingly, we affirm the court's entry of a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from use of the term Murphy bed."); Blinded Veterans Ass'n v. Blinded Am. Veterans Found., 872 F.2d 1035, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1989) ("[I]f an organization's own name is generic, a competitor's subsequent use of that name may give rise to an unfair competition claim if the competitor's failure adequately to identify itself as distinct from the first organization causes confusion or a likelihood of confusion."); WWP, Inc. v. Wounded Warriors, Inc., 566 F. Supp. 2d 970, 97778 (D. Neb. 2008) (granting preliminary injunction under the Nebraska Deceptive Trade Practices Act against bad-faith imitation of invalid mark).18ware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., 135 S. Ct. 1293, 1309 (2015), the court of appeals correctly held that "federal trademark registration bestows truly significant and financially valuable benefits upon markholders." Tam, 808 F.3d at 1240. It may, however, have understated those benefits in the process.A mark owner denied registration on the Principal Register can suffer significant disadvantages in litigation to protect its mark.12 Some of those disadvantages are purely procedural in nature. For example, Sections 7(b) and 33(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1057(b), 1115(a) (2012), provide that a certificate of registration on the Principal Register constitutes "prima facie" evidence of the validity of the registered mark; if such a registration becomes incontestable under Section 15 of the Act, id. § 1065, that evidence becomes "conclusive," subject to certain exceptions identified in Section 33(b) of the Act. Id. § 1115(b); see generally Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 194-95. In contrast, "[u]nregistered marks have no presumption of validity . . . . Thus, a plaintiff must prove that an unregistered mark is valid and pro-12 Although the court of appeals and the parties alike have focused on the advantages accruing to registrations on the Principal Register, a registration even on the Supplemental Register (which is unavailable to potentially disparaging marks under Section 2(a) of the Act) creates federal subject-matter jurisdiction over actions to protect the registered mark. See 15 U.S.C. § 1121. It also allows the registrant to use the ® symbol, which can be an effective deterrent against infringement. Id. § 1111. Finally, it can be the basis of the USPTO's rejection of an application to register another party's confusingly similar mark. See, e.g., In re Clorox Co., 578 F.2d 305, 307 (C.C.P.A. 1978).19tectable." MNI Mgmt., Inc. v. Wine King, LLC, 542 F. Supp. 2d 389, 404 (D.N.J. 2008) (citation omitted).Further advantages are more substantive in nature. The court of appeals recognized a number of these, including the availability of nationwide constructive priority of rights, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1057(c), 1072, "the assistance of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in restricting importation of infringing or counterfeit goods," Tam, 808 F.3d at 1329 (citing 15 U.S.C. § 1124; 19 U.S.C. § 1526), the simplified process for obtaining and maintaining registrations under the Madrid Protocol and the Paris Convention, 15 U.S.C. § 1141b, and the complete defense to claims of trademark dilution under state law. Id. § 1125(c)(6).Other advantages accruing to federal registrations (but not identified by the court of appeals) include the availability of particular private causes of action only to registrants on the Principal Register. Thus, for example, nonregistrants are ineligible for the cause of action against counterfeiting13 created by the intersection of Section 32 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114, which is available only to federal registrants,14 with Section 34, 15 U.S.C. § 1116, and13 A defendant's mark is "counterfeit" only if it is "identical [to], or substantially indistinguishable from, a registered mark." 15 U.S.C. § 1127 (emphasis added); see also id. § 1116(d)(1)(b) ("`[C]ounterfeit mark' means . . . a counterfeit of a mark that is registered . . . in the . . . Patent and Trademark Office for such goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed and that is in use . . . ." (emphasis added)).14 See, e.g., Fin. Inv. Co. (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Geberit AG, 165 F.3d 526, 531 (7th Cir. 1998) ("Authorities uniformly agree that only20Section 35, id. § 1117. Nonregistrants challenging counterfeit imitations of their marks can rely on the unfair competition cause of action under Section 43(a) of the Act, id. § 1125(a), but liability under that section does not trigger the heightened remedies set forth in Section 34(d), id. § 1116(d), or the availability of statutory damages under Section 35(c), id. § 1117(c). Nonregistrants are also ineligible for the private cause of action provided for Section 526(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. § 1526(a) (2012), which is similarly restricted to the owners of registered marks. Finally, the existence or nonexistence of a registration on the Principal Register is relevant to the inquiry into whether a mark is sufficiently famous to qualify for protection against likely dilution under federal law. 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2). Despite the availability of some causes of action to protect unregistered marks, nonregistrants therefore are disadvantaged vis-à-vis their federal registrant counterparts.CONCLUSIONThe registration system is an integral part of federal trademark law, but a federal registration is not a prerequisite for the use of a mark in commerce. Moreover, the denial of a federal registration does not necessarily eliminate all federal or common-law rights to the underlying mark, and the Court shouldthe trademark's registrant (or her assignee) may sue under § 32(1)."); Gaia Techs., Inc. v. Reconversion Techs., Inc., 93 F.3d 774, 779-80 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (vacating finding of liability under Section 32 in light of plaintiff's failure to demonstrate ownership of registration).21reject any suggestion to the contrary. Nevertheless, the owner of a mark registered on the Principal Register enjoys certain substantive and procedural advantages in litigation to protect its mark that are not available to the owners of unregistered marks. Although the ABA does not take a position on the merits of the question presented, it urges the Court to answer that question in a manner not disturbing these basic propositions of United States trademark law.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: JONATHAN S.

A. THE ABA CRIMINAL JUSTICE STANDARDS WERE REVISED TO INCORPORATE THE REQUIREMENTS OF PADILLA TO PREVENT PREJUDICE TO DEFENDANTS.The ABA Standards articulate a set of criteria with respect to a lawyer's duty to provide competent representation--including the duty to advise a noncitizen defendant about immigration consequences during plea negotiations. This Court recognized in Padilla that deportation is a uniquely "severe penalty" and held that the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to provide affirmative, competent advice to her client about whether his plea carries a risk of deportation. See Padilla, 559 U.S. at 365, 367 ("The weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of7deportation.") (emphasis added) (citing, among other sources, ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function 4-5.1(a), p. 197 (3d ed. 1993); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty 14-3.2(f), p. 116 (3d ed. 1999) (hereinafter "Pleas of Guilty Standards")). In doing so, Padilla acknowledged the risk of deportation to the non-citizen defendant's decision-making. "Collateral consequences" may be of greater concern to him than a prison sentence or fine, because it may deprive him "of all that makes life worth living." Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284 (1922) (Brandeis, J.); accord INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 322 n.48 (2001) ("[I]f a defendant will face deportation as a result of a conviction, defense counsel `should fully advise the defendant of these consequences.'") (quoting Pleas of Guilty Standard 143.2, cmt., p. 75 (2d ed. 1982)).The ABA recognized the significant impact of Padilla on the criminal justice system, due to the large number of non-citizens for whom convictions of certain offenses can lead to deportation or removal. See ABA Report with Recommendation 100C (Criminal Justice Section) at 1 nn.1, 2 (2010) (hereinafter "Report 100C") (noting that nearly one out of ten defendants is not a United States citizen and that, in areas of high immigrant population such as California, one out of every four persons residing in the state is foreign-born), available at http://www. americanbar.org/content/dam/ aba/directories/policy/2010_am_100c.authcheckdam. pdf. The ABA also understood the challenges faced by public defender offices in fulfilling Padilla's mandate, due to the lack of attorneys skilled in immigration law in such offices and the financial impossibility of hiring immigration counsel. See id. at 10­11. As a result, in8August 2010, the ABA House of Delegates urged local, state, and federal funding, training, and pro bono services to assist lawyers in advising their clients about the immigration consequences of criminal proceedings. See ABA Recommendation 100C (Criminal Justice Section) (2010); see also Report 100C at 4­5 (discussing "many examples of basic immigration strategies that are designed to give the prosecution what is required, while avoiding making the defendant removable or ineligible for relief from removal").In 2015, the ABA published Defense Function Standard 4-5.5 ("Special Attention to Immigration Status and Consequences"). In response to Padilla, the ABA specifically crafted this new Standard to expand upon the already existing Standards. It states:(a) Defense counsel should determine a client's citizenship and immigration status. . . . .(b) If defense counsel determines that a client may not be a United States citizen, counsel should investigate and identify particular immigration consequences that might follow possible criminal dispositions. Consultation or association with an immigration law expert or knowledgeable advocate is advisable in these circumstances. Public and appointed defenders should develop, or seek funding for, such immigration expertise within their offices.(c) After determining the client's immigration status and potential adverse consequences from the criminal proceedings, including removal, exclusion, bars to relief from removal, immigration detention, denial of citizenship, and9adverse consequences to the client's immediate family, counsel should advise the client of all such potential consequences and determine with the client the best course of action for the client's interests and how to pursue it.(d) If a client is convicted of a removable offense, defense counsel should advise the client of the serious consequences if the client illegally returns to the United States.Defense Function Standard 4-5.5 (emphasis added). The ABA also added other Standards, aimed at preventing or mitigating client prejudice caused by ineffective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., Defense Function Standard 4-5.4 ("When defense counsel knows that a consequence is particularly important to the client, counsel should advise the client as to whether there are procedures for avoiding, mitigating or later removing the consequence . . . . ").Finally, given that non-citizen juvenile defendants may suffer unique prejudice due to their youth and inexperience, the ABA House of Delegates also passed a resolution: (i) urging courts to ensure that defense counsel advise the juvenile client of the "varying [immigration] consequences that may flow from different dispositions of the case" and the availability of any relief from the same and to seek, when practicable, to minimize adverse consequences, and (ii) encouraging local bar associations and others to train judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and legal aid lawyers about the same and to support efforts to provide resources to defense counsel and agencies to provide their juvenile clients effective representation10that satisfies Padilla.4 ABA Resolution 104E (Criminal Justice Section) (2013) at 1­2, available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ publishing/abanews/13606040182013_hod_midyear_ meeting_104erevised.authcheckdam.pdf.B. THE ABA STANDARDS RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS RATIONAL FOR A DEFENDANT TO CHOOSE TRIAL OVER MANDATORY AND PERMANENT DEPORTATION.The prejudice inquiry under Strickland requires a fact-specific analysis: the petitioner must convince a fact-finder that a decision to reject the plea bargain and go to trial would have been rational under the circumstances. Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 485­86 (2000) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695­96). The new ABA Defense Function Standard 4-5.5 similarly presumes that one client's willingness to accept certain immigration consequences of a plea may vary from the next--but that it is each client's informed decision to make, depending upon his factual circumstances. Factual circumstances may include family obligations, financial resources, and conditions in the country to which a defendant will be returned. For example, an individual facing deportation to England has a different analysis than an individual facing deportation to South Sudan. See, e.g., Defense4 For example, ABA practitioners found that some juvenile defendants entered pleas unaware that they were not United States citizens. And, at least one juvenile only learned her actual immigration status years later when detained by immigration authorities. See ABA Report with Resolution 104E (Criminal Justice Section) (2013) at 2.11Function Standard 4-6.1(b) ("[C]ounsel should consider the individual circumstances of the case and of the client, and should not recommend to a client acceptance of a disposition offer unless and until appropriate investigation and study of the matter has been completed") (emphasis added).The ABA's Standards and policy guidance, including their client-specific approach, is based upon the practical experiences of ABA members that a rational non-citizen may, under certain circumstances, reject a plea offer guaranteeing mandatory deportation in favor of a jury trial, even in the face of strong evidence of guilt: "[A] plea deal that might otherwise seem attractive--for example, a suspended one-year sentence for misdemeanor theft--may often look considerably different once it is determined that that plea would in fact be deemed an `aggravated' felony conviction leading to the alien client's swift deportation." Pleas of Guilty Standard 14-1.4, cmt., p. 58 n.96. This Court has similarly recognized that some defendants may accept the risk of a longer sentence in order to plead to a non-deportable offense. See Padilla, 559 U.S. at 364, 368 ("[D]eportation is an integral part--indeed, sometimes the most important part--of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes . . . `[p]reserving the client's right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.'" (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 322) (second alteration in original)). This calculus makes sense, given the severity of deportation, which is "the equivalent of banishment or exile." Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 391 (1947).12Broad-based ABA practitioner experience teaches that a rational defendant may decide for a host of reasons to "roll the dice" on a jury to avoid the draconian result of permanent deportation. The defendant (and his counsel) may believe that the court will suppress key evidence or make favorable evidentiary rulings, that his credibility will hold great sway with a jury of his peers, that he can undermine the credibility of a key government agent or informant, or merely that a jury will acquit or hang, especially in the case of a first-time, non-violent drug offender, such as Petitioner. To many defendants, taking a chance at trial is rational when deportation is, at minimum, a life sentence away from family and friends, and possibly entails loss of liberty or even life. As the ABA has previously noted, some "immigrant defendants would trade any concern in order to avoid removal . . . . A defendant can only make this crucial decision if he or she understands the potential criminal and immigration penalties." Report 100C at 6; accord Padilla v. Commonwealth ("Padilla II"), 381 S.W.3d 322, 330 (Ky. Ct. App. 2012) ("[F]or Padilla, exile is a far worst [sic] prospect than the maximum ten year sentence."). Faced with certain loss, it is rational to throw the "Hail Mary" survival pass, even if the odds of success are low. See generally People v. Martinez, 304 P.3d 529, 531, 535 (Cal. 2013), as modified on denial of reh'g (Sept. 11, 2013) ("[B]ecause `the test for prejudice considers what the defendant would have done, that a more favorable result was not reasonably probable is only one factor for the trial court to consider when assessing the credibility of a defendant's claim that he or she would have rejected the plea bargain if properly advised.'").13Here, Petitioner's paramount desire to avoid deportation to South Korea, as well as his first-time offender status and strong familial and business ties to the United States, may well have tipped the balance in favor of trial.5 See, e.g., Ortega-Araiza v. State, 331 P.3d 1189, 1194 (Wyo. 2014) (observing that it was "entirely reasonable" for defendant "to reject the plea and insist on going to trial (or seek a different plea agreement with lesser deportation consequence) as he was facing deportation whether he was convicted pursuant to a plea agreement or as a result of a trial. Better to gamble on an acquittal at trial, than the assured conviction and deportation resulting from a guilty plea"); Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 9 N.E.3d 789, 797 (Mass. 2014) ("If an assessment of the apparent benefits of a plea offer is made, it must be conducted in light of the recognition that a non-citizen defendant confronts a very different calculus than that confronting a United States citizen.").In contrast, the Court of Appeals essentially disregarded the fact-specific nature of the prejudice inquiry and, in effect, established a per se rule--that a defendant's low likelihood of prevailing on the merits at trial rendered that factor dispositive in analyzing Strickland's second prong, regardless of the particular context. In other words, it is always irrational for a defendant charged with a deportable offense and facing strong evidence of guilt to proceed to trial rather than take a plea deal requiring deportation, "despite his very strong ties to the United States." Pet. App. 10a. While5 The government conceded below that Petitioner's trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. Brief for Petitioner at 2, 11; Pet. App. 75a.14strong evidence against a defendant is certainly a relevant factor in his decision making, it is not the only factor. And the weight a defendant assigns to that factor will vary from defendant to defendant.Trial counsel's ineffective assistance foreclosed Petitioner of the opportunity to freely and intelligently choose whether to exercise his constitutional right to a trial by a jury of his peers. The ABA Standards seek to prevent such deprivations and to ensure that all noncitizen defendants are competently advised about immigration consequences, so that they can make a "voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action." Hill, 474 U.S. at 56.C. INCOMPETENT ADVICE ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES OF A PLEA MAY DEPRIVE A DEFENDANT OF THE ABILITY TO PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE SENTENCES THAT AVOID DEPORTATION.The ABA Standards and policy guidance also recognize that criminal cases are overwhelmingly resolved by plea negotiations and that such negotiations can be an ongoing and dynamic process. When the Court decided Padilla, ninety-five percent of cases were resolved by plea bargain. Padilla, 559 U.S. at 372 n.13. That number has increased, at least in federal cases. See U.S. Sentencing Comm'n, 2015 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics, Table 10 (97.1% of cases resolved by plea bargain). The plea bargaining process is guided not only by defense counsel's duty to his client, but also by the prosecutor's ability to consider holistically the facts of an individual defendant's situation, once he or she is made aware of15those facts. See Prosecution Function Standard 3-1.2(b) ("The duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice . . . not merely to convict.").6 Prosecutors also have an interest in the finality of convictions and ensuring that the correct result is reached in all cases.Today's criminal justice system bears little relationship to what the Founding Fathers envisioned, with the jury trial as its centerpiece. In reality, "our criminal justice system is almost exclusively a system of plea bargaining, negotiated behind closed doors and with no judicial oversight." Jed S. Rakoff, Why Innocent People Plead Guilty, N.Y. Review of Books, Nov. 20, 2014 (advocating the involvement of magistrate judges in the plea bargaining process, due to the arbitrary nature of the "current system of prosecutor-determined plea bargaining"). Thus, the Sixth Circuit's premise that the only options available to Petitioner were a binary choice between the offered plea agreement and trial was particularly flawed. Pet. App. 7a­8a; cf. United States v. Kwan, 407 F.3d 1005, 1017­18 (9th Cir. 2005), abrogated on other grounds by Padilla, 559 U.S. at 356 (noting that non-citizen defendant "could have gone to trial or renegotiated his plea agreement to avoid deportation; he could have pled guilty to a lesser charge, or the parties could have stipulated that Kwan would be sentenced to less than one year in prison").6 See also ABA Report with Recommendation 103E (Criminal Justice Section) (2007) (urging federal, state, and local governments to assist defense counsel and prosecutors "in advising clients of the collateral consequences of criminal convictions during representation"), available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/ dam/aba/directories/policy/2007_my_103e.authcheckdam.pdf.16Indeed, the ABA Standards recognize that competent counsel must at least understand the need to propose an alternative sentence that does not involve deportation, when available. Defense counsel and prosecutors are encouraged to consult with each other about such a disposition. See Prosecution Function Standard 3-4.1(a) ("The prosecutor should have and make known a general policy or willingness to consult with defense counsel concerning disposition of charges by plea."); Pleas of Guilty Standard 14-3.1, cmt., p. 105 ("[A] refusal to negotiate with defendants is inconsistent with the ABA's . . . Standards and with efficient judicial administration.").ABA policy further acknowledges that "[i]n many cases it is possible to identify a plea . . . that is roughly equivalent to the one charged but is safer for immigration purposes." Report 100C at 4. Defense counsel can negotiate a plea to a different charge or one requiring more incarceration yet avoiding deportation. See Pleas of Guilty Standard 14-3.1(c), p. 101. For example, in federal court, defense counsel often negotiate a sentence of one year plus one day, rather than only one year, which makes the defendant eligible for "good time" credits and an early release. See Report 100C at 4. However, for the non-citizen defendant, such a sentence may trigger harsh deportation consequences. Instead, if a person has been charged with an offense that becomes an aggravated felony only if the court imposes a sentence of one year or more, he may request a sentence of 364 days, thereby preserving17the possibility for relief from deportation.7 See id. On remand from this Court, the Kentucky Court of Appeals acknowledged a similar possibility in Padilla's case. Padilla II, 381 S.W.3d at 330 ("[H]ad the immigration consequences of Padilla's plea been factored . . . trial counsel may have obtained a plea agreement that would not have the consequence of mandatory deportation."); accord Kwan, 407 F.3d at 1017 ("[H]ad counsel and the court been aware that a nominally shorter sentence would enable [the defendant] to avoid deportation, there is a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a sentence of less than one year.").Defense counsel who advises her client competently can shape the dialogue with prosecutors and help develop alternative charging or plea options that avoid deportation, thereby aiding the defendant and, oftentimes, other interests of justice.By bringing deportation consequences into this [plea bargaining] process, the defense and prosecution may well be able to reach7 In Petitioner's case, Mr. Lee pled guilty to one count of unlawful possession with intent to distribute MDMA (ecstasy), in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced Mr. Lee to a period of incarceration of twelve months and one day. Lee v. United States, Petition for Writ of Certiorari ("Pet.") at 7; accord Pet. App. 51a, 57a. Petitioner's defense counsel testified that he was not aware that a guilty plea to a violation of Section 841(a)(1) would result in mandatory deportation. Id. at 54a. Because counsel was not aware of this fact, he apparently did not explore with the government whether Petitioner could plead guilty to a different, non-deportable crime. (Any conviction to the original charge, an aggravated felony, would have required deportation.)18agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties. . . . Counsel who possess the most rudimentary understanding of the deportation consequences of a particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain creatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction and sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as by avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically triggers the removal consequence.Padilla, 559 U.S. at 373; see also generally Pleas of Guilty Standard 14-4.1, p. 141 (noting that diversion may be appropriate when "the interests of justice will be served," including when "the needs of the offender and the government can be better met outside the traditional criminal justice process"); Jenny Roberts, Effective Plea Bargaining Counsel, 122 Yale L.J. 2650 (2013) (discussing Padilla and other cases and analyzing the role of defense counsel in plea negotiations).Defense counsel's lack of understanding or misunderstanding about immigration consequences also can limit a defendant's options, because a prosecutor may not even consider plea options which avoid deportation, unless defense counsel raises the issue. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, U.S. Attorneys' Manual, § 9-73.520 (1997) (for immigration violations, federal prosecutors should seek the deportation of all deportable non-citizen criminals, absent extraordinary circumstances). ABA guidance supports the view that it is not always irrational for a defendant to reject a plea offer requiring deportation, despite strong evidence of guilt, because the defendant19may very well have sought an alternative sentence that avoids deportation.D. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL HARMS NOT ONLY THE DEFENDANT, BUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WELL.As this Court observed in Padilla, the impact of incompetent counsel is far broader than just harm to the defendant--it harms the adversarial criminal justice system itself:It is our responsibility under the Constitution to ensure that no criminal defendant--whether a citizen or not--is left to the "mercies of incompetent counsel." To satisfy this responsibility, we now hold that counsel must inform her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation. Our longstanding Sixth Amendment precedents, the seriousness of deportation as a consequence of a criminal plea, and the concomitant impact of deportation on families living lawfully in this country demand no less.Padilla, 559 U.S. at 374 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).Despite the different criminal justice experiences and perspectives reflected in the ABA's diverse membership, there is a consensus that the failure to inform defendants of the risk of deportation associated with plea bargains also diminishes the fairness and credibility of our criminal justice system. See generally Recommendation 100C ("[I]n many cases a criminal defender armed with an analysis can obtain a criminal20disposition that will satisfy the prosecution, while creating no or at least less severe adverse immigration consequences."); accord Padilla, 559 U.S. at 373 ("[I]nformed consideration of possible deportation can only benefit both the State and non-citizen defendants during the plea-bargaining process."). Resourcechallenged prosecutorial agencies may welcome accurate information about immigration consequences from defense counsel, to negotiate alternative sentences that promote finality and serve the goals of deterrence and punishment, but impose a lesser burden on the courts and sister agencies. See generally St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 322 (noting that a plea agreement grants the government numerous "tangible benefits, such as promptly imposed punishment without the expenditure of prosecutorial resources"). Indeed, since Padilla, some states have issued guidance that prosecutors commit ethical misconduct if they do not inform an unrepresented defendant about the need to obtain legal advice regarding immigration law consequences under certain circumstances. See, e.g., Virginia Legal Ethics Opinion 1876, Mar. 19, 2015, available at http://www.vacle.org/opinions/1876.htm. Adopting the Sixth Circuit's approach--namely, that a first-time offender and long-time legal permanent resident with very strong ties to the United States cannot establish prejudice solely because "[t]he case against him was very strong"--would harm the criminal justice system's interests in fairness and finality which the ABA Standards aim to promote. See, e.g., Prosecution Function Standard 3-8.1 (prosecutor should not defend a conviction if she believes that a miscarriage of justice associated with the conviction has occurred).21This Court can only fulfill the Sixth Amendment's promise to provide the accused, in all criminal prosecutions, "the Assistance of Counsel for his defen[s]e" by recognizing the reality that, in some circumstances, the noncitizen defendant can and will rationally choose to reject a plea offer which would result in permanent deportation. It is the defendant's voluntary and intelligent choice to make. Our Constitution demands no less.CONCLUSIONAmicus curiae American Bar Association respectfully urges this Court to reverse the Sixth Circuit's decision.Respectfully submitted,Linda A.

A. Where Patented Methods May Be Performed By Multiple Actors, Clarification Is Needed As To The Law Of Induced Infringement To Reflect The Realities Of Technology And Patent Practice Today.5As the Federal Circuit majority stated in Akamai: "It would be a bizarre result to hold someone liable for inducing another to perform all of the steps of a method claim but to hold harmless one who goes further by actually performing some of the steps himself." 692 F.3d at 1309. In Akamai, the en banc Federal Circuit confronted the increasingly common situation in fields ranging from health diagnostics, medicine, financial services, and oil drilling, to the complex networks of today's information technology markets, where many innovative patented methods, by their very nature, involve two or more actors. This occurs either because the practical reality of the industry is such that different steps will be performed by different entities (e.g., a test or process performed by a subcontracted lab as part of a patient's treatment regimen), or because the method is directed to an interaction of two actors (e.g., a business method that involves facilitating a customer's performance of an action).In resolving the Akamai case, the Federal Circuit confronted its own precedent, under which a party that performed some, but not all, of the steps of a method patent could not be liable for direct infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(a).4 In essence,4 Section 271(a) provides: "Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent."6Federal Circuit precedent limited liability for direct infringement under § 271(a) "to those who practice each and every element of the claimed invention." BMC Resources, Inc. v. Paymentech, L.P., 498 F.3d 1373, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Although the court acknowledged that a "party cannot avoid infringement . . . simply by contracting out steps of a patented process to another entity," 498 F.3d at 1381, it held that liability arises only if the accused entity "controls or directs" the performance of all of the steps. Id. The court then relied on BMC in Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F.3d 1318 (Fed Cir. 2008), to reverse a jury's finding of liability under § 271(a), concluding that, "where the actions of multiple parties combine to perform every step of a claimed method, the claim is directly infringed only if one party exercises `control or direction' over the entire process such that every step is attributable to the controlling party, i.e., the `mastermind'." 532 F.3d at 1329. Finally, in Golden Hour Data Systems, Inc. v. emCharts, Inc., 614 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2010), the court held that two coequal parties could not be liable for divided infringement under § 271(a) because neither one "controlled or directed" the other, and affirmed a finding of no infringement, even though the accused companies had formed a strategic alliance, enabled their programs to work together, and collaborated to sell the two programs as a unit.7These precedents for direct infringement under § 271(a) did not reach petitioner Limelight's conduct. Nevertheless, the majority characterized the situation as one where "the patentee's rights are plainly being violated by the actors' joint conduct." Akamai, 692 F.3d at 1306. The Akamai majority then expanded the reach of 35 U.S.C. § 271(b) to allow liability for induced infringement where one entity performs some steps of a method claim and, with full knowledge of the patent, induces another entity to perform the remaining steps--but without requiring a predicate finding, as required under Federal Circuit precedent, that there was conduct constituting direct infringement under § 271(a).The ABA agrees that the issue of multiple entities who act together to infringe a patent must be addressed. The ABA respectfully asserts, however, that it should not be addressed by adopting an entirely new rule of induced infringement under § 271(b) but, rather, by clarifying the law of direct infringement under § 271(a). Akamai's new construction of § 271(b) has engendered and will continue to engender uncertainty in multi-actor relationships. Patent holders or their assignees will be able to expand the range of potentially liable actors and inject new and potentially disruptive risks into established business arrangements. The Federal Circuit's intent-based inducement standard, coupled with the broad range of conduct that may constitute "inducing" infringement, also will present8factual disputes that will make pretrial resolution of infringement cases unlikely.Further, the ABA submits that, under the Federal Circuit's constrained standard for direct infringement under § 271(a), it is relatively easy for an entity to structure its business dealings in such a way that will immunize itself and others acting in concert with it from liability for infringement--for example, by disclaiming the existence of agency or by contract drafting that eliminates the risk that one entity can be found to have "directed" or "controlled" the other.The ABA also notes that if this Court rejects the Federal Circuit's expansion of § 271(b), the question of divided infringement will remain for multiple actor cases, including in this case on remand.For all of these reasons, the ABA respectfully requests that this Court clarify the standards for determining when an actor or actors should be liable for direct infringement under § 271(a) in multiple actor cases.B. For Addressing Multiple Actor Infringement Cases, The ABA Offers Four Conclusions Developed By The ABA's IPL Section.In considering whether a finding of indirect infringement, whether through active inducement of9infringement under § 271(b) or contributory infringement under § 271(c), should require a predicate finding of direct infringement by at least one entity that is liable as a direct infringer, the ABA suggests that four conclusions developed by the diverse members of the ABA's IPL Section, and adopted as policy by the ABA, may be of assistance. Each of these conclusions is discussed below and set out in the Appendix.The four conclusions are:(1) Direct infringement may be found on the part of a single entity that does not perform all the steps of a patented process, if that entity directs or controls others who perform all of the process steps that the directing/controlling entity itself does not perform.Under Conclusion No. 1, a single entity would be liable for direct infringement under § 271(a) if it directs or controls others who perform all of the steps of a patented method, even in the absence of an agency or contractual relationship. That is, a finding of "direction or control" for purposes of establishing liability under § 271(a) would take into account the totality of the facts and circumstances, including, inter alia: the nature of the relationship between the actors; whether the actors have an express or implied agreement among themselves;10whether one actor supplies another actor with the means, instructions and know-how to complete the infringement; the degree of control or direction one actor maintains over another; and whether a common actor directs the acts alleged to constitute the infringement.(2) Direct infringement may be found on the part of multiple entities that act in concert to perform, or to direct or control the performance of, all of the steps of a patented process, as part of a common design or purpose of such entities for carrying out the process.The ABA submits that patent law needs to address instances of direct infringement committed by joint venturers and other circumstances involving concerted action where one actor does not necessarily "direct" or "control" the other. The Federal Circuit's "single entity" rule permits entities to collaborate with respect to a patented method yet escape liability for infringement. See, e.g., Golden Hour Data Systems, 614 F.3d 1367 (two parties not found liable for divided infringement under § 271(a) where neither "controlled or directed" the other, even though they formed a strategic alliance, enabled their programs to work together, and collaborated to sell the two programs as a unit). Such a result offends basic notions of justice and under-protects patent holders' rights to "exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling the11invention." 35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(1). And the incentive to invent is weakened where there is no remedy for direct infringement, even though every element set forth in a patent claim has been satisfied by multiple entities acting in concert.Conclusion No. 2 thus addresses instances involving concerted action by multiple entities acting as part of a common design or purpose for carrying out the claimed process. That is, this conclusion would permit liability to flow from a common enterprise, design, or purpose, irrespective of the nature of the parties' relationships with each other (e.g., despite the absence of a contract or agency relationship).(3) In fact situations involving multipleentities, a finding of directinfringement does not necessarilyrequire the finding of an agencyrelationship (or a contractualrelationship)betweenthedirecting/controlling entities orthose that act in concert as part of acommon design or purpose, andother entities.Conclusion No. 3 specifically addresses the Federal Circuit's stringent "agency or contractual obligation" standard, under which an actor may easily immunize itself against claims of divided infringement through, for example, contract12drafting. As this Court has recognized, infringement of a patent is "essentially a tort." See Carbice Corp. of America v. American Patents Dev. Corp., 283 U.S. 27, 33 (1931). Moreover, this Court assumes that, when Congress creates a tort action, it does so against the backdrop of "ordinary tort-related" rules. Meyer v. Holley, 537 U.S. 280, 285 (2003). Adopting a more complete tort-centered approach to direct infringement under § 271(a)--one that recognizes not only traditional notions of vicarious liability like agency and contract, but also circumstances wherein entities act in concert or pursuant to a common design or plan--would obviate any need for a new doctrine of induced infringement under § 271(b).(4) When directing/controlling entities are liable as direct infringers, a directed/controlled entity that is merely acting under the direction or control of the directing/controlling entities will not itself be liable as an infringer.Finally, Conclusion No. 4 recognizes that the increasing ease with which multi-step method patents may be subdivided among multiple entities greatly increases the risk that unwitting actors may be involved in an infringement. Accordingly, the ABA does not advocate liability for an entity that merely acts under the direction or control of another. To the contrary, liability should not be imposed13unless an entity is part of a collaborative plan to jointly perform the steps of a method patent.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above, the ABA respectfully urges this Court to reject the Federal Circuit's expansive interpretation of § 271(b). The ABA urges this Court to construe § 271(a) to permit findings of liability for direct infringement where, in carrying out the steps of a patented multi-step process, (a) one entity directed or controlled other entities in performing steps that it did not perform, or (b) multiple entities acted in concert to perform, or to direct or control the performance of, all of the steps of the process as part of a common design or purpose.Respectfully submitted.Of Counsel: JAMES C.

A defendant receives ineffective assistance of counsel, and a capital sentence is unconstitutional under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, when (1) trial counsel's mitigation investigation is objectively unreasonable and (2) that deficiency had a "reasonable probability" of affecting the penalty imposed. See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 38-39 (2009). Because the Fifth Circuit assumed arguendo that trial counsel's mitigation investigation was deficient, see Loden, 778 F.3d at 498 n.4, the Question Presented involves the second part of the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel ("IAC") inquiry: whether Mr. Loden's decision to waive a sentencing presentation means that he experienced no prejudice from counsel's deficient investigation.In Landrigan, this Court held that a defendant's scorched-earth opposition to the investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence precluded any prejudice finding. See 550 U.S. at 477-78. A certiorari grant is appropriate to consider whether Landrigan should also preclude a finding of prejudice in the great bulk of cases, like Loden, where the deficient investigation may have contributed to the defendant's decision to waive a sentencing presentation.7The certiorari issue implicates constitutional rights at the core of modern capital sentencing: the Eighth Amendment right to present mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase of a capital trial, see Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110-11 (1982), and the Sixth Amendment right to have counsel adequately investigate that evidence, see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 522-23 (2003). This Court has explained that "the grave task of imposing a death sentence" requires that the sentencer consider mitigating factors such as the defendant's "personal history and characteristics and circumstances of the offense." Abdul-Kabir v. Quarterman, 550 U.S. 233, 263-64 (2007).A defendant's decision to waive his Eighth Amendment right to present sentencing evidence can be a direct function of the sentencing case that counsel is prepared to present. When counsel's failure to do an adequate investigation precipitates a waiver like Mr. Loden's, the waiver itself should not preclude a finding of "reasonable probability that [the defendant] would have received a different sentence after a constitutionally sufficient mitigation investigation." Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S. 945, 956 (2010).I. THE MITIGATION FUNCTION IS CENTRAL TO CAPITAL DEFENSE.At a bifurcated capital trial, the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a "sentencing hearing at which [a defendant] is permitted to present any and all relevant mitigating evidence that is available." Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1986). Because the presentation of mitigating evidence is "defense counsel's job" at the sentencing phase, Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 380-81, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments entitle a defendant to a lawyer who performs a reasonable8mitigation investigation. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534. Criminal process cannot reliably select "the worst of the worst" defendants for capital sentencing if defense counsel does not perform the mitigation function adequately--a reality of capital defense reflected in the Guidelines and ABA Standards for Criminal Justice.Although the Guidelines and ABA Standards for Criminal Justice do not themselves set constitutional standards for deficient performance in IAC cases, this Court has cited them favorably as "valuable measures of the prevailing professional norms of effective representation." Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 367 (2010). For example, ABA Standards for Criminal Justice § 4-4.1 restates the professional consensus regarding the importance of a penalty-phase investigation, and this Court has cited § 4-4.1 favorably in no less than three of its six major mitigationinvestigation opinions. See Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 387 ("[T]he [ABA] Standards for Criminal Justice . . . describes the obligation [to investigate mitigating evidence] in terms no one could misunderstand . . . ."); Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524 (noting that "we long have referred" to the ABA standards "as `guides to determining what is reasonable' " and citing § 4-4.1 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688)); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 396 (2003) (citing § 4-4.1 in support of the conclusion that "trial counsel did not fulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background"). Standard § 4-4.1 provides:Defense counsel should conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction. . . . The duty to investigate exists regardless9of the accused's admissions or statements to defense counsel of facts constituting guilt or the accused's stated desire to plead guilty.(emphasis added).The Guidelines and ABA Standards for Criminal Justice specify investigatory norms because failure to meet them tends to prejudice defendants. Various provisions of the Death Penalty Guidelines emphasize the centrality of the mitigation investigation in capital defense. In Wiggins, this Court favorably cited multiple sections of the 1989 Guidelines, including § 11.4.1(C) and § 11.8.6. The Commentary to § 11.8.6 explains, "Counsel may not choose, without investigation and preparation, to sit back and do nothing at sentencing." This is so even when a defendant initially objects to the presentation of mitigating evidence. 1989 Death Penalty Guidelines § 11.4.1(C) ("The investigation for preparation of the sentencing phase should be conducted regardless of any initial assertion by the client that mitigation is not to be offered."). Part II explains that an inadequate mitigation investigation increases the likelihood of a death sentence in many ways--for example, by inducing the Eighth Amendment waiver at issue here.II. A DEFICIENT MITIGATION INVESTIGATION CAN BE PREJUDICIAL, EVEN IF A CLIENT WAIVES THE RIGHT TO PRESENT SENTENCING-PHASE EVIDENCE.A defendant is prejudiced by counsel's inadequate mitigation investigation if "there is a reasonable probability that [the defendant] would have received a different sentence after a constitutionally sufficient mitigation investigation." Sears, 561 U.S. at 956; see also Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534 ("[T]o establish prejudice,10a defendant must show . . . a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome." (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). Usually, prejudice to the sentencing "outcome" involves inadequate presentation of mitigating evidence to a jury. There are, however, other ways a deficient mitigation investigation can create prejudice.A defendant may be prejudiced by counsel's deficient investigation if it causes him to waive his Eighth Amendment right to present mitigating evidence. The decision to waive is not necessarily independent of a deficient investigation, and a waiver that is contaminated by the deficiency cannot foreclose a finding of prejudice. Waiver may be precipitated by counsel's deficient investigation for a number of reasons.First, an inadequate mitigation investigation may artificially inflate the desirability of an Eighth Amendment waiver, making it more attractive only because there is no viable mitigation case to present. See, e.g., Blystone v. Horn, 664 F.3d 397, 426 (3d Cir. 2011) ("The fact that Blystone chose to forego [presentation of inadequately investigated mitigation], simply does not permit the inference that, had counsel competently investigated and developed [other mitigation], Blystone would have also declined their presentation.").Second, inadequate investigation may lead counsel to recommend against presenting a mitigation case when a thorough investigation would have uncovered evidence prompting counsel to make the opposite recommendation. Defendants, in turn, may waive their right to present mitigating evidence in reliance on counsel's faulty advice. A deficient investigation therefore undermines not only the strategic options available to a defendant (present a weak mitigation11case or none at all), but also counsel's ability to competently recommend against waiver. See Commentary to 1989 Death Penalty Guidelines § 11.4.1 ("Without investigation, counsel's evaluation and advice amount to little more than a guess").Third, even when counsel advises a client to present mitigating evidence, deficient investigation may precipitate waiver by disrupting confidence in the attorneyclient relationship. Thorough investigation gives counsel access to important personal information about the client that tends to facilitate a better relationship of trust and understanding. By contrast, a compromised relationship undermines defense counsel's ability to secure necessary cooperation from the defendant and his family, as well as a defendant's confidence in counsel's preferred sentencing strategy.11 A defendant's lack of confidence in counsel's mitigation strategy may in turn contribute to the decision to waive.Under any of these three scenarios, counsel's deficient investigation can prejudice the sentencing outcome by causing a capital defendant to forego his Eighth Amendment right to present sentencing evidence to a jury.Deficient investigation also increases the likelihood of a death sentence by reducing a prosecutor's incentive to de-capitalize the proceeding. Specifically, it reduces the prosecutorial incentive to charge defendants with noncapital offenses, to decline to seek death sentences11 See Russell Stetler, Commentary on Counsel's Duty to Seek and Negotiate a Disposition in Capital Cases, 31 HOFSTRA L. REV. 1157, 1163 (2003) ("Life-history investigation not only unearths mitigation evidence but also identifies the support system that may motivate a client to want to live, even behind bars. This investigation also provides counsel with insight into any mental disorders that may affect the relationship with the legal team and the client's ability to come to terms with his case realistically.").12in cases that remain nominally capital, and to make plea bargains. See Commentary to ABA Criminal Justice Standards § 4-4.1 (noting that the lawyer has an important role to play in raising mitigating factors to the prosecutor, which may cause the prosecutor to defer or abandon prosecution).The 2003 Death Penalty Guidelines were not formally in effect during the trial of this case, but 2003 Guidelines § 10.9.1 (Duty to Seek an Agreed-Upon Disposition) is a consolidated version of several 1989 Guidelines.12 The Commentary to the 2003 Guidelines explains how important the mitigation investigation is to plea negotiations:[P]lea bargains in capital cases are not usually offered but instead must be pursued and won. . . . In many jurisdictions, the prosecution will consider waiving the death penalty after the defense makes a proffer of the mitigating evidence that would be presented at the penalty phase and explains why death would be legally and/or factually inappropriate. . . . [Whether such consideration is formal or informal], the mitigation investigation is crucial to persuading the prosecution not to seek death.Commentary to 2003 Guidelines § 10.9.1, reported at 31 HOFSTRA L. REV. 913, 1040-41 (2003) (quotations and citations omitted). An empirical study performed for the Texas Indigent Defense Commission concluded that "greater investment in mitigation" entails "[d]evelop[ing] a defense narrative . . . [that] can often12 See § 11.6.1 (Plea Negotiation Process), § 11.6.2 (Contents of Plea Negotiations), and § 11.6.3 (Decision to Enter a Guilty Plea).13dissuade prosecutors from pursuing a capital death trial."13In sum, a deficient mitigation investigation can have a "reasonable probability" of affecting a sentencing outcome even if a defendant waives the Eighth Amendment right to present mitigating evidence to a fact-finder. Indeed, when the deficiency causes such a waiver, it has prejudiced the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel and should not be countenanced.III. THE FIFTH CIRCUIT RULE PERVERSELY ENSURES THAT THE MOST DEFICIENT INVESTIGATIONS WILL TRIGGER NOPREJUDICE FINDINGS.Loden establishes a perverse rule under which the greatest investigatory deficiencies will be the most likely to trigger findings of no prejudice. Defense counsel's failure to perform an adequate mitigation investigation left Mr. Loden with a Hobson's choice during his penalty phase: Because he could not present a coherent or compelling mitigation case, his only other option was simply to forego an evidentiary presentation. The fact that Mr. Loden had to make such a "choice" establishes the prejudice the Fifth Circuit found lacking.Moreover, unless reversed, the Fifth Circuit's Loden rule will tend to predetermine no-prejudice findings precisely when counsel has been the least diligent. The more deficient the investigation, the less mitigating evidence will be available, and the more likely it is that the defendant will have no viable options other13 Public Policy Research Inst., Judgment and Justice: An Evaluation of the Texas Regional Public Defender for Capital Cases, at viii (June 2013), available at http://tidc.texas.gov/ media/18616/130607_finalcapitaldefenderreport.pdf.14than waiver. In addition, if counsel fails to build the trust and rapport facilitated by a thorough mitigation investigation, the more abandoned and hopeless the defendant is likely to feel, which may also contribute to a waiver. Thus, the less time and effort counsel devotes to developing mitigating evidence, the more likely the defendant is to believe that his only choice is to forego a mitigation case, even though such a case might have been compelling if counsel had explored the evidence and explained its potential impact. This result is inconsistent with the Court's precedents explaining the importance of a thorough investigation of mitigating evidence, and with the ABA's Standards for Criminal Justice and Guidelines that set out the prevailing professional norms for effective representation in capital cases.Because the more inadequate the representation, the more likely the waiver becomes, the Fifth Circuit's Loden rule is most pernicious when counsel's conduct is most deficient. No Supreme Court precedent, including Landrigan, supports such a result. In Landrigan, this Court carefully explained why there was no chance that a deficient investigation induced the client's waiver--the defendant in that case faced no Hobson's choice.This Court's review is necessary to consider the distinction between a defendant like Mr. Landrigan, who was a "bright star" in the "constellation of refusals to have mitigating evidence presented," Landrigan v. Stewart, 272 F.3d 1221, 1226 (9th Cir. 2001), and a defendant like Mr. Loden, for whom the Eighth Amendment waiver may have been a direct result of counsel's inadequate investigation. In recognition of the profound practical and doctrinal implications of15 the Fifth Circuit's rule, this Court should grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the ABA respectfully urges this Court to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: CLAUDIA WILSON FROST LEE KOVARSKY DAWN JENKINS CHRIS RICHARTWILLIAM C.

I. THE STATUTORY TEXT, STRUCTURE, AND HISTORY DICTATE A NARROW READING OF THE ILLICIT TRAFFICKING AGGRAVATED FELONY PROVISION LIMITED TO FELONIES THAT INVOLVE TRAFFICKING.The INA provides that "illicit trafficking in a controlled substance . . . including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) . . .)" constitutes an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B). Section 924(c), Title 18, in turn defines a "drug trafficking crime" as "any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act" and two other federal criminal statutes. 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). The INA defines neither "felony" nor "trafficking" as those terms relate to the "illicit trafficking" "aggravated felony" provision. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and federal courts have failed to develop a consistent and coherent view of how this provision applies to state simple possession offenses.5 Because all trafficking is a felony under federal law, state-law felony trafficking offenses are necessarily federal felonies. See 21 U.S.C. § 841.7 Initially, the BIA held that by including offenses covered under the federal criminal code's definition of "drug trafficking crime," the INA includes a state possession offense analogous to a federal felony, even if it is not a statelaw felony. See In re K-V-D, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1163 (B.I.A. 1999); In re L-G, 21 I. & N. Dec. 89 (B.I.A. 1995); In re Davis, 20 I. & N. Dec. 536 (B.I.A. 1992).6 This is the "hypothetical federal felony" approach. The BIA then changed course, holding that it would follow the relevant circuit's rule or, if there was no circuit authority, the majority rule. The BIA viewed the majority rule as being that the state designation controls: if a drug offense is a state-law felony it is an aggravated felony, regardless of whether it involves trafficking. See In re Yanez-Garcia, 23 I. & N. Dec. 390 (B.I.A. 2002); In re Santos-Lopez, 23 I. & N. Dec. 419 (B.I.A. 2002).Some federal appellate decisions follow the hypothetical federal felony approach. See, e.g., Gerbier v. Holmes, 280 F.3d 297 (3d Cir. 2002). Others apply the state law designation. See, e.g., United States v. Restrepo-Aguilar, 74 F.3d 361 (1st Cir. 1996). And one appeals court has taken an either/or approach, holding that an offense is an aggravated felony if it would be a felony under either state or federal law. See United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, 412 F.3d 572 (5th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1142 (2006).Thus, depending on the jurisdiction, a non-citizen convicted of simple possession may be deemed to have committed an aggravated felony on the ground that (a) the offense is analogous to a federal drug felony; (b) the offense6 The illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision was enacted in 1990. See Immigration Act of 1990 § 501, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978, 5048, as corrected by the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 § 306(a)(1), Pub. L. No. 102-232, 105 Stat. 1733, 1751.8 is classified as a state-law felony; or (c) either one of these circumstances exists.Yet a coherent approach faithful to the statutory text and applicable to a range of factual contexts is possible. That textually faithful approach encompasses but goes beyond the hypothetical federal felony approach. It requires including as illicit trafficking aggravated felonies only those offenses that actually involve trafficking and that are not misdemeanors under either federal or state law. As discussed in Section I, the statutory text, structure, and legislative history dictate this reading. And as discussed in Sections II and III, the problems caused by a broader reading for the administration of criminal justice and for uniformity in the immigration laws further support the proposed statutory construction. Indeed, neither the rule of lenity nor the principle of constitutional avoidance permit reading the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision to include low-level possession-only crimes.A. Simple Possession, Whether a Felony Under State Law or a Hypothetical Felony Under Federal Law, Does Not Constitute "Illicit Trafficking."The statutory language compels the conclusion that simple possession offenses are not aggravated felonies because "illicit trafficking" does not include mere possession of a controlled substance. In Leocal, this Court, construing another aggravated felony provision, unanimously reaffirmed that statutory terms should be given their "ordinary or natural meaning." 543 U.S. at 9 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).77 Thus, driving under the influence of alcohol and causing serious bodily injury is not a "crime of violence" aggravated felony, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F), because "[t]he ordinary meaning of this term [crime of violence] . . . cannot be said naturally to include DUI offenses," Leocal, 543 U.S. at 11. This analysis reflects the long-established principle that the inquiry into statutory meaning necessarily begins with the plain language. See, e.g., Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 144 (1995).9 Petitioner correctly explains that the natural reading of the statute is that a simple possession offense that is a statelaw felony but a federal-law misdemeanor is not an illicit trafficking aggravated felony. See Lopez Br. I.A. Leocal, however, requires a further conclusion: because simple possession does not constitute trafficking, no simple possession offense, including one hypothetically punishable as a federal felony, constitutes an illicit trafficking aggravated felony.The argument made for deeming state-law felony possession offenses to be aggravated felonies is that the INA refers to "drug trafficking (as defined in Section 924(c) . . .)"; Section 924(c) refers to "any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act"; and, allegedly, "any felony" includes any state-law felony. See Lopez v. Gonzalez, 417 F.3d 934 (8th Cir. 2005). The argument made for considering second or subsequent state-law misdemeanors is that, under federal criminal law, a second possession offense under certain circumstances may be prosecuted as a felony. See 21 U.S.C. § 844; see also Sanchez-Villalobos, 412 F.3d at 577. This is said to render such a misdemeanor offense a Section 924(c) "drug trafficking crime," and therefore an illicit trafficking aggravated felony. Id.But the subcategory of Section 924(c) "drug trafficking crime[s]" "includ[ed]" in the principal category of "illicit trafficking" "aggravated felonies" may not swallow the principal "illicit trafficking" category. See Federal Land Bank v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U.S. 95, 100 (1941) ("[T]he term `including' . . . connotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle."). And the "ordinary or natural" meaning of "illicit trafficking" requires more than mere possession. See Compact Oxford English Dictionary 2092 (2d ed. 1999) (defining "traffic" as "[t]he buying or selling or exchange of goods for profit; bargaining; trade"); cf. Salinas v. United States, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 1675 (2006)10 (per curiam) (holding that simple possession does not constitute a "controlled substance offense" under the Sentencing Guidelines because the relevant Guideline pertains to "possession . . . with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).Thus, the natural reading of the aggravated felony provision is that it creates a single "illicit trafficking" category that "includ[es]" as a subset those felony violations of three designated federal statutes that themselves include a "trafficking element." In other words, even if all offenses punishable as felonies under the three statutes enumerated in Section 924(c) constitute Section 924(c) "drug trafficking crimes," it does not follow that all "drug trafficking crimes," including misdemeanor crimes hypothetically punishable as federal felonies, constitute "illicit trafficking" under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B). Therefore, simple possession offenses, irrespective of their misdemeanor or felony classification, do not constitute illicit trafficking aggravated felonies.B. To be an "Aggravated Felony," a State Offense Must Be a Felony Under State Law.The ABA agrees with Petitioner that a state felony possession offense that would be a misdemeanor under federal law is not an "illicit trafficking" "aggravated felony." This conclusion should not be taken, however, to suggest that because a second or subsequent state-law misdemeanor possession offense might be prosecuted as a felony under federal law, the offense constitutes an aggravated felony.88 Petitioner does not address this issue because his offense is a state felony. The Court need not reach this question here. However, in other cases, it has been argued or courts have found that state misdemeanor drug possession offenses are aggravated felonies under the hypothetical federal felony approach. See, e.g., Sanchez-Villalobos, 412 F.3d 572. This is not a proper application of the hypothetical federal felony11 The natural meaning of the term "aggravated" modifying "felony" is that "aggravated felony" includes only particularly serious felonies. See Compact Oxford English Dictionary 28 (defining "aggravated" as "Increased, magnified; Increased in gravity or seriousness: made worse or more grievous; intensified in evil character"); see also Leocal, 543 U.S. at 9.9 The statutory structure and history further show that "aggravated felonies" do not include nonfelony offenses.Other INA amendments enacted simultaneously with the "aggravated felony" provision reflect that Congress intended that this provision include only felonies.10 For example, Congress revised the immigration detention provisions to require detention of "any alien convicted of an aggravated felony," and directed that "the Attorney General shall notapproach, see infra p.29; Steele v. Blackman, 236 F.3d 130 (3d Cir. 2001), and is incorrect for the other reasons set forth in this brief. 9 As one circuit judge observed:Common sense and standard English grammar dictate that when an adjective ­ such as "aggravated" ­ modifies a noun ­ such as "felony" ­ the combination of the terms delineates a subset of the noun. One would never suggest, for example, that by adding the adjective "blue" to the noun "car," one could be attempting to define items that are not, in the first instance, cars. In other words, based on the plain meaning of the terms "aggravated" and "felony," we should presume that the specifics that follow in the definition of "aggravated felony" under INA § 101(a)(43) serve to elucidate what makes these particular felonies "aggravated"; we certainly should not presume that those specifics would include offenses that are not felonies at all.United States v. Pacheco, 225 F.3d 148, 157 (2d Cir. 2000) (Straub, J, dissenting). 10 See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 ("ADAA"), Pub. L. No. 100-690, § 7342, 102 Stat. 4181, 4469; see generally Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 51 (1987) ("[I]n expounding a statute, we [are] not . . . guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).12 release such felon from custody."11 ADAA § 7343(a)(4), 102 Stat. at 4470. Congress also amended the criminal provision for illegal reentry after deportation to provide for different sentence enhancements depending on whether the prior deportation was subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction or, instead, to conviction for "a felony (other than an aggravated felony)." Id. § 7345(a)(2), 102 Stat. at 4471.12 Congress later added an enhancement if the prior deportation followed a conviction for "three or more misdemeanors." Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, § 130001(b), 108 Stat. 1796, 2023. Thus, Congress distinguished between misdemeanors and aggravated felonies within the same statutory provision.13 The legislative history of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ("IIRIRA"), which amended the "aggravated felony" definition, further supports the distinction. See Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, § 321, 11011 See also id. § 7347(a), 102 Stat. at 4471-72 ("With respect to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony who is taken into custody by the Attorney General . . . the Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent practicable, detain any such felon at a facility at which other such aliens are detained."). 12 In 1990 and 1991 amendments, Congress also clarified that state drug offenses may be deemed aggravated felonies and barred waiver of exclusion for aggravated felons, see Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, §§ 501(a)(3), 511(a), 104 Stat. 4978, 5048, 5052, if the individual had served "for such felony or felonies" a five-year or more term of imprisonment, Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-232, § 306(a)(10), 105 Stat. 1733, 1751. 13 Congress saw no need to add a parenthetical "(other than an aggravated felony)" to the "three or more misdemeanor" provision, plainly contemplating overlap between the terms "felony" and "aggravated felony" but not between "misdemeanor" and "aggravated felony." See Leocal, 543 U.S. at 12 (holding that the fact that the statute separately listed and distinguished between "crime of violence" and "DUI" for purposes other than the aggravated felony definition, "reinforc[ed]" the conclusion that a DUI is not a crime of violence aggravated felony).13 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-627 to -628. Proponents of the IIRIRA amendments referred to the crimes and individuals they wished included as "felonious acts," "convicted felons," and "serious felonies," in addition to "aggravated felonies" and "aggravated felons." 142 Cong. Rec. S4592-01, S4598S4600 (May 2, 1996).14Thus, the statutory structure and legislative history reinforce that Congress knew how to, and did, distinguish between felons and misdemeanants. It intended that the aggravated felony provision apply only to felony offenses.II. SUBJECTING NON-CITIZENS TO MANDATORY DEPORTATION FOR LOW-LEVEL SIMPLE POSSESSION OFFENSES ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE INTEGRITY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.Any drug offense, including simple possession (other than a single offense of possession for personal use of 30 grams or less of marijuana), renders a non-citizen deportable. 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). In many cases the United States appropriately removes non-citizens for committing crimes, including drug offenses. But Petitioner and other noncitizens convicted of low-level possession offenses have not merely been deemed "deportable" (meaning there would still be the possibility of discretionary relief). Rather, they are subject to mandatory deportation and other extreme immigration consequences as "aggravated felons."Imposing such harsh immigration consequences for lowlevel offenses has unanticipated adverse consequences for the14 Also, in a colloquy about IIRIRA's restoration of eligibility for deportation relief to "aliens who have not committed aggravated felonies," Senator Hatch explained that this was in response to earlier restrictions barring relief "for virtually any alien who had been convicted of any crime, including some misdemeanors." 142 Cong. Rec. S1229401, S12295 (Oct. 3, 1996).14 justice system. Not only does it result in injustices for individual defendants, but it negatively affects the role of prosecutors, defense counsel, and judges. The statutory provision at issue should be construed, under the rules of lenity and constitutional avoidance, to maintain and promote the fairness and integrity of the justice system.A. The Severity of the Collateral Consequences ofAggravatedFelonyConvictionsisDisproportionate to the Criminal Justice System'sTreatment of Low-Level Possession Offenses.The immigration consequences of an aggravated felony conviction are myriad and severe. Such a conviction bars discretionary relief from deportation, known as cancellation of removal.15 See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). A non-citizen convicted of such an offense may not request that an immigration judge consider the offense's actual severity, the individual's equities, and the interests of the United States.16 Aggravated felony convictions also bar asylum, id. § 1158(b)(2)(B), and may preclude withholding of removal, another type of deportation relief, id. § 1231(b)(3)(B).17Commission of any crime is a serious matter, but not all crimes are of equal gravity. ABA policy recognizes that convictions for misdemeanors under either federal or state law should not result in mandatory, extreme immigration15 Non-citizens have long been deportable for some crimes, but discretionary relief existed. See St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 294-96. IIRIRA eliminated such relief for "aggravated felons." 16 In a cancellation of removal hearing, the judge may waive deportation based on factors such as the non-citizen's family ties in the U.S., residence of long duration in this country, hardship to the family, service in the U.S. Armed Forces, history of steady employment, existence of property or business ties, proof of rehabilitation, and other equities such as value and service to the community. See, e.g., In re C-V-T, 22 I. & N. Dec. 7 (B.I.A. 1998). 17 A post-1990 aggravated felony also permanently bars naturalization. See id. §§ 1101(f)(8), 1427(a)(3).15 consequences. See ABA Report 300 at 1. ABA policies also recognize that collateral consequences should correspond to the seriousness of the conduct involved. See ABA Criminal Justice Standards 19-1.2 and 19-2.2. Broadly construing the "illicit trafficking" "aggravated felony" provision to include offenses that do not involve trafficking, and that would be misdemeanors under either federal or state law, creates stark disproportionality between the offense and its collateral consequences.18 As Petitioner's case illustrates, under the broad reading of the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision currently being applied in immigration proceedings, a single simple possession offense triggers mandatory deportation. It is plainly legitimate for a state, such as South Dakota, to treat simple possession as a felony to effectuate local criminal justice policies. See Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 93 (1985). But states do not legislate criminal law with collateral immigration consequences in mind. Even if the state classifies an offense as a felony, traditional criminal justice goals are typically served by punishing the offender sufficiently to achieve retribution and deterrence, while at the same time permitting rehabilitation and reassimilation into society. Permanently and automatically banishing an individual from the country may go well beyond those goals.The disproportionality that results from imposing mandatory deportation is even more apparent when18 Indeed, the term "conviction" as used in the INA includes dispositions for which the sentence was suspended, or for which the penalty consisted of participation in rehabilitative programs, community service, or fines. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48). Withheld adjudications and deferred prosecutions are also included. In re Punu, 22 I. & N. Dec. 224 (B.I.A. 1998). A disposition that is not a "conviction" under state criminal law may still be a "conviction" for immigration purposes. In re Salazar-Regino, 23 I. & N. Dec. 223, 231 (B.I.A. 2002) (en banc).16 misdemeanor offenses are considered.19 Misdemeanor possession charges tend to result in probation, time served, or lesser penalties, rather than incarceration.20That some states have chosen to reduce sentences or otherwise ameliorate criminal justice consequences for drug possession offenses further illustrates the disparity between the criminal justice treatment of low-level possession crimes, and the severity of mandatory deportation as a collateral consequence.21 Arizona, for example, mandates probation and treatment for certain first and second-time drug19 Misdemeanor possession offenses exist in many jurisdictions. See, e.g., Alaska Stat. § 11.71.050 (various controlled substances, including marijuana and barbituates); Del. Code 16 §§ 4753-4754 (any narcotic); Haw. Rev. Stat. § 712-1246.5 ("any harmful drug"); Mass. Gen. Laws 94C § 34 (any controlled substance except second heroin offense); Mich. Comp. Laws § 333.7403 (marijuana and various hallucinogens); N.Y. Penal Law § 220.03 (any controlled substance); Tenn. Crim. Code § 3917-418 (cocaine); Wyo. Stat. § 35-7-1031(c) (any controlled substance). 20 See, e.g., Stephanie Morin, New York State Defenders Assoc., Analysis of New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services Misdemeanor Drug Offense Statistics for the Years 1995 Through 2004 (Oct. 15, 2005), http://www.nysda.org/idp/docs/05_Analysis.pdf; New York State Dispositions ­ 1995 through 2004, http://www.nysda.org/idp/ docs/NYS.Conviction.Sent.and.Len.pdf (in over 60% of the 258,655 New York misdemeanor possession convictions from 1995-2004, the defendant received time served, probation, conditional discharge, or a fine); Mass. Dep't of Corr., New Court Commitments to Massachusetts County Correctional Facilities During 2004, at 16 tbl. 15 (Nov. 2005), http://www.mass.gov/Eeops/docs/doc/research_reports/2004cty.pdf (showing that persons convicted of simple possession represent a small fraction of those incarcerated in Massachusetts for drug offenses). 21 See Jon Wool & Don Stemen, Changing Fortunes or Changing Attitudes? Sentencing and Corrections Reforms in 2003, at 1 (Mar. 2004), http://www.vera.org/publication_pdf/226_431.pdf (in 2003 "[t]hirteen states made significant changes, ranging from the repeal or reduction of mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related offenses to the expansion of treatment-centered alternatives to incarceration"); see also id. at 1-2, 14 (noting that some states have concluded that incarceration-focused approaches to possession crimes are unsuccessful).17 possession offenders.22 California passed a similar law,23 and Texas has decided to punish low-level, first-time possession offenses classified as felonies with community supervision and substance abuse treatment, not incarceration.24Finally, defendants charged with low-level possession offenses may receive minimal procedural protections. This reflects the high volume of such offenses and the expectation that minimal criminal law consequences will result. In New York State, for example, there are tens of thousands of misdemeanor possession arrests annually. New York State Div. of Crim. Just. Servs., Adult Arrests: N.Y. State by County and Region 1994, http://criminaljustice.state.ny.us/ crimnet/ojsa/arrests/year1994.htm. New York City criminal court judges handle thousands of cases per year. Daniel Wise, Caseloads Skyrocket in Brooklyn Courts: Upswing Linked to NYPD Narcotics Investigation, N.Y. L.J., May 22, 2000, at 1. Most of these misdemeanors are of necessity processed extremely quickly and without substantial procedural protections. To varying degrees, this is true throughout the country. Providing relatively few procedural protections in a criminal case with low stakes may be appropriate; where mandatory deportation results, however,22 Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-901.01; see also State v. Gomez, 127 P.3d 873, 877 (Ariz. 2006) (describing the intent behind the Arizona statute as being a desire to more effectively treat drug addicts and to save the state millions of dollars in incarceration costs). 23 See Cal. Penal Code § 1210.1 (requiring probation for most first or second nonviolent drug possession convictions); People v. Williams, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 546, 549-50 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003). 24 See Tex. Crim. P. Code art. 42.12 § 15(a)(1) (as amended by Texas H.B. 2668, Chapter 1122 (2003)); Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 481.115(b), 481.1151(b)(1), 481.116(b), 481.121(b)(3), 481.129(g)(1); see also Holcomb v. State, 146 S.W.3d 723, 733 (Tex. App. 2004) ("The 2003 [Texas sentencing] amendment . . . require[s] mandatory clemency in the form of probation rather than leaving probation to the discretion of the trial court.").18 the stakes are considerably higher than such treatment warrants.B. Disproportionality Between Collateral and Direct Consequences Compromises the Integrity of the Criminal Justice System.Where collateral immigration consequences greatly outweigh direct criminal consequences of a conviction, injustices for the defendant are not the only result. This disproportionality also adversely affects the administration of the criminal justice system and its key actors ­ prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges. Robert Johnson, a former President of the National District Attorneys Association and a current officer of the ABA's Criminal Justice Section task force, has described these problems:Increasingly we see situations in which the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction exceed the consequences that are imposed by a judge upon sentencing. . . . . A foreigner legally in this country for many years, who may be married to a U.S. citizen and/or parent of U.S. citizens, can be deported for relatively minor offenses. . . .[A]s prosecutors, we see the effects of these collateral consequences. When the consequences are significant and out of anyone's control, victims of criminal conduct are less likely to cooperate. Defendants will go to trial more often if the result of a conviction is out of the control of the prosecutor and judge and is disproportionate to the offense and offender. . . . [M]any judges change their rulings, sentencing felonies as misdemeanors and expunging records to avoid what they believe to be an unjust result. A judge in my jurisdiction once allowed a felon to withdraw his plea of guilty after he served his prison sentence to avoid a deportation. . . .19 [T]he collateral consequences of a conviction are so severe that we are unable to deliver a proportionate penalty in the criminal justice system without disproportionate collateral consequences. As a prosecutor, you must comprehend this full range of consequences that flow from a crucial conviction. If not, we will suffer the disrespect and lose the confidence of the very society we seek to protect.25Disproportionality between collateral and direct consequences adversely affects the prosecutorial function. "The duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice, not merely to convict." ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function, Standard 3-1.2(c) (3d ed. 1993). In order to carry out that duty, prosecutors enjoy broad discretion to decide whether and what charges to bring against an individual. See id. Commentary to ABA Criminal Justice Standard 3-1.2(c) at 5. Taking into account collateral consequences goes hand in hand with these obligations.26Where collateral consequences are excessive in relation to the offense and cannot be averted upon conviction, however, prosecutors may find themselves sacrificing traditional criminal justice principles. Pursuing a conviction may serve the goals of punishment or deterrence but cannot be reconciled with the duty to seek justice. This can lead25 Message from the President Robert M.A. Johnson, Nat. Dist. Attys. Ass'n, The Prosecutor, May/June 2001, http://www.ndaa-apri.org/ndaa/ about/president_message_may_ june_2001.html ("Message from the President, NDAA"). 26 See id. Standard 3-3.9(b)(iii) (in deciding whether to bring charges a prosecutor may consider disproportion of the authorized punishment to the particular offense or offender); NDAA, National Prosecution Standards 42.3 (2d ed. 1991) (prosecutors may consider "[u]ndue hardship caused to the accused" in deciding whether to bring charges).20 prosecutors to change a charge's wording or which offense is charged, or even to decline to bring low-level charges.27In the process, state criminal law enforcement may be distorted. The non-citizen may suffer injustice if harsh immigration consequences result from a low-level offense conviction. Yet averting such consequences can require extraordinary steps that impede the fulfillment of criminal justice goals. A prosecutor might charge a non-citizen with a lesser crime to avoid excessive collateral immigration consequences. Ironically, a U.S. citizen who engages in the same conduct may therefore be charged more severely and receive harsher treatment than a non-citizen. See Mikos, Enforcing State Law in Congress's Shadow, 90 Cornell L. Rev. at 1424-25 & n.37.Disproportionate collateral consequences also adversely affect the prosecutorial function because those consequences can dramatically alter defendants' incentives. The incentive to go to trial increases greatly where mandatory deportation will follow a plea, see St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 323, even where criminal justice considerations (such as the likelihood of conviction or the prospect of an acceptable criminal sanction upon a plea) dictate otherwise. Yet prosecutors, like defense counsel, face resource constraints. Plea bargaining obviates the need for trial and concomitant expense, relieves uncertainty, and gives the parties some control over the resulting disposition. Resolving cases by plea in appropriate circumstances is therefore, as a practical matter, critical to the administration of criminal justice and to prosecutors' ability to manage their resources. Relatively minor offenses such as simple possession crimes are prime candidates for27 See Robert A. Mikos, Enforcing State Law in Congress's Shadow, 90 Cornell L. Rev. 1411, 1454-55 (2005) (discussing examples in which prosecutors went to great lengths to circumvent defendant's deportation); Susan L. Pilcher, Justice Without a Blindfold: Criminal Proceedings and the Alien Defendant, 50 Ark. L. Rev. 269, 303-06 (1997)).21 resolution by plea. Prosecutors face significantly increased resource pressures where defendants go to trial because a plea would trigger mandatory deportation.The disparity between collateral and criminal consequences also affects defense counsel's role. Where mandatory deportation will result from a conviction, a defense attorney will often pursue any and all strategies to avoid that result. As one widely used criminal defense practice guide explains: "[T]he permanent immigration consequences greatly outweigh the criminal consequences in the vast majority of all criminal cases. . . . [M]ost defendants[] who . . . understand the exact meaning of the adverse immigration consequences of a proposed plea bargain, will be willing to sacrifice traditional criminal defense goals in order to protect their immigration status." Norton Tooby & Katherine A. Brady, Criminal Defense of Immigrants § 1.4 at 20 (3d ed. 2003). For example, assuming the non-citizen defendant considers avoiding mandatory deportation critical (almost invariably so), defense counsel is far more likely than in the ordinary case to advise that client to go to trial. See id. The more broadly the aggravated felony provision is construed, the more counsel's decisions are affected.The defense function is also affected in other ways. Counsel should accurately advise clients of collateral consequences.28 This is even more critical where the stakes are as high as mandatory deportation. See St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 322 n.48; see also, e.g., People v. Correa, 485 N.E.2d 307 (Ill. 1985). Indeed, inaccurate advice may be a basis for a defendant to withdraw or attack a plea, including by claiming28 See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty, Standard 143.2(f) (3d ed. 1999) ("To the extent possible, defense counsel should determine and advise the defendant sufficiently in advance of the entry of any pleas, as to the possible collateral consequences[.]").22 ineffective counsel.29 Yet it is extraordinarily difficult to advise clients when the immigration statute is read in an overly broad and non-coherent manner. Deeming low-level possession offenses to be "illicit trafficking" "aggravated felonies" is such a reading. These offenses involve no trafficking and are misdemeanors under either federal or state law. So construed, the statute can be a labyrinth of traps for the unwary, even for counsel armed with manuals such as the ABA's The Criminal Lawyer's Guide to Immigration Law ­ Questions and Answers. That most defense counsel are under-funded public defenders or legal service providers with high caseloads renders the problem more acute.Finally, where the offense is classified as a misdemeanor under state law, there is a realistic possibility that a defendant could be unrepresented. Many states permit conviction for a misdemeanor without counsel if there will be no incarceration.30 The critical defense role of accurately29 See Rollins v. State, 277 Ga. 488, 492 (Ga. 2004) (holding that defendant who was erroneously advised that drug possession plea under state's First Offender Act would not result in deportation was entitled to withdraw plea); In re Resendiz, 25 Cal. 4th 230, 248 (2001) (holding that misadvice regarding immigration consequences may constitute ineffective assistance); Correa, 108 Ill. 2d at 553 ("[E]rroneous and misleading advice on the crucial consequence of deportation [meant] the defendant's pleas of guilty were not intelligently and knowingly made and therefore were not voluntary[.]"). See also ABA Criminal Justice Standard 14-2.1 (providing that a court should permit withdrawal of a plea if involuntary). 30 States in which misdemeanor possession convictions may be uncounseled include Florida, see Fla. Stat. § 893.13(6)(a) (first degree misdemeanor marijuana possession offense); Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.111(b)(1) (no right to counsel if judge certifies there will be no incarceration); Fla. Stat. § 27.512 (court may not appoint public defender if has issued noincarceration order), Massachusetts, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C § 34; id. ch. 274 § 1 (first and second marijuana possession offenses are misdemeanors); id. ch. 211D § 2A (no counsel appointed of the judge states on the record that a misdemeanor defendant will not be sentenced to incarceration); and New Hampshire, see N.H. Rev. Stat. § 318-B:2623 advising a defendant of immigration consequences is necessarily undermined where there is no counsel. See ABA Criminal Justice Standard 14-3.2(f). Yet second or subsequent misdemeanors have been deemed aggravated felonies. See, e.g., Sanchez-Villalobos, 412 F.3d 572.Nor is the role of the judiciary unaffected. Judges recognize that extreme immigration consequences may not be warranted in every case. ABA Standards support this principal.31 In order to render justice and avoid condemning non-citizen defendants to mandatory deportation, judges may exercise leniency or otherwise take steps not ordinarily taken. See Message from the President, NDAA.Judges too are burdened by the incentives disproportionate collateral consequences create for noncitizen defendants. In criminal courts around the country, defendants charged with minor offenses may be arraigned, plead guilty, and be sentenced all on the same day. Judges may not have the luxury of spending more than a few minutes on each case. State criminal justice systems have come to rely heavily on plea bargaining to diminish the administrative burden of dealing with large numbers of cases, including low-level drug crimes. See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 260 (1971) ("If every criminal charge were subjected to a full-scale trial, the States and the Federal Government would need to multiply by many times the number of judges and court facilities."). But defendants(class A misdemeanor marijuana possession offense); id. § 625:9 (VII) (a prosecutor may change a nonviolent class A misdemeanor charge to a class B misdemeanor charge) (amended in non-relevant part by 2006 N.H. Laws Ch. 64 (H.B. 1636)); id. § 604-A:2 (no right to appointed counsel for class B misdemeanors). 31 See ABA Criminal Justice Standards 19-1.2 & 19-2.2; see also id. Standard 19-2.4 (courts should take into account collateral sanctions in determining a sentence, and should inform the defendant of those sanctions); id. Standard 19-2.5 (courts should be authorized to grant relief from collateral sanctions).24 facing mandatory deportation are far more likely not only to go to trial but also to litigate post-conviction, such as by seeking to withdraw pleas or to appeal or collaterally attack their convictions. Judges, as well as prosecutors and defense counsel, therefore must expend valuable resources that might be better dedicated to matters other than intensive litigation over low-level charges.In sum, the disproportionality between the collateral consequences of aggravated felony convictions and the direct consequences of low-level possession crimes produces myriad adverse affects on the fair and orderly administration of criminal justice.C. The Rules of Lenity and Constitutional Avoidance, and the Fair and Regular Administration of Criminal Justice, Require a Narrow Reading of the Illicit Trafficking Aggravated Felony Provision.Deeming low-level drug possession offenses to be illicit trafficking aggravated felonies creates a dramatic disparity between collateral and direct criminal consequences. Should the Court find the statute ambiguous, the rules of lenity and constitutional avoidance apply. Each canon compels the conclusion that the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision only applies to felony offenses involving trafficking.The well-settled rule of lenity requires that "any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes [be construed] in favor of the alien." INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449 (1987); see also United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 348-49 (1971) (rule of lenity applies to criminal law provisions). A key principle animating this rule is that "fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed." Bass, 404 U.S. at 348; see also St. Cyr, 533 U.S.25 at 321 (explaining that considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations properly play a role in statutory interpretation). Fair warning is sorely lacking when simple possession crimes trigger mandatory deportation for "illicit trafficking." Similarly, any ambiguity as to the meaning of "aggravated felony" must be resolved in favor of a narrow reading that does not include misdemeanors. Individuals charged with misdemeanor possession offenses lack fair notice that they will be deemed "aggravated felons." Indeed, the criminal justice system commonly treats these offenses in a summary fashion, with minimal procedural protections and speedy disposition by plea bargain in almost all cases. These defendants can reasonably expect relatively minor direct criminal consequences. For mandatory deportation to follow is quite another matter.32The rule of constitutional avoidance also counsels that illicit trafficking aggravated felonies do not include low-level possession crimes. Assuming there were "two plausible statutory constructions to adopt, a court must consider the necessary consequences of its choice. If one of them would raise a multitude of constitutional problems, the other should prevail[.]" Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 380-81 (2005). This principle "rest[s] on the reasonable presumption that Congress did not intend the alternative which raises serious constitutional doubts." Id. at 381.33 Deeming low-level simple possession to constitute an illicit trafficking aggravated felony threatens to run afoul of the void for32 The rule of lenity compels reading the statute to exclude low-level possession crimes for additional reasons as well. See Lopez Br. at III.B & C; Toledo-Flores Br. at E. 33 See also Adrian Vermeule, Saving Constructions, 85 Geo. L.J. 1945, 1960-61 (1997) (providing examples of cases where the Court construed a statute narrowly to avoid a constitutional question ultimately resolved in favor of the broader reading).26 vagueness doctrine, itself based in the Due Process Clause. See Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S. 223, 230 (1951). That doctrine, applicable in the immigration context "in view of the grave nature of deportation," requires that a statute "convey[] sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices." Id. at 231-32. Such warning is lacking in cases involving low-level possession offenses, including Petitioner's as well as second or subsequent misdemeanors.34 The "illicit trafficking" "aggravated felony" statutory language does not convey that such offenses would be included. The manner in which the criminal justice system deals with such offenses further demonstrates this point. These offenses may be addressed in a fairly summary fashion; the direct criminal consequences are relatively low stakes.35 A non-citizen in such circumstances lacks sufficient warning as to deportation consequences.III. THE ILLICIT TRAFFICKING AGGRAVATED FELONY PROVISION SHOULD BE CONSTRUED TO AVOID NON-UNIFORMITY PROBLEMS.Congress is generally presumed to legislate with uniformity in mind. See Jerome v. United States, 318 U.S. 101, 104 (1943) ("[I]n the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, . . . Congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law."). Moreover, immigration law is quintessentially a matter of federal policy and should be uniform.Uniformity in immigration law also has constitutional underpinnings. The one provision in the U.S. Constitution expressly referring to the federal immigration power34 The constitutional avoidance principle applies "whether or not th[e] constitutional problems pertain to the particular litigant before the Court." Clark, 543 U.S. at 724. 35 In some instances, convictions could even be obtained without counsel.27 provides: Congress shall "establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization." U.S. Const. art. I, § 8. Congress's power over naturalization must "necessarily be exclusive [to the federal government]; because if each State had power to prescribe a Distinct Rule, there could be no Uniform Rule." The Federalist No. 32 at 199 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed. 1961).36 This Court has not construed the Uniform Rule provision, but has recognized the principle of uniformity in immigration law. See Henderson v. Mayor of New York, 92 U.S. 259, 273 (1875) ("The laws which govern the right to land passengers in the United States from other countries ought to be the same in New York, Boston, New Orleans, and San Francisco," requiring "a uniform system or plan[.]"); Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 73 (1941) ("[T]he treatment of aliens, in whatever state they may be located, [is] a matter of national moment.").37ABA policy further counsels uniformity. Limiting collateral sanctions "to those that are specifically warranted by the conduct constituting a particular offense" necessarily means that immigration consequences should not vary based on the arbitrary fact of geography. ABA Criminal Justice Standard 19-1.2. ABA policy that the aggravated felony provision should not be read to include misdemeanors under36 The Constitution refers to naturalization, but "the Federal Government['s]" "broad constitutional powers" include "determining what aliens shall be admitted to the United States, the period they may remain, regulation of their conduct before naturalization, and the terms and conditions of their naturalization." Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410, 419 (1948). Also, aggravated felonies implicate naturalization. See supra p.14 note 17. 37 See also Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 382 (1971) ("Congress' power is to `establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization.' A congressional enactment construed so as to permit state legislatures to adopt divergent laws on the subject of citizenship requirements for federally supported welfare programs would appear to contravene this explicit constitutional requirement of uniformity.").28 either state or federal law also recognizes that including such crimes raises non-uniformity problems. See infra pp.29-30.38Thus, the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision should be construed so as to avoid non-uniformity problems arising from attaching immigration consequences to state-law convictions. Constitutional concerns underscore that Congress did not intend to foster non-uniformity through the aggravated felony provision. See Clark, 543 U.S. at 380-81.As presently applied, the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision triggers varying immigration consequences depending on the geographical happenstance of where the non-citizen was convicted. On the one hand, as Petitioner's case illustrates, simple possession may be deemed an aggravated felony if the offense is a felony under state law. But while some states have made a local policy choice to classify possession crimes as felonies, others have chosen differently. Basing the aggravated felony designation on the state's felony classification has "the paradoxical result of allowing states, in effect, to impose banishment from the United States as a sanction for a violation of state law. For then if a state made the possession of one marijuana cigarette a felony, which it is perfectly entitled to do, it would be in effect annexing banishment from the United States to the criminal sanction." Gonzales-Gomez v. Achim, 441 F.3d 532, 535 (7th Cir. 2006).3938 Uniformity is also a matter of basic fairness. See Francis v. INS, 532 F.2d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 1976) ("Fundamental fairness dictates that permanent resident aliens who are in like circumstances, but for irrelevant and fortuitous factors, be treated in a like manner."). 39 See also Gerbier, 280 F.3d at 312 (noting the "real possibility" of "disparate results" that contravene the uniformity principle if the fact that a state classifies a drug offense as a felony suffices to make it an "aggravated felony"). Nor is this the first time the aggravated felony provision has been applied, at least initially, so as to compromise uniformity. See, e.g., Solorzano-Patlan v. INS, 207 F.3d 869, 874 (7th Cir. 2000) (rejecting the former INS's argument that a non-citizen's29 On the other hand, the approach adopted in some circuits of deeming second or subsequent state-law misdemeanors to be aggravated felonies also raises non-uniformity problems. Such offenses could be prosecuted as felonies under federal law. See 21 U.S.C. § 844. However, federal law imposes strict requirements on the government for doing so. The United States Attorney must file an information alleging, and then must subsequently prove, that the defendant had a valid final conviction for a prior drug offense. See id.; Steele, 236 F.3d at 137-38. The defendant may challenge the prior conviction as unlawfully obtained. See 21 U.S.C. § 851. States vary as to whether they have such procedural schemes for repeat misdemeanor offenses and whether those procedures are utilized.40 Thus, depending on the state at issue, a non-citizen with a second misdemeanor may or may not have received those additional protections.41Non-uniformity also results from deeming second misdemeanor possession convictions to be aggravated felonies for another reason. As described above, the procedural protections afforded during the criminal justice process can vary depending on whether the charge is for a felony or a misdemeanor. See supra pp.16-17. And while states typically classify all offenses actually involving trafficking as felonies, they vary as to how they classify andconviction was a "burglary offense" aggravated felony simply because he was convicted under an Illinois statute entitled "burglary," where other states would not apply that label and the Illinois offense did not correspond to the generic "burglary" definition). 40 Massachusetts, for example, has an enhanced penalty provision for recidivists that imposes analogous requirements. See Mass. G.L. ch. 278, § 11A. But many states do not. 41 Requiring that the state prosecution satisfied procedural requirements analogous to those existing under federal law is one approach to this problem, see Steele, 236 F.3d at 137-38, but does not ameliorate nonuniformity. This rule could only apply in states that have such procedural requirements, and only some states do.30 treat simple possession offenses. In a state where the offense is a misdemeanor, mandatory deportation could result based on a conviction obtained with a lesser degree of due process than in other states. The variance in treatment could be dramatic in congested court systems where misdemeanor offenses may be resolved in a matter of minutes, or in states that may not always provide counsel for a misdemeanor.The statute should be construed to avoid non-uniformity problems. See Clark, 543 U.S. at 380-81. Non-uniformity implicates the "uniform Rule" requirement.42 Moreover, permitting the accident of geography to determine whether an offense is an aggravated felony leads to fair notice problems. A non-citizen cannot be expected to reasonably understand or be able to predict the collateral consequences of a low-level offense conviction in those circumstances. See supra pp.2526. Adopting a narrower reading of the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision avoids these constitutional doubts. The aggravated felony designation should apply only to state-law felonies and only where those felonies are not misdemeanors under federal law. Furthermore, the designation should apply only when trafficking is involved. In this manner, the non-uniformity introduced by sweeping individuals such as Petitioner, or second-time misdemeanants, into the "illicit trafficking" aggravated felony category would be avoided.CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the ABA respectfully submits that the Court should reverse the decision of the Court below.42 See generally Iris E. Bennett, The Unconstitutionality of Nonuniform Immigration Consequences of `Aggravated Felony' Convictions, 74 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1696 (1999).MICHAEL S.

I. THIS COURT SHOULD GRANT CERTIORARI TO CORRECT THE NINTH CIRCUIT'S MISAPPLICATION OF HECK V. HUMPHREY.The ABA urges the Court to grant certiorari to resolve the Circuit split over whether Heck bars a criminal defendant in Taylor's situation from recovering damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 after his conviction has been vacated and he has been released. This Court should hold that it does not.Heck held that, to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, a § 1983 plaintiff must show that the conviction or sentence has been reversed, expunged, or declared invalid in some way. Heck, 512 U.S. at 486-87. The question over which courts have split is whether Heck applies to a prisoner who is not still in custody and lacked any opportunity to seek habeas relief while in custody. It should not.This would be consistent with the narrower view of Heck outlined by the concurring opinion in Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1 (1998), in which Justice Souter, writing for three other justices, agreed that a habeas petition filed by a released prisoner challenging his parole revocation was moot, but hinged that conclusion on his understanding that Heck would not bar a released prisoner from bringing a § 1983 claim. See id., 523 U.S. at 19-21. He emphasized that the petitioner in Heck was "an inmate" still "in custody," and therefore required to exhaust the state appeals process and to secure a favorable termination of the incarceration either14through that process or federal habeas before seeking § 1983 damages. Id. at 19-20. Justice Souter explained that it would be "a patent anomaly" to apply the favorable termination requirement of Heck to a plaintiff not in custody given that such an interpretation would make a person sentenced to a short term, or convicted but not imprisoned, chronically ineligible for relief. Id. at 20. He clarified:[A] former prisoner no longer "in custody" may bring a §1983 action establishing the unconstitutionality of a conviction or confinement without being bound to satisfy a favorable termination requirement that it would be impossible as a matter of law for him to satisfy.Id. at 21. Justice Stevens agreed with that proposition in his dissent. See id. at 24 n.8 ("Given the Court's holding that petitioner does not have a remedy under the habeas statute, it is perfectly clear, as Justice Souter explains, that he may bring an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.").Adopting this view of Heck would result in a uniform, easy-to-understand rule that the lower courts can readily apply. And it would resolve Taylor's case in a manner that avoids the unjust result reached below. Because Taylor is no longer in custody, he may challenge his incarceration through § 1983, whether or not his original conviction is15deemed to have been "favorably terminated" in light of its vacatur.22 ER 137.Importantly, this Court's holding that Heck applies only where the person seeking relief under § 1983 remains imprisoned would also encourage prosecutors to follow the ABA's Prosecutorial Standards and ABA Resolution 112B. With the scope of the Heck bar clearly confined, state and local jurisdictions no longer would have a financial incentive to extract new no-contest or guilty pleas, before agreeing to support a motion to vacate an unlawful conviction. A decision from this Court on whether Heck applies to a situation like Taylor's will not only provide guidance to lower courts, but also to states, local jurisdictions, and prosecutors.II. TAYLOR'S PETITION PRESENTS A QUESTION OF EXCEPTIONAL IMPORTANCE.The issue presented here--whether a state or local jurisdiction may avoid paying civil damages by conditioning the release of a person whose conviction has been shown to be unlawful on a new plea and thus insulating themselves under a broad (and incorrect) reading of Heck--is of exceptional importance. It is critical to the integrity of our prosecutorial system that pleas be free from coercion, particularly where a defendant is22 As Taylor explains, it is highly doubtful whether Heck would bar recovery in the circumstances here, even if Heck applied to former prisoners generally, and that question is itself the subject of a significant split among the lower courts which merits this Court's review. See Pet. 21-26, 29-32.16incarcerated pursuant to a conviction that the prosecutor's office itself acknowledges can no longer be sustained. Demanding that the incarcerated defendant enter a new guilty, no-contest, or Alford plea in such circumstances in order to secure release is at odds with the guidance of the ABA's prosecutorial standards, rules, and resolutions, undermines the integrity of our criminal justice system, and has long-term negative consequences for persons who, like Taylor, accept such pleas out of desperation to secure their release.A. Conditioning the Release of a WrongfullyConvicted Person on a New Plea isInconsistentwiththeABA'sProsecutorial Guidance and Underminesthe Integrity of Our Justice System.ABA Model Rule 3.8(h) directs a prosecutor to remedy a wrongful conviction when she "knows of clear and convincing evidence establishing that [the] defendant . . . was convicted of an offense that the defendant did not commit."23 And Prosecution Function Standard 3-4.3(a) suggests that "[a] prosecutor should seek or file criminal charges only if the prosecutor believes that the charges are supported by probable cause [and] that admissible23 The clear and convincing standard represents the bare minimum expected of prosecutors presented with evidence indicating a likely wrongful conviction. See Am. Bar Ass'n, Report to the House of Delegates (Criminal Justice Section) (2008) (accompanying proposed Model Rules 3.8(g) and (h) and expressing "the expectation that, as ministers of justice, prosecutors routinely will and should go beyond the disciplinary minimum.")17evidence will be sufficient to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt." These standards are well-accepted norms, reflecting decades of study and deliberation by the ABA. Together, they guide a prosecutor's office that knows of a wrongful, or a likely wrongful, conviction to act to vacate the conviction--without conditioning such action and the defendant's release on an agreement to a new guilty, no-contest, or Alford plea.In 2017, the ABA House of Delegates reaffirmed that guidance by passing Resolution 112B:When the prosecutor's office supports a defendant's motion to vacate a conviction based on the office's doubts about the defendant's guilt . . . or about the lawfulness of the defendant's conviction, the office should not condition its support for the motion on an Alford plea, a guilty plea, or a no contest plea by the defendant to the original or any other charge. Nevertheless, the office may independently pursue any charge it believes is supported by admissible evidence sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and may seek to resolve the matter with an Alford plea, no contest plea, or guilty plea to that charge.Resolution 112B, supra p.4, at 1. In its Report supporting the resolution, the ABA commended the increasing number of prosecutors' offices that had convened conviction integrity units and reviewed past convictions, but explained that it remained concerned about occasions in which prosecutors with serious doubts about a convicted defendant's guilt had conditioned the office's support for the release of18such a defendant upon a new guilty, no-contest, or Alford plea.24 This is because the prosecution's conditioning of a plea in exchange for its support for a post-conviction remedy raises the risk that such pleas are likely to be, or appear to be, coerced, and are unfair to the defendant.25However, several Circuits, including the Ninth, have now effectively endorsed this practice by holding that the later convictions bar recovery of damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Taylor, 913 F.3d at 936; Olsen v. Correiro, 189 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 1999) (defendant whose murder conviction was overturned, but who then pled guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a sentence of time served, could not recover under § 1983); Poventud v. City of New York, 750 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2014) (defendant who pled guilty to lesser crime after prior conviction was vacated could only recover for years served beyond those sanctioned by new sentence). It is all the more troubling since this practice is at odds with accepted standards for prosecutorial conduct.Extracting pleas from defendants who have essentially been exonerated also undermines public confidence in our criminal justice system. The public appearance will often be that the prosecution insisted on the guilty plea to save face or to prevent the defendant from pursuing civil remedies--not that the defendant is genuinely guilty of the new24 ABA Report with Resolution 112B (Criminal Justice Section) (2017) at 2. 25 Id. at 3.19charge.26 Indeed, avoiding liability for civil damages is often the motivating factor behind the growing practice of securing guilty, no-contest, or Alford pleas in exchange for the immediate release of a wrongfully convicted defendant.27Extracting a plea by withholding consent to vacatur of a prior unlawful conviction and release also carries a serious risk that it is, in fact, predicated on a false admission of guilt. A person facing jail time may accept a guilty plea to avoid or secure release from incarceration--even if he is innocent. And as Taylor has explained, a person who has wrongly lost decades of his life in jail will feel particularly compelled to take any opportunity to be released, even if it means pleading no contest or guilty to a crime for which he has steadfastly maintained his innocence.2826 As the Ninth Circuit recognized in MacDonald v. Musick, 425 F.2d 373, 375 (9th Cir. 1970): "It is no part of the proper duty of a prosecutor to use a criminal prosecution to forestall a civil proceeding by the defendant . . ., even where the civil case arises from the events that are also the basis for the criminal charge." 27 See, e.g., Stephanie Clifford, Wrongly Convicted, They Had to Choose: Freedom or Restitution, N.Y. Times (Sept. 30, 2019), https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/wrongful-convictionscivil-lawsuits.html (discussing financial issues faced by jurisdictions as a result of past exonerations, and providing examples where prosecutors sought new pleas to avoid such liability). 28 See "Freed Prisoner," supra n.18.20B. Pleading No Contest to Time Served to Secure Release from a Wrongful Conviction is Not Unique.Taylor's predicament was not unique. Numerous individuals have been exonerated or had their convictions proven unlawful after years of imprisonment, and an increasing number have then had prosecutors require that they plead guilty or no contest to new charges, with a sentence of time served, in order to secure their immediate release.Exonerations are increasingly common. The National Registry of Exonerations lists 2,522 exonerations since 1989.29 That number, which does not include cases like Taylor's where the defendant agreed to a new plea to secure release, amounts to over 22,315 years of wrongful imprisonment, roughly two-thirds of it served by people of color.30 And while the average length of incarceration before release is just under nine years, more than a few29 National Registry of Exonerations, Univ. of Mich.

The threat of continued incarceration means that a defendant is significantly more likely to plead guilty, whether or not he is in fact guilty.3531 See id.32NationalRegistryofExonerations,https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/NRE.Guilty.Plea.Article1.pdf.33 In Harris County, Texas, hundreds of persons who had pledguilty to drug possession were later exonerated by lab testsshowing that the substance at issue was not drugs. See RadleyBalko, Faulty Drug Field Tests Bring False Confessions, BadConvictions, Wash. Post (Feb. 11, 2016). See also NationalRegistry of Exonerations, https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Drug_Cases_2016.pdf. Harris Countyis only unique in that it voluntarily reviewed past convictions;few prosecutors' offices have shown a similar commitment toredressingpastmistakes.Seeid.,https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/Conviction-Integrity-Units.aspx.34 See Radley Balko, Study: Sleep Deprivation Linked to False Confessions, Wash. Post (Feb. 9, 2016).35 See Paul Heaton et al., The Downstream Consequences of Misdemeanor Pretrial Detention, 69 Stan. L.

Rev. 201, 213-14 (Feb. 2018) (sample study of detainees in two(continued...)22Especially for a wrongfully incarcerated person who has spent years or decades in prison, the prospect of immediate relief is understandably irresistible, particularly when the choice is to wait additional months or even years to secure full exoneration through ongoing or new proceedings. And many may not have even made an informed choice ­ not realizing that, by accepting a deal granting immediate freedom, they might be giving up the prospect of obtaining monetary relief for the unlawful conviction and/or incarceration.The growing body of case law addressing the legal impact of such pleas in a wide variety of circumstances shows that this is a very real problem, and that prosecutors have used the desire of incarcerated defendants for freedom to extract new pleas even after the prior conviction has been shown to be unlawful. See, e.g., Blumberg v. Hewitt, 708 F. App'x 903, 904 (9th Cir. 2017) (person convicted of murder and granted habeas relief pled guilty and was sentenced to time served); Poventud v. City of New York, 750 F.3d 121, 135-36 (2d Cir. 2014) (person whose conviction was vacated accepted State's offer to plead guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for immediate release); Olsen v. Correiro, 189 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 1999) (person secured vacatur of murder conviction based on investigating officers' failure to disclose evidence, but pled nolo contendere to lesser charge of manslaughter with the State's agreement to recommend time served);________________________(continued...) counties found that 44% of initially detained defendants pled guilty compared to only 20.7% of released defendants).23Dennis v. City of Philadelphia, 379 F. Supp. 3d 420, 423-24 (E.D. Pa. 2019) (person convicted for murder was granted habeas and then offered no contest plea); Roberts v. City of Fairbanks, No. 4:17-cv-0034HRH, 2018 WL 5259453 (D. Alaska Oct. 22, 2018) (dismissing § 1983 claims of four persons convicted of murder who were released after presenting evidence of innocence due to stipulated agreement that vacated convictions had been validly entered).Such pleas insulate jurisdictions from paying civil damages for wrongful incarceration.36 But pleas extracted from defendants who have essentially been exonerated--and the legal impact of such pleas, including on § 1983 claims--require particular scrutiny given that we now know that prosecutors can, and do, secure guilty, no-contest, and Alford pleas from the innocent.C. Coerced Pleas Lead to Serious LongTerm Consequences for the Wrongfully Convicted.Plea deals such as the one at issue here also have devastating, long-term effects on those who enter into them--impacts that an incarcerated person may not fully comprehend or properly weigh when facing the prospect of more years behind bars. In many states, a felony guilty plea will prevent the defendant from voting, finding employment, and securing housing upon release.37 For example, in36 See Clifford, Wrongly Convicted, supra n.27. 37 See Gabriel J. Chin & Richard W. Holmes, Jr., Effective Assistance of Counsel and the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell L. Rev. 697, 700 (2002) (documenting the collateral(continued...)24Arizona, where Taylor was convicted, a felony conviction deprives a released defendant of his right to serve on a jury38 and to vote,39 and prevents him from receiving worker's compensation benefits, getting certain tuition waivers at state schools, and potentially retaining parental rights.40 In addition to these state law consequences, federal law requires that convicted felons be evicted from public housing41 and authorizes housing authorities to deny later applications.42 These are just the tip of the iceberg. Indeed, the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Conviction hosts a database of more than 44,605 state and federal consequences to guilty pleas.43 Taylor has suffered many of these consequences firsthand.

Those unjust consequences, as well as the broader harm to the44 Kimberly Matas, Year of Freedom After 4 Decades Behind Bars Difficult for Louis Taylor, Arizona Daily Star, May 11, 2014, online at https://tucson.com/news/blogs/police-beat/yearof-freedom-after-decades-behind-bars-difficult-forlouis/article_595cb493-574d-5d50-a3de-06e3d1741ce4.html. 45 See Elizabeth S.

This Court has stated that "the Sixth Amendment right to counsel exists, and is needed, in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial." Strickland, 466 U.S. at 684. The Court has also stated that on direct appeal, there is no substitute for "the benefit of counsel's examination into the record, research of the law, and marshalling of arguments on [the defendant's] behalf." Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 358, 358 (1963). The ABA respectfully asserts that counsel is especially needed when, under the procedure adopted by a state, a post-conviction proceeding is the first opportunity for presenting a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.A. Effective Representation At The First Proceeding In Which A Trial-Phase IAC Claim May Be Presented Ensures Review Will Be Based On A Robust RecordTo succeed on a trial-phase IAC claim, a defendant must show that trial counsel's performance was objectively unreasonable and that it prejudiced the defendant. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-88. While "InJavigating the appellate process without a lawyer's assistance is a perilous endeavor for a layperson," Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U.S. 605, 621 (2005), establishing trial-phase IAC claims on post-conviction review is more perilous still, because such claims6 almost always require evidence that is outside of the trial record.Indeed, many states require trial-phase IAC claims to be brought during state post-conviction review precisely because direct appeal is limited to claims which are evident on the face of the record. See, e.g., State v. Parrott, 811 A.2d 705, 712 (Conn. 2003) ("Almost without exception, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must be raised by way of habeas corpus, rather than by direct appeal, because of the need for a full evidentiary record for such a claim.") (internal quotation marks omitted); Archer v. State, 986 So. 2d 951, 955 (Miss. 2008) (noting that while trial-phase IAC claims should ordinarily be brought on post-conviction review, they may be considered on direct appeal if facts of the claim are "fully apparent from the record."). Additionally, direct appeal counsel who also served as trial counsel will not often attack his or her own performance at trial. See Halbert, 545 U.S. at 620 n.5 ("A [trial] lawyer may not, however, perceive his own errors or the need for [postconviction motions for preservation of issues for appellate review].").Preparing a robust record for review of a defendant's trial-phase JAC claims may require development of the necessary factual background through: (1) interviewing the client; (2) questioning prior defense counsel for the client and requesting access to the complete client files; (3) interviewing law enforcement officials involved in the case and requesting access to their files; and (4) speaking with prosecutors involved in the case and requesting7 access to their files.° Investigating a trial-phase IAC claim may also require sophisticated legal assessments, such as determining whether trial counsel failed to move to suppress evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.'Effective litigation of a trial-phase IAC claim also requires the presentation of a written record in a form that comports with the rules of evidence and procedure applicable to that proceeding. At any oral hearing the court may conduct, effective assistance may also require compelling attendance of witnesses, admitting and presenting evidence, and crossexamining prosecution witnesses. Failure to comply with the forum's procedures and rules may foreclose the defendant's opportunity for relief in both state and federal post-conviction proceedings.The ABA Standards recognize that a post-conviction proceeding is fundamentally an original judicial proceeding, involving problems of investigation and the development and presentation of a robust record. The ABA Standards accordingly provide that, "the responsibility of a lawyer in a post-conviction proceeding should be guided generally by the standards governing the conduct of lawyers in criminal cases." Standard 4-8.5 of the volume ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE, PROSECUTION FUNCTION AND® See generally, Randy Hertz and James S. Leibman, FEDERAL HABEAS CORPUS PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 11.2[b] (6th ed. 2011).7 See generally, FEDERAL HABEAS CORPUS PRACTICE AND PRO-CEDURE § 11.2[c} (outlining the various factual bases for an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim). See also, Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 383-87 (1986) (noting counsel's failure to request pretrial discovery that would have disclosed a potential Fourth Amendment violation).8 DEFENSE FUNCTION (ABA 3d ed. 1993) (hereinafter "Defense Function Standards"). See also Commentary to Defense Function Standard 4-8.5 (the Standards applicable to lawyers performing these tasks "are essentially the same as those outlined in these Standards for the defense of a criminal case.").The ABA Standards also provide that, when investigation reveals that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance, the first post-conviction counsel "should not hesitate to seek relief on that ground." Defense Function Standard 4-8.6(a).*Without competent counsel, most indigent and incarcerated defendants who lack legal training will be unable to adequately perform these basic functions of assessment, investigation, and litigation that are necessary for presenting a trial-phase IAC claim. Rather, a defendant's attempt to enforce his Sixth Amendment right, especially "where the record is unclear or the errors are hidden," will often be a "meaningless ritual," Douglas, 372 U.S. at 358, without effective assistance of first state postconviction counsel.B. Effective Representation At The First Proceeding In Which A Trial-Phase IAC Claim May Be Brought Is Necessary In Light Of Procedural And Other Errors That Can Preclude ReviewEffective representation during the first proceeding in which a trial-phase IAC claim may be brought is necessary if a defendant is to secure review in state8 Similarly, counsel may decline to represent a defendant for his or her ineffective assistance of counsel claim only after investigation into prior defense counsel's conduct. Defense Function Standard 4-8.6(b).9 and federal court forums because, to litigate a trialphase IAC claim in state post-conviction proceedings,counsel must navigate a number of procedural rules specific to state post-conviction review.These procedural! rules include but are not limited to: statutes of limitations on post-conviction claims, tolling provisions for the pendency of some other event, rules about when a claim can or must be presented in a subsequent petition, appellate authorization procedures for certain kinds of claims, laws about when a collateral attack can be co-pending with certiorari proceedings in the United States Supreme Court, state comity and abstention rules that foreclose state courts from entertaining postconviction challenges to convictions that are the subject of ongoing habeas proceedings, requirements for seeking discretionary review in the highest court of record in a state jurisdiction, and special types of leave necessary to appeal adverse trial decisions. Where counsel fails to comply, defendants will often be unable to obtain merits determinations on their trial-phase IAC claims.Further, state post-conviction mistakes will often preclude federal post-conviction review. For example, trial-phase IAC claims rejected by state courts on procedural grounds are often "procedurally defaulted" on federal habeas review. See, e.g., Walker v. Martin, 131 S. Ct. 1120, 1124-25 (2011) (holding that claim not timely asserted in petition for discretionary state post-conviction review was procedurally defaulted). In addition, state post-conviction counsel's failure to adequately litigate a trial-phase IAC claim, even if not dismissed on procedural grounds, can cause all of a defendant's federal post-conviction claims to be dismissed as unexhausted. See Rose v. Lundy, 45510U.S. 509, 510 (1982). Finally, improperly-filed statepost-conviction petitions fail to toll the applicablefederal habeas limitations period, see 28 U.S.C.§ 2244(d)(2), which may render the federal claimuntimely. See(finding that,Artuz v.becauseBennett, 531 U-S. 4, 6-8 (2000)state post-conviction petitionwas properly filed, the federal limitations period wastolled for defendant's otherwise untimely federalhabeas petition).Effective assistance of counsel in the first proceeding in which a defendant may present a trial-phase IAC claim, accordingly, is necessary in light of the procedural and other errors that can preclude review of a defendant's Sixth Amendment claim.C. Even If A Defendant Obtains Federal Merits Review, An Inadequately-Constructed State Record Limits The Factual Basis On Which A Federal Court May Grant ReliefAEDPA provides that federal habeas relief may issue only when a state decision on the merits is either legally or factually unreasonable. See 28U.S.C. § 2254(d). Whether a state's decision is legally unreasonable is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1),which allows relief where state adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States." Whether a state decision is factually unreasonable is determined in light of the state record; that requirement appears in AEDPA's plaintext. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) (allowing habeas reliefwhere the state proceedings "resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding") (emphasis added).ll Until recently, this Court had not decided whether the legal reasonableness of a state decision is also assessed exclusively against the evidence in the state record. In Pinholster, however, this Court decided that review under § 2254(d)(1) was restricted to the reasonableness of the state decision in light of the record before it. 1381 S. Ct. 1888, 1398 ("The State argues that review is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits|, and we] agree with the State."). Since Pinholster, accordingly, recognition of a right to effective assistance of counsel in the first proceeding in which a defendant may present a trialphase IAC claim has become paramount if state and federal post-conviction proceedings are to remain viable forums for enforcing a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial counsel.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons stated above, amicus curiae American Bar Association requests that this Court reverse the decision below.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: CLAUDIA WILSON FROST LEE KOVARSKY ELI BURRISS DAWN JENKINS HAROUT SAMRAWILLIAM T.

DUE PROCESS AND THE SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO COUNSEL OF CHOICE PRECLUDE PRETRIAL RESTRAINTS ON A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT'S USE OF LAWFULLY OBTAINED ASSETS TO RETAIN COUNSELA. Pretrial Restraint of Untainted Assets Needed to Retain Counsel Effectively Precludes Defendants From Exercising Their Constitutional Right to Counsel of ChoiceWhen an indictment charges an offense for which a defendant's assets may be subject to forfeiture upon conviction as alleged proceeds or instrumentalities of the offense, it is now routine for the government to seek a pretrial order restraining those assets. Although a defendant is presumed innocent, a pretrial order that restrains assets needed to pay counsel effectively precludes the defendant from exercising core Sixth Amendment rights at a critical time. "[T]he choice of attorney will affect whether and on what terms the defendant cooperates with the prosecution, plea bargains, or decides instead to go to trial." Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 150. It will affect "strateg[y] with regard to investigation and discovery, development of the theory of defense, [and] selection of the jury." Id. Both before and after the return of an indictment, a defendant has no more essential or important resource than the guidance and independent judgment of counsel who is intimately familiar with8the case. Indeed, selection of counsel may be the most important contribution a defendant makes to her defense. United States v. Laura, 607 F.2d 52, 56 (3d Cir. 1979) (citing Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975); Brooks v. Tennessee, 406 U.S. 605 (1972)).Pretrial freezing of untainted assets needed to retain counsel is a concern not only for the defendant, but for counsel, the courts, and the criminal justice system. When a defendant's wholly legitimate assets are frozen prior to trial, counsel may have to continue the representation pro bono or withdraw, leaving the client unrepresented at a particularly vulnerable time or forced to start over with newly appointed counsel with no knowledge of the case and with whom the client has no established relationship of confidence and confidentiality. Otherwise, the attorney-client relationship would be transformed into a contingency fee arrangement that depends on the outcome at trial, in violation of bedrock attorney ethics rules in every State.8 As ABA Model Rule 1.5(d)(2) states, "A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect a contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case." See also ABA, Model Rule 1.7(b) (representation barred by conflict where lawyer8 The state rules of professional conduct are available at: http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/resources/links _of_interest.html. A comparison of individual ABA Model Rules to each of the state rules can be found at: http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_ responsibility/policy/rule_charts.html. See also Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., & Susan P. Koniak, The Law and Ethics of Lawyering 508 (1990) ("All states prohibit contingent fees for the defense of a criminal case").9representation limited by material personal interest); ABA Criminal Justice Standard 4-3.4(k) ("Defense counsel should not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect a contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case or in a criminal forfeiture action"). Consistent with these principles, courts have held that contingent fee arrangements create an actual conflict of interest that compromises the independence of counsel. E.g., Winkler v. Keane, 7 F.3d 304, 307-08 (2d Cir. 1993) (noting that contingent fee created a disincentive for counsel to seek a plea agreement or to pursue mitigating defenses that would have resulted in conviction for a lesser offense); Ibn-Tama v. United States, 407 A.2d 626 (D.C. 1979) (vacating murder conviction where contingent fee arrangement and actions of counsel had "completely ruptured and torn asunder" the attorney-client relationship).The Justices of this Court unanimously recognized, in the majority and dissenting opinions in Kaley, that the right to choose counsel prior to a criminal trial is of "vital interest" to the defendant, and is, in fact, the "root meaning" of the Sixth Amendment that "matters profoundly." Compare Kaley, 134 S. Ct. at 1102 (citing United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 547 U.S. 140, 146 (2006)), with id. at 1114-15 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) ("Granting the Government the right to take away a defendant's chosen advocate strikes at the heart of [the] significant role" of the "independent bar as a check on prosecutorial abuse and government overreaching").10Pretrial deprivation of the right to counsel of choice by freezing defendant's lawfully obtained property that is needed for payment of counsel has such deleterious practical consequences that it has been described as a "`nuclear weapon' of the law." United States v. Ramilovic, 419 F.3d 134, 137 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 322 (1999)). Most significantly, a defendant subject to pretrial restraint of assets may find that counsel of choice is simply unobtainable when, as under the decision below, none of a defendant's assets are beyond the control and discretion of the prosecution. And when the government alleges joint and several liability against conspirators, the amount sought through forfeiture may exceed the defendant's total assets, making all her assets subject to pretrial restraint. See, e.g., United States v. Cano-Flores, 2015 WL 4666891 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 7, 2015) at *16 ("Forfeiture amounts calculated under the government's view . . . may consist almost entirely of the amounts that the defendant never obtained").Even if counsel could be found who would accept an engagement in these circumstances, the potential that the attorney-client relationship will become a contingent fee arrangement can impede the development of the trust needed for effective assistance of defense counsel.9 Where a pretrial9 In plea bargain negotiations, for example, the attorney's potential conflict of interest becomes more concrete when a defendant is offered the opportunity to plead guilty to a lesser offense that would financially disadvantage his lawyer by forfeiting funds that would otherwise be available to pay counsel.11freeze of lawfully obtained assets puts counsel's continued participation at risk, defendants and courts face the prospect of having to replace counsel at a time of the prosecutor's choosing, even as late as the eve of trial. In those circumstances, defendants and the criminal justice system as a whole bear the burden of replacement counsel who have had less or even insufficient time to prepare the defense. The prospect of governmental veto casts a cloud over the effective representation provided by counsel.As this Court held in Gonzalez-Lopez, a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice is not cured by the substitution of effective counsel to conduct the trial. "Deprivation of the right is `complete' when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants, regardless of the quality of the representation he received." 548 U.S. at 148; id. at 146 (Sixth Amendment guarantees right to be "defended by the counsel he believes to be best," for which "[n]o additional showing of prejudice is required to make the violation `complete'"). Denial of this right isE.g., Winkler v. Keane, 7 F.3d at 307-08; see also Pamela Karlan, Discrete and Relational Criminal Representation: The Changing Vision of the Right to Counsel, 105 HARV. L. REV. 670, 715-17 (1991) (discussing additional ways contingent fee arrangements undermine the attorney-client relationship). Conflicts of interest are not limited to the ramifications of impending contingency. See, e.g., United States v. Cosme, 2015 WL 4716437 (2d Cir. Aug. 10, 2015) at *2 ("attorney asked to be relieved because of the conflict between his position as a court-appointed lawyer and [defendant's] potential Monsanto hearing, the purpose of which would be to obtain the release of seized funds in order to hire a replacement lawyer").12among `"a very limited class of errors' that trigger automatic reversal because they undermine the fairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole." United States v. Davila, 133 S. Ct. 2139, 2149 (2013) (quoting United States v. Marcus, 560 U.S. 258 (2010)). It is deemed "structural" error because "[i]t is impossible to know what different choices the rejected counsel would have made, and then to quantify the impact of those different choices on the outcome of the proceedings." Gonzales-Lopez, 548 U.S. at 150.If defendants in criminal proceedings are unable to use their legally obtained, untainted property to retain private counsel, then accepted notions of effective assistance of counsel, the right to counsel of choice, and a balanced adversary system will have undergone a transformative shift. The right to counsel will be eroded because it will depend on what the government is willing to permit for a particular defendant. In addition, forcing an otherwise non-indigent defendant to accept appointed counsel places an additional strain on the already limited resources available for representing the truly indigent, to the further detriment of the criminal justice system.1010 A likely consequence of freezing assets that otherwise would be available to pay retained counsel is that courts will have to appoint attorneys at government expense. But a defendant who is restrained from using lawfully-obtained assets to pay an attorney, even as he retains title to the frozen assets (until such time when, post-conviction, they may be forfeited), may be deemed non-indigent, and thus ineligible for appointed counsel. Thus, the power to restrain untainted assets pretrial potentially confers on prosecutors the authority to create a constitutionally unacceptable, counsel-deprived limbo. The risk is not13B. Pretrial Restraint on Legally Obtained Assets Needed to Retain Counsel of Choice is Contrary to this Court's Sixth Amendment PrecedentsThis Court's repeated reliance on the nexus between the assets and the offense charged to justify pretrial restraints is central to the constitutional analysis. Since 1989, this Court has addressedin Caplin & Drysdale, Monsanto and Kaleypotential conflicts between the governments use of its statutory criminal forfeiture authority and the constitutional role of the right of counsel in the administration of our criminal justice system. In those three cases, the Court upheld the unambiguous statutory authority to restrain pretrialand ultimately forfeit post-convictiononly tainted property in the face of claims that such property should be available to retain counsel. See, e.g., Kaley, 134 S. Ct. at 1096 (describing and quoting Caplin & Drysdale as holding "the Government does not violate the Constitution if, pursuant to the forfeiture statute, `it seizes the robbery proceeds and refuses to permit the defendant to use them' to pay for his lawyer").Caplin & Drysdale arose after conviction, andhypothetical. Only persons "financially unable" to pay for retained counsel are entitled to appointed counsel, 18 U.S.C. § 3006A, and their proof of indigence is made on pain of perjury. United States v. Kahan, 415 U.S. 239, 243 (1974). A trial court may exclude restrained or forfeitable assets from this determination, or it may not. United States v. Salemme, 985 F. Supp. 197, 203 (D. Mass. 1997) (excluding some forfeitable property from financial disclosure requirements but not others).14there was no dispute that the drug proceedswhich had already been found to be drug proceeds pursuant to a guilty pleawere both tainted and actually forfeited. See In re Forfeiture Hearing as to Caplin & Drysdale, 837 F.2d 637, 641-42 (4th Cir. 1988)) (en banc), aff'd, 491 U.S. 617 (1989). In upholding the post-conviction forfeiture, this Court's majority opinion cited and relied on the relation-back doctrine, a common law principle codified in federal forfeiture statutes and identified by this Court as the "'taint theory' ... long recognized in forfeiture cases." 491 U.S. at 627 (citing United States v. Stowell, 133 U.S. 1 (1890) and quoting legislative history). Under the relation-back doctrine, title to tainted property (i.e., drug proceeds) automatically becomes vested in the government at the time it is used unlawfully. Id.11 Thus, as the Court explained, the tainted property at issue belonged to the government and the defendant never had lawful ownership of it.In reaching that conclusion, Caplin & Drysdale delineated the constitutional boundaries of the Sixth Amendment's protection of the right to retain counsel of choice: it "does not go beyond the individual's right to spend his own money to obtain the advice and assistance of . . . counsel." 491 U.S. at 626 (quoting Walters v. National Ass'n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 370 (1985) (ellipsis in original, emphasis added). This pivotal distinction between tainted and untainted assets was reaffirmed in Kaley: "stolen money" and "ill-gotten gains" cannot be used to defend the robbery suspect because "[t]hat money is not11 21 U.S.C. § 853(c) (vesting interest in tainted property "upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture").15rightfully his," and he "has no Sixth Amendment right to spend another person's money for legal fees." Kaley, 134 S. Ct. at 1096-97 (quoting Caplin & Drysdale) ); id. at 1097 ("no one contests that the assets in question derive from, or were used in committing, the offenses").12In Caplin & Drysdale, Monsanto and Kaley, the relevant interest the Court identified in the pretrial restraint context was not any government interest in untainted assets, but rather was limited to securing "`ill-gotten gains'" or "`stolen assets.'" Similarly, both the majority and dissenting opinions in Kaley recognized an appropriate role for a pretrial hearing to identify traceable assets. 134 S. Ct. at 1095 n.3 (Government agreed that defendant has a constitutional right to a hearing on traceability); id. at 1111 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) ("the Government concedes that due process guarantees defendants a hearing to contest the traceability of the restrained assets to the charged conduct").12 See Kaley, 134 S.Ct. at 1096 (noting that the district court had excluded from the asset freeze order in that case "$63,000 that it found (based on the parties' written submissions) was not connected to the alleged offenses").16C. The Speculative, Attenuated Interest in Untainted Assets as to Which the Government Might Have a Claim Only After Conviction and Meeting Other Statutory Requirements Does Not Overcome a Defendant's Immediate, Vested Sixth Amendment Right to Use Untainted Property to Engage Counsel of ChoiceLegally acquired property should be available to permit the accused to control her defense through selection of counsel. As this Court held in GonzalezLopez, and reaffirmed in Kaley, a defendant's right to choose counsel is irretrievably lost if denied prior to trial. Kaley, 134 S. Ct. at 1102 (citing GonzalezLopez); accord, id. at 1113-14 ("the right to counsel of choice is inherently transient, and the deprivation of that right effectively permanent") (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).While the Sixth Amendment interests of a defendant are at their zenith pretrial, the government's contingent interests in a defendant's legitimate assets are at their nadir. No countervailing benefit to the government warrants an immediate and final abridgement of Sixth Amendment protections prior to trial by barring the use of lawfully acquired assets for retaining counsel. Viewed from this perspective, the government's pretrial interest is properly limited to "allegedly tainted assets." Kaley, 134 S. Ct. at 1112 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting, citing Caplin & Drysdale).17The government's remote general interest in satisfying a future criminal judgment from the defendant's untainted assets depends on three levels of contingency. First, it is contingent on whether the government prevails on the issue of criminality at a future trial. Second, it is contingent on the government prevailing at trial as to the tainted nature of the assets subject to forfeiture. Third, it is contingent on whether the government prevails in showing that the defendant possesses inadequate tainted assets to satisfy a forfeiture judgment and that "as a result of any act or omission of the defendant" the tainted assets (as listed in 21 U.S.C. § 853(a)) have been rendered unavailable for forfeiture. Only then has the government established authority to obtain the forfeiture of untainted substitute assets after conviction. 21 U.S.C. § 853(c); 18 U.S.C. § 982(b)(1). See United States v. Jarvis, 499 F.3d 1196, 1204-05 (10th Cir. 2007) (noting the government's "potential and speculative" interest prior to trial because "the United States does not have a ripened interest in . . . substitute assets until (1) after the defendant's conviction, and (2) the court determines the defendant's § 853(a) forfeitable property is out of the government's reach for a reason enumerated in § 853(p)(1)(A)-(E)"). Those essential predicates for forfeiture do not exist prior to or during trial.18D. Congress Has Not Authorized Pretrial Restraints that Prevent a Defendant's Use of Her Own Lawfully Obtained Assets to Retain Counsel of ChoiceThe primacy of a defendant's right to use her own lawfully obtained assets to secure counsel should be all the more impervious to government intrusion because Congress has not endorsed the pretrial restraint of untainted assets. To be sure, Congress has provided a variety of statutory means to advance the government's interest in securing a postconviction forfeiture judgment, including the relationback doctrine, and pretrial restraints on tainted assets. But Congress has not provided statutory authority for the government to commandeer before trial a defendant's lawful assets needed to mount a criminal defense.For example, Congress provided express statutory authority for pretrial orders restraining the use of tainted assets, which 21 U.S.C. § 853(a) defines to include property with a nexus to a crime. 21 U.S.C. § 853(e) (authorizing restraints to preserve the "property described in subsection (a) for forfeiture"). See also 18 U.S.C. § 982(b)(1) (adopting § 853 forfeiture provisions for other offenses).Consistent with that statutory limitation, the circuit courts overwhelmingly have held that Congress did not authorize pretrial restraints on lawful "substitute assets." Those courts explained19that substitute assets are not included in § 853(e), which authorizes pretrial restraining orders only for the categories of tainted property expressly crossreferenced in § 853(a) (namely, proceeds and instrumentalities), while substitute assets are addressed only in the post-conviction forfeiture provision, 21 U.S.C. § 853(p). See, e.g., United States v. Jarvis, 499 F.3d at 1204 ("all but one federal court of appeals to address this issue has determined the legislative silence regarding substitute property in § 853(e) precludes pre-conviction restraint of substitute property"); see also United States v. Parrett, 530 F.3d 422, 430-31 (6th Cir. 2008) (statutory language does not permit substitute assets to be subject to pretrial restraint); United States v. Pantelidis, 335 F.3d 226, 234 (3d Cir. 2003); United States v. Gotti, 155 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir. 1998); United States v. Field, 62 F.3d 246, 249 (8th Cir. 1995); United States v. Ripinsky, 20 F.3d 359, 363 (9th Cir. 1994); In re Assets of Martin, 1 F.3d 1351, 1359 (3d Cir. 1993); United States v. Floyd, 992 F.2d 498, 500-02 (5th Cir. 1993);13 Stefan Cassella, Asset Forfeiture Law in the United States §17.1 at 537 (2d ed. 2013) ("canons of statutory13 While all these circuits reached this conclusion based on the plain language of § 853 and its counterpart, 18 U.S.C. § 982, some have noted that the legislative history of the substitute assets provisions confirms congressional intent not to include pretrial restraining order authority over substitute assets. Ripinsky, 20 F.3d at 364 n.7; In re Assets of Martin, 1 F.3d at 1360 (citing legislative history of predecessor Comprehensive Forfeiture bill, and holding that "Congress clearly intended to exclude substitute assets from property subject to preliminary restraints").20construction dictate the result reached by the majority of courts").14In Kaley, this Court construed § 853's statutory restraining order authority in the same mannerconcluding that Congress authorized pretrial restraints when "the property at issue has the requisite connection to that crime. See § 853(a)." Kaley, 134 S. Ct. at 1095 (emphasis added). Section 853(a) is, by definition, limited to tainted property that "has the requisite connection to that crime." Id.The legislative history of the 1984 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act,15 from which the restraining order provisions of § 853 originate, makes clear that Congress did not intend to abridge Sixth Amendment rights. See H.R. Rep. No. 98-845, pt. 1, p. 19 n.1 (1984) ("[n]othing" in 21 U.S.C. § 853 "is intended to interfere with a person's Sixth14 The only arguably contrary authority, In re Billman, 915 F.2d 916 (4th Cir. 1990), did not involve funds used for criminal defense nor did it implicate any Sixth Amendment choice of counsel issue. The Fourth Circuit acknowledged that it did not have the benefit of any other circuit opinion on point, id., and it did not conduct a plain language analysis of the statute that all other circuits would later employ to reach the opposite conclusion. When the Fourth Circuit eventually confronted this issue in a subsequent case, it held that the Sixth Amendment required a court to authorize use of untainted property for purposes of retaining counsel. United States v. Farmer, 274 F.3d 800, 802, 805 (4th Cir. 2001) (Wilkinson, J.) (holding that defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to use "untainted assets" for criminal defense and citing this Court's majority opinion in Caplin & Drysdale). 15 Pub. L. No. 98-473, § 301, reprinted in 1984 U.S. Code & Ad. News (98 Stat.) 1837, 2040.21Amendment right to counsel"). This Court has construed the legislative history of the 1984 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act as a congressional acknowledgement of the Sixth Amendment issues potentially created by restraining orders, and an "exhortation for the courts to tread carefully in this delicate area." Monsanto, 491 U.S. at 609 n.8; see also Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U.S. at 636 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (quoting this legislative history).In conformity with its express language and stated policy, the statute should not be read to authorize government action that would raise grave constitutional questions. Accordingly, and consistent with this Court's construction of the statute and its legislative history, the circuit courts have held overwhelmingly that when Congress approved substitute assets forfeiture in 1986, it excluded pretrial restraints on substitute assets.16 In so doing, Congress eliminated the prospect of a conflict between a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to choose counsel and the issuance of a pretrial restraining order to block the use of untainted assets for that purpose.In this case, the government has not invoked the general pretrial restraint provisions authorized by Congress for criminal forfeiture cases, § 853(e). Rather, the government invoked a specialized statute16 Statutory authority for substitute assets forfeiture was enacted as part of the Drug Possession Penalty Act of 1986, a title within the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. Pub. L. No. 99570, title 1, §1153(a) & (b), 100 Stat. 3207-13 (1986).22dealing with injunctions against fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1345, that is also aimed only at tainted assets"property, obtained as a result of" a banking or health care violation. Id. § 1345(a)(2). More specifically, § 1345(a)(1)(C) authorizes the issuance of injunctions "to enjoin such violation" of banking or health care laws, and, if a person is "violating or about to violate" such a law, § 1345(a)(2) authorizes equitable relief when that person "is alienating or disposing of property, obtained as a result of" such a violation, or which "is traceable to such violation." Id. This language is clearly aimed at the use of equitable restraints to "prevent a continuing and substantial injury to the United States" by barring ongoing or prospective violations of banking or health care laws. 18 U.S.C. § 1345(b).17 See, e.g, United States v. Phillip Morris USA, Inc., 396 F.3d 1190, 1198-99 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (plain meaning of statute authorizing injunctions to "prevent and restrain" RICO violations is limited to prospective relief, and does not include prior violations) (citing Meghris v. KFC Western, Inc., 516 U.S. 479, 488 (1996)).In turn, § 1345(a)(2) is aimed at prospective transfers or alienations of "traceable" (i.e., tainted) property. Temporary restraints are authorized in17 Indeed, this Court has consistently held that imminent future injury is the sine qua non of equitable relief and the Article III jurisdiction to issue it. Clapper v. Amnesty, Int'l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1147 (2013); City of Los Angeles v. Lyon, 461 U.S. 95, 112 (1983). This Court has further held that federal courts lack inherent equitable authority to restrain assets prior to judgment. Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 326 & n.8 (1999).23§1345(a)(2)(B) only with respect to imminent transfers of tainted assets. Lawfully obtained property spent on legal representation simply is not property traceable to an ongoing health care violation, nor to a transfer of traceable proceeds.This plain-language, common-sense reading of §1345 is fully consistent with congressional failure to approve pretrial restraints on substitute assets, Parrett, 530 F.3d at 429-30, and with this Court's admonition not to construe statutes in a manner that would actually or potentially conflict with constitutional rights. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 406 (2010); Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 24-25 (2000); United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349-350 (1971). This Court requires a clear statement from Congress that it intends such a constitutional conflict. Id.; McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 359-60 (1987). Congress must, at a minimum, speak clearly before it encumbers the right to counsel by pretrial freezing of the legitimate assets necessary to pay them.The statutes involved in this case do not meet that standard. This conclusion is particularly compelling in this case because, when Congress spoke directly to the issue of untainted "substitute assets," it did not authorize restraint of such assets pretrial and permitted it only for post-conviction forfeitures. See Jarvis, 499 F.3d at 1204 (legislative silence24regarding substitute property in § 853(e) precludes pre-conviction restraint of substitute property).18E. Due Process Protects a Defendant's Right to Use Lawful Assets for Her Criminal DefensePrior restraints on a defendant's financial ability to defend herself by spending lawfully obtained assets also runs afoul of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Due Process Clause guarantees that federal criminal proceedings will be fundamentally fair. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 505 (1976). Moreover, due process protects both a defendant's substantive right to a fair trial, Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470 (1973), and to fair criminal procedures. As Chief Justice Roberts observed in his dissent in Kaley, "[t]he possibility that the prosecutor could elect to hamstring his target by preventing him from paying his counsel of choice raises substantial concerns about the fairness of the entire proceeding." Kaley, 134 S.Ct. at 1107 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (citing In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955)). Barring a defendant from using legitimate untainted assets to defend herself prior to and during trial undermines both components of due process.The Due Process Clause speaks to "the balance of forces between the accused and his accuser." Wardius, 412 U.S. at 475. The right of counsel is a18 See n.14, supra, discussing In re Billman, 915 F.2d 916 (4th Cir. 1990).25necessary component for a fair balance between the defendant and the government because an independent counsel is an essential ingredient of a fair trial. Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 322 (1981). Prior restraints on untainted assets needed to pay attorneys' fees enable the government to determine who will be its adversary, to restrict the resources available to the defense, and even to determine when chosen counsel will be replaced with substitute counsel. The prospect of such restraints on untainted assets compromises the independence of counsel and places counsel's financial interests in conflict with the interests of the client. See pages 810, supra. Fundamental fairness demands that an accused person not be thus encumbered in presenting a defense. A system that grants one party the discretion to restrict and control the lawfully obtained resources available to its opponent is not the adversarial system that has existed throughout our history. The Constitution and the traditions of our criminal justice system demand that the government prevail by proving its allegations, not by impeding an accused's ability to mount a defense.Under the decision below, a lifetime of lawful labor offers no protection against the loss of the right to counsel of choice precisely when it is of the most value to the accused. For these reasons, the decision of the Eleventh Circuit tilts the scales sharplyand incorrectlyin favor of the prosecution. That is an imbalance our Constitution should not abide.26CONCLUSIONThe American Bar Association respectfully requests that the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit be reversed.Respectfully submitted.Of Counsel: JERROLD J.

In landmark decisions beginning with Romer and continuing through Obergefell, this Court has recognized that gay and lesbian people are entitled to "equal dignity in the eyes of the law." Obergefell, 136 S. Ct. at 2608. Equal dignity necessarily encompasses a right to participate on full and equal terms in day-to-day commercial and social activities without fearing exclusion and stigma based on one's identity or intimate relationships. For centuries, public accommodations laws have protected the right of persons to obtain goods and services on equal terms. And since the Civil Rights Era, Congress and this Court have considered arguments by commercial entities claiming constitutional exemptions from laws forbidding race discrimination in the provision of public accommodations. By decisively4rejecting those arguments, Congress and this Court ensured that basic protections against race discrimination, though controversial when first enacted, matured into enduring norms that command broad acceptance and mark our progress as a Nation.In this case, the Court faces a choice very much like the choice it faced when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964. The Court has only recently recognized that the Constitution protects the equal dignity of gay and lesbian people. And this constitutional protection remains the subject of good faith disagreement. Petitioner Phillips contends that Colorado's public accommodations law unconstitutionally forces him to endorse marriage equality for gay and lesbian people in contravention of his beliefs, just as business owners challenged the 1964 Act as an infringement on their constitutional liberty to decide whether to endorse racial equality. To ensure that the rights of gay and lesbian people can be fully and publicly realized in communities across the country, it is imperative that this Court reject petitioners' request for a constitutional exemption to public accommodations laws, just as it did a half-century ago when business owners sought similar exemptions from laws prohibiting race discrimination.I. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241 (1964)--Title II of which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, religion, and national origin in public accommodations in interstate commerce--was a watershed. With a half-century's distance, it is easy to forget that the principle of racial equality was far from securely established by 1964. The campaign of "massive resistance" against integration of schools and other public facilities had not yet5run its course. Only one year earlier, Medgar Evers had been murdered for his civil-rights organizing efforts in Mississippi, and Dr. King had authored his Letter from a Birmingham Jail and spoken from the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington. And the brutal assaults on protesters at the Edmund Pettus Bridge were still a year in the future.That was the backdrop against which Congress debated the Civil Rights Act. And while antidiscrimination principles in general received wide endorsement in Congress, the debates featured passionate arguments that those principles should be subordinated to the right of business owners to discriminate based on their personal beliefs about customers. Senator J. Lister Hill of Alabama, for example, argued that Title II violated individuals' "fundamental right[]" to choose his associates, and that "forced association is not free." 110 Cong. Rec. 8444 (1964). Senator Barry Goldwater offered similar constitutional arguments to explain his opposition to the law. See Christopher W. Schmidt, "Defending the Right to Discriminate, The Libertarian Challenge to the Civil Rights Movement," in Signposts: New Directions in Southern Legal History 417, 433 (Sally E. Hadden & Patricia Hagler Minter, eds., 2013). Ultimately, those arguments did not win the day. Congressional committees endorsed the view that "[t]here is no serious question of the right of association or of property or of privacy as a barrier to the legislation," see S. Rep. No. 88-872, at 92 (1964), and Congress passed the statute.After the Civil Rights Act became law, commercial enterprises pressed the same arguments in the courts, again without success. In Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964), for example, this6Court rejected the contention that the Civil Rights Act violated a business's Fifth and Thirteenth Amendment rights by denying the personal liberty to select customers. The Court reaffirmed that holding in Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964), ruling that the Act did not violate due process by interfering with a restaurant owner's rights to refuse to serve whomever he pleased. And in Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, 390 U.S. 400, 402 (1968), the Court rejected as "patently frivolous" a business owner's contention that serving African Americans violated his free-exercise rights.In each case, the business owners framed their arguments in terms strikingly similar to the arguments now before the Court. In Katzenbach, for instance, the restaurant owner asserted that "the personal rights of persons in their personal convictions and in their choice of associates have been recognized and accorded constitutional protection by this Court." Brief for Appellees, Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964), 1964 WL 81100, at *33 ("McClung Br."). Petitioners frame their claimed exemption in terms of compelled speech rather than association, but the thrust is the same: petitioners seek the right to choose, based on their religious and moral convictions, which of their customers will receive a full range of services and which will be relegated to a demeaning second-class status.II. This Court should reject petitioners' claim for a First Amendment exemption from Colorado's accommodations law because such an exemption would undermine the antidiscrimination principles that Congress and the courts have determined are fundamental to our pluralistic society.7Petitioners (joined by the federal government) claim to find support for their proposed exemption in Hurley v. Irish American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557 (1995), and Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000). Those decisions recognized a narrow exception to the general principle that laws regulating conduct for reasons unrelated to expression should receive minimal First Amendment scrutiny. Specifically, the Court held in both cases that public accommodations laws may not be applied to an expressive association whose purpose is to communicate its members' messages, when doing so would force the association to alter those messages. But at the same time, the Court emphasized that applying public accommodations laws to commercial establishments-- like petitioners'--raises no First Amendment concern. Unlike expressive associations, commercial establishments historically have been understood to exist for commercial purposes and to be obligated to accept all comers. Any speech in which they engage is treated as incidental to their commercial purposes--not as endorsement of views or beliefs of the customers they serve, or even of the principle that those customers are entitled to service on equal terms. Accordingly, those decisions provide no support for the exemption that petitioners and the government advocate here.That is for good reason. Recognizing petitioners' claim to a compelled-speech exemption to public accommodations laws would convert the narrow departure recognized in Hurley and Dale into a gaping hole that would permit virtually any business to assert a First Amendment right to treat any group of persons as second-class citizens unworthy of full participation in the life of the community. Many business activi-8ties--from serving meals to seating patrons to providing legal advice and counseling--can be recast as expressive in nature. Permitting compelled-speech claims to override public accommodations laws therefore would vitiate those laws, leaving individuals vulnerable to the stigma of being refused service based on business owners' beliefs and hobbling government's authority to enforce a basic guarantee of equal dignity.Cognizant of the risk that their arguments present to sound and principled enforcement of federal, state, and local antidiscrimination laws, petitioners and the government suggest that any First Amendment speech exemption could be narrowly cabined to protect only opposition to gays and lesbians and marriage equality--as opposed to racial discrimination generally or opposition to interracial marriage in particular. That suggestion flies in the face of Romer and Obergefell. Accepting it would drain much of the substance from the Constitution's guarantee of "equal dignity in the eyes of the law." Obergefell, 136 S. Ct. at 2608. This Court should reject the invitation to single out gay and lesbian people for disfavored treatment under public accommodations laws.I. THERE IS NO CONSTITUTIONAL EXCEPTION TO PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS LAWS FOR COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISESAs long as there have been public accommodations laws, there have been challenges to those laws based on businesses' asserted constitutional right to choose their customers. Each time, as here, the business owner asserted a sincere moral or religious objection to serving a particular class of customers. The basis for those constitutional challenges varied over time--9ranging from arguments based on the Fourteenth Amendment, to arguments based on the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments, to arguments based on the First Amendment rights of free association, free exercise of religion, and free speech. But this Court's response never deviated. So long as the business chose to place its goods and services in the stream of commerce, this Court has been crystal clear that there is no commercial constitutional exception to public accommodations laws. Petitioners dress their First Amendment arguments in new constitutional garb, but the substance of those arguments is equally threadbare.A. This Court Has Long Recognized States' Authority to Pass Public Accommodations Laws1. When this Court was called upon to rule on the constitutionality of a state public-accommodations law more than seventy years ago, it unequivocally rejected arguments akin to those made by petitioners here. In Railway Mail Association v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88 (1945), a union challenged a state law forbidding labor organizations from denying membership or equal treatment of members on the basis of race, color or creed. Like petitioners, the union argued that the law violated its constitutional right to discriminate. It insisted that "[t]here will always be discriminations. We discriminate in the methods of our religious worship.... We differ in our tastes and likes, and yet nothing can be done about this for it is beyond regulation in the absence of a binding grant from us to our form of government." Brief for Appellant, Railway Mail Association v. Corsi, 326 U.S. 88 (1945), 1945 WL 48802, at *30. Emphasizing its so-called "social" rights, the union10argued that it would be unconstitutional to "deprive the [Association] or its members of the right to make selection in choosing members." Id.Although the union located its asserted constitutional right in the Due Process Clause, and although it believed it had the right to discriminate on the basis of race, rather than sexual orientation, the crux of its contentions were exactly the same as petitioners'. Like petitioners, the union argued that it was exercising "a personal and constitutional right beyond the power of legislation." But the Court rejected that argument, holding that there was "no constitutional basis for the contention that a state cannot protect workers from exclusion solely on the basis of race, color or creed." Corsi, 326 U.S. at 94 (emphasis added).B. Congress Rejected a Commercial Constitutional Exception When It Enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964Two decades later, this Court was again asked to endorse a commercial constitutional exception to a public accommodations law. This time, it was in the context of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Before judicial challenges to the Act were filed, however, businesses and their supporters began voicing those constitutional objections when the Act was debated in Congress. Those arguments failed to stop the enactment of the Act's public accommodations provision, just as they would later fail to persuade this Court.1. Congressional opponents of the Civil Rights Act repeatedly contended that business owners should be free to discriminate based on their personal views about potential customers, and that a federal public accommodations law would encroach on that freedom.11Senator Sam Ervin, Jr. wrote a law review article in which he argued that "there is all too little discussion of the immense price in personal liberty and freedom that will be the cost" of public-accommodations legislation. Sam J. Ervin, Jr., The United States Congress and Civil Rights Legislation, 42 N.C. L. Rev. 3, 10 (1963). Senator J. Lister Hill argued that Title II of the Act destroyed freedom by compelling individual association: "Just as freedom of thought and belief are fundamental rights reserved to an individual, so is freedom to choose one's associates, and, conversely, freedom from compulsion to associate, for forced association is not free." 110 Cong. Rec. 8444 (1964). Senator John L. McLellan argued that Title II's requirements "would deny American citizens the freedom of choice-- the freedom to select their own personal associates and business customers." Id. at 7871. And Senator Strom Thurmond submitted a lengthy statement contending that Title II was "an unconstitutional and unwarranted invasion of an individual's right to hold, enjoy, and utilize private property." See S. Rep. No. 88-872, at 42 (1964). "[I]ndividual liberty," Thurmond explained, "means that a private property owner has the liberty of choosing, according to his own even arbitrary, capricious, or irrational desires, the persons with whom he desires to deal." Id. at 65.Much like petitioners, opponents of the Act also framed the issue as a "choice between surrendering constitutional rights and bankruptcy":There are those who argue that liberty and freedom and choice are not impinged upon by H.R. 7152. They assert that if a person who owns a place of public accommodation does not wish to submit to the compulsion of a law which dictates whom he12must serve, he can simply discontinue doing business. This argument, which seems to be based on a freedom of choice between surrendering constitutional rights and bankruptcy, ignores several fundamental principles. In reality, the property owner is given no choice, except a choice between the rock and the whirlpool.Id. at 4829 (statement of Sen. Stennis); cf. Pet. Br. at 2 (Colorado's public accommodations law "effectively forc[ed Petitioner] to stop designing wedding cakes" and cost him 40% of his business).Some legislators made free expression arguments much like those that petitioners propound. Senator John Tower argued that the Act "would attempt to deny to millions of employers and employees any freedom to speak or to act on the basis of their religious convictions or their deep-rooted preferences for associating or not associating with certain classifications of people." 110 Cong. Rec. 7778 (1964). And Congressman Charles Edward Bennett contended that it "not only violates our Constitution but it strikes a serious blow against the treasured ideal of liberty.... We allow people to refuse to salute our American flag.... Much of this tolerance is based upon misconstruction of our doctrine of religious freedom... In a country which tolerates all sorts of peculiar behavior based upon religious convictions, is it not possible that those same concepts of religious toleration should allow people to teach their children to love all people of all races but discourage close associations that may lead to intermarriage with members of other races?" 110 Cong. Rec. 2765 (1964).13As the congressional debate drew to a close, Senator Barry Goldwater offered the most prominent libertybased argument against the Act. He stated that he had "constantly and consistently voiced objections" to Title II of the Act, which covered "private enterprise in the area of so-called `public accommodations.'" Text of Goldwater Speech on Rights, N.Y. Times, June 19, 1964, at 18. Those "constitutional" objections, he announced, are of such "overriding significance that they are determinative of my vote on the entire measure," even though he was "unalterably opposed to discrimination or segregation on the basis of race, color, or creed, or any other basis." Id. Senator Goldwater concluded that Title II's regulation of private enterprise would "fly in the face ... of our God-given liberties" and "could ultimately destroy the freedom of all American citizens, including the freedoms of the very persons whose feelings and whose liberties are the major subject of this legislation." Id. He emphasized that it was "time to attend to the liberties of all," and not what he called "the special appeals for special welfare." Id.2. In formulating his opposition to the legislation, Senator Goldwater consulted with Robert Bork and William Rehnquist. See Schmidt, supra, at 433. Both had asserted that public accommodations laws infringed on the constitutional rights of business owners. For example, Professor Bork argued in the New Republic that the "justifiable abhorrence of racial discrimination" would, if channeled into public accommodations laws, "be subversive of free institutions." Robert H. Bork, Civil Rights--A Challenge, The New Republic, Aug. 31, 1963, at 21. In particular, Professor Bork opposed the Interstate Public Accommodations Act--a14precursor to Title II of the Civil Rights Act--on the ground that it would derogate liberty:Few proponents of legislation such as the Interstate Public Accommodations Act seem willing to discuss either the cost in freedom which must accompany it or why this particular departure from freedom of the individual to choose with whom he will deal is justified .... There seems to be a strong disposition on the part of proponents of the legislation simply to ignore the fact that it means a loss in a vital area of personal liberty. That it does is apparent. The legislature would inform a substantial body of the citizenry that in order to continue to carry on the trades in which they are established they must deal with and serve persons with whom they do not wish to associate.Id. at 22. On this view, it was irrelevant whether "choos[ing] associates on the basis of racial characteristics" was morally defensible. When a majority "impose[s] upon a minority its scale of preferences," Professor Bork argued, "[t]he fact that the coerced scale of preferences is said to be rooted in a moral order does not alter the impact upon freedom," a value of "very high priority." Id.Nor did it matter that the Interstate Public Accommodations Act was drafted to reach businesses--not private clubs, churches, or homes:Under any system which allows the individual to determine his own values that distinction [i.e., between personal and business relationships] is unsound. It is, moreover, patently fallacious as a description of reality. The very bitterness of the resistance to the demand for enforced integration15arises because owners of many places of business do in fact care a great deal about whom they serve. The real meaning of the distinction is simply that some people do not think others ought to care that much about that particular aspect of their freedom.Id. at 23.Professor Bork's "description of reality" mirrors that of petitioners here. Like the business owners he described, petitioners also "care a great deal about whom they serve." Id. Although petitioners will offer custom cakes to some customers who are about "to find a life that could not be found alone," they will not serve those hoping to "find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex." Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2593. Echoing decades-old arguments, petitioner Phillips insists that the "Commission must respect [his] freedom to part ways with the current majority view on marriage and to create his wedding cakes consistently with his decent and honorable religious beliefs." Pet. Br. at 3 (quotation marks omitted). Petitioner's business decision is grounded in his faith, and there is no doubt that he holds a genuine conviction that "weddings are sacred and that they create an inherently religious relationship." Id. at 9. But the only question in this case is whether those personal convictions permit a business owner who serves the public to refuse to provide goods and services to those who "conflict[] with his religious beliefs" when doing so would violate a valid public accommodations law. Id.Future-Justice Rehnquist offered similar arguments when he opposed a Phoenix public accommodations ordinance on the ground that it would intrude on the freedoms of "thousands of small business proprietors."16See Nominations of William H. Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell, Jr.: Hearings Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 92nd Cong. 305 (1971) ("Rehnquist Hearings"). He argued to the Phoenix City Council in 1964 that "[h]ere you are talking about a man's private property and you are saying, in effect, that people shall have access to that man's property whether he wants it or not ...." Id. After the Council passed the ordinance, he continued to press the argument, maintaining that the ordinance "summarily does away with the historic right of the owner of a drug store, lunch counter, or theater to choose his own customers." Id. at 306. In his view, it was "impossible to justify the sacrifice of even a portion of our historic individual freedom for a purpose such as" integration in public accommodations. Id. at 307.3. These arguments did not prevail in Congress. The Senate Commerce Committee's report on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 appended a brief by Professor Paul Freund, which concluded that "[t]here is no serious question of the right of association or of property or of privacy as a barrier to the legislation, applicable as it is to commercial places of public accommodation." See S. Rep. No. 88-872, at 92 (1964). The Commerce Committee's report concurred with Freund's analysis, observing that "the right of the private property owner to serve or sell to whom he pleased" had never existed at English common law. Id. at 22. The House Judiciary Committee's report on the bill similarly rejected the argument that "the enactment of title II invades rights of privacy and of free association" because "the types of establishments involved in title II are those regularly held open to the public in general." H.R. Rep. No. 88914, at 9 (1963). The House Report accurately predict-17ed that "there is no question that the courts will uphold the principle that the right to be free from racial discrimination outweighs the interest to associate freely where those making the claim of free association have knowingly and for profit opened their doors to the public." Id.C. This Court Rejected Constitutional Challenges to Title II Seeking Commercial Constitutional ExceptionsPresident Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act on July 2, 1964. Business owners immediately went to court, again seeking a commercial constitutional exception to public accommodations laws. Those libertybased objections failed to persuade this Court, just as they had failed to persuade the 88th Congress at that pivotal moment in our history.1. In Heart of Atlanta, 379 U.S. at 241, the plaintiff argued that the Act violated the Constitution by "tak[ing] away the personal liberty of an individual to run his business as he sees fit with respect to the selection and service of his customers." Jurisdictional Statement and Brief of Appellant, Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964), 1964 WL 81380, at *32. Similar to petitioners, the motel argued that "[t]his right of ownership to use one's property as one sees fit is a fundamental principle underlying the private enterprise system." Id. at *51. Speaking in precisely the same terms as Petitioner, the motel insisted that "[t]o deprive a person of [his] basic right to pursue his calling ... unless he furnishes labor or services for certain individuals for whom he does not desire to work is obviously coercion if not outright18punishment," in violation of the Constitution. Id. at *57; see Pet. Br. at 2.The Court disagreed, explaining that the motel had "no `right' to select its guests as it [saw] fit, free from governmental regulation." Heart of Atlanta, 379 U.S. at 259. The Court rebuffed the motel's appeal for a commercial constitutional exception from public accommodations law in the plainest of terms: "a long line of cases ... rejected the claim that the prohibition of racial discrimination in public accommodations interferes with personal liberty." Id. at 260.2. In the next four years, the Court twice reaffirmed that holding. In Katzenbach, 379 U.S. at 294, it rejected a restaurant owner's argument that Title II unconstitutionally "deprive[d] the restaurant owners of liberty and property without due process of law in contravention of the guarantees of the Fifth Amendment" by interfering with his "right to use and control his property as he wishes" and to "deal or refuse to deal with whomever he pleases." McClung Br. at *31­32. Katzenbach involved a restaurant called Ollie's Barbecue that specialized in "barbecued meats and homemade pies." 379 U.S. at 296. In that case, much like this one, the barbecue owner contended that "[e]ven in a highly commercial context, a businessman has always possessed the right to deal with those he pleases, and for reasons personal to himself this right to exclude certain persons might and often does have real meaning to him." McClung Br. at *33. The owner further insisted that the "personal rights of persons in their personal convictions and in their choice of associates have been recognized and accorded constitutional protection by this Court." Id. In fact, in making this argument, the owner cited the same compelled-speech case that peti-19tioners repeatedly cite in their brief. Compare id. at *33 (citing W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943), with Pet. Br. at 3, 15, 29, 35, 46. Given this authority, the restaurant owner insisted, "it seems plain that Title II imposes upon restaurants within its coverage restraints on established rights of liberty and property which are entitled to constitutional protection." McClung Br. at *33.Petitioner makes strikingly similar arguments, beyond simply citing the same precedent. He contends that he has a First Amendment right to refuse to sell wedding cakes "in conflict with his religious beliefs," Pet. Br. at 1, which, like the owner in Katzenbach, have "real meaning to him." McClung Br. at *31­32. Amicus appreciates that those beliefs have profound importance to petitioner Phillips, and they are no doubt at least as strongly held as the "personal convictions" held by the owner of Ollie's Barbecue. Id. at *33. But, as in Katzenbach, those deeply-felt beliefs can find no shelter in the Constitution once a business owner chooses to enter the marketplace. For that reason, the Court rejected the restaurant owner's arguments in a footnote, holding that Heart of Atlanta "disposes of the challenges that the appellees base on the Fifth, Ninth, Tenth, and Thirteenth Amendments, and on the Civil Rights Cases." Katzenbach, 379 U.S. at 298 n.1.3. To the extent any doubt remained following these decisions, the Court interred the idea of a commercial constitutional exception to public accommodations laws in Piggie Park, 390 U.S. 400. In that case, another restaurant owner sought to defend himself from a lawsuit under Title II by arguing that it interfered with his First Amendment rights. The defendant maintained that he "believe[d] as a matter of religious20faith that racial intermixing or any contribution thereto contravenes the will of God," and so any application of the Act to his business violated his religious liberties. Second Am. Answer, Pet. App. 21a; see also Pet. App. 125a­127a (defendant explaining that his religion required segregation).The district court rejected the defendant's First Amendment claim:Undoubtedly defendant Bessinger has a constitutional right to espouse the religious beliefs of his own choosing, however, he does not have the absolute right to exercise and practice such beliefs in utter disregard of the clear constitutional rights of other citizens. This court refuses to lend credence or support to his position that he has a constitutional right to refuse to serve members of the Negro race in his business establishments upon the ground that to do so would violate his sacred religious beliefs.Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc., 256 F. Supp. 941, 945 (D.S.C. 1966). And when that claim reached this Court, it provoked a similar reaction: as in Katzenbach, the Court needed only a footnote to dispense with the restaurant owner's claim as "patently frivolous." Piggie Park, 390 U.S. at 402, n.5.By the time the Court decided Piggie Park in 1968, it was well-established that commercial enterprises could not invoke sincerely held religious or moral beliefs to exempt themselves from public accommodations laws. In fact, the leading intellectual proponents of a commercial constitutional exception to public accommodations laws reversed their thinking. See Rehnquist Hearings, supra, at 70 (explaining that "I21would not feel the same way today about [the Phoenix ordinance] as I did then"); Robert H. Bork, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law 80­ 81 (1990) (stating that his initial view with respect to Title II "was incorrect because, as I subsequently realized, there are no general principles to decide competing claims of association and nonassociation"). And when Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 602, 604 (1983), reached this Court, Justice Rehnquist made clear that he would have rejected a university's First Amendment claim based on its "fundamentalist conviction ... that the Scriptures forbid interracial dating and marriage." Brief for Petitioner, 1981 U.S. S. Ct. Briefs LEXIS 1345, at *41. Despite writing in dissent, Justice Rehnquist stated that Congress has the power to deny tax-exempt "status to organizations that practice racial discrimination," and that he agreed "with the Court such a requirement would not infringe on petitioners' First Amendment rights." 461 U.S. at 622 & n.4.As this history confirms, "times can blind us to certain truths." Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 579. In the years after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act and this Court's historic decisions, a "settled social consensus" eventually emerged that business owners who offer their goods and services to the public cannot claim constitutional sanctuary from public accommodations laws. Joseph William Singer, No Right to Exclude: Public Accommodations and Private Property, 90 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1283, 1291 (1996). Petitioners' effort to breathe new life into such constitutional arguments by recasting them as compelled-speech claims cannot be squared with this Court's unbroken line of precedent refusing to recognize a business owner's individual22right to avoid complying with a valid public accommodations law.II. PETITIONERS' CLAIMED COMPELLEDSPEECH EXEMPTION WOULD VITIATE PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS LAWSPetitioners and the federal government ask this Court to disregard the hard-earned lessons of our history, and to hold for the first time that the Constitution requires a compelled-speech exemption to public accommodations laws. Recognizing such an exemption would invite myriad challenges to the enforcement of public accommodations laws, as much business activity can be characterized as expressive. More broadly, there would be no principled way to recognize only compelled-speech exemptions while rejecting claims for exemptions based on the free exercise of religion or the freedom of association. The argument pressed by petitioners and the government in this case thus threatens to cripple the effectiveness of the federal public accommodations laws that the Department of Justice is charged with enforcing, as well as comparable state and local laws.A. This Court Has Recognized That Applying Public Accommodations Laws To Commercial Establishments Raises No First Amendment ConcernsPetitioners and the government attempt to locate their claimed First Amendment right in this Court's decisions in Hurley, 515 U.S. 557, and Dale, 530 U.S. 640. But those decisions are inapplicable here. The normal rule is that laws that regulate conduct irrespective of whether the conduct may have an expressive element--like public accommodations laws--are23subject at most to deferential First Amendment review. See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 389 (1992); see also Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 62 (2006) ("FAIR"). Hurley and Dale recognized a narrow exception to that rule, holding that a public accommodations law may not be applied to an expressive association whose purpose is to communicate its members' messages, when doing so would force the association to alter its messages. But in those very decisions, the Court emphasized that applying public accommodations laws to commercial establishments--like petitioners'--raises no First Amendment concern.This case is governed by the rule, not its exception. Extending the exception to cover this case would have profoundly destabilizing consequences.1. In Hurley, the Court held that requiring the organizers of the private parade to permit a pro-gayrights group to march in the parade unconstitutionally compelled the organizers to change their message. 515 U.S. at 576. Emphasizing the "inherent expressiveness of marching to make a point," the Court concluded that the parade itself is "a form of expression" in which the organizers chose the messages to communicate. Id. at 568. The Court was careful to note that public accommodations laws "do not, as a general matter, violate the First ... Amendment[]" because they focus on "the act of discriminating against individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and services on the prescribed grounds," rather than on the content of speech. Id. at 572. In the case of the parade, however, the State had attempted to apply its public accommodations law to "the sponsors' speech itself," by requiring the organizers to accommodate participants24whose messages they did not condone. Id. at 573. Doing so effectively compelled the organizers to alter the overall message of the parade.Similarly, in Dale, the Court held that applying a public accommodations law to compel the Boy Scouts to permit a gay man to be an assistant scoutmaster violated the Scouts' right of expressive association. 530 U.S. at 660. The Court emphasized that the Boy Scouts' purpose was to "transmit ... a system of values" to young people--in other words, to engage in expression--and that the Boy Scouts transmitted those values through scout leaders. Id. at 650. Again, the Court observed that applying public accommodations laws to "clearly commercial entities, such as restaurants, bars, and hotels," gave rise to relatively little "potential for conflict" between those laws and First Amendment rights. Id. at 657. Applying the public accommodations law to the Boy Scouts, however, expanded that law well beyond its traditional commercial focus to "places that often may not carry with them open invitations to the public" and, in the case of the Boy Scouts, private "membership organizations" that exist for expressive purposes. Id. at 657, see also id. at 659 n.4 (suggesting that the Boy Scouts are not a public accommodation at all). That application, the Court concluded, was unconstitutional: because the Boy Scouts' values included a belief that homosexuality was immoral, requiring them to include a gay scout leader would necessarily force them to alter their message. Id. at 649­51.2. In Dale and Hurley, then, the Court viewed the expressive associations at issue as different in kind from businesses that have been the traditional subject of public accommodations laws. Dale, 530 U.S. at 657; Hurley, 515 U.S. at 572­73. Those businesses have25long been subject to public accommodations laws, and such laws have always had an incidental effect on speech. FAIR, 547 U.S. at 62 (antidiscrimination statutes require businesses to take down "white applicants only" signs). But applying public accommodations laws to those traditional businesses was, in the Court's view, unlikely to raise First Amendment issues. Dale, 530 U.S. at 657.That conclusion follows from the historical consensus (originating at common law, and adopted by Congress, the States, and the courts) that when a business offers goods or services for commercial purposes, it assumes an obligation to be generally open to the public. While expressive associations exist to communicate a message, and therefore must make decisions about the content of that message and the nature of their members, the law has historically held that commercial establishments must be open to the public because they exist for commercial purposes, and any speech they engage in is incidental to those purposes. As a result, commercial establishments have never had discretion under the law to make expressive decisions about whom to exclude.That understanding is imperative in a pluralistic society. To permit entities whose activities are not inherently expressive to challenge generally applicable laws based on "incidental" effects on speech would be to enable them to "erect a shield against laws requiring access simply by asserting that mere association would impair [their] message." FAIR, 547 U.S. at 69­70. As discussed below, permitting commercial establishments to claim First Amendment exemptions to antidiscrimination laws would render it more difficult to enforce those laws to ensure that members of disfa-26vored groups are able to participate as full members of American society.B. Because Virtually Any Business Activity Can Be Recast As Expressive In Nature, Petitioners' Claimed Exemption Would Eviscerate Antidiscrimination Laws1. Petitioners attempt to avoid the sweeping consequences of the First Amendment exemption they seek by asserting that their cakes are uniquely expressive. In petitioners' view, the expressive content of the cakes means that the act of designing and baking them expresses a message of support for the marriage in question. Pet. Br. at 24. But many, perhaps most, businesses could make similar claims. Consider the following:· Recently, a restaurant in Washington, D.C., refused to provide a single dessert to a gay couple because two men sharing a dessert would not "go with the ambiance of the restaurant."4 The restaurant clearly believed that allowing the couple to share dessert communicated that such conduct was acceptable. In serving the dessert on two plates, the restaurant sent an unmistakable message of disapprobation.· A restaurant could claim that being compelled to admit African-American customers, take their orders, explain the menu, and convey prices entails compelled expression. Even permitting blacks and whites to commingle could be said to communicate that the customers are equal members of the community and that integration is appropriate.4 http://wapo.st/2ySarwy.27· Fertility clinics could contend that advising samesex couples on their medical options for having children and providing appropriate treatment, entails compelled speech. Like petitioners' custom wedding cakes, clinic staff must tailor their advice to specific patients. They could claim that providing their services to same-sex or interracial couples conveys the message that it is appropriate for such couples to raise children.· A clothing store that provides personal shoppers who give personalized advice may claim that it should not be compelled to serve customers shopping for outfits for a wedding of same-sex couples because doing so sends a message of endorsement.As these examples show, no principled distinction can be drawn between petitioner's custom wedding cakes and a wide array of business activities that could be cast as expressive. In each case, the proprietor chooses the content of his expression--how to plate the cake, what advice to give, where to seat patrons. In each case, engaging in the commercial transaction compelled by an antidiscrimination statute entails forced speech and association. Petitioners have not even attempted to explain how their wedding cakes are distinguishable from these examples and the myriad other such claims one can imagine. Recognizing petitioners' claim could therefore permit asserted expressive rights to eviscerate antidiscrimination laws.2. The federal government, for its part, attempts to cabin its proposed compelled-speech exemption by arguing that the exemption should apply only when (i) the product or service is expressive, and (ii) the business owner provides it on commission (as opposed to28providing it off the shelf). Brief of United States 19­22 ("U.S. Br.").This is no limit at all. If wedding cakes are sufficiently expressive to come within the Hurley/Dale exception, so would any number of ordinary products and services, such as those described above. And virtually all services, and many goods, are "made to order," in the sense that they are undertaken in response to customer requests. Restaurant meals, for instance, are made to order, and both the dishes themselves and the act of serving particular patrons have expressive components. See supra pp. 26­27. In the government's view, then, restaurants apparently could claim a First Amendment right to refuse to serve particular patrons.Nor is it clear why it is that, if perceived endorsement is the problem, petitioners' claimed exemption could be limited to products or services made to order or on commission. Surely the act of selling a pre-made wedding ring to a same-sex couple sends the same message of endorsement as making one to order. In all events, applying the government's made-to-order limitation would embroil courts in parsing degrees of expressiveness, not to mention purchase agreements and vendor contracts.The government also asserts that a proprietor may claim an exemption on the ground that the mere use of its specially made product in a ceremony compels the proprietor to "figuratively" participate in it. U.S. Br. at 19. But the government does not explain why it is reasonable to assume that any witness to a wedding ceremony would conclude, based on the use of an inanimate product (such as a wedding dress) in the ceremony, that the product's creator endorses the ceremo-29ny. If a law school's hosting particular groups on campus, providing a room for them, and advertising their presence does not suggest that the law school endorses the hosted groups, FAIR, 547 U.S. at 65, it is difficult to see how providing a product that is used in a ceremony that one does not attend (and may not even know about) could be understood to convey endorsement.3. The government also fails to grapple with the obvious implications of its argument. If the government's compelled-speech analysis is correct, there would be no evident justification for disallowing exemptions based upon claims of free exercise or freedom of association. These are all claims of constitutional stature, and this Court has never suggested that the freedom not to speak is entitled to greater solicitude than the right to the free exercise of religion or freedom of association.The Court has long held that a claimed free-exercise right, without more, does not justify an exemption to generally applicable laws that incidentally burden the exercise of that right. Employment Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 882 (1990); accord Bob Jones Univ., 461 U.S. at 604. Notwithstanding the fundamental importance of religious exercise, the Court in Smith reasoned that the First Amendment "has not been offended" by burdens that are "merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision," 494 U.S. at 878, and laws of general application "could not function" if they were continually subject to challenge on religious grounds. 5 Id. at 880. Those premises are5 After Smith, Congress enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb et seq., which "prohibits the Federal Government from taking any action that30equally applicable to petitioners' compelled-speech claim. Recognizing that claim would therefore undermine Smith's reasoning--and throw into doubt decades of jurisprudence. Remarkably, the government fails to even to address this risk, simply stating in a footnote that it declines to address the Free Exercise Clause. U.S. Br. at 33 n.6.C. The Assertion That An Exemption From Public Accommodations Laws Can Be Limited To Opposition To Gays And Lesbians And Marriage Equality Is MeritlessIn a further effort to cabin the disquieting implications of their proposed approach, petitioners and the federal government suggest that a constitutional exemption from public accommodations laws would not extend to laws that bar discrimination based on race or opposition to interracial marriage. That distinction lacks any principled basis. When the Civil Rights Act was enacted, its protections were controversial in part because they contradicted the sincerely held religious and moral beliefs of a part of the population. This Court, by upholding the statute against constitutional challenge, and by recognizing the right to interracial marriage, helped ensure that the right to be free of racial discrimination would become what it is today: asubstantially burdens the exercise of religion" absent a compelling interest. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2759 (2014). As this Court held in Hobby Lobby, RFRA has the effect of permitting free-exercise exemptions to generally applicable statutes in certain circumstances. The fact that a statute was necessary to achieve that result confirms that the Constitution does not require it.31norm that commands broad assent. The rights of gay and lesbian Americans, recognized relatively recently, remain the subject of controversy on religious and moral grounds, just as the right of African Americans to equal treatment was controversial a half-century ago. By granting petitioner Phillips a constitutional right to close his business to gay and lesbian couples who plan to marry but not to interracial couples, this Court would be saying in no uncertain terms that discrimination against gay and lesbian people is permissible in ways that racial discrimination is not. Such a message would have devastating consequences for the principle that gay and lesbian people deserve to be treated and full and equal members of their communities.1. The government first argues that while "eradicating racial discrimination" is a compelling interest, eradicating discrimination against gays and lesbians is not. U.S. Br. at 32. That assertion contradicts this Court's repeated recognition that gays and lesbians are entitled to equal dignity under the law. In Romer v. Evans, the Court held that the State may not "impose[] a special disability upon" gays and lesbians by denying them the existing protections of public accommodations laws. 517 U.S. at 631. The Court rejected the State's reliance on "freedom of association, and in particular the liberties of landlords or employers who have personal or religious objections to homosexuality." Id. at 635. Accepting the government's premise that States have a diminished interest in protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination would effectively single out this class of people for disfavored treatment under antidiscrimination laws--precisely what Romer prohibited.32The government's assertion that the state interest in protecting the right of same-sex couples to marry is less compelling than its interest in protecting the right of interracial couples to marry is equally unjustified. The rights to marriage recognized in Obergefell and Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), are grounded in the same equal protection and due process principles. The Obergefell Court adopted Loving's rationale that unequal treatment with respect to marriage "offended central precepts of liberty." 135 S. Ct. at 2603. Moreover, the Court reasoned, the importance of "same-sex marriage" rights "became more clear and compelling from a full awareness and understanding of the hurt that resulted from laws barring interracial unions." Id. at 2603. There is no way to conclude, consistent with Obergefell, that the constitutional protection of marriage for same-sex couples is any less fundamental than the constitutional protection of interracial marriage. It follows that the state's interest in eradicating discrimination against same-sex marriage is as compelling as its interest in eradicating discrimination against interracial marriage.2. The government next argues that the state's interest in protecting the marriage right recognized in Obergefell is insufficiently "weighty" because opposition to marriage equality is held "in good faith by reasonable and sincere people." U.S. Br. at 32. But in Obergefell this Court recognized that "when that sincere, personal opposition [to marriage equality] becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied." 135 S. Ct. at 2602. The Court thus recognized that permitting sincerely33held religious beliefs opposing marriage equality to dictate civil rights raises serious dignitary concerns. The State surely has a "weighty" interest in addressing those concerns by ensuring that gays and lesbians are not denied goods or services based on fundamental aspects of their personal lives and relationships.There is, moreover, no principled basis for drawing a bright-line rule privileging opposition to same-sex marriage while disapproving opposition to interracial marriage. The sincerity of the beliefs is certainly no ground for distinction: many segregationists believed that white supremacy was religiously ordained and that marriages between persons of different races violated God's plan. As the Court observed in Loving, the trial judge in that case opined that "Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents.... The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix."6 388 U.S. at 3. In 1981, Bob Jones University unsuccessfully claimed that its prohibition on interracial dating should not result in the loss of special tax status because it "genuinely believe[d] that the Bible forbids interracial dating and marriage." Bob Jones Univ., 461 U.S. at 580. Even today, some believe that interracial marriage is "a bad thing for society." Pew Research Center, Intermarriage in the 50 Years Since Loving v. Virginia, Public Views6 Similar examples abound. For instance, in 1947, Mississippi governor Theodore G. Bilbo argued that "there is every reason to believe that miscegenation and amalgamation are sins of man in direct defiance to the will of God." Theodore G. Bilbo, Take Your Choice: Separation of Mongrelization 109 (1947).34On Intermarriage (2017)7 (9% of those surveyed believe that interracial marriage is bad for society, and 10% would oppose it in their family). To the extent these objections to interracial marriage are rooted in religious or moral concerns, the government offers no persuasive reason for treating them as unworthy of constitutional protection while granting constitutional status to petitioners' objections.The government's position thus comes down to the suggestion that opposition to "same-sex marriage" is more "reasonable" than opposition to interracial marriage, because opposition to "same-sex marriage" can reflect "decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises." U.S. Br. at 32 (quoting Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2594). But the "reasonableness" or "decency" of particular beliefs is not a sound basis for deciding whether antidiscrimination laws may be enforced in a particular case. Courts should not be in the business of crafting exemptions to antidiscrimination laws based on their view of the reasonableness or decency of the beliefs at issue.In sum, the government asks this Court to privilege opposition to marriage by same-sex couples over the right itself. Doing so would effectively hold that this Court's decisions in Lawrence, Windsor, and Obergefell are due less constitutional respect than Heart of Atlanta and Loving. This Court should reject the government's baseless attempt to consign gays and lesbians to second-class status under antidiscrimination laws.7 http://pewrsr.ch/2vzeVt5.35CONCLUSION The judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,DONALD B.

I.IMMIGRATION JUDGES AND THE BOARD ARE AUTHORIZED TO ORDERADMINISTRATIVE CLOSUREA. Department Of Justice Regulations Authorize Immigration Judges And The Board To Order Administrative Closure As A Docket-Management ToolThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., charges theAttorney General with administering the Nation's system of immigration adjudication. 8 U.S.C.§ 1103(g). For more than three decades, the Attorney General has delegated that authority to theExecutive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which today is made up primarily of theBoard of Immigration Appeals and more than 300 immigration judges. See Immigration ReviewFunction, Editorial Amendments, 48 Fed. Reg. 8,038 (Feb. 25, 1983) (codified at 8 C.F.R. §1003.0) (establishing EOIR). Those entities are authorized by law to preside over and toadjudicate immigration proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.10(b) (authorizing IJs to "conduct[]hearings under section 240 of the [INA] and such other proceedings the Attorney General mayassign to them"); id. § 1003.1(d)(1) (The Board "shall function as an appellate body chargedwith the review of those administrative adjudications under the [INA] that the Attorney Generalmay by regulation assign to it.").Both the INA and the regulations the Attorney General has promulgated to implement itenvision an adjudicative system--a system of courts and cases--for determining the rights andentitlements of individuals placed into immigration proceedings. Since its enactment, the INAhas authorized immigration judges (originally known as "special inquiry officers") to "conductproceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien," 8 U.S.C. §1229a(a)(1)--proceedings in which IJs "administer oaths, receive evidence, and interrogate,examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses," id. § 1229a(b)(1), and after which IJs4"shall decide whether an alien is removable from the United States ... based only on the evidence produced at the hearing," id. § 1229a(c)(1)(A). The INA, in other words, makes clear that a noncitizen will be removed from the United States only after an individualized adjudication occurs.The regulations promulgated by the Attorney General implement Congress's expectation, instructing IJs to "decid[e] the individual cases before them ... subject to the applicable governing standards," 8 C.F.R. § 1003.10(b), and directing the Board to "function as an appellate body charged with the review of ... administrative adjudications," id. § 1003.1(d)(1). Of particular importance here, those regulations authorize both entities to "exercise their independent judgment and discretion and ... take any action ... appropriate and necessary for the disposition" of their cases. Id. § 1003.10(b) (IJs) (emphasis added); see also id. § 1003.1(d)(1)(ii) (the Board shall "exercise [its] independent judgment and discretion [and] ... may take any action ... appropriate and necessary for the disposition of the case" (emphasis added)). Thus, although the immigration courts and the BIA are not Article III courts, by design they exercise adjudicative authority, and their processes and modes of decision closely resemble those used by courts across the Nation.As the regulation makes clear, the Attorney General has entrusted to the Board and to the IJs the authority to take actions they deem necessary to deciding cases. Inherent in that authority to decide cases is the power to decide whether to defer from acting on a particular case at a particular time. The Supreme Court has explained--in the context of Article III courts--that "the power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants." Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936); see also Clinton v. Jones, 5205U.S. 681, 706 (1997) (observing that the "discretion to stay proceedings [is] an incident to [the] power to control [a court's] own docket"). The same is true for the BIA and immigration courts; absent the express withdrawal of such authority by the Attorney General or by Congress, they are entrusted to "take any action ... appropriate and necessary for the disposition of" their cases, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(1)(ii), 1003.10(b),--including the entry of a stay of proceedings. See Landis, 299 U.S. at 254.Administrative closure is simply a version of a stay that removes a case from "active status" on a court's docket. In an era of exceptionally heavy caseloads among courts and agencies alike, such a procedural mechanism is a practical necessity. It permits adjudicative entities to concentrate resources on matters in active litigation--a tool "`particularly useful in circumstances in which a case, though not dead, [is] likely to remain moribund for an appreciable period of time.'" Papotto v. Hartford Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 731 F.3d 265, 275 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Freeman v. Pittsburgh Glass Works, LLC, 709 F.3d 240, 247 (3d Cir. 2013)). Courts regularly employ administrative closure, or similar practices known by slightly different names. The Third Circuit has described it as "an established practice among district courts" in that circuit, id. at 275, and it is widely accepted by courts in circuits across the country. See, e.g., St. Marks Place Hous. Co. v. HUD, 610 F.3d 75, 81 (D.C. Cir. 2010); CitiFinancial Corp. v. Harrison, 453 F.3d 245, 250 (5th Cir. 2006); Lehman v. Revolution Portfolio, LLC, 166 F.3d 389, 392 (1st Cir. 1999); see also 15A Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 3914.6 & n.29 (2d ed. 1992 & 2017 Supp.) (collecting cases). There is nothing unusual about the practice; it is no more than "a familiar, albeit essentially ad hoc, way in which courts remove cases from their active files without making any final adjudication." Lehman, 166 F.3d at 392. There is no obstacle to its use by IJs and the Board.6B. The Department's Own Longstanding And Consistent Use Of Administrative Closure Underscores The Practical Utility Of The ProcedureConsistent with the principles discussed above, the Board and IJs have employed administrative closure without incident as a docket-management tool for at least three decades. During that time, the Department has promulgated several regulations and has issued guidance premised on the availability of administrative closure as a procedural mechanism and providing instructions for its use. The tool is by now familiar, unremarkable, and widely used.The Board's approval of administrative closure dates at least to its 1988 opinion in Matter of Amico, 19 I. & N. Dec. 652 (BIA 1988). In Amico, the respondent had sought and received three continuances, but when he failed to appear for a fourth hearing, the IJ administratively closed the case. Although the Board reversed in that case on the ground that administrative closure was not appropriate under those particular circumstances, the Board recognized that IJs have the power to order administrative closure in appropriate circumstances. "The administrative closing of a case," the Board explained, "is merely an administrative convenience which allows the removal of cases from the calendar in appropriate situations." Id. at 654 n.1.Administrative closure has since become widely recognized as an essential aspect of immigration courts' authority and ability to manage their dockets so that they can focus on cases requiring immediate attention. Over the last three decades, more than 1,000 Board opinions have evaluated parties' requests for administrative closure. The ABA is not aware of any opinion in which any Board member has suggested the need to reexamine whether immigration judges have the authority to order administrative closure.7Moreover, the Board's opinions demonstrate that IJs do not indiscriminately terminate cases, but rather properly employ administrative closure in certain sets of circumstances where that tool is most needed and appropriate. Most common are cases in which, as the Board observed in Matter of Avetisyan, the most efficient disposition of a case requires the parties and the court to "await an action or event that is relevant to immigration proceedings but is outside the control of the parties or the court and may not occur for a significant or undetermined period of time." 25 I. & N. Dec. 688, 692 (BIA 2012). For instance, a noncitizen may have submitted a visa petition to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), see Matter of Hashmi, 24 I. & N. Dec. 785, 791 n.4 (BIA 2009), or may be awaiting a certification from a law enforcement agency that she has been helpful to an ongoing criminal investigation, a predicate to obtaining a U-visa, see Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I. & N. Dec. 807, 811 (BIA 2012). In cases like those, "[a]dministrative closure is an attractive option, as it will assist in ensuring that only those cases that are likely to be resolved are before the Immigration Judge." Hashmi, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 791 n.4.33Over the last seven years, administrative closure has been used to implement theDepartment of Homeland Security's decision to exercise prosecutorial discretion with respect topersons in removal proceedings. See Memorandum from Riah Ramogan, Acting Principal LegalAdvisor, U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, to OPLA Attorneys 2, Apr. 6, 2015,https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/prosecutorial-discretion/guidance_eoir_johnson_memo.pdf(explaining that ICE attorneys "should generally seek administrative closure or dismissal of casesit determines are not priorities"). Although the ABA generally supports the use of prosecutorialdiscretion in immigration proceedings, see Reforming the Immigration System, supra, at 1-60, theauthority to order administrative closure is independent of the power to exercise prosecutorialdiscretion. Enforcement priorities are for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), not theimmigration courts, to set. See Matter of W-Y-U-, 27 I. & N. Dec. 17, 19 (BIA 2017) ("[I]nconsidering administrative closure, an Immigration Judge cannot review whether an alien fallswithin the DHS's enforcement priorities or will actually be removed from the United States."). Adecision to retain the use of administrative closure would not affect DHS's authority to set or alterthose priorities at any time.8Regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice recognize that administrative closure is important to the Department's efficient and balanced implementation of the INA. Over the last two decades, the Department has promulgated more than a dozen regulations that expressly link immigration relief to the availability of administrative closure. Some regulations directly condition relief on a person's ability to obtain administrative closure. The regulations governing provisional unlawful presence waivers, for instance, prohibit a noncitizen in removal proceedings from applying for such a waiver "unless [his or her] removal proceedings are administratively closed and have not been recalendared at the time of filing the application." 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iii). The regulations implementing the V-visa program operate similarly: An individual in removal proceedings who believes she is eligible for a V-visa is directed to move for administrative closure, and IJs are instructed to grant such closure if the individual appears to be eligible for relief. See id. § 1214.3 (IJ "shall administratively close the proceeding" in such a case (emphasis added)).4 These regulations plainly presuppose the availability of administrative closure; indeed, if IJs and the Board were not authorized to order it, these regulations would point noncitizens seeking relief toward a dead end.Finally, the Department has also repeatedly issued guidance documents recognizing that administrative closure allows the Board and IJs to more efficiently manage their dockets. In 2013, the Chief Immigration Judge issued Operating Policies and Procedures Memorandum (OPPM) 13-01, which described administrative closure as "a docketing tool that has existed for decades," and "strongly encouraged" IJs "to utilize administrative closure in appropriate cases."4For other examples, see 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.11(d)(1)(i), 1214.2(a) (regulations governing T-visas); id. §§ 245a.12(b), 245a.20(a)(1) (LIFE Legalization); id. §§ 245.13(d)(3), 1245.13(d)(3)(NACARA); id. §§ 245.15(p)(4), 1245.15(p)(4) (HRIFA); id. §§ 245.21(c), 1245.21(c)(Indochinese Parole Adjustment Act); and id. §§ 1240.62(b)(1)(i), 1240.70(f)- (g) (ABC benefits).9OPPM 13-01 at 3-4, Mar. 7, 2013, https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2013/03/08/13-01.pdf; see also id. at 4 ("Administrative closure under the standards set forth inAvetisyan provides judges with a powerful tool to help them manage their dockets ....").5 A2015 memorandum from the Chief Immigration Judge further directed that in certain cases inwhich a noncitizen is seeking relief in another forum, "the case must be administratively closedor reset for that process to occur." Memorandum from Brian M. O'Leary, Chief ImmigrationJudge, to All Immigration Judges 2, Mar. 24, 2015, http://bit.ly/2GbwKjZ (hereinafter O'LearyMemo.) (emphasis added). As those agency documents reflect, administrative closure hasbecome an integral component of the Department's efforts to ensure that the immigrationadjudication system is efficient and balanced.C. The Factors Set Out In Avetisyan And W-Y-U- Offer Appropriate Guidance To IJs And The BoardThe decision whether to order administrative closure is well suited to the sound discretionof IJs and the Board. The factors set out in the Board's opinion in Avetisyan (as modified by itsopinion in W-Y-U-) offer useful guidance to IJs and the Board in the exercise of that discretion.The Board explained in Avetisyan that, as a general matter, IJs and the Board shouldweigh six factors in considering whether administrative closure is justified:(1) the reason administrative closure is sought; (2) the basis for any opposition to administrative closure; (3) the likelihood the respondent will succeed on any petition, application, or other action he or she is pursuing outside of removal proceedings; (4) the anticipated duration of the closure; (5) the responsibility of either party, if any, in contributing to any current or anticipated delay; and (6) the ultimate outcome of removal proceedings (for example, termination of the proceedings or entry of a removal order) when the case is recalendared before the Immigration Judge or the appeal is reinstated before the Board.5OPPM 13-01 was supplemented and amended last year by OPPM 17-01, but OPPM 17-01addresses continuances only; it does not discuss administrative closure. See OPPM 17-01 at 1,July 31, 2017, https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/oppm17-01/download.1025 I. & N. Dec. at 696. As the Board observed in Avetisyan, these factors are similar to the factors used by IJs when evaluating motions to reopen and requests for continuances. Id. The Board has emphasized that administrative closure is not appropriate where a noncitizen without a reasonable prospect of obtaining relief merely seeks to delay the adjudication of his case "as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings." Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I. & N. Dec. at 815.The Avetisyan factors, at their core, instruct the decisionmaker--the Board or an IJ--to weigh the reasons administrative closure is sought against the reasons (if any) that it is opposed, with an eye toward "the likelihood the respondent will succeed on any petition, application, or other action he or she is pursuing outside of removal proceedings" as well as "the ultimate outcome of removal proceedings." 25 I. & N. Dec. at 696. As the Board clarified last year in Matter of W-Y-U-, in other words, at least where administrative closure is opposed by one party, "the primary consideration ... is whether the party opposing administrative closure has provided a persuasive reason for the case to proceed and be resolved on the merits." 27 I. & N. Dec. at 20. Unsurprisingly, this practical balancing of interests is exactly what courts do when deciding whether to grant an opposed request for a stay. See, e.g., Belize Soc. Dev. Ltd. v. Gov't of Belize, 668 F.3d 724, 732-33 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (a court should "`weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance' ... between [its] interests in judicial economy and any possible hardship to the parties" (quoting Landis, 299 U.S. at 254-55)); Lockyer v. Mirant Corp., 398 F.3d 1098, 1110 (9th Cir. 2005) (similar). As those decisions recognize, administrative closure is appropriate where the interest in pausing proceedings is weightier than the interest in allowing them to proceed.11That standard will generally be met where a noncitizen has a realistic possibility ofobtaining immigration relief in another forum. As the Board has repeatedly held, a noncitizenwith an application pending in another forum that appears to meet the relevant criteria for reliefis a paradigmatic candidate for administrative closure. See Avetisyan, 25 I. & N. Dec. at 696(administrative closure appropriate where a noncitizen "has properly appealed from the denial ofa prima facie approvable visa petition"); see also Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I. & N. Dec. at 815; Hashmi,24 I. & N. Dec. at 790. A noncitizen need not establish that it is absolutely certain he or she willobtain relief in another forum; rather, it should be enough to show that the prospect of obtainingsuch relief is real, not "purely speculative." Avetisyan, 25 I. & N. Dec. at 696; see also Matter ofMontiel, 26 I. & N. Dec. 555, 557 (BIA 2015) (administrative closure often appropriate where adefendant appeals his criminal conviction). By contrast, where the prospect of relief is remote orspeculative, the equities would generally tilt in the other direction, and administrative closurewould not be warranted. Avetisyan, 25 I. & N. Dec. at 696.II.WITHDRAWAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE CLOSURE AUTHORITY WOULD COMPROMISE THEINTEGRITY, EFFICIENCY, AND FAIRNESS OF THE IMMIGRATION ADJUDICATIONSYSTEMA. The ABA Has A Longstanding Commitment To The Integrity, Efficiency, And Fairness Of The Immigration Adjudication SystemFor decades, the ABA and its members have devoted significant resources to the study,analysis, and practice of immigration law. In doing so, the ABA has expended particular timeand energy studying the immigration adjudication system--most recently in its comprehensive2010 study of removal proceedings, Reforming the Immigration System, supra. That studyconcluded--echoing the observations of numerous stakeholders and commentators--that the12adjudication system is seriously underfunded and under-resourced, creating significant problems for IJs and noncitizens alike.It is widely recognized that the immigration adjudication system is under-resourced. In Fiscal Year 2016, more than 328,000 new matters were filed in immigration courts across the country. U.S. Dep't. of Justice, Exec. Office for Immigration Review, FY 2016 Statistics Yearbook, A2 & Fig. 1 (Mar. 2017) (hereinafter FY 2016 Yearbook), https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/fysb16/download. Such a workload is exceptionally challenging for the Nation's immigration judges to process. Doing so without adding to the backlog would require each IJ to process roughly 20 matters each week, or four matters each weekday--a grueling pace for any court. And the already existing backlog is immense; as of December 2017, more than 667,000 cases were pending on immigration court dockets across the country. See Syracuse Univ., Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), Hot Spots With Highest Growth in Immigration Court Backlog, http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/497/ (last accessed Feb. 14, 2018). On average, those cases have been pending for 708 days, or just under two years. Syracuse Univ., TRAC, Immigration Court Backlog Tool, http://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/court_backlog/ (last accessed Feb. 14, 2018).The gap in resources available to immigration courts makes it difficult for them to render justice in an efficient and thorough manner. As Reforming the Immigration System describes, the demands placed on immigration judges by the current backlog are substantial: They are required to issue multiple reasoned decisions each day with little support by administrative staff or law clerks. Supra, at 2-17. Those burdens have exacted a systemic toll on IJs; as one 2008 study recounts, immigration judges report "higher levels of burnout than any other professional group" tested, "including physicians in busy hospitals and prison wardens." Id. It is no surprise that IJs13often do not issue reasoned written decisions, id. at 2-26; that there are wide and striking disparities among IJs regarding grant rates for various forms of immigration relief, id. at 2-15; and that, as a result, stakeholders across a variety of contexts have expressed a concern of the quality of the adjudications that take place in immigration courts, id. at 2-16.B. The Withdrawal Of Administrative Closure Authority Would Compromise The Integrity, Efficiency, And Fairness Of The Immigration Adjudication SystemAny decision to discontinue the use of administrative closure would be counterproductive to ongoing efforts to improve the immigration adjudication system.6First, the withdrawal of administrative closure authority would dramatically increase the workload of immigration judges and the BIA. As noted above, the immigration courts are struggling under an enormous backlog of cases: As of December 2017, more than 667,000 matters are pending before IJs nationwide, with many individuals waiting years to receive a hearing. Administrative closure offers one mechanism for releasing some of the pressure on this embattled system. By closing cases that are not priorities, IJs can focus on the most pressing and serious cases and hold other cases in abeyance--often with ICE's agreement. In FY 2016, more than 48,000 cases were administratively closed, representing one in four immigration cases "completed" that year. See FY 2016 Yearbook, at A8, C5-C7.Revoking administrative closure authority would work serious damage to the efficient processing of cases through the system, as these figures illustrate. The addition of more than6Because existing regulations delegate docket management authority to IJs and the Board,thus authorizing administrative closure, see supra pp. 4-10, no additional delegation of authorityis required to maintain present practices. If the Attorney General concludes that an expressdelegation is required, however, the ABA urges him to promptly promulgate regulationsdelegating the authority to administratively close cases, for the reasons set out in this section.1448,000 cases annually to the immigration courts' merits dockets would make it even more difficult for IJs to render decisions in an efficient and thorough manner while simultaneously increasing the pressure on IJs to issue hasty or unreasoned decisions. There is simply no good reason to add thousands of low-priority cases to IJs' already-crowded dockets.Second, the withdrawal of administrative closure authority would impede meaningful access to relief for many individuals who have meritorious claims. As noted above, the paradigmatic case for administrative closure is a person who may qualify for immigration relief upon the completion of some other administrative or judicial process--obtaining the predicate findings necessary to qualify for a U-visa, for instance, see 8 C.F.R. § 214.14, or waiting for one's priority date to arrive, see Hashmi, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 790. See also id. at 791 n.4 ("Administrative closure is an attractive option in these situations, as it will assist in ensuring that only those cases that are likely to be resolved are before the Immigration Judge.").Withdrawing the authority from IJs and the Board to administratively close proceedings would make it considerably more difficult for those individuals to obtain relief. In the absence of administrative closure, IJs confronted with such cases will either issue continuance after continuance to allow noncitizens to pursue relief in another forum or will issue final orders of removal, pretermitting those proceedings. Neither course is appropriate or desirable in an efficient and balanced adjudicative system. An increased reliance on continuances would be highly detrimental to the effective operation of the courts, forcing IJs and the parties to expend valuable time and resources on cases that do not need to be adjudicated, while simultaneously exposing noncitizens to the risk that their attorneys will fail to notify them of a subsequent hearing date, among other perils. And entering final orders of removal when an immigrant has a fair likelihood of obtaining immigration relief--for instance, a person with a prima facie valid15visa application pending--is arbitrary and contrary to the Immigration and Nationality Act's recognition that certain classes of individuals are deserving of relief. A decision to withdraw administrative closure authority, in other words, is not an abstract or procedural one; it would have profound and long-lasting consequences on the operation of the immigration adjudication system and the lives of those who must proceed through it.C. Other Procedural Tools, Including Continuances, Dismissal, And Termination Of Proceedings, Are Not Effective Substitutes For Administrative ClosureThe Attorney General has also asked whether other existing docket management tools-- specifically, a continuance for good cause shown, dismissal without prejudice, and termination without prejudice--can substitute for administrative closure. Although those mechanisms are also important tools for docket management and efficient adjudication of cases, they cannot serve as effective substitutes for administrative closure.A continuance for good cause, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29, offers the parties only a temporary window of time to seek relief elsewhere. As the Board observed in Avetisyan, "[b]ecause it keeps a case on the Immigration Judge's active calendar, a continuance may be appropriately utilized to await additional action required of the parties that will be, or is expected to be, completed within a reasonably certain and brief amount of time." 25 I. & N. Dec. at 691. But many of the judicial and administrative processes that warrant the use of administrative closure will take extended or unpredictable amounts of time to complete. For example, an application for a U-visa must be accompanied by a certification from a law enforcement officer, a process that may take time, especially if a criminal investigation is ongoing. See O'Leary Memo., supra, at 2. An even longer wait may occur where a person in removal proceedings has submitted a16visa petition to USCIS and must await the arrival of her priority date before she can apply for adjustment of status. See Hashmi, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 790.The parties and the court could perhaps fashion a makeshift replacement for the current system by seeking and granting repeated continuances. See Hashmi, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 791 n.4 (describing "the repeated rescheduling of a case that is clearly not ready to be concluded"). Even if EOIR were to acquiesce to such a system, but see OPPM 17-01, supra, at 2 (memorandum from Chief Immigration Judge discouraging IJs from "granting multiple and lengthy continuances"), such a wasteful regime would serve no conceivable end. It would require the parties to continually reappear for hearings at which nothing would occur--in some cases traveling hundreds of miles to do so--and would squander the time and resources of the parties and the immigration judge alike. The advantages of efficiency offered by administrative closure cannot be found in a patchwork system of continuances.7The increased use of dismissal or termination of proceedings in lieu of administrative closure, by contrast, might be beneficial to noncitizens in immigration proceedings, but it could seriously and unnecessarily inconvenience the ICE attorneys for whom administrative closure offers an equally convenient method of docket management. Whereas administrative closure pauses immigration proceedings, dismissal and termination without prejudice end those proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(c), (f). The consequences for ICE are significant: To bring an administratively closed proceeding back before the IJ or the Board, ICE must merely move to7If the Attorney General determines that the Board and IJs do not or should not have theauthority to order administrative closure, he should swiftly take whatever steps are necessary toensure that individuals in removal proceedings are eligible to apply for forms of relief currentlylimited only to those who obtain administrative closure. See, e.g., 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iii)(limiting provisional unlawful presence waiver to those who obtain administrative closure).17recalendar it, see W-Y-U-, 27 I. & N. Dec. at 20, whereas to resuscitate a terminated case ICE must file another Notice to Appear, effectively starting from scratch. See Avetisyan, 25 I. & N. Dec. at 695 ("[A]dministrative closure differs from termination of proceedings, where the Immigration Judge or the Board issues a final order, which constitutes a conclusion of the proceedings and which ... would require the DHS to file another charging document to initiate new proceedings."). Only administrative closure offers both parties--the noncitizen and ICE-- the efficiency and predictability needed to effectively administer the adjudication system. III. IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WITHDRAWS ADMINISTRATIVE CLOSURE AUTHORITY,HE SHOULD NOT RECALENDAR CLOSED CASES EN MASSE The Attorney General finally asks what consequences should follow if he determines that the Board and IJs do not or should not have the authority to order administrative closure. The Attorney General should not disturb the thousands of cases that have been administratively closed over the last three decades. Some have estimated the number of administratively closed cases at more than 350,000. A mass recalendaring of 350,000 cases would flood the immigration courts, crippling them beyond their ability to recover. By far the better course, if the Attorney General decides to withdraw the authority to administratively close cases, would be to allow ICE to move to recalendar these cases on an individual basis--as the current regime already does. See W-Y-U-, 27 I. & N. Dec. at 18 ("[E]ither party may move to recalendar [a closed case] before the Immigration Court ... or to reinstate the appeal before the Board."). That would allow ICE to prioritize those closed cases that it believes require revisiting, while permitting persons who are not enforcement priorities to retain their closed-case status. And it would allow the already-flooded immigration courts to cope with their increased workload in a more deliberate and resource-effective way.18CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Attorney General should retain administrative-closure authority and continue to encourage its use.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: PAUL R.Q.

I. LEAR SUPPORTS THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT'S RULE.In Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653 (1969), the Court held that a licensee that had repudiated its licensing agreement was free to contest the validity of the licensor's patent. In doing so, however, the Court rejected, as "inconsistent with the aims of federal patent policy," the doctrine of licensee estoppel itself. Id. at 673. But the facts of the case did not require the Court to reject the doctrine.3Accordingly, although Petitioner argues that Lear cannot be reconciled with the Federal Circuit's rule in this case, see Pet. Br. 36-38, a review of the doctrine of licensee estoppel and a careful understanding of the true holding of Lear demonstrate that Petitioner is mistaken.3At common law, the doctrine of licensee estoppel prevented a licensee from simultaneously challenging a patent's validity and practicing the invention under the protection of the license. A licensee who repudiated the licensing agreement, however, was free to defend an action for post-repudiation royalties or infringement on invalidity grounds. Thus, even in the absence of a valid termination of the licensing agreement, a licensee could set up a validity challenge.A. Lear Correctly Rejected Licensee Estoppel in the Case of a Repudiating Licensee.Lear involved a suit for royalties by licensor Adkins after licensee Lear refused to pay royalties under the terms of the parties' licensing agreement. See 395 U.S. at 659. Lear defended based, in part, on the asserted invalidity of Adkins' patent. Id. at 660. The California Supreme Court held that, "[u]nder the doctrine of licensee estoppel, Lear [is] prohibited from challenging the validity of Adkins' patent" because, although Lear had stopped paying royalties, he had not "validly terminated" the agreement pursuant to its terms. Adkins v. Lear, Inc., 67 Cal. 2d 882,3 The development of the common law doctrine of licensee estoppel, and the doctrine's relation to Lear, are reviewed in William C. Rooklidge, Licensee Validity Challenges and the Obligation to Pay Accrued Royalties: Lear v. Adkins Revisited, reprinted in ROGER M. MILGRIM, MILGRIM ON LICENSING app. 8D.4899 (1967). It was this ruling, and only this ruling, that the Court reviewed and reversed in Lear.Although the Court broadly articulated its holding, appearing to reject the doctrine of licensee estoppel in toto, what the Court necessarily rejected in Lear was only the version of the doctrine applied by the California Supreme Court on the facts of the case. Accordingly, the true holding of Lear does not foreclose application of the doctrine to markedly different facts, including those here.The doctrine that a patent licensee may not challenge the validity of the licensed patent was established in this country by the middle of the nineteenth century. See Lear, 395 U.S. at 662. In Dale Tile Manufacturing Co. v. Hyatt, 125 U.S. 46 (1888), for example, the Court held federal question jurisdiction was lacking where a licensee, who was sued for royalties under the license agreement, defended by challenging the patent. The Court explained that, in "this action to recover royalties due under the agreement, the defendant, while continuing to enjoy the privileges of the license, was estopped to deny the validity of the patent or of any reissue thereof." Id. at 54 (citing, inter alia, Kinsman v. Parkhurst, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 289 (1855)) (emphasis added).The italicized portion of the Court's holding was integral to the doctrine of licensee estoppel that the Court described. The application of the doctrine as described in Hyatt depended on the fact that the licensee continued to enjoy the privileges of the license. The doctrine would not prevent a licensee who repudiated the licensing agreement from contesting the validity of the license in a suit by the licensor for future royalties or for infringement. Lower courts elaborated but did not extend the doctrine as described by the Court.In Universal Rim Co. v. Scott, 21 F.2d 346 (D.N.D. Ohio 1922), for example, the district court considered whether, absent a provision permitting the license agree-5ment to be terminated, a licensee could contest the validity of patents covered by the agreement after renunciation and notice. Id. The court answered yes, stating that "the licensee, whenever he ascertains that the patents covered by the license agreement are invalid, may refuse to be further bound thereby, and, upon repudiation and notice, may thereafter defend against an action for royalties or an infringement suit as freely as may a stranger." Id. at 348-49.The district court's holding reflected the "weight of authority" pre-Lear ­ "that the licensee may dispute the validity of the patent under which he is licensed after he has repudiated the license." Crew v. Flanagan, 242 Minn. 549, 558 (1954) (collecting cases).4 Because the licensee in Lear4 Accord Martin v. New Trinidad Lake Asphalt Co., 255 F. 93, 94 (D.N.J. 1919) ("A licensee * * * may not set up the supposed invalidity of the patent * * * unless, prior to the period for which the royalties are sought to be recovered, he has given to the licensor a distinct, definite, and unequivocal notice to the effect that he no longer recognizes the binding force of the agreement.") (collecting cases); Mudgett v. Thomas, 55 F. 645, 649 (C.C. S.D. Ohio 1893) ("[D]efenses involving the validity of the patent will be available only for the period subsequent to the abandonment of the license by the defendants, and notice thereof to the plaintiffs."); Marston v. Swett, 82 N.Y. 526, 533 (1880) ("Where the patent is apparently valid and in force the party using it, receiving the benefit of its supposed validity, is liable for royalties agreed to be paid and cannot set up as a defense the actual invalidity of the patent. * * * If the manufacturer does not so intend, and chooses to make the patented article, not under the patent but in hostility to it, he must give notice of that intention, in order that the presumption may not attach or the patentee be misled.").6had repudiated the licensing agreement, the Court had no need to address the issue presented here.B. Lear Needlessly Rejected Licensee Estoppel in the Case of a Nonrepudiating Licensee.The Court decided Lear on the premise that, under the doctrine of licensee estoppel, a patent licensee could avoid estoppel only by terminating the agreement pursuant to its terms, and that committing a material breach, or otherwise repudiating the agreement, did not suffice. The Court therefore reasoned that, to allow licensees to avoid estoppel, it had to abolish the estoppel doctrine in toto. Lear, 395 U.S. at 663 n.10.The Court's premise, however, appears to have been mistaken. The justification for licensee estoppel at common law was that "it would be unreasonable for a licensee to have the advantage of the patent in his commercial dealings with the world at large and repudiate it in his dealings with his licensor when it comes to paying royalties. He must take a stand which is consistent for he cannot be allowed to affirm and disaffirm the patent at one and the same time." Crew v. Flanagan, 242 Minn. at 558 (emphasis added). Accord Marston v. Swett, 82 N.Y. at 533 ("The reasons for the rule are that the party has got what he bargained for; that he cannot be allowed at the same time to affirm and disaffirm the patent."). Thus, allowing a licensee to set up an invalidity defense upon repudiation of a licensing agreement would not, as the Court evidently supposed, undermine the vitality of the estoppel doctrine. See Lear, 395 U.S. at 663 n.10.Because the facts of Lear did not require the Court to reject licensee estoppel, the Court's rejection of the doctrine is not binding authority. See Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 454-55 (1972) ("broad language * * * unnecessary to the Court's decision * * * cannot be considered binding authority"); Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (67Wheat.) 264, 399-400 (1821) ("It is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is presented for decision.").1. The cases cited by Lear do not undermine licensee estoppel.The Court in Lear stated that St. Paul Plow Works v. Starling, 140 U.S. 184 (1891), undermined the common law doctrine of licensee estoppel. See Lear, 395 U.S. at 663. In St. Paul, however, the licensee had "renounce[d] its license" long before asserting the patents' invalidity. 140 U.S. at 186. For this reason, the lower court admitted invalidity evidence. Had it succeeded in proving invalidity, the licensee would have been relieved of the obligation to pay post-repudiation royalties. Thus, although inconsistent with the "strong-form" version of licensee estoppel that the Court necessarily rejected in Lear, St. Paul was consistent with the common law rule of licensee estoppel and the Federal Circuit's rule in this case.In Pope Manufacturing Co. v. Gormully, 144 U.S. 224 (1892), the Court was troubled primarily by the fact that the licensing agreement purported to bind the licensee even in the event that the licensor's patent was eventually declared invalid. However, as the Universal Rim court explained, "[a] licensee, if evicted from the use of the patents by a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declaring the patents invalid, may, after giving notice to the licensor, defend against the payment of royalties subsequently accruing." 21 F.2d at 348. Under the common law rule of licensee estoppel, such "eviction" ended the estoppel. In short, the licensing agreement's infirmities in Pope were unrelated to any legitimate application of the licensee estoppel doctrine.8Nor did Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Manufacturing Co., 326 U.S. 249 (1945), compel the Court's rejection of licensee estoppel. Although the Court found the doctrine of assignor estoppel "inconsistent with the patent laws" as applied to the facts of the case, id. at 257-58, it is unclear why licensee estoppel ­ a different doctrine developed for different reasons ­ was undermined by the limitation that the Court placed on assignor estoppel in that case. Further, the Court's concern in Scott Paper was with the patent assignee's attempt to recapture by private agreement an expired patent's monopoly. Id. at 256. Such was not the Court's concern in Lear.Finally, the antitrust cases on which Lear relied did not compel the Court's rejection of licensee estoppel as traditionally applied. The Court stated that cases such as Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., 317 U.S. 173 (1942), were "antithetic to the principles underlying [licensee] estoppel," Lear, 395 U.S. at 666; but Sola and the other cases cited by the Court dealt with the effect of the validity of patents on price-fixing clauses in licensing agreements, a question unrelated to the doctrine of licensee estoppel. Sola and similar cases recognize that such licenses become per se illegal price-fixing agreements as a matter of antitrust law if the patent is invalid. These cases are simply exceptions to the antitrust law rule that price fixing is acceptable if contained in a patent license.In sum, none of the cases that Lear relied on compelled rejection of the doctrine of licensee estoppel as traditionally applied. The antitrust exception cases were afield; Scott Paper, at most, expressed a federal policy in favor of encouraging validity challenges in a different context; and both St. Paul and Pope in fact were examples of the licensee estoppel doctrine at work.2. Lear Properly Overruled Hazeltine.In Lear, the Court stated that Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339 U.S. 8279(1950), in which it had most recently applied the doctrine of licensee estoppel, "should no longer be regarded as sound law with respect to its `estoppel' holding." 395 U.S. at 671. The Court properly overruled Hazeltine because the Court's holding in that case was inconsistent with its holding in Lear.In Hazeltine, a licensor sought royalty payments under the terms of a licensing agreement that provided for royalty payments that would be required whether or not the licensed invention was used. See 339 U.S. at 829-30. The licensee defended, arguing that, "notwithstanding the licensing agreement, [it] may contest the validity of the patents it is charged with using." Id. at 836. However, the Court rejected this argument based on "[t]he general rule * * * that the licensee under a patent license agreement may not challenge the validity of the licensed patent in a suit for royalties due under the contract." Id.The holding of Hazeltine was too broad a statement of the rule ­ broader than the holding of Lear itself. In Lear, the licensee had voluntarily relinquished its claim to the benefits of the licensing agreement before asserting the patent's invalidity. At the very least, the Court in Hazeltine applied estoppel to the licensee without regard to whether the licensee had repudiated the benefit of the license. Thus, Hazeltine was an application of the "strong form" licensee estoppel rejected in Lear.C. Lear Should Be Limited To Similar Facts.Lear was correctly decided because the "strong form" version of licensee estoppel endorsed by the California Supreme Court was inequitable and did not serve the purposes of the doctrine as traditionally understood. In support of its holding in Lear, the Court relied on federal policy in favor of encouraging patent validity challenges. See 395 U.S. at 670. The "strong form" version of licensee estoppel rejected in Lear indeed disserved this policy. Under that version of the doctrine, a licensee who became10convinced of the patent's invalidity would nevertheless ­ absent a valid termination ­ be unable to challenge the patent, even if he chose to repudiate the contract. Thus, the licensee could never, after signing the license and notwithstanding changed circumstances, opt out of the license and return to the position of a stranger to the patent. The Court correctly concluded that a rule, in effect requiring that licensees prospectively and irrevocably sign away their rights to challenge the validity of a licensed patent, is bad patent policy. Lear leveled the playing field by allowing a licensee who repudiates based on its belief that the patent is invalid (and thus that the license is unnecessary and improper) to assert the patent's invalidity as a defense in an action by the licensor.The traditional doctrine of licensee estoppel, as opposed to the "strong form" version at issue in Lear, was equitable and well-supported. Traditional licensee estoppel imposes no irrevocable waiver of licensee challenges. Instead, the traditional doctrine simply requires licensees to choose between enjoying the benefits of the license and asserting the invalidity of the licensed patent. Under the doctrine, a licensee may choose either but not both, as the Federal Circuit properly refused to permit Petitioner to do here. Under the Federal Circuit's rule, the playing field remains level: a licensee may assert the invalidity of the licensor's patent, but only after forgoing the benefits that the patent license provides.To be sure, encouraging patent invalidity challenges is a goal of federal patent law. But it is neither the only goal nor the overarching goal. "The stated objective of the Constitution in granting the power to Congress to legislate in the area of intellectual property is to `promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.'" Kewanee Oil v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 480 (1974). Thus, for example, it is federal patent policy to reward inventors and to foster invention, including by encouraging the disclosure of inventions. See id. at 480-81; see also Dawson Chem. Co. v.11Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U.S. 176, 221 (1980) (discussing "the policy of stimulating invention that underlies the patent system"). As the Federal Circuit has explained, allowing licensees in good standing to challenge the patents under license "yields undesirable results" because it "discourages patentees from granting licenses." GenProbe, Inc. v. Vysis, 359 F.3d 1376, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Such a rule would skew federal patent policy away from its overarching goal of encouraging invention and innovation.The policy of encouraging invalidity challenges does not require that non-repudiating licensees be allowed to challenge the validity of licensed patents. Other avenues for challenging patent validity are available. First, the patent might be challenged by a non-licensee. Second, Congress in 1981 created a mechanism that allows individuals to request that the Patent and Trademark Office reexamine a patent based on prior art. See 35 U.S.C. §§ 302, 311(b). Thus, it is now substantially easier and less expensive to challenge the validity of a patent than it was when Lear was decided. Compared with the competing goal of encouraging innovation, the policy in favor of encouraging validity challenges is less in need of protection now than it was when Lear was decided.The Court stated in Lear that its task was to "balance the claims of promisor and promisee in accordance with the requirements of good faith." See Lear, 395 U.S. at 670. Applying Lear so broadly as to permit licensee challenges without repudiation would not balance the interests of licensees and licensors in accordance with the requirements of good faith. Doing so would permit licensees in effect to inoculate themselves against infringement actions, and then, having limited their downside risk, immediately to seek to avoid their obligations under the parties' agreement altogether. "In other words, in this situation, the licensor would bear all the risk, while the licensee would benefit from the license's effective cap on12damages or royalties in the event its challenge to the patent's scope or validity fails." Gen-Probe, 359 F.3d at 1382.Equitable and policy considerations thus support recognition of the continued validity of "traditional" licensee estoppel as a matter of federal patent law ­ and reading Lear as limited to its core holding.5 That is just what the Federal Circuit did in stating that a licensee "cannot invoke the protection of the Lear doctrine until it (i) actually ceases payment of royalties, and (ii) provides notice to the licensor that the reason for ceasing payment of royalties is because it has deemed the relevant claims to be invalid." Studiengesellschaft Kohle, m.b.H. v. Shell Oil Co., 112 F.3d 1561, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1997).65 The negative incentive effects of Lear's holding are substantial, and counsel strongly in favor of limiting it to similar facts. See John W. Schlicher, Judicial Regulation of Patent Licensing, Litigation and Settlement Under Judicial Policies Created in Lear v. Adkins, AM. INTELL. PROP. L. ASS'N, SELECTED LEGAL PAPERS, Vol. III, No. 1 (June 1985). As this paper shows, Lear's rule ­ especially in its strong form ­ is economically inefficient, decreasing the output of licensees and increasing the deadweight loss of monopoly. While the rule increases patent invalidity challenges, the economic benefits therefrom are more than outweighed by the increased costs of the rule, including costs associated with (1) increased litigation, (2) decreased licensee productivity, (3) decreased rate of inventing, and (4) inefficient exploitation of inventions. Id. at 8-13. 6 Other circuits have reached similar conclusions. See Rite-Nail Packaging Corp. v. Berryfast, Inc., 706 F.2d 933, 936-37 (9th Cir. 1983); Hull v. Brunswick Corp., 704 F.2d 1195, 1203 (10th Cir. 1983); Am. Sterilizer Co. v. Sybron Corp., 614 F.2d 890, 897-98 (3d Cir. 1980); PPG Indus.,(continued...)13II. THIS CASE DOES NOT PRESENT A SUITABLE "CASE OR CONTROVERSY."Lear did not address the question of jurisdiction under Article III or the Declaratory Judgment Act. As the Federal Circuit noted, "[i]n Lear, the licensee stopped paying royalties and the patentee sued for royalties; there was clearly a justiciable controversy, and that aspect was not an issue in Lear." Pet. App. 5. The Federal Circuit's conclusion that this case does not present an actual case or controversy is consistent with Lear.In Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227 (1937), the Court first articulated the standards for a declaratory judgment action. The Court explained:The Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, in its limitation to "cases of actual controversy," manifestly has regard to the constitutional provision and is operative only in respect to controversies which are such in the constitutional sense. The word "actual" is one of emphasis rather than of definition. Thus the operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is procedural only. In providing remedies and defining procedure in relation to cases and controversies in the constitutional sense the Congress is acting within its delegated power over the jurisdiction of the federal courts which the Congress is authorized to establish.Id. at 239-40. "The Declaratory Judgment Act allowed relief to be given by way of recognizing the plaintiff's right even though no immediate enforcement of it was asked."Inc. v. Westwood Chems., Inc., 530 F.2d 700, 706, 708 (6th Cir. 1976).14Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671-72 (1950).Petitioner seeks vindication of a substantive right that, absent its repudiation of the license agreement, it does not actually have. If Lear stands only for the proposition that a repudiating licensee may assert invalidity as a defense to an infringement action or a suit to recover royalties, and a non-repudiating licensee such as Petitioner has no such right, then Petitioner's "claim" is "foreclosed under the applicable substantive law," Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 282-90 (1995) (citation omitted), and Petitioner may not assert invalidity. To allow licensees to assert offensively in a declaratory judgment action that which they could not assert defensively in an action for royalties would impermissibly expand licensees' substantive rights. This would directly violate the Court's statement that the operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is "procedural only." Aetna, 300 U.S. at 240.Contrary to Petitioner's claim, the Court did not previously "decide[ ] the same jurisdictional issue before this Court today," Pet. Br. 16, in Altvater v. Freeman, 319 U.S. 359 (1943). Altvater did not concern the right of a nonrepudiating licensee to assert invalidity claims. In Altvater, the Court held that a licensee could assert a counterclaim seeking a declaration relating to the validity of certain reissue patents. See 319 U.S. at 365-66. However, the reason the Court allowed the counterclaim was that the licensee was only paying the royalties "under compulsion of an injunction" from a prior case. Id. at 365. Indeed, the Court noted that the lower courts had found "that the license agreement was terminated on the surrender of the original patent and was not renewed and extended to cover the reissue patents." Id. at 364 (emphasis added). Therefore, it is clear that the licensee's obligation to continue paying royalties did not stem from the licensing agreement but from the injunction. As the Court made15clear, "[a] controversy was raging, even apart from the continued existence of the license agreement." Id. Thus, the Court's decision in Altvater did not touch on the question presented in this case; a question which the Altvater Court explicitly "put to one side" and declined to answer. See id.Petitioner is invoking the Declaratory Judgment Act not to obtain an interpretation of the license agreement's terms, but to obtain advice about its potential legal exposure if it should repudiate the agreement and yet continue to practice the invention. That, however, is exactly the sort of question that private parties face all the time and for which they seek the advice of counsel. As the Eleventh Circuit has explained:Persons occupying positions of responsibility * * * often must make difficult decisions that can have adverse consequences for others. * * * Needless to say, the decisionmakers would benefit greatly by having guidance as to the potential legal ramifications of their decisions. Furnishing such guidance prior to the making of the decision, however, is the role of counsel, not of the courts.Hendrix v. Poonai, 662 F.2d 719, 722 (11th Cir. 1981). For this reason, even if this case were thought to satisfy Article III, as implemented by the Declaratory Judgment Act, it would not be suitable for adjudication.Harris Trust and Savings Bank v. E-II Holdings, Inc., 926 F.2d 636 (7th Cir. 1991), is instructive. In that case, the trustee plaintiffs sought a declaration as to whether the appellee, a party to the indenture agreement at issue, was in default of that agreement. However, the district court held that it lacked Article III jurisdiction because the trustees "declined to declare an event of default under the terms of the Indentures," as they were free to do, and instead asked the court to determine whether a default had occurred. 722 F. Supp. 429, 441 (N.D. Ill. 1989). The16district court held that, because the trustees, "in effect, at all times ha[d] the power to create a controversy, but they ha[d] not yet done so," no actual controversy existed. Id.The equities in favor of finding an actual controversy in Harris Trust arguably were substantial. As the Seventh Circuit explained, the decision whether to declare an event of default, if incorrect, likely would have exposed the trustees to suit. See Harris Trust, 926 F.2d at 638. Nevertheless, the court held that unless and until the trustees declared an event of default, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the question. See id. at 640 ("the Trustees have declined to express an opinion on the merits[;] * * * that failure evidences the lack of a case or controversy").Petitioner has the power to create an actual controversy but has not done so. In the same way that the trustees' failure to declare an event of default under the parties' agreement prevented the court from exercising its jurisdiction, the Petitioner's failure to repudiate its license prevents the federal courts from hearing this case. Of course, if Petitioner is wrong and Respondents' patent is valid, Petitioner would then be subject to an infringement suit (or a suit for royalties), but in this respect Petitioner is in the same position as the trustees in Harris Trust, who similarly would have faced substantial litigation exposure if they made the wrong choice. The mere fact that a party faces a difficult business decision does not confer jurisdiction on the federal courts. See, e.g., Crowley Co. v. United States, 849 F.2d 273, 276 (7th Cir. 1988) ("You cannot go to a federal court for advice on the legality of a proposed course of action.").17III. THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT'S RULE FURTHERS THE AIMS OF THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT AND PATENT POLICY.From the earliest days of the Declaratory Judgment Act, the Court has consistently affirmed that federal courts are "under no compulsion to exercise th[eir] jurisdiction" in declaratory judgment actions. Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., 316 U.S. 491, 494 (1942). Rather, through the Declaratory Judgment Act,Congress sought to place a remedial arrow in the district court's quiver; it created an opportunity, rather than a duty, to grant a new form of relief to qualifying litigants. Consistent with the nonobligatory nature of the remedy, a district court is authorized, in the sound exercise of its discretion, to stay or to dismiss an action seeking a declaratory judgment before trial or after all arguments have drawn to a close. * * * In the declaratory judgment context, the normal principle that federal courts should adjudicate claims within their jurisdiction yields to considerations of practicality and wise judicial administration.Wilton, 515 U.S. at 288 (footnote omitted).In the words of the Federal Circuit, the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act is toenable a person who is reasonably at legal risk because of an unresolved dispute, to obtain judicial resolution of that dispute without having to await the commencement of legal action by the other side. It accommodates the practical situation wherein the interests of one side to the dispute may be served by delay in taking legal action.BP Chems. Ltd. v. Union Carbide Corp., 4 F.3d 975, 977 (Fed. Cir. 1993).18By entering into licensing agreements, licensors give up a number of important rights, including the right to exclude the licensee from using the claimed invention and, in the case of use, to sue for treble damages, among other things. If the licensee is nevertheless allowed to seek to invalidate the patent, then the licensee has effectively given up nothing. Under this regime, "the licensor would bear all the risk, while licensee would benefit from the license's effective cap on damages or royalties in the event its challenge to the patent's scope or validity fails." Gen-Probe, 359 F.3d at 1382. Therefore, to allow the licensee to sue the licensor, even while retaining the protection of the license, would undermine rather than serve the principle of equality that underlies the Declaratory Judgment Act."The factors relevant to wise administration here are equitable in nature." Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183 (1952). Those factors here militate in favor of declining jurisdiction even if Article III and the Act permit a federal court to exercise jurisdiction. See, e.g., Wilton, 515 U.S. at 288; Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 762-63 (1987); Pub. Affairs Assocs., Inc. v. Rickover, 369 U.S. 111, 112 (1962); Brillhart, 316 U.S. at 494 (Frankfurter, J.); Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 300 (1943) (Stone, C.J.). Accordingly, the Court could affirm the Federal Circuit's judgment on equitable and prudential grounds and leave the Article III question to the future. See Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 11-18 (2004) (reversing for lack of prudential standing and avoiding Article III issue on which review had been granted); see generally J. E. Riley Inv. Co. v. Comm'r, 311 U.S. 55, 59 (1940) ("Where the decision below is correct it must be affirmed by the appellate court though the lower tribunal gave a wrong reason for its action."); Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984) ("this Court reviews judgments, not opinions").19CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:RICHARD L. RAINEY DAVID H. REMES CHRISTIAN J. PISTILLIMICHAEL S. GRECO Counsel of Record President, American Bar Association 321 North Clark Street Chicago, IL 60610 (312) 988-5000JULY 26, 2006
I. The federal policies underlying the court-made federal procedural default rules do not support denial of a federal forum for enforcement of international treaty obligations in light of the federal government's plenary power over foreign relations, and the minimal risk to state criminal processes.The procedural default doctrine is a jurisprudential rule crafted by the federal courts to protect the integrity of state court proceedings.7 It was fashioned to promote three principally domestic goals. First, the procedural default doctrine promotes federal-state comity by precluding federal courts from hearing federal habeas claims that were not previously raised in accordance with state procedural rules, absent a showing of cause and prejudice. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90-91 (1977); Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 11 (1984) (explaining that considerations of comity and concerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice motivate the procedural default doctrine); Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 730-32 (1991) (explaining that "concerns of comity and federalism" underlie procedural default rules). Second, the procedural default doctrine prevents gamesmanship or "sandbagging" by defendants and/or defense lawyers, who might otherwise "take their chances on a verdict of not guilty in a state trial court with the intent to raise their [federal] claims in a federal habeas court if their initial gamble does not pay off." Sykes, 433 U.S. at 89. Third, like other limits on the ability of federal courts to grant habeas relief, the7. See Dretke v. Haley, 541 U.S. 386, __, 124 S. Ct. 1847, 1853 (2004) (referring to the exceptions to the procedural default doctrine as "judge-made rules"); Patrick E. Higginbotham, Reflections on Reform of § 2254 Habeas Petitions, 18 Hofstra L. Rev. 1005, 1014 (1990) ("[R]espect for state procedural default rules is a judge-made doctrine, not directly drawn from any express statutory provision.").11doctrine reduces the burdens habeas cases place on the federal courts. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 487-88 (1986) (refining the procedural default doctrine with the explicit goal of minimizing the burden on federal habeas courts); cf. Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 491 n.31 (1976) (explaining the decision to eliminate Fourth Amendment claims from the scope of federal habeas review by stating that "resort to habeas corpus . . . results in serious intrusions on values important to our system of government" including "the most effective utilization of limited judicial resources"). Because these policies must give way to Congress' decision that U.S. courts must enforce Vienna Convention obligations as interpreted by the ICJ, and because the traditional policies supporting the procedural default doctrine are diminished when they implicate duties owed by the United States to foreign nations under the Convention, this Court should give effect to the ICJ's Avena Judgment, and enforce its interpretation of U.S. treaty obligations.A. In cases implicating the United States' treaty obligations under the Vienna Convention, the balance of federal and state interests tips more heavily toward federal interests than when only internal state procedural rules and domestic law are at stake.1. The power to conduct international affairs and the authority to enter treaties are granted exclusively to the federal government by the Constitution, and, under the Supremacy Clause, treaties plainly preempt contrary state laws.In the arena of international relations, federal interests are at their height, and they are exclusive of state interests. See, e.g., American Ins. Ass'n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396,12413 (2003) ("concern for uniformity in this country's dealings with foreign nations . . . animated the Constitution's allocation of the foreign relations power to the National Government") (internal quotation marks omitted). The Constitution entrusts the federal government with "full and exclusive responsibility for the conduct of affairs with foreign sovereignties." Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 63 (1941). As this Court has emphasized, "[o]ur system of government is such that the interest of the cities, counties and states, no less than the interest of the people of the whole nation, imperatively requires that federal power in the field affecting foreign relations be left entirely free from local interference." Id.; see also Board of Trustees of University of Illinois v. United States, 289 U.S. 48, 59 (1933) ("In international relations and with respect to foreign intercourse and trade the people of the United States act through a single government with unified and adequate national power."); The Federalist No. 80, at 500 (Alexander Hamilton) (Benjamin Fletcher Wright ed., 1961) ("[T]he peace of the whole ought not to be left at the disposal of a part"). Applying the procedural default doctrine to avoid enforcement of the United States' Vienna Convention obligations would allow state and local procedural rules to impair foreign relations.It is precisely because of the importance of ensuring that the entire country speak with one voice in international relations and that the United States be able to fulfill its international obligations that the Constitution explicitly makes treaties "the supreme Law of the Land," overriding "any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary."8 U.S. CONST . art. VI, cl. 2. "It is the declared duty"8. The United States signed the Vienna Convention and its Optional Protocol on April 24, 1963, and the Senate unanimously ratified both instruments on October 22, 1969. See 115 CONG. REC. 30,997 (Oct. 22, 1969). Accordingly, the Vienna Convention indisputably has the force of a treaty under the Constitution.13of both state and federal judges, under the Supremacy Clause, "to determine any Constitution, or laws of any State, contrary to [a] treaty . . . made under the authority of the United States, null and void." Ware v. Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199, 237 (1796); see also Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U.S. 483, 489 (1880) ("It is the declared will of the people of the United States that every treaty made by the authority of the United States shall be superior to the Constitution and laws of any individual State."). The transcripts of the Senate hearings on ratification of the Vienna Convention make clear that the Senate understood that the Convention would preempt any conflicting state laws. S. EXEC. REP. NO. 91-9, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 2 & 5 (appendix) at 18 (statement by Deputy Legal Adviser J. Edward Lyerly) (1969) ("[T]o the extent that there are conflicts in . . . state laws[,] the Vienna Convention, after ratification, would govern."); William J. Aceves, The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations: A Study of Rights, Wrongs, and Remedies, 31 VAND. J. TRANSNAT'L L. 257, 26768 (1998).There is no doubt that Texas's procedural rules, if enforced through the application of the federal procedural default doctrine to Mr. Medellin's federal habeas petition, would conflict with the Vienna Convention. The United States agreed to be bound by the ICJ's interpretations of the Vienna Convention when it signed and ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention. See Optional Protocol, art. I (providing that disputes "arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice."). In its Avena Judgment, the ICJ held that application of the procedural default rules to preclude review of Vienna Convention violations prevents "`full effect [from being] given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this article are intended,' and thus violate[s] paragraph 2 of Article 36." Avena, ¶ 113. The Vienna Convention, as14authoritatively interpreted, therefore prohibits state procedural rules from blocking review of Vienna Convention claims brought by foreign nationals such as Mr. Medellin. It would violate both the Supremacy Clause and the intent of the Senate that ratified the Vienna Convention and the Optional Protocol to allow state procedural rules to do so.2. Unlike federal constitutional rights that may be procedurally defaulted, here the right belongs not only to the defendant but also to the defendant's home country, thereby affecting international relations and heightening the federal interests at stake.When a state arrests or prosecutes a citizen of a country that is a signatory to the Vienna Convention and fails to comply with the Convention's requirements, that failure violates not only the defendant's rights, but also the rights of the defendant's home country. See, e.g., LaGrand Case (Germany v. U.S.), 2001 I.C.J. 104 (June 27) ("LaGrand") ¶ 74 ("[W]hen the sending State is unaware of the detention of its nationals due to the failure of the receiving State to provide the requisite consular notification without delay, . . . the sending State has been prevented for all practical purposes from exercising its rights under Article 36."); Avena, ¶ 102 (describing the United States as precluding Mexico "from exercising its right" under one provision of the Convention). Those rights include the rights "to visit a national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation." Vienna Convention, art. 36 ¶ 1(c).When a state fails to honor a treaty-partner's Vienna Convention rights, the federal government must deal with the consequences. The resulting tensions in international15relations can be substantial. See, e.g., Brian Knowlton, Execution Pits Mexico Against U.S. ­ Fox Echoes World On Death Penalty, INT 'L HERALD TRIB., Aug. 16, 2002, at 1 (reporting that Mexican President Vicente Fox canceled a trip to visit President George W. Bush's Texas ranch to protest Texas's execution of a Mexican national who had not been told of his Vienna Convention rights). As this very case demonstrates, state officials' violations of the Vienna Convention may cause the United States to be brought before the ICJ and ultimately to receive a judgment against it. See Avena; see also LaGrand.The impact on international relations distinguishes Vienna Convention rights from other federal rights that have been subjected to procedural default rules. Generally, if an American defendant violates a state procedural rule in attempting to assert an individual federal right, only that individual's rights are affected. In such situations, this Court has determined that federal-state comity generally requires that any claim to that right be considered procedurally defaulted. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90-91 (1977). The balance of federal and state interests tips much more heavily toward federal interests, however, when the right at issue belongs not just to the defendant, but also to his home country. It would violate the federal government's constitutionally protected interest in international relations to apply that doctrine to hold that the right of a sovereign treaty-partner ­ which was never informed of the arrest and detention of one of its citizens ­ may be waived by the procedural mistakes of an individual attorney.16B. Sandbagging is not a concern in this context because when a defendant fails to raise the claim that his Vienna Convention rights have been violated, it is usually due to ignorance, not strategy.Article 36 of the Vienna Convention requires United States authorities to tell an arrested foreign national, "without delay," that he may have his nation's consul informed of the arrest. ¶ 1(b).9 When such information is not provided, it is very likely that the arrested individual will be unaware of the right to consular notification. His lawyer is also highly likely to be unaware of that right because most lawyers have received no training in international law. See Claudio Grossman, Building the World Community: Challenges to Legal Education and the WCL Experience, 17 Am. U. INT 'L L. REV. 815, 825 (2002) (reporting that "the contemporary law student is only slightly more likely to take an international law course than her counterpart in 1912" and that as of 2002, there were "still no questions on any bar exam concerning international law, no mandatory international law courses, and generally no first-year exposure to the study of international law."); John A. Barrett, Jr., International Legal Education in U.S. Law Schools: Plenty of Offerings, But Too Few Students, 31 INT'L LAW . 845, 854 (1997) ("[A]t most law schools across the United States, fewer than 20 percent of graduates ever take a course in international law."). Nor has the federal government created any mechanism for9. The ICJ found that the detaining authorities' duty to provide information to an individual about consular rights "arises once it is realized that the person is a foreign national, or once there are grounds to think that the person is probably a foreign national." Avena, ¶ 63. The court suggested that because law enforcement authorities do not always know whether someone is a foreign national, every arrested individual could be told, along with the Miranda warnings, that "should he be a foreign national, he is entitled to ask for his consular post to be contacted." Id. ¶ 64.17notifying defendants and their lawyers of consular rights under the Vienna Convention. Simply put, defendants and their attorneys cannot make strategic decisions to leave out arguments about which they are utterly unaware. Cf. Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 385 (1986) (explaining that counsel's failure to file a timely suppression motion could not have been based on "strategic considerations" because counsel was unaware of the potential basis for the motion after failing to conduct any pretrial discovery).The fact that there is no federally-imposed system in place for informing defendants or their attorneys of consular rights under the Vienna Convention further distinguishes those rights from the other federal rights that may be procedurally defaulted. For example, the right to receive Miranda warnings, which is subject to the procedural default doctrine,10 also involves the defendant's right to be informed of other rights. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966). But since this Court's decision in Miranda, the Miranda warnings have "become embedded in routine police practice to the point where [they] have become part of our national culture." Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 443 (2000). No such national practice has developed to inform arrested individuals of their Vienna Convention rights. The federal government has made efforts to encourage state and local law enforcement officials to comply with the Vienna Convention, but has not completed the task.11 The lack of a10. See Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 806 (1991) (applying the procedural default doctrine to bar a Miranda claim on federal habeas).11. In January, 1998, the S tate Department published a booklet entitled "Consular Notification and Access: Instructions for Federal, State and Local Law Enforcement and Other Officials Regarding(Cont'd)18national practice compounds the problems associated with not informing an individual defendant directly of those rights, because the defendant is unlikely to have heard of the rights from others who have been arrested or from television or movies.1 2(Cont'd) Foreign Nationals in the United States and the Rights of Consular Officials to Assist Them" and a reference card designed to be carried by individual arresting officers. See LaGrand, ¶ 121. By June, 2001, 60,000 copies of the booklet and 400,000 copies of the pocket card had been distributed to federal, state and local law enforcement and judicial officials. Id. The State Department has reported that by December, 2003, these members had grown to 100,000 and 600,000, respectively. See Adam Liptak, Mexico Awaits Hague Ruling on Citizens on Death Row, N.Y. T IMES, Jan. 16, 2004, at A1. The State Department does not deny, however, that Vienna Convention violations continue. See id. Apparently, the fact that the federal government has informed state authorities about the Vienna Convention does not mean that state authorities will pass that information on to defendants and their attorneys. Indeed, as this case demonstrates, unless federal courts enforce Vienna Convention rights on habeas, states will be able to violate the Vienna Convention with impunity.12. It is clear that Mr. Medellin's failure to raise his Vienna Convention claim was not the result of a strategic decision. At the time of Mr. Medellin's trial in 1994, Wainwright v. Sykes had already been decided, and no federal court had held that an exception to the procedural default rules should be made for habeas claims under the Vienna Convention or any other treaty. Indeed, reflecting the state of the law prior to the ICJ's decision in Avena, this Court found in Breard v. Greene that Vienna Convention rights could be procedurally defaulted. 523 U.S. 371, 375-76 (1998). Given the state of the law at the time of Mr. Medellin's trial, he should have expected that if he failed to raise a claim regarding his Vienna Convention rights, he would waive the claim both for the purposes of his state court proceedings and for any future federal habeas proceedings. There is therefore no reason to believe that Mr. Medellin was engaging in gamesmanship or was making any other strategic choice when he failed to raise a claim regarding the violation of his Vienna Convention rights at trial.19C. Giving effect to the Avena decision would not create a significant burden for federal courts.Giving effect to the Avena decision would not open the floodgates to habeas claimants. Going forward, if the federal courts enforced Vienna Convention rights on habeas more frequently, states would presumably implement procedures to honor those rights in the first place, thereby eliminating most future Vienna Convention habeas claims. State courts faced with Vienna Convention claims also would be less likely to treat those claims as procedurally barred. This would further reduce the need for federal courts to evaluate the claims in the first instance, without the benefit of state court consideration. Cf. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 89-90 (1977) (explaining that if state appellate courts know that federal issues "raised for the first time in the proceeding before them may well be decided in any event by a federal habeas tribunal[,]" they will have to choose "between addressing the issue notwithstanding the petitioner's failure to timely object, [and] fac[ing] the prospect that the federal habeas court will decide the question without the benefit of their views.") Thus, any impact on federal courts' workload created by giving effect to the Avena decision would diminish rapidly over time.II. The reasoning in Breard v. Greene does not control the instant case in light of the subsequent authoritative interpretation of the Vienna Convention by the ICJ.This Court's per curiam opinion in Breard v. Greene, 523 U.S. 371 (1998), does not control this case and is readily reconciled with Amicus' views. In Breard , Court gave two reasons why Petitioner Breard's Vienna Convention claim could be procedurally defaulted, neither of which applies here. First, the Court expressed the view that, at that time,20the procedural default doctrine did not appear to be inconsistent with the Vienna Convention. Id. The Court explained that it would have "give[n] respectful consideration to the interpretation of an international treaty rendered by an international court with jurisdiction to interpret such" if there were such an interpretation. Id. But "absent a clear and express statement to the contrary, the procedural rules of the forum State govern the implementation of the treaty in that State." Id. The ICJ has now provided precisely such "a clear and express statement to the contrary." See Avena, ¶ 113. This subsequent authoritative interpretation of the Convention by the ICJ eliminates the primary rationale upon which the Breard decision was based.Second, this Court observed in Breard that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ("AEDPA") was enacted long after the Vienna Convention became effective in the United States. This Court noted that if a statute enacted after a treaty is inconsistent with the treaty, "the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null." Breard, 523 U.S. at 376 (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court then pointed to the provision of AEDPA providing that an evidentiary hearing is generally unavailable on federal habeas if the petitioner "has failed to develop the factual basis of [the] claim in State court proceedings." Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2)). Unlike the petitioner in Breard , however, Mr. Medellin raised his Vienna Convention claim in his state post-conviction proceedings. He also filed a supporting affidavit and requested an evidentiary hearing, which was denied.13 See Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 21, Medellin v. Dretke (No. 04-5928). Thus, under Michael13. The State concedes that Mr. Medellin was not notified of his right to contact the Mexican consul. Medellin v. Dretke, 371 F.3d 270, 279 (5th Cir. 2004). Indeed, the state habeas court commented on the merits of Mr. Medellin's Vienna Convention claim. See Brief in Opposition at 14, Medellin v. Dretke(No. 04-5928).21Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420 (2000), AEDPA's limitations on evidentiary hearings do not apply in this case.In Michael Williams, this Court held that only habeas petitioners who have "failed to develop the factual basis of a claim," must comply with 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2)'s requirements for an evidentiary hearing. 529 U.S. at 430. The Court further held that such a failure requires "a lack of diligence." Id. This Court emphasized that diligence "depends upon whether the prisoner made a reasonable attempt .. . [to] pursue claims in state court," id. at 435, and suggested that "seek[ing] an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law" would be sufficient "in the usual case." Id. at 437.14 Because AEDPA's limitations on evidentiary hearings do not apply in this case, they cannot bar application of the Vienna Convention.The fact that the ICJ has now issued the Avena Judgment also changes the policy considerations that necessarily bear on the question of whether some Vienna Convention claims should be exempt from the procedural default doctrine. The procedural default doctrine consists of judge-made rules designed to achieve certain goals, the foremost of which is the balancing of federal and state interests. The foreign relations stakes, and thus the federal interest in the relationship between the Vienna Convention and the procedural default doctrine, are dramatically higher now that the ICJ has issued the Avena Judgment than they were at the time Breard was considered. Ruling against Mr. Medellin would now require the Court to deny the enforceability of an ICJ order in favor of the very same individual. It would also require the Court to reject the ICJ's authoritative14. See also Mason v. Mitchell, 320 F.3d 604, 621 n.6 (6th Cir. 2003) (finding that the petitioner's request for an evidentiary hearing in state court was sufficient to demonstrate diligence for purposes of avoiding application of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2)).22interpretation of the Vienna Convention, by which the United States government agreed to be bound. The implications of such a decision both for domestic separation of powers and for international relations are entirely different now than they were at the time Breard was before the Court.III. To promote the international rule of law and to preserve the United States' ability to protect its citizens overseas, the United States courts should give effect to the LaGrand and Avena Judgments.The treatment of foreign nationals by domestic law enforcement may have critical international and foreign policy implications. "Experience has shown that international controversies of the gravest moment, sometimes even leading to war, may arise from real or imagined wrongs to another's subjects inflicted, or permitted, by a government." Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 64 (1941). It is to prevent such real or imagined wrongs from leading to international conflict that the United States has entered treaties and agreed to participate in peaceful international dispute resolution mechanisms such as the ICJ. It would dangerously undermine these actions and the international rule of law for the United States to violate its obligations under the Vienna Convention and Optional Protocol by failing to give effect to the LaGrand and Avena Judgments.A. If the United States does not respect foreign nationals' Vienna Convention rights, United States citizens abroad will likely not receive the Convention's protections.As this Court has observed: "One of the most important and delicate of all international relationships, recognized immemorially as a responsibility of government, has to do with the protection of the just rights of a country's own nationals when those nationals are in another country."23Hines, 312 U.S. at 64. The Vienna Convention is designed to enable countries to help their own nationals when those nationals are abroad, in part by agreeing to allow other countries to take similar steps where their citizens are concerned. If the United States ignores its obligations under the Vienna Convention, it risks losing its ability to insist that other countries abide by their obligations to respect the consular rights of American citizens on their soil.The United States has consistently used the Vienna Convention and the ICJ to protect its own citizens overseas. In fact, the United States was the first country to invoke the Optional Protocol, which it used to bring an application against Iran concerning U.S. diplomatic and consular personnel who were held hostage in 1979. United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (U.S. v. Iran), 1979 I.C.J. 7 (Dec. 15), 1980 I.C.J. 3 (May 24). In bringing that application, the United States relied on the Optional Protocol's establishment of the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Vienna Convention. When the ICJ ruled in favor of the United States provisionally in 1979 and then finally in 1980, 1979 I.C.J. 7, 1980 I.C.J. 3, the United States insisted that Iran was bound to comply with the court's judgment.The United States also routinely demands that it receive notice when its citizens are detained by foreign authorities. The State Department in fact requires consular officials to lodge a protest if detaining authorities do not notify the consul within 72 hours. 7 Foreign Affairs Manual § 426.2-1 (2004), available at http://foia.state.gov/ masterdocs/07fam/07m0420.pdf. The United States cannot expect other countries to respect its citizens' consular rights, however, if the United States does not honor the reciprocal rights of those countries and their citizens in the face of state procedural impediments.24The fact that American courts' handling of Vienna Convention claims could affect the United States' ability to protect its citizens overseas is yet another factor distinguishing Vienna Convention rights from other rights subject to procedural default rules. If an American defendant is held to have procedurally defaulted a claim that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was denied, only that defendant is affected. But if the United States violates foreign nationals' consular notification rights, and American courts compound that violation by refusing to hear the foreign national defendants' Vienna Convention claims, it could seriously prejudice how American citizens are treated when they are arrested overseas. This would be particularly true if the courts did so after the ICJ issued a binding decision to the contrary.B. If United States courts now denied that they were bound by the ICJ's Avena Judgment, it would frustrate the United States' adoption of the Vienna Convention and Optional Protocol.If United States courts were now to refuse to give effect to the ICJ's Avena decision, it would make the President's signing and the Senate's ratification of the Optional Protocol hollow. Article I of the Optional Protocol states that "[d]isputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice." Optional Protocol, art. I. Under the plain and unambiguous language of the Article, countries signing the Optional Protocol agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the ICJ in cases involving disputes over the interpretation or application of the Convention. Submitting to the ICJ's jurisdiction necessarily entails agreeing to be bound by its judgments. See United Nations Charter, art. 94 ("Each Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice in any case to which it is a party"). A decision25by this Court refusing to give effect to the ICJ's AvenaJudgment would entirely undermine the President's and Senate's actions signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol.It would infringe upon the treaty powers granted to thePresident and the Senate by the Constitution, and it would make the United States' treaty promises unreliable in the eyesof the rest of the world.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above, and consistent with its commitment to promoting the rule of law, the ABArespectively submits that the Court should reverse thedecision of the Fifth Circuit.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:Jeffrey L.

 The ABA submits that, where an indigentdefendant faces incarceration for contempt of court,the potential deprivation of the defendant's liberty interest warrants the appointment of counsel-- regardless of whether the proceeding is labeled "civil" or "criminal'--to ensure the fair and efficient administration of justice. I. A Defendant Facing Incarceration forContempt Should Be Provided Counsel Regardless of Whether the Proceeding Is Labeled "Civil" or "Criminal." In the ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE: PROVIDING DEFENSE SERVICES (3d ed. 1992), the ABA noted that "the line between criminal and civil proceedings which give rise to a constitutional right to counsel has become increasingly blurred. Thus, protected liberty interests have extended due process concepts to justify the provision of counsel for indigent litigants in such `quasi-criminal' matters as contempt for failure to make child support payments ...." Commentary to Standard 5-5.2, at 65. The ABA called for counsel in all proceedings for offenses punishable by incarceration, "regardless of their denomination as felonies, misdemeanors, or otherwise." Standard 5-5.1. In support, the ABA noted a civil contempt case involving noncompliance with a child support order. Commentary to Standard75-5.1, at 62 n.7 (citing Ridgway v. Baker, 720 F.2d 1409 (5th Cir. 1983)). Like the ABA, the Ridgway court recognized that "the line between civil and criminal contempt is rarely as clear as the state would have us believe." Ridgway, 720 F.2d at 1414. Rejecting the state's argument that a defendant at a civil contempt proceeding holds "the keys of his prison in his own pocket," the court stated that this old saying ignores two salient facts: "that the keys are available only to one who has enough money to pay the delinquent child support and _ that, meanwhile, the defendant, whatever the label on his cell, is confined." Jd. at 1413-14.The Ridgway court also observed that an error in a contempt finding is more likely to occur if the defendant is denied counsel. Jd. at 1414; see also Elizabeth G. Patterson, Civil Contempt and the Indigent Child Support Obligor: The Silent Return of Debtor's Prison, 18 Cornell J.L. & Pub. Pol'y 95, 122 (2008); Robert Monk, The Indigent Defendant's Right to Court-Appointed Counsel in Civil Contempt Proceedings for Nonpayment of Child Support, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 326, 339 (1983) (`determination of an indigent's ability to comply is especially delicate and susceptible to error'). While coercive contempt is premised on a finding that the defendant can, but is refusing, to comply with the court's order, few lay persons have the training or experience needed to carry the burden of showing that they are not able to comply, even when not under the pressure of potential incarceration.Further, a contempt proceeding can be converted from civil to criminal through a sentence that is not coercive but is, instead, punitive: "Even a8dispassionateauthorized tocourt mayimpose amistakenly believe that it isjail sentence on a defendantwithout the means to pay, in order to motivate himto greater diligence in the future. Such a sentence isnot coercion[. While] the court hopes to deter futurenoncompliance . . .[,] deterrence is one of the classicaims of punishment." Monk, supra, at 340.As the Ridgway court stated in 1983: "The rightto counsel turns on whether deprivation of liberty may result from a proceeding, not upon its characterization as `criminal' or civil." 720 F.2d at 1413. Because there can be no dispute that, when adefendant faces a potential for incarceration at a civil contempt proceeding, his or her liberty interest is atstake, the ABA urges that an indigent defendant should have aright to counsel in these circumstances.II. Where an Indigent Defendant Faces Incarceration for Contempt, the Appointment of Counsel Promotes the Fair and Efficient Administration of Justice.The need "to assure fair proceedings" was a key consideration when the ABA formulated the right to counsel principles embodied in Standards 5-5.1 and 5-5.2. See, e.g., Commentary to Standard 5-5.1, at 62. While recognizing the concerns that right to counsel issues raise over increased administrative and financial burdens, the ABA concluded that, where a person's liberty interest is at stake, the provision of counsel is essential to both the fair and the efficient administration of justice. In other words, providing counsel to indigent defendants facing incarceration at civil contempt proceedings for9the nonpayment of child support is not only the right,but also the practical, thing to do.While appointing counsel in these circumstances would necessarily add costs, those costs must be balanced with savings and, potentially, increased support payments that can result. First, providing counsel for indigent defendants does not necessarilyresult in reduction of support payments: "If [the defendant] cannot pay, then he will not pay, whetherconfined or not, and whether represented by counsel or not." Monk, supra, at 345.Further, appointed counsel can guard against theimproper use--and the costs--of incarceration. SeeMonk, supra, at 345. And, in the event of a finding ofcontempt, counsel can assist the court infashioning--wherealessersanctionthanincarceration would yield compliance--an order thatis most likely to be complied with based on thedefendant's available resources; counsel can alsoappeal to the court's considerable discretion inimposing a lesser sanction. See Patterson, supra, at122; see also Monk, supra, at 339.Moreover, appointment of counsel in thesecircumstances promotes the public's interest inobtaining the correct outcome. As one federal districtcourt judge has stated, "As every trial judge knows,the task of determining the correct legal outcome isrendered almost impossible without effectivecounsel."Robert W. Sweet, Civil Gideon andConfidence in a Just Society, 17 Yale L. & Pol'y Rev.508, 505 (1998).

Ct. Rev. 36, 52 (2002))." Appointment of counsel in these circumstancesalso promotes the efficient administration of justice. As an amicus brief filed by a group of judges noted, when cases are presented pro se, judges have to spend "an inordinate amount of time decipheringpleadings[,] and hearings, when properly scheduled,are slow and onerous." In the Jonsson AmicusBrief, that group of judges noted that, "With court time at a premium, any inordinate attention that must be paid to pro se cases has a ripple effect. . . .[T]he community as a whole is impacted by the backlog created by the spillover from pro se cases."Finally, as this Court has noted, court proceedings must not only be fair, but also must "appear fair."

On the other hand, public confidence is enhancedthrough representation by counsel. As found by a Washington state task force, representation not only increased satisfaction with the legal outcomes, but also greatly increased respect for the justice system overall. Jonsson Amicus Brief at 15 (citing Task Force on Civil Equal Justice Funding, Washington State Supreme Court, The Washington State Civil Legal Needs Study 56 (2003)). This task force concluded that, among low-income people who sought and received an attorney's help, 27% were "very positive" and 27% were "somewhat positive" in their attitudes toward the justice system, while only 3% and 18% had such views, respectively, if they had tried but failed to get an attorney's help. Id.In 2010, the ABA adopted the MODEL ACCESS Act, having concluded that "[p]roviding legal representation to low-income persons at public expense will result in greater judicial efficiency by avoiding repeated appearances and delays caused by incomplete paperwork or unprepared litigants, will produce fairer outcomes, and will promote public confidence in the systems of justice."

I, THERE SHOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE APPEAL UNDER COHEN WHEN A COURT RULES THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE HAS BEEN WAIVED AND COMPELS DISCLOSURE.In United States v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co., 236 U.S. 318 (1915), this Court stated:The desirability of protecting confidential communications between attorney and client as a7 matter of public policy is too well known and has been too often recognized by text-books and courts to need extended comment now. If such communications were required to be made the subject of examination and publication, such enactment would be a practical prohibition upon professional advice and assistance. Id. at 336, citing Conn. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Schaefer,94 U.S. 457, 458 (1876); Blackburn v. Crawfords, 3 Wall. 175 (1865). See also Chirac v. Reinicker, 24 U.S. 280, 294 (1826) (the attorney-client privilege "is indispensable for the purposes of private justice").Just as well known, however, is the principle that "[t]lestimonial exclusionary rules and privileges contravene the fundamental principle that the public... has a right to every man's evidence." Trammel, 445 U.S. at 50 (ellipsis in original; internal quotation marks omitted); see also Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 US. 1, 19 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("the particular value the courts are distinctively charged with preserving--justice--is severely harmed by contravention of `the fundamental principle that the public... has a right to every man's evidence") (quoting Trammel, 445 U.S. at 50) (internal quotation marks omitted)).It is because of the tension between the public interests embodied in the attorney-client privilege and in the "right to every man's evidence," the ABA submits, that the contours of the attorney-client privilege are often unclear. This tension is documented in treatises and scholarly works on the privilege's exceptions, intricacies, and areas of ambiguity.®® See, e.g., EDWARD J. IMWINKELRIED, THE NEW WIGMORE: EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGES (2002).8 It is also documented in case law, in which the lower courts have debated the scope of the privilege and, the ABA submits, based on the importance of the privilege, have too frequently been incorrect in determining the appropriate balance between these public interests.The ABA accordingly asserts that there should be a right to immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine when a court rules that the attorney-client privilege has been waived and compels production of attorney-client communications. That is, such orders necessarily "fall in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated." Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 387 U.S. 541, 546 (1949).A. The Necessity To Maintain the Appropriate Balance Between the Privilege and the "Right to Every Man's Evidence" Is the Result of the Privilege's Ongoing Common Law Development.The attorney-client privilege "is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law." Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 389, citing 8 WIGMORE, EVIDENCE § 2290 (McNaughton rev. 1961).° Nevertheless, the appropriate balance between the privilege and the right to "every man's evidence" is continually being debated because a_ court's* In fact, the attorney-client privilege "goes back to the reign of Elizabeth I, where the privilege already appears as unquestioned." 8 WIGMORE, EVIDENCE § 2290, at 542.9 "interpretation of the privilege's scope is guided by `the principles of the common law . . . as interpretedby the courts ... in the light of reason and experience." Swidler & Berlin v. United States, 524U.S. 399, 403 (1998) (ellipses in original) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 501 and citing Funk v. United States, 290 U.S 371 (1933)).Rule 501 provides authority for the federal courts to pursue an "evolutionary development," Trammel, 445 U.S. at 47, of testimonial privileges, including the attorney-client privilege."In this ongoing "evolutionary development," however, the decisions. of the lower courts have not© Rule 501 states: "[T]he privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience." See also S. REP. No. 93-1277, at 11 (1974), as reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7051, 7058 (reflecting congressional intent that questions of privilege, including attorneyclient privilege, in federal proceedings be decided under "federally developed common law based on modern reason and experience"). This Court has considered federal and state case law, see, e.g., Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 389-93; scholarly commentary, see, 2.g., Trammel, 445 U.S. at 50 & n.11; and "consensus among the States," Jaffee, 518 U.S. at 13 (States' policy decisions, as reflected in court decisions and legislation, bear on questions of federal courts' recognition of new privileges or amendment to existing ones).This Court has also considered accepted norms of professional conduct, including ABA standards. See, e.g., Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 390-91 (to give sound legal advice, lawyer must ascertain factual background and sift through facts), citing ABA MODEL CODE OF PROF'L RESPONSIBILITY, Ethical Consideration 4-1; Jaffee, 518 U.S. at 10 & n.9, 13 n.12 (relying in part on professional organizations' ethical standards, in recognizing psychotherapist-patient privilege).10 always been correct. For example, the lower courts spent at least twenty years addressing the scope of the attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine in the corporate context, to determine when an employee was sufficiently identified with the corporation for the privilege to attach. Over this time, two generally competing tests were used. One was the "control group" test."' The other was the "subject matter" test." Still other courts used various "hybrids."" The "control group" test considered whether an individual was within the group that could take a substantial part in making the decision for which an attorney's advice was sought. A chronological sampling of cases applying this test includes United States v. Aluminum Co of America, 193 F. Supp. 251 (N.D.N.Y. 1960); City of Philadelphia v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 210 F. Supp. 483 (E.D. Pa. 1962), mandamus and prohibition denied sub. nom. General Elec. Co. v. Kirkpatrick, 312 F.2d 742 (8d Cir. 1962); Virginia Electric & Power Co. v. Sun Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 68 F.R.D. 397 (E.D. Va. 1975); and SEC v. Canadian Javelin Ltd., 451 F. Supp. 594 (D.D.C. 1978)." The "subject matter" test contained several components, including whether the person making the communication was an employee of the corporation, whether the decision was made at the instance of the employee's superior, and whether its subject matter was within the employee's duties. A chronological sampling of cases applying this test includes Leve v. General Motors Corp., 43 F.R.D. 508 (S.D.N.Y. 1967); Hasso v. Retail Credit Co., 58 F.R.D. 425 (E.D. Pa. 1973); Syigab Steel & Wire Corp. v. Imoco-Gateway Corp., 62 F.R.D. 454 (N.D. IIL. 1974); Hercules Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 434 F. Supp. 186 (D. Del. 1977); and In re Grand Jury Subpoena dated July 13, 1979, 478 F. Supp. 368 (E.D. Wis. 1979).8 See, e.g., Diversified Indus., Inc. v. Meredith, 572 F.2d 596 (8th Cir. 1978) (en banc) (five-prong test).il When this Court granted certiorari in Upjohn, the lower court had used the "control group" test. This Court concluded:The narrow scope given the attorney-client privilege by the court below not only makes it difficult for corporate attorneys to formulate sound advice when their client is faced with a specific legal problem but also threatens to limit the valuable efforts of corporate counsel to ensure their client's compliance with the law. Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 392: However, this Court declined to set out the test to be used by the lower courts and, instead, stated: "Any such approach would violate the spirit of Federal Rule of Evidence 501. While such a `case-by-case' basis may to some slight extent undermine desirable certainty in the boundaries of the attorney-client privilege, it obeys the spirit of the Rules." Jd. at 396-97 (citations omitted). The wisdom of this approach has been continually reaffirmed as new issues have developed in the legal landscape. However, the ABA submits that this approach also counsels that, for the "small class" of orders in which a court rules that the attorney-client privilege has been waived and compels production,4 The ABA was among the amici and urged that the "control group" test "could seriously undermine the vitality of the socially beneficial practice of corporate self-inquiry." Brief of the American Bar Association as Amicus Curiae, Upjohn (No. 79886), 1980 WL 339283, at *15-16. The ABA also urged that the Court's decision would "significantly affect the ability of lawyers to provide responsible, effective legal representation and to give informed guidance necessary to ensure compliance with the law." Id. at *2. The ABA submits that issues of corporate selfinquiry are similarly important in the present case.12 there should be.a right to immediate appeal. As this Court stated in Upjohn, id. at 393:(If the purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to be served, the attorney and client must be able to predict with some degree of certainty whether particular discussions will be protected. An uncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results in widely varying applications by the courts, is little better than no privilege at all.B. The Importance of Maintaining Appropriate Balance Between the Public Interests Counsels that the "Small Class" of Orders Appealable Under Cohen Should Include Rulings that the Privilege Has Been Waived and Compelling Production.The importance of maintaining the appropriate balance between the public interests that are served by the attorney-client privilege and by the "right to every man's evidence" counsels that orders finding waiver of the privilege and compelling production should be included in the "small class" of orders that are immediately appealable under Cohen.These orders, the ABA submits, necessarily satisfy Cohen's three-prong test, in that they will always "conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment." Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 468 (1978). See also United States v. Philip Morris, 314 F.3d 612, 620 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (order is appealable under Cohen "if it meets the three prong test of conclusiveness,13 separability and importance, and effective unreviewability").As to the first and second Cohen prongs, the Eleventh Circuit, in the decision now before this Court, stated that the challenged order left "no room for the district court to further consider whether the information at issue is protected," and "we agree that the attorney-client privilege is important and that the district court can resolve [whether the communications must be produced] without deciding the merits of the case." Pet. App. 8a.Likewise, each of the circuit courts cited by the Eleventh Circuit as having addressed whether such an order was immediately appealable under Cohen, see Pet. App. 9a--10a, and regardless of their ultimate rulings about the applicability of Cohen, concluded that the first and second prongs were met, or their analyses are otherwise distinguishable."4 The cases cited by the Eleventh Circuit in which jurisdiction was found, and accordingly, the first and second Cohen prongs were deemed met, are Philip Morris, 314 F.3d at 617-21; Kelly v. Ford Motor Co. (In re Ford Motor Co.), 110 F.3d 954, 957-64 (8d Cir. 1997); and In re Napster, Inc. Copyright Litigation, 479 F.3d 1078, 1087-89 (9th Cir. 2007) (even while noting, for second prong, potential overlap of privilege question and underlying suit). Cf F.D.L.C. v. Ogden Corp., 202 F.3d 454, 459 (1st Cir. 2000) (permitting client that was a party to take immediate appeal from order directed to nonparty law firm, because compliance would "render{] an end-of-case appeal nugatory" and "immediate appeal offers the only vehicle by which [the client] can gain effective review of the [attorney-client] privilege issue"); Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. Turner & Newall, PLC, 964 F.2d 159 (2d Cir. 1992) (granting writ of mandamus based on consideration of goals of attorney-client privilege and adverse effects of disclosure of privileged documents to opposing counsel, after brief discussion of Cohen that relied on14 As for the third prong, however, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that such an order was not effec-Second Circuit decisions deeming "discovery orders" not to be appealable; not analyzing whether the three prongs of the collateral-order doctrine would justify a different treatment of orders involving claims of attorney-client privilege).While the Tenth Circuit in Boughton v. Cotter Corp., 10 F.3d 746, 749 (10th Cir. 1993), found no jurisdiction, that court nevertheless stated that the order "arguably meets the first and second prongs of the [Cohen] test." In Reise v. Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin System, 957 F.2d 293, 295 (7th Cir. 1992), the Seventh Circuit, in considering an order compelling a mental examination, noted that "even orders to produce information over strong objections based on privilege are not appealable." However, one year after Reise, the Seventh Circuit cited Boughton with approval in a case involving an informer's privilege. Simmons v. City of Racine, PFC, 37 F.3d 325, 327 (7th Cir. 1994), citing Boughton, 10 F.3d at 749-50.In Texaco Ine. v. Louisiana Land and Exploration Co., 995 F.2d 43, 43-44 (5th Cir. 1993), the Fifth Circuit dismissed an interlocutory appeal from an order rejecting a claim of attorneyclient privilege, but did so not based on an assessment of whether such an order satisfies the three prongs of Cohen, but based on Fifth Circuit precedent that, except where governmental privilege is involved, discovery orders in general are not appealable under Cohen.Finally, the remaining case cited by the Eleventh Circuit, Quantum Corp. v. Tandon Corp., 940 F.2d 642 (Fed. Cir. 1991), is readily distinguishable, in that it involved the "dilemma" of whether an alleged patent infringer should be "forced to choose between waiving the [attorney-client] privilege in order to protect itself from a willfulness finding . . . and maintaining the privilege." Id, at 643-44. The Federal Circuit later overruled all precedent authorizing an adverse inference of willfulness in Knorr-Bremse Systeme Fuer Nutzfahrzuege GMbH v. Dana Corp., 383 F.3d 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2004), explaining: "[T]he inference that withheld opinions are adverse to the client's actions can distort the attorney-client relationship, in derogation of the foundations of that relationship." Id. at 1344.15 tively unreviewable, stating that if, on appeal from a final judgment, it was determined that the privileged information had been wrongly turned over, "we could reverse any adverse judgment and require a new trial, forbidding any use of the improperly disclosedinformation, as well as any documents, witnesses, or other evidence obtained as a consequence of the improperly disclosed information." Pet. App. 8a--Ya.With respect, the ABA asserts that this reasoning is contrary to "the principles of the common law as... interpreted by the courts . . . in the light of reason and experience," Rule 501, which have consistently protected against disclosure--and not simply use-- of privileged communications. As this Court stated in Hunt v. Blackburn, 128 U.S. 464, 470 (1888):The rule which places the seal of secrecy upon communications between client and attorney is founded upon the necessity, in the interest and administration of justice, of the aid of persons having knowledge of the law and skilled in its practice, which assistance can only be safely and readily availed of when free from the consequences or the apprehension of disclosure. See also Swidler & Berlin, 524 US. at 408. Further, a new trial will not cure the damage caused by an erroneously compelled disclosure. To the contrary, allowing an adversary to see privileged documents that are later held inadmissible at retrial "may alert adversary counsel to evidentiary leads or give insights regarding various claims and defenses. Moreover, attorneys cannot unlearn what has been disclosed to them." Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. Turner & Newall, PLC, 964 F.2d 159, 165 (2d Cir. 1992). See also Philip Morris, 314 F.3d at 619 ("It16 would be impossible for a court to sort out and redress the harm caused by the incorrect disclo-sure."); In re England, 375 F.3d 1169, 1176 (D.C. Cir. 2004) ("Disclosure followed by appeal after final judgment is obviously not adequate in [privilege] cases-- the cat is out of the bag.") (quoting In re Papandreou, 139 F.3d 247, 251 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (alteration inEngland)). Finally, an erroneous privilege ruling may ulti-mately evade appellate review after judgment. The producing party may prevail in the litigation, or the threat of production may induce settlement. Even if not disclosed in the original action, nonparties could demand production of the privileged communications based on rulings. for which an appeal was never available.The Eleventh Circuit's reasoning is not consistent with this Court's determination that an order is effectively unreviewable if it "involves an asserted right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial." Lauro Lines S.R.L. v. Chasser, 490 U.S. 495, 499 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).In Lauro Lines, this Court concluded that an order concerning a forum selection clause did not involve such a right. Id. at 501. See also id. at 502-03 (Scalia, J., concurring) (although "the `right not to be sued elsewhere than in Naples" is "positively destroyed" if trial occurs in the United States, the right not to be tried in a particular court--even when established by Congress or international treaty--"is not sufficiently important to overcome the policies militating against interlocutory appeals").17 Unlike review of a ruling concerning a forum selection clause, when review of an erroneous ruling compelling production of attorney-client communications must occur if at all only after a final judgment, the privilege as to the communications is destroyed.More important, the ABA submits, is the harm to the privilege itself:As a practical matter, if the client knows that damaging information could more readily be obtained from the attorney following disclosure than from himself in the absence of disclosure, the client would be reluctant to confide in his lawyer....Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403 (1976). See also In re England, 375 F.3d at 1175-76 ("important institutional interests' [of encouraging full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and promoting the broader public interests in the administration of justice embodied in the attorneyclient privilege] would be `eviscerate[d] by an erroneous privilege ruling, underscoring the importance of interlocutory review") (quoting Philip Morris, 314 F.3d at 618) (first alteration added). Compare Chase Manhattan Bank, 964 F.2d at 165 (granting writ of mandamus with respect to attorney-client privilege issue because assurance that communications "will not be admissible as evidence at trial . . . will not suffice to ensure free and full communication by clients who do not rate highly a privilege that is operative only at the time of trial").18 This is also true where the order concerns an issue of waiver. As the District of Columbia Circuitstated in Philip Morris, 314 F.3d at 618: A decision defining the contours of a waiver of privilege is no less "important" for Cohen purposes than a ruling on the contours of the privilege itself. An erroneous finding of waiver, like an erroneous ruling denying a claim of privilege, eviscerates the same important institutional interests in preserving information, and derivatively, full and frank communication between client and attorney.When the efficiency interests that underlie finality, including the costs of piecemeal review, are weighed against the costs that can result when review of an erroneous ruling compelling production of privileged communications must await a final judgment, the attorney-client privilege, the ABA submits, is "sufficiently important to overcome the policies militating against interlocutory appeals." Lauro Lines, 490 U.S. at 503 (Scalia, J., concurring).16 For a discussion of the growing importance of the issue of waivers, see, e.g., I EDNA S. EPSTEIN, THE ATTORNEY-CLIENTPRIVILEGE AND THE WORK-PRODUCT DOCTRINE 392 (ABA Sec. ofLitigation 5th ed. 2007) ("The expansion of all types of waivers in the last twenty years or so of privilege jurisprudence is stunning in its extent and scope. On occasion one wonders if the multiple types of possible waivers are not about to swallow the privilege whole."), See also Fed. R. Evid. 502 ("Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations on Waiver") (limiting when disclosure in court proceeding or to federal office or agency constitutes waiver of privilege, and when such waiver extends to undisclosed communications or information) (effective Sept. 19, 2008).19 C. Orders Ruling that the Privilege HasBeen Waived and Compelling Production Should Be Appealable Under Cohen Because Questions as to the Appropriate Balance of the Public Interests Must Be Answered Correctly. District court orders ruling that the attorney-client privilege has been waived and compelling production should be appealable under Cohen because questions as to the appropriate balance between the public interests embodied in the attorney-client privilege and the "right to every man's evidence" will continue to be asked and, the ABA submits, must be answered correctly if the privilege is to retain its vitality. As shown in the discussion of Upjohn, supra, there have been profound differences of opinion in the lower courts as to the scope of the attorney-client privilege. Differences of opinion are also found in this Court's decisions. For example, in Swidler & Berlin, 524 U.S. at 402, this Court considered whether the attorney-client privilege should survive the client's death when, in connection with a criminal investigation of the client, subpoenas were issued to an attorney and his law firm. The lower court had concluded that a balancing test should be used because a risk of posthumous revelation confined to the criminal context would have little to no chilling effect on client communication, and the costs of protecting communications were high. Id.`"Th its amicus brief, the ABA urged that the lower court's decision was a substantial departure from the "principles of common law" as historically interpreted by the courts, citing Rule 501, and would result in conscientious attorneys advising--regardless of whether death were imminent--that clients should assume their communications would not remain con-20In reversing, this Court concluded that "[bJalancing ex post the importance of the information against client interests, even limited to criminal cases, introduces substantial uncertainty into the privilege's application." Id. at 409, citing Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 393, and Jaffee, 518 U.S. at 17-18.Justice O'Connor, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented, asserting that "an invocation of the attorney-client privilege should not go unexamined `when it is shown that the interests in the administration of justice can only be frustrated by [its] exercise." 524 U.S. at 412 (quoting Cohen v. Jenkintown Cab Co., 357 A.2d 689, 693-94 (Pa. Super. 1976) (alteration in Swidler & Berlin)).The ABA submits that Swidler illustrates the profound differences of opinion that arise among judges as to the appropriate balance that should be maintained between the attorney-client privilege and the "right to every man's evidence." When an alleged waiver is at issue, the differences of opinion are equally profound. Because "[a]n uncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results in widely varying applications by the courts, is little better than no privilege at all," Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 393, questions of waiver must be answered correctly if the privilege is to retain its vitality.Accordingly, the ABA submits that when production of privileged communications is compelled based on a court's order that the privilege has been waived, such orders should fall within that "small class" offidential after death.

I. Miller v. Alabama Announced a Substantive Rule That Applies Retroactively.In Miller, this Court held that the Eighth Amendment's bar on cruel and unusual punishments precludes sentencing schemes under which juveniles receive a mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The question in this case is whether that rule should apply retroactively to juveniles whose convictions became final before Miller was announced.Miller articulated a "new" constitutional rule--that is, a rule that was not dictated by previous precedent. Accordingly, under Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989) and its progeny, the rule in Miller does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review unless it is either a "substantive" rule or a "watershed" rule of criminal procedure. The question the ABA addresses here is whether Miller set forth a "substantive" rule within the meaning of this Court's retroactivity doctrine.14A careful examination of Miller itself, including the decisions on which Miller relied, and the principles underlying the distinction between "substantive" and "procedural" rules, demonstrates that the holding in Miller is a substantive rule that should apply retroactively to all juveniles who were mandatorily sentenced to life without parole. Miller14 This brief does not address whether Miller set out a "watershed" rule of criminal procedure.9changed the Eighth Amendment rule as to when life without parole is a constitutionally permissible sentence for a juvenile, severely constricting the states' ability to impose such a punishment. In short, Miller did not merely set out a procedural mechanism designed to make decisions more accurate, it changed the substance of Eighth Amendment doctrine regarding what punishments are cruel and unusual for juveniles.A. Miller Was Based on the Eighth Amendment's Substantive Guarantee of Proportionality.Miller is a case about proportionality under the Eighth Amendment. See 132 S. Ct. at 2463 (explaining that the Eighth Amendment embodies "the basic precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to both the offender and the offense") (internal quotation marks omitted). It addressed whether, and under what circumstances, life without the possibility of parole could be a proportional--and hence constitutional--sentence for offenders who committed their crimes as juveniles.The Court explained that this question "implicate[s] two strands of precedent reflecting our concern with proportionate punishment." Id. First, the Court relied on decisions that "adopted categorical bans on sentencing practices based on a mismatch between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty." Id. Second, it relied on decisions that "prohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment, requiring that10sentencing authorities consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death." Id. at 2463­64. "[T]he confluence of these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment." Id. at 2464.1. The first strand of precedent included decisions like Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (death penalty may not be imposed on juveniles), and Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010) (life without parole may not be imposed on juveniles who did not commit homicide), which "establish that children are constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing." Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2464. "Because juveniles have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform," Roper and Graham hold that "they are less deserving of the most severe punishments." Id. at 2464 (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, "children have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility, leading to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). They "are more vulnerable . . . to negative influences and outside pressures." Id. And, perhaps most significantly here, "a child's character is not as well formed as an adult's; his traits are less fixed and his actions less likely to be evidence of irretrievable depravity." Id. (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).Those "distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when11they commit terrible crimes." Miller, 132 S. Ct. at2465. Because minors are less blameworthy, "thecase for retribution is not as strong with a minor aswith an adult." Id. (internal quotation marksomitted).Moreover, juveniles' "immaturity,recklessness, and impetuosity" mean that they areunlikely to be deterred by "potential punishment."Id. Finally, a sentence of life without parole requires"making a judgment that he is incorrigible--butincorrigibility is inconsistent with youth." Id.(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).For all these reasons, "life-without-parole sentences .. . may violate the Eighth Amendment"--that is, theEighth Amendment's substantive guarantee thatpunishment will be proportional to the crime--"whenimposed on children." Id.Miller reasoned that mandatory imposition of life without parole on juveniles "prohibit[s] a sentencing authority from assessing whether the law's harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender" and thus "contravenes Graham's (and also Roper's) foundational principle: that imposition of a State's most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children." 132 S. Ct. at 2466.2. Because the Court viewed a life without parole sentence for a juvenile as analogous to a death sentence--the harshest possible available sentence, which mandates that the juvenile offender will die in prison--Miller also relied on a second strand of precedent. Those decisions require "that capital defendants have an opportunity to advance, and the judge or jury a chance to assess, any mitigating12factors, so that the death penalty is reserved only for the most culpable defendants committing the most serious offenses." 132 S. Ct. at 2467 (citing Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U.S. 66, 74-76 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110-12 (1982); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978)); see id. at 2464 (citing Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976)). "In light of Graham's reasoning," the Court explained, "these decisions too show the flaws of imposing mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders. . . . Such mandatory penalties . . . preclude a sentencer from taking account of an offender's age and the wealth of characteristics and circumstances attendant to it," by applying the same sentence to all juvenile and adult offenders alike regardless of culpability or the likelihood of change in the future. Id. at 2467­68.3. Synthesizing these two lines of precedent, the Court held that "the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders." Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2469. "By making youth . . . irrelevant to the imposition of that harshest prison sentence, such a scheme poses too great a risk of disproportionate punishment." Id. (emphasis added). Indeed, the Court noted, "given all we have said . . . about children's diminished culpability and heightened capacity for change, we think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon. That is especially so because of the great difficulty . . . of distinguishing at this early age between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile13offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption." Id. (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).In short, Miller held that the inherent characteristics of juvenile offenders--even those who have committed homicide--will typically render a sentence of life without parole unconstitutionally disproportionate. It required states to give meaningful consideration to the characteristics of youth before imposing life without parole on a juvenile precisely because of the "great . . . risk of disproportionate punishment" that would otherwise exist. Id.B. Miller's Holding Is Substantive Under This Court's Retroactivity Doctrine.Whether Miller's holding is retroactive under this Court's doctrine turns on whether the holding is viewed as "substantive" or "procedural." The principles underlying this Court's retroactivity doctrine demonstrate that Miller's holding is "substantive" for retroactivity purposes. In a nutshell, Miller held that most of those serving mandatory life in prison without parole sentences for crimes committed as juveniles are serving sentences the state cannot constitutionally impose. That is the very essence of a substantive rule.1. In Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), this Court set out its retroactivity doctrine, in which new constitutional rules typically are applied to cases pending on direct review but are not retroactive to cases on collateral review. Teague identified two14exceptions to that rule: A new rule should be applied retroactively if (1) "it places certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe"; or (2) "it requires the observance of those procedures that . . . are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty"-- that is, it is a "watershed" rule of criminal procedure. Id. at 307, 311 (plurality).In Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989), the Court clarified that the first Teague exception applies to "substantive categorical guarantees accorded by the Constitution." Id. at 329. For instance, where "the Eighth Amendment, as a substantive matter, prohibits imposing the death penalty on a certain class of defendants because of their status, or because of the nature of their offense," the rule should be retroactive. Id. at 329­ 30. That is so because "the Constitution itself deprives the State of the power to impose a certain penalty, and the finality and comity concerns underlying [the general rule of nonretroactivity] have little force." Id. at 330.More recently, in Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348 (2004), the Court gave additional content to the distinction between substantive constitutional guarantees, which apply retroactively, and merely procedural rules, which do not. "New substantive rules generally apply retroactively," "because they necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him." Id. at 351­52 (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, "[n]ew rules of15procedure . . . generally do not apply retroactively," because "[t]hey do not produce a class of persons convicted of conduct the law does not make criminal" or facing an unconstitutional punishment, "but merely raise the possibility that someone convicted with use of the invalidated procedure might have been acquitted otherwise." Id. at 352. Put differently, "[a] rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes." Schriro, 542 U.S. at 353. "In contrast, rules that regulate only the manner of determining the defendant's culpability are procedural." Id.Schriro determined that the rule of Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002)--which held that, under the Sixth Amendment, an aggravating factor necessary to imposition of the death penalty must be found by the jury, not the judge--was "procedural" and thus not retroactive under those principles. 542 U.S. at 358­59. The Court explained that Ring "did not alter the range of conduct Arizona subjected to the death penalty"; "[i]nstead, Ring altered the range of permissible methods for determining whether a defendant's conduct is punishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than a judge find the essential facts bearing on punishment." Id. at 353. "[T]he range of conduct punished by death in Arizona was the same before Ring as after. . . . This Court's holding that, because Arizona has made a certain fact essential to the death penalty, that fact must be found by a jury, is not the same as this Court's making a certain fact essential to the death penalty. The former was a procedural holding; the latter would be substantive." Id. at 354.162. Under these principles, Miller's holding is a substantive rule. Although Miller did not categorically bar life without parole sentences for juveniles, it nonetheless recognizes a "substantive . . . guarantee accorded by the Constitution," Penry, 492 U.S. at 329--the guarantee that, under the Eighth Amendment, life without parole may be imposed only on "the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption." Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2469.In Schriro's terms, Miller's holding is substantive because there is "a significant risk that [a juvenile] defendant" sentenced before Miller "faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him." 542 U.S. at 352. Indeed, Miller made precisely that point: Mandatory life without parole is unconstitutional as applied to juveniles because "such a scheme poses too great a risk of disproportionate punishment"--punishment that the Constitution forbids. 132 S. Ct. at 2469.In other words, unlike Ring, which merely required states to change the decisionmaker--from the judge to the jury--Miller sets new requirements that must be satisfied for the decision itself to be constitutional. As Schriro explained, "this Court's making a certain fact essential to the death penalty . . . would be substantive," and such a holding would be retroactive. 542 U.S. at 354. Here, Miller has effectively made certain facts essential to the constitutional imposition of life without parole on juveniles--facts that, before Miller, decisionmakers17in states with mandatory sentencing schemes could not consider at all.Before Miller, every juvenile convicted of a homicide offense could constitutionally be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. After Miller, such a sentence is permitted only in the "rare" and "uncommon" case in which the juvenile's crime and character reflect irreparable corruption. Outside of that exceptional case, each person serving a sentence of mandatory life in prison without parole for crimes committed as a juvenile is now serving a sentence that the State may not lawfully impose.3. Because Miller addressed the scope of the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment, Miller established a substantive rule. Most constitutional provisions governing criminal proceedings--like the Sixth Amendment jury-trial right at issue in Ring--mandate procedural protections for defendants. See Schriro, 542 U.S. at 353 (noting that "the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee . . . has nothing to do with the range of conduct a State may criminalize"). By contrast, the Eighth Amendment has everything to do with the range of conduct a State may criminalize--and with the range of punishment a State may impose on a specific offender. It imposes substantive restrictions on a State's authority to punish, and new rules regarding those substantive restrictions should thus be applied retroactively.The Eighth Amendment cases on which Miller relied bolster this point. Roper, Graham, and Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002) (barring the death18penalty for the intellectually disabled), have all been applied retroactively.15 Those are cases in which the Court held that "the Eighth Amendment, as a substantive matter, prohibits imposing the death penalty [or life without parole] on a certain class of defendants because of their status"--Penry's archetype of a substantive rule. 492 U.S. at 329­30. Miller's rule likewise reflects a new understanding of the Eighth Amendment's substantive guarantee; the only difference between Miller and Roper, Graham, and Atkins is that Miller held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits imposing life without parole on juveniles, not categorically, but in all but the very rare cases.15 See Penry, 492 U.S. at 329-30 (making clear that rule eventually adopted in Atkins would be applied retroactively); see also, e.g., Arroyo v. Dretke, 362 F. Supp. 2d 859, 883 (W.D. Tex. 2005), aff'd on other grounds sub nom., Arroyo v. Quarterman, 222 Fed. App'x 425 (5th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (per curiam) (applying Roper retroactively to case on collateral review); In re Sparks, 657 F.3d 258, 262 (5th Cir. 2011) (acknowledging that Roper has been given retroactive effect); Moore v. Biter, 725 F.3d 1184, 1190-91 (9th Cir. 2013) ("Thus, we hold that Graham is retroactive under Teague."); In re Moss, 703 F.3d 1301, 1303 (11th Cir. 2013) (holding that offender made a prima facie showing that "Graham has been made retroactively applicable by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review"); Bell v. Cockrell, 310 F.3d 330, 332 (5th Cir. 2002) (holding that Atkins applies retroactively to collateral attacks, including habeas relief); Hill v. Anderson, 300 F.3d 679, 681 (6th Cir. 2002) (acknowledging Atkins applies retroactively); see also In re Henry, 757 F.3d 1151, 1160 (11th Cir. 2014) (same); In re Holladay, 331 F.3d, 1169, 1173 (11th Cir. 2003) (same); Martin v. Symmes, 782 F.3d 939, 942 (8th Cir. 2015) (same); Ochoa v. Sirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007) (same); Woods v. Buss, 234 F. App'x 409, 411 (7th Cir. 2007) (same).19To be sure, not all decisions grounded in the Eighth Amendment articulate new substantive rules. Some Eighth Amendment decisions do not alter the basic understanding of what the Amendment forbids, but instead impose procedural protections designed to increase the accuracy of sentencing determinations. When an Eighth Amendment decision is solely concerned with defining the procedure necessary to protect the pre-existing understanding of the Eighth Amendment guarantee, it may not be applicable retroactively as a substantive rule.16 Miller, however, both articulated a new substantive understanding of the Eighth Amendment and imposed a procedural requirement to vindicate that understanding.4. Lower courts finding the rule in Miller nonretroactive have relied heavily on language in Miller stating that "[o]ur decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime--as, for example, we did in Roper or Graham. Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer16 For that reason, the Court has held that certain new rules grounded in the Eighth Amendment do not apply retroactively. See, e.g., Beard v. Banks, 542 U.S. 406, 408 (2004) (rule of Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367 (1988), that juries may not disregard mitigating factors not found unanimously); Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227 (1990) (rule of Caldwell v. Mississippi, 474 U.S. 320 (1985), that jury may not be led to believe that ultimate responsibility for sentencing defendant to death lies elsewhere). Unlike Miller, Mills and Caldwell merely addressed the appropriate jury instructions to maximize the accuracy of the sentencing process; they did not change the understanding of the scope of the underlying bar on cruel and unusual punishment.20follow a certain process--considering an offender's youth and attendant characteristics--before imposing a particular penalty." 132 S. Ct. at 2471. Those courts have concluded that because Miller requires a new process--an individualized sentencing hearing--it is "procedural," not substantive, and therefore not to be applied retroactively.17That analysis is fundamentally wrong. Miller's newly required procedure is only designed to implement its new substantive rule. The existence of a procedure necessary to enforce a substantive rule does not mean that the rule itself is merely procedural. Atkins, for example, required states to adopt new procedures to determine whether capital defendants had intellectual disabilities, but the underlying rule in Atkins was undoubtedly substantive: The Eighth Amendment forbade executing those with intellectual disabilities. So too here.Nor does Miller's statement that it did not "categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders" render the rule in Miller purely procedural. Miller itself makes clear that a new rule need not be categorical to be substantive. A new rule under which life without parole is only rarely a proportionate sentence for juvenile offenders is just17 See, e.g., Johnson v. Ponton, 780 F.3d 219, 222 (4th Cir. 2015); People v. Tate, --- P. 3d ---, 2015 WL 3452609, at *11, 2015 Colo. 42, ¶ 60 (Colo. June 1, 2015); State v. Tate, 130 So. 3d 829, 834, 837 (La. 2013), 130 So. 3d 829, 834, reh'g denied (Jan. 27, 2014), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 2663, 189 L. Ed. 2d 214 (2014).21as substantive as a new rule under which it is never a proportionate sentence. In both cases, failure to apply the rule retroactively creates "a significant risk that a defendant . . . faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him." Schriro, 542 U.S. at 352. Indeed, in cases like this one, which fundamentally altered the scope of the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, the Court has never refused to give retroactive effect to its decisions.18 As explained further below, the Court should not reach a contrary result here. It is not consistent with basic principles of fairness to continue to force a prisoner to serve a sentence that the Court has held youth makes disproportionate.II. Retroactive Application of Miller Is Necessary To Avoid Unjust Treatment of Juvenile Offenders and Will Not Unduly Burden the States.This Court's retroactivity doctrine weighs the potential injustice of refusing to apply a new constitutional rule to all affected defendants against the states' interest in finality. In many cases, that balance counsels in favor of respecting finality. Here, however, the balance tips sharply in the other direction. The injustice of refusing to apply Miller retroactively is far greater, and the burden on the states from doing so far less, than in the typical case. The very point of Miller is that juveniles change; and18 E.g., Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005); Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 608 (1978); Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305 (1976).22unless Miller is retroactive, most juveniles condemned to die in prison under a mandatory sentencing scheme will never have the opportunity to demonstrate either their capacity for change or that they have in fact changed. Moreover, the rule in Miller will have little effect on finality. It undoes no convictions and requires no one to be released from prison. It merely requires that a small group of prisoners receive a hearing to determine whether they should someday have the opportunity to seek release. For these reasons, a majority of states have interpreted Miller to apply retroactively or have enacted reforms consistent with Miller's new rule.A. Applying Miller Retroactively Is the Only Just Result.Miller's premise is that because juvenile offenders are less culpable and have greater capacity for change, they must be treated differently from adults in sentencing. Fair treatment requires that Miller's new rule be applied retroactively, so that no juvenile offenders are denied the opportunity to establish their capacity for change before they die in prison.Indeed, the longer juvenile offenders have already served in prison, the greater is the likelihood that they can demonstrate the kind of changed character that might entitle them to the possibility of parole. Likewise, the longer juvenile offenders have already served in prison, the more disproportionate is the continued incarceration for those who may be able to demonstrate that their crimes reflect the "unfortunate yet transient immaturity" of youth23rather than bad character. Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2469.As Miller noted, "[i]mprisoning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of his life by a forfeiture that is irrevocable. . . . And this lengthiest possible incarceration is an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile, because he will almost inevitably serve more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender." 132 S. Ct. at 2466. At the same time, "[l]ife without parole forswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal"; "[i]t reflects an irrevocable judgment about an offender's value and place in society, at odds with a child's capacity for change." Id. at 2465 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).Miller recognized that life without parole may be imposed only on "the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption." Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2469. Refusing juvenile offenders the chance to demonstrate that they did not fall within that category when they were sentenced under mandatory sentencing schemes, or do not fall within that category now, unnecessarily subjects them to a significant risk of serving out an irrevocable sentence that is disproportionate and therefore unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.24B. Applying Miller Retroactively Would Not Meaningfully Affect States' Interest in Finality.The states' interest in finality, whichunderpins the general rule of non-retroactivity, isparticularly weak here. One justification for finalityis deterrence. See Teague, 489 U.S. at 309 ("Withoutfinality, the criminal law is deprived of much of itsdeterrent effect.").However, whatever therelationship may be between finality and deterrenceof adult conduct, children are different. "[T]he samecharacteristics that render juveniles less culpablethan adults--their immaturity, recklessness, andimpetuosity--make them less likely to considerpotential punishment" and thus much less likelythan adults to be deterred by the prospect ofpunishment. Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2465. Especiallygiven that applying Miller retroactively would notvacate juvenile offenders' convictions or necessarilyeven modify their sentences, retroactivity would notundermine deterrence.The states' interest in finality also encompasses an interest in avoiding the expense and difficulty of repeated trials long after the offense. That interest is also not meaningfully implicated here. Applying Miller retroactively would not mean repeated re-litigation of convictions that were the result of trials that conformed to contemporary constitutional standards; it would not automatically undo any juvenile offender's life sentence. What is at issue here is merely whether those juvenile offenders should be given the opportunity at some point during their lives to demonstrate that they25have changed. As Justice Harlan's influential separate opinion in Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 691 (1971), put it, finality in the criminal law ensures that "attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community." Id. at 690. Because Miller merely requires that juvenile offenders be given an opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for rehabilitation and their ability to rejoin society, preserving their constitutionally infirm sentences cannot reasonably be justified by an interest in finality.Moreover, as demonstrated by the states that have already determined that Miller should be applied retroactively, any burden on the courts from resentencing those affected by Miller would be minimal. Only a limited number of juvenile offenders would be affected.19 When Miller was decided in 2012, approximately 2,500 juvenile offenders of the approximately 1,600,000 people imprisoned in the United States20 were serving19 See, e.g., People v. Williams, 982 N.E.2d 181, 198 (Ill. App. Ct. 2012) ("At oral argument the State informed the court that approximately 105 convicted defendants in Illinois have life without parole sentences and would be affected if the Miller holding is applied retroactively. This is not such a great number of cases for us to conclude that it is an unreasonable burden for the State and the courts to reopen their cases for resentencing.").20 U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Correctional Populations in the United States, 2011, at 2­3 (Nov. 2012) (reporting that the number of prisoners under the jurisdiction or legal authority of state and federal adult correctional officials at the end of 2011 was1,598,780).26sentences of life without parole.21 Approximately 90% of those individuals were serving sentences imposed pursuant to mandatory sentencing regimes.22 At that time, 38 states permitted imposition of life without parole upon juvenile offenders 14 years of age or older, and 28 states mandated a life without parole sentence for certain types of offenses and under certain circumstances.23In the states that either have held that Miller does not apply retroactively24 or have not decided the issue of retroactivity, only a limited number of21 See Erik Eckholm, A Murderer at 14, Then a Lifer, Now a Man Pondering a Future, N.Y. Times, at A1 (Apr. 11, 2015) (noting that most of the 2,500 juvenile offenders serving life without parole sentences when Miller was decided were sentenced under mandatory sentencing schemes); see also Connie de la Vega & Michelle Leighton, Sentencing Our Children to Die in Prison: Global Law and Practice, 42 U.S.F.

Times, at A1 (Apr. 11, 2015) (estimating that 1,130 prisoners in Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania could be affected by Miller's retroactive application).26 See Dan O'Connor, Juvenile Lifers: Miller v. Alabama and Michigan, Senate Fiscal Agency (Aug. 16, 2012) ("Speaking on behalf of the MDOC, Executive Bureau Administrator Russell Marlan and Legislative Liaison Jessica Peterson stated that the Department had looked through its population and determined that there are 370 individuals for whom the [Miller] decision may be applicable.").27 See Moriah Balingit, Other states watch how Pennsylvania handles life terms for juveniles, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Sept. 23, 2012) ("The Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center estimates there are about 470 inmates . . . who are serving life sentences for crimes they committed before their 18th birthday . . . .").28 Kent Faulk, Alabama Supreme Court says SCOTUS ruling on juvenile killers not retroactive (Mar. 27, 2015).29 Erik Eckholm, Juveniles Facing Lifelong Terms, Despite Rulings, N.Y.

The Federal Government and ManyStates Have Recognized that FairnessDictatesMiller'sRetroactiveApplication.The federal government has repeatedly conceded that Miller applies retroactively to habeas cases.30 As the First Circuit recognized, "[t]he government plays a central role in criminal law enforcement . . . [and] it is fair to say that the government is generally resistant to collateral review of criminal convictions and sentences." Evans-Garcia v. United States, 744 F.3d 235, 238-39 (1st Cir. 2014) (certifying that Miller qualified as a basis for habeas relief on a second or successive petition where government made the "exceedingly rare" concession that Miller applied retroactively). State attorneys general have made similar concessions.31 The federal and state governments' "exceedingly rare" decisions to concede the retroactivity of a rule favoring prisoners, in addition to the number of states expressly holding that Miller applies retroactively,30 See, e.g., Johnson v. United States, 720 F.3d 720, 720 (8th Cir. 2013) ("The government here has conceded that Miller is retroactive . . . ."); Wang v. United States, No. 13­2426 (2d Cir. July 16, 2013) (unpublished) (relying in part on the government's concession to certify a second or successive habeas petition based on Miller).31 See, e.g., People v. Tate, --- P. 3d ---, 2015 WL 3452609, at *22, 2015 Colo. 42, ¶ 104 (Colo. June 1, 2015) (Hood., J. dissenting) (recognizing that "[w]hile such a concession is not binding on this court, it is certainly telling").29supports the conclusion that government interests are not unduly harmed by giving juvenile offenders the benefit of the rule in Miller no matter when their sentences were imposed.Most state courts that have addressed the issue agree that Miller applies retroactively.32 To date, the highest courts of twelve states have ruled that Miller applies retroactively,33 and the resentencing process under Miller has commenced in those states.Moreover, states have demonstrated that they are equipped to handle the changes required by Miller without undue disruption to the criminal justice system. For example, as one of Florida's appellate courts noted, the burden of resentencing its 266 defendants "will not be onerous in terms of determining what sentence to impose as the appellate courts [in Florida] are already addressing the issue for defendants whose sentences were32 See People v. Tate, 2015 Colo. 42, at ¶ 103 (Hood., J. dissenting).33 Kelley v. Gordon, 2015 Ark. 277, 6 (Ark. June 18, 2015); Casiano v. Comm'r of Correction, 317 Conn. 52 (May 26, 2015); Falcon v.

Ragland, 836 N.W.2d 107, 117 (Iowa 2013).30pending when Miller was issued."34 In fact, Florida is now using a discretionary sentencing scheme.35 In interpreting Florida's post-Miller legislation to apply retroactively, the Florida Supreme Court made clear that a life without parole sentence will rarely be warranted for a juvenile offender and that such sentences must be reviewed critically to be faithful to Miller.36Illinois, too, has already begun holding resentencing hearings in accordance with Miller. In fact, one petitioner, Addolfo Davis, was given a resentencing hearing, and then re-sentenced to a term of life in prison without the possibility of parole.37 As evidenced by the court's sentencing order, individuals who were mandatorily sentenced to life without parole can conceivably receive that same sentence upon resentencing, but only after the judge has considered the mitigating factors of youth and the juvenile offender's proven capacity to change in accordance with Miller.In addition, states have legislative options available to provide opportunities for subsequent judicial review of sentences or parole hearings after a34 Toye v. Florida, No. 2D12­5605 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. Jan. 22, 2014). 35 Laws of Florida, Chapter 2014-220(b)(1).36 Horsley v. Florida, 160 So. 3d 393, 405, (Fla. 2015). 37 Resentencing Order, People v. Davis, No. 91CR-03548 (Ill. Cir. Ct. Cook Cnty. May 4, 2015).31set number of years38 for most juvenile offenders convicted of homicide.39 Those new laws are already being applied retroactively to juvenile offenders currently serving life without parole sentences.40As the experiences of these states illustrate, there are many ways in which a State can ensure that individuals who are serving sentences of mandatory life without parole receive a "meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation." Id. at 2469 (quoting Graham, 130 S. Ct. at 2030). The minimal burden associated with a court's provision of the resentencing determinations is outweighed by the interests of the discrete population of juvenile offenders who are currently serving a sentence that the State may not constitutionally impose after Miller. This Court should hold that Miller set out a substantive rule that applies retroactively, and that38 The ABA takes no position in this brief on what is a reasonable length of time before judicial sentence reviews or parole hearings are given to juvenile offenders, or whether any of the laws cited in this section adequately respond to Miller's directives.39 See 11 Del. Code § 4204A(d); Cal. Pen. Code § 1170(d)(2)(A); Fla. Stat. § 921.1402(2)(a); W.V. Code § 61-11-23(b); Wyo. Stat. § 6-10-301(c).40 79 Laws of Del. 2013 § 7; see also Wyant v.

I. TEXAS'S STANDARDS FOR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY CONTRADICT ESTABLISHED CLINICAL STANDARDS IN VIOLATION OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENTA. Texas's Briseno Standard Contravenes Clinical Standards For Diagnosing Intellectual DisabilityIn Atkins, this Court cited clinical, scientifically based standards as the proper measure of whether a criminal defendant is intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for execution under the Eighth Amendment. Specifically, this Court endorsed the AAMR's threepart definition of intellectual disability: "`[1] significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, [2] existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas ... [3] manifest[ing] before age 18.'" Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 308 n.3 (2002) (quoting AAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992) (1992 AAMR Manual)).4 In Hall4 Since Atkins, the AAMR has changed its name to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, or AAIDD, to be consistent with the change in terminology from "mental retardation" to "intellectual disability." The basic definition of intellectual disability, however, has remained the same. The current AAIDD manual explains that "[i]ntellectual disability is characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, social,8v. Florida, this Court reaffirmed that "clinical definitions of intellectual disability ... were a fundamental premise of Atkins," and rejected as inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment an approach to assessing intellectual disability that "disregard[ed] established medical practice," thereby creating an unacceptable "risk[] [of] executing a person who suffers from intellectual disability." 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1995, 1999, 2001 (2014).Notwithstanding Atkins and Hall, the CCA in this case expressly rejected established clinical standards for diagnosing intellectual disability. Indeed, the CCA overturned the trial court's finding that Moore has an intellectual disability on the ground that the court had erred by relying on current clinical standards for determining intellectual disability. Pet. App. 5a-12a. Stating that "the mental-health fields and opinions of mental-health experts ... do not determine whether an individual is exempt from execution under Atkins," the CCA held that courts were required to abide by the standards for intellectual disability that it had established in Ex parte Briseno and were prohibited from relying on current clinical standards. Pet. App.7a.5Briseno purported to adopt the standard for intellectual disability set out in the AAMR's 1992 manualand practical adaptive skills" and "originates before age 18." AAIDD, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 1 (11th ed. 2010) (AAIDD Manual); see also APA, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 37 (5th ed. 2013) (DSM-5) ("[t]he essential features of intellectual disability ... are deficits in general mental abilities ... and impairment in everyday adaptive functioning," with onset "during the developmental period").5 The Texas legislature has never enacted a statute implementing Atkins, so there is no statutory definition of intellectual disability for purposes of capital punishment. Pet. App. 7a.9and quoted in Atkins, requiring "significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning ... accompanied by related limitations in adaptive functioning." 135 S.W.3d 1, 7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). But while it paid lip service to Atkins, Briseno immediately proceeded to rewrite the standard for assessing limitations in adaptive behavior, rejecting clinical standards in the process. As Atkins noted, the AAMR's 1992 manual explained that limitations in adaptive behavior mean deficits in two or more of the following areas: "`communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, self-direction, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.'" 536 U.S. at 308 n.3 (quoting 1992 AAMR Manual); see also id. (reciting the APA's materially identical criteria). The current AAIDD manual frames the inquiry as whether a person has significant limitations in one of three broader domains--conceptual, social, or practical adaptive behavior. AAIDD Manual 43; see also DSM5 at 37 ("Adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning in three domains: conceptual, social, and practical.").6 But the basic idea remains the same: Each of the former ten skill areas is "conceptually linked" to one or more of the broader domains. AAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 81 (10th ed. 2002). Critically, a person's particular strengths are irrelevant to the inquiry: An individual with intellectual disability may well possess6 "Conceptual skills" include "language; reading and writing; and money, time, and number concepts"; "[s]ocial skills" include "interpersonal skills, social responsibility, self-esteem, gullibility, ... and social problem solving"; and "[p]ractical skills" include "activities of daily living ..., occupational skills, use of money, safety, health care, travel/transportation, schedules/routines, and use of the telephone." AAIDD Manual 44 (italics omitted).10some adaptive skills, but the condition is--and has long been--defined by limitations in adaptive behavior. AAIDD Manual 47; see also 1992 AAMR Manual 1 ("Specific adaptive limitations often coexist with strengths in other adaptive skills or other personal capabilities[.]").Briseno expressly rejected those established clinical criteria for assessing adaptive behavior, opining-- without support--that they were "exceedingly subjective." 135 S.W.3d at 8. Instead, Briseno instructed courts to employ seven non-clinical factors for assessing adaptive behavior:[1] Did those who knew the person best during the developmental stage--his family, friends, teachers, employers, authorities--think he was mentally retarded at that time, and, if so, act in accordance with that determination?[2] Has the person formulated plans and carried them through or is his conduct impulsive?[3] Does his conduct show leadership or does it show that he is led around by others?[4] Is his conduct in response to external stimuli rational and appropriate, regardless of whether it is socially acceptable?[5] Does he respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral or written questions or do his responses wander from subject to subject?[6] Can the person hide facts or lie effectively in his own or others' interests?[7] Putting aside any heinousness or gruesomeness surrounding the capital offense, did the commission of that offense require fore-11thought, planning, and complex execution of purpose?Id. at 8-9.These factors are scientifically bankrupt. Tellingly, they "are absent from other areas of Texas law" concerning intellectual-disability determinations. ABA Texas Assessment 396. And Briseno offered no authority supporting their use in any context. To the contrary, the court acknowledged that the factors diverge from established medical practice, opining that it is "understandable that those in the mental health profession should define mental retardation broadly," but that Texas citizens might not agree that all persons who meet clinically based "definition[s] of mental retardation" should be exempt from the death penalty. 135 S.W.3d at 6; see also Ex parte Van Alstyne, 239 S.W.3d 815, 820 & n.29 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (per curiam) (Briseno factors are "non-diagnostic").As the ABA has documented, the Briseno factors contravene clinical standards for diagnosing intellectual disability in several ways.1. Reliance on lay stereotypes. The Briseno factors reflect lay stereotypes rather than objective medical diagnosis. The first factor alone--whether family, friends, and other laypeople believed the defendant had an intellectual disability as a child--allows the opinions of those without training to displace those of medical professionals. It should go without saying that, "[w]hile laypersons may be able to provide descriptions of the defendant's behavior that are relevant to a mental retardation diagnosis, they are not qualified to make this diagnosis themselves." ABA Texas Assessment 396; see also Ellis, Mental Retardation and the Death Penalty: A Guide to State Legislative Issues, 27 Mental12& Physical Disability L. Rep. 11, 13 n.29 (2003) ("[T]hat an individual possesses one or more [skills] that might be thought by some laypersons [to be] inconsistent with the diagnosis (such as holding a menial job, or using public transportation) cannot be taken as disqualifying.").The other factors similarly reflect lay conceptions of the intellectually disabled that have no scientific basis. For example, the fourth factor, which asks whether the defendant can respond rationally to external stimuli, reflects the misconception that a person with intellectual disability is categorically incapable of reacting sensibly to his or her environment. Yet according to the DSM-5, some intellectually disabled individuals "may function age-appropriately in personal care," possess "[r]ecreational skills resembl[ing] age-mates," and pursue "competitive employment ... in jobs that do not emphasize conceptual skills." DSM-5 at 34; see also Richardson et al., Patterns of Leisure Activities of Young Adults with Mild Mental Retardation, 97 Am. J. Mental Retardation 431, 433, 440 (1993) (study of young adults with intellectual disability, some of whom had jobs, were married, and had children).The fifth factor, which asks whether a defendant can respond coherently to questioning, assumes that people with intellectual disability must lack normal language skills, another lay misconception. Research predating Atkins has shown that, for the most part, persons with intellectual disability have qualitatively normal syntax, vocabulary, and grammar. Fowler, Language Abilities in Children with Down Syndrome, in Children with Down Syndrome: A Developmental Perspective 302 (Cicchetti & Beeghly eds., 1990) ("the language structures that are acquired by children with Down Syndrome ... [are] normal and unremarkable in the order of their appearance"); Kamhi & Johnston,13Towards an Understanding of Retarded Children's Linguistic Deficiencies, 25 J. Speech & Hr'g Res. 435, 444 (1982) (language abilities of children with intellectual disability are comparable to normal children's).The sixth factor similarly treats the ability to lie as inconsistent with intellectual disability, but the capacity for deceptive behavior in some persons with intellectual disability is well-documented. E.g., Sodian & Frith, Deception and Sabotage in Autistic, Retarded and Normal Children, 33 J. Child. Psychol. & Psychiatry 591, 601 [year] (task in which "children had to tell a simple lie to prevent an opponent from winning a reward ... was easily passed by almost all normal 4-year olds and by all retarded children with a mental age of about 5 years"). The Briseno factors thus allow the determination of intellectual disability to turn on lay conceptions of a host of behaviors (rationality, intelligibility, lying) that have minimal or no relevance to a clinical diagnosis of intellectual disability.2. Improper consideration of adaptive strengths. The Briseno factors improperly emphasize adaptive strengths. They assume that a person does not have intellectual disability if he or she exhibits certain skills or capacities, regardless of how significant his or her deficits may be in other areas of functioning. Accepted clinical standards, on the other hand, focus on deficits: "Individuals with an [intellectual disability] typically demonstrate both strengths and limitations in adaptive behavior. Thus, in the process of diagnosing [intellectual disability], significant limitations in conceptual, social, or practical adaptive skills are not outweighed by the potential strengths in some adaptive skills." AAIDD Manual 47; see also Brumfield v. Cain, 135 S. Ct. 2269, 2281 (2015) (citing clinical guidance explaining14that "intellectually disabled persons may have `strengths in ... some adaptive skill areas'").3. Failure to focus on typical performance. The Briseno factors encourage the factfinder to focus on the crime itself, rather than the individual's typical performance in ordinary settings, which is the focus of the clinical diagnostic inquiry. Gallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757, 777 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) ("[M]any of the Briseno factors pertain to the facts of the offense and the defendant's behavior before and after the commission of the offense."). The seventh factor, for instance, deals only with the nature of the offense, and it can override a firmly established clinical diagnosis of intellectual disability. Ex parte Sosa, 364 S.W.3d 889, 893-896 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (reversing and remanding finding that defendant had intellectual disability because, although trial court made findings on the first six factors, it did not make findings regarding the seventh factor).This emphasis on the offense itself contravenes the longstanding clinical recognition that adaptive functioning concerns "the collection of conceptual, social, and practical skills that have been learned and are performed by people in their everyday lives." AAIDD Manual 43 (emphasis added). Accordingly, "[t]he assessment of adaptive behavior focuses on the individual's typical performance." Id. at 47. Indeed, the AAIDD specifically prohibits using "past criminal behavior" as a measure of adaptive behavior. AAIDD, User's Guide: Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 20 (2012); see also id. ("The diagnosis of [intellectual disability] is not based on the person's `street smarts,' behavior in jail or prison, or `criminal adaptive functioning.'").154. Failure to recognize that other mental disorders do not preclude intellectual disability. Briseno assumes that intellectual disability is incompatible with other mental disorders, such as personality disorder; indeed, the Briseno factors purportedly permit factfinders to determine whether a defendant has "mental retardation or ... a personality disorder." 135 S.W.3d. at 8 (emphasis added). But intellectual disability and personality disorder are not mutually exclusive. Even before Atkins, the medical community understood that "[i]ndividuals with [m]ental [r]etardation have a prevalence of comorbid mental disorders that is estimated to be three to four times greater than the general population." APA, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 42 (4th ed. 1994) (DSM-IV); see also DSM-5 at 40 (similar). For that reason, clinicians follow the rule that a diagnosis of intellectual disability "should be made whenever the diagnostic criteria are met, regardless of and in addition to the presence of another disorder." DSM-IV at 45.In short, Briseno is not remotely consistent with the accepted clinical approach to diagnosing intellectual disability. As the ABA found in its assessment of Texas's administration of the death penalty, Briseno's "interpretation of the adaptive behavior component diverges significantly from the AAIDD standard," and "in many cases the Briseno factors have been used to overrule clinical adaptive functioning assessments that indicate the defendant has mental retardation." ABA Texas Assessment 392, 397.The Briseno factors thus exclude from the protection of Atkins many defendants who meet the clinical criteria for an intellectual disability. See Blume et al., A Tale of Two (and Possibly Three) Atkins: Intellectual Disability and Capital Punishment Twelve Years After16the Supreme Court's Creation of A Categorical Bar, 23 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts. J. 393, 397, 413 (2014) (pre-Hall analysis finding that average national success rate for Atkins claims was 55%, whereas rate in Texas was roughly 18%); see also Lizcano v. State, 2010 WL 1817772, at *35 (Tex. Crim. App. May 5, 2010) (Price, J., concurring and dissenting) ("[Briseno factors] grant ... latitude to fact-finders in Texas to adjust the clinical criteria for adaptive deficits to conform to their own normative judgments with respect to which mentally retarded offenders are deserving of the death penalty and which are not."). Indeed, as discussed further below, Briseno was designed to do just that, ensuring that only defendants with intellectual disabilities that conform to lay stereotypes--rather than all defendants with intellectual disabilities--are exempt from execution.B. Texas's Non-Clinical Standard For Determining Intellectual Disability Is Unconstitutional Under Atkins And HallTexas's anti-clinical approach rests on a faulty understanding of Atkins. That case established a categorical rule: The death penalty cannot be imposed on any person with an intellectual disability, as determined by clinical standards. Atkins, 536 U.S. at 318 (noting several reasons why "the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution"); see also Hall, 134 S. Ct. at 1992 ("The Eighth Amendment prohibits certain punishments as a categorical matter. ... [P]ersons with intellectual disability may not be executed."); see supra pp. 7-8.Yet the Texas courts have refused to recognize this basic holding. To the contrary, Briseno opined that Atkins had not established "a `mental retardation' brightline exemption from [Texas's] maximum statutory pun-17ishment," and that the court's task was accordingly to "define that level and degree of mental retardation at which a consensus of Texas citizens would agree that a person should be exempted from the death penalty." 135 S.W.3d at 6. The court posited that "[m]ost Texas citizens might agree that Steinbeck's Lennie"--a fictional character from the 1937 novel Of Mice and Men--should be exempt from the death penalty. Id. But the court suggested that other persons with intellectual disabilities should not be. Id. at 5-6. And Texas courts have so interpreted Briseno. See, e.g., Sosa, 364 S.W.3d at 892 (opining that "whether a defendant is mentally retarded for particular clinical purposes" is not dispositive). That approach cannot be squared with Atkins and Hall, which brook no distinctions among persons with intellectual disabilities for Eighth Amendment purposes.Given this misunderstanding of Atkins, Texas courts have deemed it unnecessary to adhere to clinical standards. But "[c]linical definitions of intellectual disability ... were a fundamental premise of Atkins." Hall, 134 S. Ct. at 1999; see also id. at 2000 ("The legal determination of intellectual disability ... is informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework."). States have no license to ignore clinical standards. Although Atkins "`le[ft] to the State[s] the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction,'" 536 U.S. at 317, States cannot, in developing these procedures, rely on standards that permit the execution of persons who would satisfy the clinical standards Atkins explicitly endorsed.Accordingly, in Hall, this Court held that Florida's standard for evaluating the first prong of the diagnostic framework--"`significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,'" 134 S. Ct. at 1994--contravened18the Eighth Amendment because it "disregard[ed] established medical practice" concerning the use of the standard error of measurement to evaluate IQ test scores. Id. at 1995; see also id. at 2001 ("Florida's rule is in direct opposition to the views of those who design, administer, and interpret the IQ test."). As the Court explained, "[i]f the States were to have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished, the Court's decision in Atkins could become a nullity, and the Eighth Amendment's protection of human dignity would not become a reality." Id. at 1999. Texas's approach produces precisely that result.II. TEXAS IS AN OUTLIER IN REFUSING TO PROVIDE THE PROTECTION OF ATKINS TO ALL PERSONS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIESTexas is an outlier among the States in using an expressly anti-clinical standard--one that deliberately excludes most people with intellectual disabilities--to determine whether a person is ineligible for the death penalty under Atkins. That isolation is significant: Where "the vast majority of States" have rejected the use of a particular procedure or standard in imposing the death penalty, that is "strong evidence of consensus that our society does not regard [it] as proper or humane." Hall, 134 S. Ct. at 1998.Moreover, as the ABA has documented, Texas's aberrant approach creates "a significant risk that persons with mental retardation remain on Texas's death row, and perhaps have been executed." ABA Texas Assessment 397. Texas's rejection of clinical standards has led Texas courts to impose the death penalty on defendants with intellectual disabilities whom other jurisdictions almost certainly would have recognized as exempt from the death penalty under Atkins. That19discrepancy is unacceptable. See Hall, 134 S. Ct. at 2001 (Florida's strict IQ cutoff constitutionally invalid in light of "risk[] [of] executing a person who suffers from intellectual disability").A. Other States Have Rejected Briseno And Acknowledged That Atkins And Hall Require Using Clinical Standards For Intellectual DisabilityNo other State uses anything like the Briseno factors to define adaptive functioning. Tobolowsky, A Different Path Taken: Texas Capital Offenders' PostAtkins Claims of Mental Retardation, 39 Hastings Const. L.Q. 1, 139-140, 142 (2011). To the contrary, through legislation and judicial rulings, numerous States have endorsed the use of clinical standards for determining intellectual disability.As this Court observed in Atkins, 536 U.S. at 317 n.22, many death-penalty jurisdictions have enacted legislation requiring the application of standards that "generally conform to the clinical definitions" in assessing whether a capital defendant is ineligible for the death penalty due to intellectual disability. See, e.g., Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 4209(d)(3)(d)(1); Idaho Code § 19-2515A(1)(a); Mo. Rev. Stat. § 565.030(6); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 15A-2005(a)(1)(b); Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 701.10b(A)(2); Ybarra v. State, 247 P.3d 269, 273-275 & n.6 (Nev. 2011) (discussing Nev. Rev. Stat. § 174.098(7)); Bowling v. Commonwealth, 163 S.W.3d 361, 369-370 & n.8 (Ky. 2005) (discussing Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 532.130(2)).7 Some go even further: Virginia7 Many of these statutes, including Delaware's and Idaho's, were revised immediately after Atkins to incorporate the AAMR's standard for evaluating adaptive functioning. See, e.g., Tobolowsky, Atkins Aftermath: Identifying Mentally Retarded Of-20requires not only a clinical definition, but also--where feasible--the use of a standardized clinical assessment to evaluate adaptive functioning. Va. Code Ann. § 19.2264.3:1.1(B)(2).Numerous other States have adopted or reinforced clinical standards by judicial decision. See, e.g., Chase v. State, 171 So. 3d 463, 470, 481-486 (Miss. 2015); State v. White, 885 N.E.2d 905, 907-908 (Ohio 2008); Blonner v. State, 127 P.3d 1135, 1140 (Okla. Crim. App. 2006); see also, e.g., Holladay v. Allen, 555 F.3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir. 2009) (applying Alabama case law).Federal courts have embraced clinical standards in interpreting federal law as well. Numerous federal courts since Atkins have held that the clinical definition of intellectual disability (and, specifically, of adaptive functioning) controls the analysis under 18 U.S.C. § 3596(c), the federal prohibition on execution of the intellectually disabled. E.g., United States v. Webster, 421 F.3d 308, 313 & n.14 (5th Cir. 2005); United States v. Wilson, 2016 WL 1060245, at *3-7, *15-19 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2016); United States v. Davis, 611 F. Supp. 2d 472, 475-477 (D. Md. 2009); see also, e.g., Ortiz v. United States, 664 F.3d 1151, 1157-1158 (8th Cir. 2011) (noting use of clinical standards).Courts outside of Texas have not only embraced current clinical standards; they have also repeatedly rejected Texas's outlier approach to evaluating adaptive behavior.Some have done so explicitly. In Van Tran v. Colson, 764 F.3d 594, 608-612 (6th Cir. 2014), the Sixth Circuit held that the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appealsfenders and Excluding Them from Execution, 30 J. Legis. 77, 9293 & n.95 (2003).21had unreasonably found that a habeas petitioner did not have intellectual disability when that court--relying on Texas's Briseno factors, see Van Tran v. State, 2006 WL 3327828, at *23-25 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 9, 2006)--rejected clinical evidence and instead emphasized the petitioner's adaptive strengths and the facts of the crime. The Sixth Circuit explained that this Court's precedent "requires the courts and legislatures to follow clinical practices in defining intellectual disability." 764 F3.d at 612; see also United States v. Candelario-Santana, 916 F. Supp. 2d 191, 212 (D.P.R. 2013) (in federal case, rejecting request to apply Briseno and explaining that, although some Briseno factors were "logical considerations" to the extent they were "consistent with the clinical definitions cited in Atkins," others "track the Atkins criteria less closely"); United States v. Montgomery, 2014 WL 1516147, at *48 (W.D. Tenn. Jan. 28, 2014) ("The Court finds the approach of other federal courts that have adhered mainly to the language found in the clinical literature, as opposed to the Briseno factors, more appropriate.").8Where state and federal appellate courts do not expressly disclaim Briseno, they have criticized or reversed intellectual-disability decisions that have relied on lay stereotypes or focused on adaptive strengths rather than deficits. These courts have stressed the importance of adhering to clinical guidance to ensure accuracy in diagnosing intellectual disability. For example, contrary to Texas's approach, courts have recognized that adaptive deficits often coexist with strengths8 Even in Pennsylvania, the one jurisdiction that had cited Briseno positively, the state supreme court recently declined to apply the Briseno factors in a capital appeal. Commonwealth v. Bracey, 117 A.3d 270, 287 (Pa. 2015).22and that a defendant's possession of adaptive skills in some areas is "in no way inconsistent with" a diagnosis of intellectual disability. White, 885 N.E.2d at 914; see also, e.g., Van Tran, 764 F.3d at 608-609; Sasser v. Hobbs, 735 F.3d 833, 845 (8th Cir. 2013); Holladay, 555 F.3d at 1363; Lambert v. State, 126 P.3d 646, 651 (Okla. Crim. App. 2005). Courts outside of Texas have also rejected reliance on the lay stereotypes that Texas encourages factfinders to consider. See, e.g., Thomas v. Allen, 607 F.3d 749, 759 (11th Cir. 2010); Van Tran, 764 F.3d at 612; White, 885 N.E.2d at 915.Texas thus stands apart: No other jurisdiction has devised an avowedly anti-clinical standard that erects a barrier to finding intellectual disability even when a medical professional applying clinical standards would reach that diagnosis.B. Texas's Approach Permits The Execution Of Individuals Who Would Not Be Eligible For The Death Penalty Under Clinical StandardsTexas's aberrant approach is starkly illustrated by the Texas defendants who have been sentenced to die based on the Briseno factors despite strong evidence of intellectual disability under a clinical analysis.To take just a few examples, Elroy Chester, Marvin Lee Wilson, and Juan Lizcano--whose cases were documented by the ABA's Texas death penalty assessment report--each demonstrated strong clinical evidence of intellectual disability, yet each was denied relief. And, if Texas's approach is not corrected, the same will be true of Bobby James Moore.231. Elroy Chester.9 In Ex parte Chester, 2007 WL 602607, *2-3 (Tex. Crim. App. Feb 28, 2007), the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals--relying entirely on trial court findings with respect to the Briseno factors-- upheld a finding that Chester had not demonstrated significant limitations in adaptive behavior. Although the State's expert acknowledged that "a person with [his scores] ... would properly be diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded," id. at *3, the court focused on Chester's adaptive strengths, not the extent of his adaptive weaknesses, id. at *4, *5 (Chester was "capable of learning if given proper teaching methods" and able to "converse ... coherently on a wide variety of topics," "capable of hiding facts and lying to protect his own interests," and "capable of forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose"). The court also gave substantial weight to Chester's conduct during the commission of the capital crime, noting, for example, that Chester had attempted to conceal his crime by wearing a mask and gloves. Id. at *5-9.Applying clinical standards in Chester's case instead of focusing narrowly on the facts of the crime would likely have led to a different result. Indeed, while the facts of the murder formed the bulk of the Texas court's analysis, Chester's offense conduct was significantly less sophisticated than similarly situated capital defendants in other States who were found intellectually disabled under a proper clinical analysis. See, e.g., Hughes v. Epps, 694 F. Supp. 2d 533, 536 (N.D. Miss. 2010) (ignoring the fact that Hughes concealed the body when determining adaptive limitations); Holladay v. Campbell, 463 F. Supp. 2d 1324,9 Chester's case is discussed at ABA Texas Assessment 397398.241339, 1346-1347 (N.D. Ala. 2006) (finding deficits in adaptive behavior notwithstanding that the crime demonstrated "premeditation and strategic planning"), aff'd, 555 F.3d 1346 (11th Cir. 2009).2. Juan Lizcano.10 Two psychologists who had evaluated Juan Lizcano agreed that his IQ scores were consistently in the 40s, 50s, or 60s and that he was intellectually disabled based on adaptive deficits in communication, self-care, and functional academics. Lizcano, 2010 WL 1817772, at *12-15. One expert observed that, "`[w]hile [Lizcano] possesses some adaptive strengths, this does not negate the evidence of his possessing adaptive deficits.'" Id. at*36 (Price, J., concurring and dissenting). Testimony from Lizcano's friends, family, and employer corroborated these deficits. Lizcano did not understand jokes and usually watched children's TV programs. Id. at *13-14. According to a girlfriend, Lizcano could not clean himself or take thorough showers, and would wear ill-fitting clothing--including a woman's blouse on one occasion--and had to be prompted to brush his teeth. Id. at *38 (Price, J., concurring and dissenting). Lizcano struggled to learn basic tasks and could not read a clock or operate a VCR. Id. at *15. A coworker noted that Lizcano was the only person he had ever trained who could not learn how to use a tape measure or a saw. Id. at *14.The prosecution offered no expert testimony to rebut the defense's clinicians. Lizcano, 2010 WL 1817772, at *10. However, applying Briseno, the court found that10 Lizcano's case is discussed at ABA Texas Assessment 398399.25(i) [Lizcano] maintained continuous employment and was recognized by his employers as a hard and reliable worker; (ii) ... made regular payments on a vehicle he purchased as a cobuyer; (iii) ... maintained romantic relationships with at least two women, neither of whom considered him to be mentally retarded and one of whom considered him to be "bright"; and (iv) ... reliably sent significant amounts of money and other items to assist his family.Id. at *15.None of this evidence forecloses a finding of intellectual disability under any scientifically valid test of intellectual disability. The evidence used to determine Lizcano's Atkins claim all related to his supposed strengths, not his deficits. And even if "a person's strengths in a particular domain [are] relevant to whether the individual has significant limitations in that particular area[,]" Wiley v. Epps, 668 F. Supp. 2d 848, 902 (N.D. Miss. 2009), the court in Lizcano's case never discussed how any of the evidence before it rebutted the deficits in Lizcano's communication and functional academics. Lizcano was sentenced to death even though defendants with intellectual disability outside of Texas have both managed money and held far more difficult jobs. E.g., Wiley v. Epps, 625 F.3d 199, 217 (5th Cir. 2010) (defendant who was able to hold down a job, serve in the military, and provide for a family was nonetheless held to have intellectual disability); Holladay, 463 F. Supp. 2d at 1339, 1346-1347 (buying and selling cars and spending frugally while on the run did not preclude an intellectual disability).263. Marvin Lee Wilson.11 Wilson presented the trial court with significant evidence of adaptive behavior limitations. Wilson v. Quarterman, 2009 WL 900807, at *8 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 31, 2009). His expert witness "testified that [his] composite score of 44 on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Skill Test was well within retarded range." Id. The expert's determination was supported by "affidavits from friends and family members attesting to his difficulties in written communication and understanding money management concepts, his inability to get along with others and avoid being victimized, and his problems with personal hygiene and maintaining employment." Id. A childhood friend, for instance, said that Wilson "`would put on his belt so tight that it would almost cut off his circulation'" and that "`[h]e couldn't even play with simple toys like marbles or tops.'" Liptak, Date Missed, Court Rebuffs Low-I.Q. Man Facing Death, N.Y. Times, Dec. 17, 2005, at A14. The state presented no evidence in rebuttal. Id. Instead, it argued that Atkins "`was never intended to protect capital murderers who commit executionstyle killings.'" Id.Nevertheless, a Texas court found that Wilson did not have an intellectual disability. As the federal habeas court later explained, "the state court relied on the Briseno factors alone, rather than as a supplement to clinical factors, in determining" that Wilson did not have "related, significant deficits in adaptive functioning." Wilson, 2009 WL 900807, at *7. The state court's findings were "based on the view that the Briseno factors can be used by themselves to establish whether a person has significant deficits in adaptive functioning,11 Wilson's case is discussed at ABA Texas Assessment 399400.27even if evidence is submitted which is relevant to the AAMR definition of adaptive deficits." Id. at *8. The court "did not make explicit findings and reached no explicit conclusion as to whether Wilson had significant limitations in adaptive functioning." Id. at *7. Instead, the court relied on the Briseno factors as a checklist and applied the factors in place of clinical standards. E.g., id. ("Wilson was capable of lying and hiding facts when he felt it was in his best interest; and that the crime at issue showed deliberate forethought, planning, and execution of purpose.").12Wilson's Atkins claim was thus denied largely on the strength of evidence relating to his crime itself-- evidence that was sufficient under Briseno, but that is the antithesis of clinical analysis of adaptive behavior. Such evidence would barely have been probative, let alone dispositive, outside of Texas. Lying and hiding facts are commonplace aspects of capital crimes, whether or not the defendant has intellectual disability. See, e.g., Nicholson v. Branker, 739 F. Supp. 2d 839, 847 (E.D.N.C. 2010); Hughes, 694 F. Supp. 2d at 564.4. Bobby James Moore. In this case, the Texas trial court relied on the AAIDD's current standard for diagnosing intellectual disability in granting relief to Moore. Pet. App. 201a-203a; see also Pet. Br. 4-6, 10-17 (describing evidence of Moore's intellectual disability12 The district court denied federal habeas relief even after finding that Wilson had "presented evidence of significant limitations in all three areas of adaptive functioning: the conceptual domain, the social domain, and the practical domain." Wilson, 2009 WL 900807, at *8. It did so because it felt bound to follow the state court's factual findings and adherence to Briseno. Id. In an unpublished opinion, the Fifth Circuit later declined to hold that use of the Briseno factors violates Atkins. Wilson v. Thaler, 450 F. App'x 369, 377 (5th Cir. 2011).28and trial court's analysis). The court found that Moore's IQ test scores, which averaged slightly over 70, established that he has significant limitations in intellectual functioning. Pet. App. 167a. It credited the testimony of Moore's expert witnesses that he "has significant deficits in adaptive functioning in the conceptual, social and practical realms that place him approximately two standard deviations below the mean," Pet. App. 201a, including inability to learn from experience, impaired reasoning and judgment, a tendency to be a follower, and difficulties communicating with others, JA11-12, 73-74, 80, 82-85. And it found ample evidence, including Moore's repeated school failures and the familial abuse he received as a child for being "dumb," that Moore's intellectual disability manifested before age 18. Pet. App. 182a-190a, 201a.The CCA, however, rejected the trial court's conclusion, reasoning that the court had erred by using the AAIDD's current standards for intellectual disability rather than the standards articulated in Briseno. Relying only on two of Moore's higher IQ test scores (disregarding the standard error of measurement because of Moore's "history of academic failure") and the fact that he was tested while on death row, it concluded that Moore had not proven significantly subaverage intellectual functioning. Pet. App. 74a-75a; but see Hall, 134 S. Ct. at 2001 (holding that "when a defendant's IQ test score falls within the test's ... margin of error, the defendant must be able to present additional evidence of intellectual disability, including testimony regarding adaptive deficits").The CCA then determined, based on the Briseno factors, that Moore had not shown significant deficits in adaptive functioning because, among other things, Moore had lived in the back of a pool hall, played pool,29mowed lawns for money, and adapted to the prison environment, Pet. App. 80a-88a--none of which is in any way inconsistent with a diagnosis of intellectual disability. Finally, the CCA concluded, with no evidentiary basis, that Moore's adaptive limitations were not "related" to his intellectual deficits, but were caused by other factors, including childhood abuse and academic failure, Pet. App. 88a-89a--factors that support a diagnosis of intellectual disability. For Moore, the CCA's refusal to abide by clinical standards for assessing intellectual disability could be the difference between a life sentence and the death penalty.* * *By prohibiting courts from using current clinical standards and instead requiring them to use the anticlinical Briseno standard, Texas has withdrawn the protections of Atkins from most defendants with intellectual disability. But, as this Court made clear in Atkins and Hall, all persons with intellectual disability, by definition, share characteristics that reduce their moral culpability and require their categorical exclusion from the death penalty. And intellectual disability is determined by reference to clinical standards. Texas's contrary approach cannot be tolerated under the Eighth Amendment.30 CONCLUSION The judgment should be reversed.Respectfully submitted.Of Counsel:PAULETTE BROWNDANIELLE SPINELLI
 I. MEANINGFUL REVIEW OF DETENTION ISFUNDAMENTAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. A. Habeas Corpus Is Deeply Rooted in theCommon Law and Our Constitutional Sys-tem. Habeas corpus, the principle that one should not beimprisoned by the Executive without fair and impartial judicial review to protect against arbitrary or unlawful government detention, is no less critical today than it was at the inception of our constitutional system. As the Founders recognized, habeas corpus is one of the "essential principles of our Government." Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural Address (Mar. 4, 1801), reprinted in Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States, S. Doc. No. 101-10, at 16 (1989). Alexander Hamilton described habeas corpus as "perhaps [a] greater securit[y] to liberty and republicanism than any [the Constitution] contains." The Federalist No. 84 (Alexander Hamilton).The modern understanding of habeas corpus throws its roots "deep into the genius of our common law." Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466, 473 (2004) (quoting Williams v. Kaiser, 323 U.S. 471, 484 n. 2 (1945)). The writ predates statute, and has existed in some form for over seven hundred years. See Henry de Bracton, De Legibus Et Consuetudinibus Anglice: Vol. 4:367 (Thorne Ed.) (containing a form for a writ of habeas corpus ad respondendum).The importance of the writ has left its mark on English and American history. The refusal of King Charles I to enforce the privilege of the writ was one of the causesthat eventually led to the English Civil War. See Petition of Right, 3 Car. 1c. 1 at § V. During the Protectorate following the English Civil War, prisoners were moved between jails or overseas to prevent service of habeas corpus petitions. See William Duker, A Constitutional History of Habeas Corpus 48-53 (1980). In 1667, Parliament impeached Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, for such acts. Duker, at 53 (quoting Proceedings in Parliament against Edward Earl of Clarendon, Lord High Chancellor of England, (1663-1667) 6 St. tr. 291).After the Restoration, when Charles IE authorized transfers of English subjects to military garrisons overseas, Parliament responded with the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, sometimes referred to as the "second Magna Carta" to prevent transfers of prisoners out of the jurisdiction of the habeas courts. See 31 Car. 2 c. 2, §§ x and xi.Particularly as applied to British subjects, there was no question that the power of the writ of habeas corpus extended overseas. In King v. Overton, 1 Sid. 387, 82 Eng. Rep. 1173 (K.B. 1668), and King v. Salmon, 2 Keble 450, 84 Eng. Rep. 282 (K.B. 1669), the writ of habeas corpus was held to run to the Island of Jersey, which was not part of the Realm of England, but was historically part of the Duchy of Normandy. Sir Matthew Hale, The History of the Common Law of England, 121 (C. Gray Ed. 1971); Charles Le Quesne, A Constitutional History of Jersey, 98 (1856). Sir Matthew Hale explained Overton and Salmon on the basis that "the King may demand, and must have an Account of the Cause of any of his Subjects' Loss of Liberty." Hale, supra, at 187.The founders of the United States were deeply aware of the importance of preserving the power of the judiciary to protect individual liberty. Having borne witness first hand to the abuses that can follow when the judiciary is rendered subordinate to executive power (see Declaration7of Independence), habeas corpus inthey saw fit to the Suspensionguarantee the right to Clause of the Constitu-tion. U.S. Const., Art. I § 9. The constitutional protectionof habeas corpus predates even the Due Process Clause ofthe Fifth Amendment."There is no higher duty than to maintain [the writ of habeas corpus] unimpaired." Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 485 (1969). As this Court has recognized, "[cJourts and their procedural safeguards are indispensable to our system of government. They were set up by our founders to protect the liberties they valued." Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U.S. 304, 322 (1946) (citing Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, 19 (1942)). Clearly, "the writ of habeas corpus is one of the pillars of our constitutional system."!!The importance of judicial review extends, perhaps especially, to detentions by military authorities. It would be "extremely dangerous to say, that because the prisoners were apprehended, not by a civil magistrate, but by the military power, there could be given by law a right to try the persons so seized in any place which the general might select, and to which he might direct them to be carried." Ex parte Bollman, 8 U.S. (4 Cranch) 75, 136 (1807).Indeed, "[a]t its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention, and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest." INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 301 (2001). As the ABA's Task Force on Enemy Combatants concluded, "indefinite detention, denial of counsel, and11 Habeas Corpus Rights for Detainees Fact Sheet, available at http://www.abanet.org/poladv/priorities/enemy /2007apr_habcorp_factsheet.pdf (last visited Feb. 3, 2008).overly secret proceedings could tear at the Bill of Rights, the very fabric of our great democracy."!2B. Due Process Requires That Every Detainee Be Informed of the Allegations Against Him and Afforded a Meaningful Opportunity to Challenge His Detention.The United States citizens in this case brought their habeas petitions to challenge their detention by United States military forces operating as part of the MultiNational Force -- Iraq. They brought their habeas petitions before the Iraqi courts were involved in any way, and their habeas petitions do not raise any challenges against Iraqi court procedures. Rather, these United States citizens are being held solely as a result of a determination by a panel of three American military officers that they are "enemy combatants" and "security intern-ees. "It is unclear what protections, if any, the prisoners received or what standards the panels applied in approving the prisoners' detentions. But it is undisputed that the habeas petitioners were not represented by counsel. They allege in their habeas petitions that they were not afforded due process, and those allegations have yet to be tested in court.Due process must be provided to ensure that every "citizen-detainee seeking to challenge his classification as an enemy combatant .. . receive notice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government's factual assertions before a neutral deci-12 Revised Report 109 (Feb. 10, 2003), available at http://www.abanet.org/leadership/recommendations03/109.pdf (ast visited Feb. 3, 2008).sionmaker." Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 533. Without judicial review to ensure that such process is actually provided, the vitality of constitutional rights lies entirely within the discretion of a single branch of government. That result is fundamentally contrary to the rule of law.The ABA does not take the position that a citizen may never be detained as an enemy combatant or transferred to the custody of a foreign government; however, the ABA continues respectfully to assert that due process must be provided to ensure that such detentions and transfers are according to law and not arbitrary. See ABA Amicus Brief, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, No. 03-6696 (U.S. Feb. 23, 2004). There can be no such inquiry without an opportunity for judicial inquiry into the process actually used.To be sure, the Executive is entitled to some deference with respect to actions taken pursuant to its constitutional responsibilities in the conduct of foreign affairs and as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. But such deference has never extended so far as to authorize Executive detentions of United States citizens without any judicial review. "While we accord the greatest respect and consideration to the judgments of military authorities in matters relating to the actual prosecution of a war, and recognize that the scope of that discretion necessarily is wide, it does not infringe on the core role of the military for the courts to exercise their own time-honored and constitutionally mandated role of reviewing and resolving claims like those presented here." Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 535. The judiciary must be empowered to honor its responsibilities "in time of war, as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty." Quirin, 317 U.S. at 19. The Constitution is this country's greatest strength, not its weakness. See Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2, 120-21 (1866).10Il. THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION WOULD UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. A. No Citizen Should Be Detained Based Solely upon Untested Allegations. At this preliminary stage, the issue before this Courtis not whether the habeas petitioners may be turned over to Iraqi authorities. Rather, the issue before this Court is whether the petitioners' habeas claims may be heard, and whether the district court can protect its jurisdiction by enjoining such a transfer while a habeas petition is pending.Both petitioners raised serious claims in their habeas petitions, each of which was filed before the Iraqi courts had any involvement. Both petitioners claim that they are United States citizens and that they have been seized and detained as alleged "enemy combatants" and "security internees" for more than two years by United States military forces without due process. They claim to be innocent of the underlying allegations of enemy belligerency or criminal activity. One claims that he will face torture if turned over to the Iraqi government. The other was condemned to death after his habeas petition was filed. Neither the habeas petitioners nor the habeas respondents have had the opportunity to test their assertions in court.The ABA takes no position with respect to the merits of the habeas petitioners' claims, but asserts that no citizen should be detained based solely upon untested allegations. "Any process in which the Executive's factual assertions go wholly unchallenged or are simply presumed correct without any opportunity for the alleged combatant to demonstrate otherwise falls constitutionally short." Hamad, 542 U.S. at 537.llB. Participation in a "Multinational Force" Should Not Defeat Jurisdiction over United States Officers.The government has taken the position that the federal courts have no jurisdiction to review detentions by United States military officers acting as part of the Multinational Force -- Iraq, and that, even if the courts have such jurisdiction, the government can defeat it unilaterally by transferring these detainees to the custody of a foreign government. The consequences of either of the government's positions would eviscerate the rule of law, which requires that judicial review must be available to prevent arbitrary or unlawful detention.The writ of habeas corpus does not act upon the detainee, but upon the custodian. This court has recognized that a writ of habeas corpus may properly issue if the custodian is within the jurisdiction of the court. See Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. at 481; Braden v. 80th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U.S. 484, 495 (1973). United States military members in the multinational force remain under the "unified command" (see Brief for the Federal Parties at 2) of United States government officials within the jurisdiction of the district court. If the government's position were adopted, and its participation as a part of a multinational force were deemed to immunize its actions from any judicial review, even when applied to United States citizens, such an argument would apply whether or not the detainee had been criminally charged, and whether or not the detainee had received any meaningful opportunity to challenge his detention. Such a result would directly contravene Hamdi, which held that a United States citizen detained by United States military authorities has the right to due process. See Hamdi, 542 US. at 533.The "multinational force' argument, further, could arguably apply whenever the United States cooperates with allies which, during the past century, has occurred in12nearly every prolonged military conflict in which it has been involved. But cooperation with allies should not be permitted to defeat the United States government's responsibilities to its citizens. "Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake." Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 536.In asserting that participation in a multinational force should not impair the jurisdiction of the federal courts over United States officials, the ABA in no way means to disparage the contributions of this country's allies in the United Nations or the efforts of the Iraqi people in restoring security and stability in Iraq. But the ABA knows, and has seen in its work in promoting the rule of law overseas, that a strong and independent court system in the United States with the power to hold even the military accountable to the Constitution can only promote this country's reputation abroad as a defender of liberty and the rule of law. Unreviewable military action is not consistent with American legal principles.C. A Subsequent Judgment of an Iraqi Court Should Not Affect the Jurisdiction of a United States Court over a Prior Habeas Petition of a United States Citizen.As noted earlier, the habeas petitions in these cases were filed before, not after, any action by the Iraqi government or its courts. Although jurisdiction was not invoked to review the judgment of the Iraqi courts, the D.C. Circuit panel in Munaf held that, in light of this Court's per curiam opinion in Hirota v. MacArthur, 338 U.S. 197 (1948), there is no jurisdiction because the prisoner was subsequently convicted by an Iraqi court. However, the panel also noted:13In holding that the district court lacks jurisdiction, we do not mean to suggest that we find the logic of Hirota especially clear or compelling, particularly as applied to American citizens. In particular, Hirota does not explain why, in cases such as this, the fact of a criminal conviction in a non-U.S. court is a fact of jurisdictional significance under the habeas statute. Munaf v. Geren, 482 F.3d 582, 584 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The panel majority, relying on its reading of Hirota, left to this Court "the prerogative of overruling its own decisions." Id. at 585 (quoting Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989)). Further, the D.C. Circuit's reading of the case was heavily influenced by its own prior opinion in Flick v. Johnson, 174 F.2d 983 (D.C. Cir. 1949). See Omar v. Harvey, 479 F.3d 1, 7 D.C. Cir. 2007). The government's assertion that there can be no habeas jurisdiction when the United States military is operating as part of a multinational force is not supported by the narrow language employed in Hirota, in which this Court held only that it lacked the power to review judgments against the petitioners under the circumstances of that case. Hirota, 338 U.S. at 198. Nothing in Hirota suggests that the Executive is free to detain a United States citizen and is not amenable to judicial review simply because it acts in concert with foreign governments. The United States has a special obligation under constitutional law for the protection of its citizens. See Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 5 (1957). It is for this reason that the Court has recognized that citizenship of the detainee can be a head of habeas corpus jurisdiction, even where the detention takes place within the territorial jurisdiction of a foreign country. See id.; see also Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 769 (1950) (`The years have not destroyed or diminished the importance of citizenship nor14have they sapped the vitality government for protection").of Aa citizen's claims upon his rule exempting detentionsof citizens overseas from judicial review would create pre-cisely the perverse incentive described by JusticeO'Connor in Hamdi:Military authorities faced with the stark choice of submitting to the full-blown criminal process or releasing a suspected enemy combatant captured on the battlefield will simply keep citizen-detainees abroad. ... It is not at all clear why [presence outside the United States] should make a determinative constitutional difference.Hamdi, 542 U.S. at 524.The government expresses concern that habeas corpus jurisdiction would conflict with the Iraqi government's "exclusive jurisdiction" to punish offenses that occur within its sovereign borders. As the ABA pointed out in its amicus brief filed in Boumediene, a distinction based on whether detentions by the United States military occurred within or outside of the United States would create a situation "where individual rights are not judicially enforceable, thus undermining the most fundamental attribute of the rule of law." Brief Amicus Curiae of the ABA, Boumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195 (Aug. 24, 2007) at 10. The ABA therefore respectfully asserts that the district court must have jurisdiction to review detentions of United States citizens by its military, regardless of the location of the detention.CONCLUSION The American Bar Association respectfully requests that the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Munaf v. Geren be reversed, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Omar v. Harvey be affirmed.15Of Counsel: DAVID J. CYNAMON MATTHEW J. MACLEAN DARON T. CARREIRORespectfully submitted,WILLIAM H. NEUKOM 
 I. The PTO's Proposed Interpretation of Section 145 Would Erect anInsurmountable Roadblock to Justice for Many Patent Applicants. Adopting the PTO's position will close the Section 145 avenue to many, if notmost, individuals, small businesses, and non-profit organizations. The implicationsof doing so are of grave concern to the ABA.Equal access to justice is not merely an aspiration, but the cornerstone of theAmerican justice system. As Justice Powell noted in an August 10, 1976, speechduring a program, at the 1976 ABA annual meeting, entitled "Legal ServicesCorporation: A Presidential Program of the Annual Meeting of the American Bar Association:3Equal justice under law is not merely a caption on the façade of the Supreme Court building; it is perhaps the most inspiring ideal of our society. It is one of the ends for which our entire legal system exists. It is fundamental that justice should be the same, in substance and availability, without regard to economic status. Critical to the notion of equal access is that those with fewer resources not bedissuaded from seeking redress from the courts by financial impediments to justice.It is pursuant to this principle that courts waive filing, court, and transcript fees for3 Justice Powell August 10, 1976, speech, pp. 2-3, found at: http://law2.wlu.edu/deptimages/powell%20archives/PowellSpeech_LegalServices CorporationAug10,1976.pdf6Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 14 Filed: 01/23/2018the indigent. See, e.g., Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17-18 (1956) ("Plainly, the ability to pay costs in advance bears no rational relationship to a defendant's guilt or innocence, and could not be used as an excuse to deprive a defendant of a fair trial."); Jafar v. Webb, 303 P.3d 1042 (Wash. 2013) (requiring waiver of all court fees and local surcharges for indigent litigants).Fee shifting is treated in a similar fashion, and it is usually permitted under statutes designed to increase access to justice, rather than limit it. Where Congress permits fee shifting by statute, it generally does so to correct an imbalance of power by permitting a successful plaintiff to collect attorneys' fees. Robert V. Percival & Geoffrey P. Miller, The Role of Attorney Fee Shifting in Public Interest Litigation, 47 Law and Contemporary Problems 233, 241 (Winter 1984) ("Fee shifting is designed to remove some of the disincentives facing public interest litigants, thus increasing access to the courts for groups who otherwise might be unrepresented or underrepresented."). For example, provisions in civil rights statutes, such as the Equal Justice Act, allow prevailing plaintiffs to obtain fees. See Pub. L. No. 96-481, 94 Stat. 2325 (1980) (at 28 U.S.C. § 2412 and 5 U.S.C. § 504). That Act levels the litigation playing field between the government, on the one hand, and individuals and small businesses, on the other. See H.R. Rep. No. 99-120 (I), p. 4 (1985) ("The Act reduces the disparity in resources between individuals, small businesses, and other organizations with limited resources and the Federal Government."). Indeed,7Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 15 Filed: 01/23/2018Congress has expressly articulated its concern that well-funded governmental agencies not target small businesses because of their inability to pay for expensive litigation. See H.R. Rep. No. 96-1418, p. 10 (1980) ("In fact, there is evidence that small businesses are the target of agency action precisely because they do not have the resources to fully litigate the issue" with the well-funded government.).Contrary to these foundational principles, the interpretation advocated by the PTO would shut the door to the Congressionally created Section 145 pathway for all except those who can afford to pay not only their own legal fees but also those of the federal government, and regardless of the outcome. The expenditures required of applicants to pursue actions to overcome adverse PTO decisions in district court are already high. Those plaintiffs must introduce new evidence and pay for experts and other expenses, as well as their own attorneys' fees. On top of the already high costs of a civil action, an additional hurdle of reimbursing the PTO for potentially tens of thousands of dollars in fees will be insurmountable for many applicants and a significant deterrent to even more of them. Applicants who lack sufficient funds to pay for their adversary's lawyers would be blocked from the benefits of the Section 145 pathway--including de novo review of the denial of their applications and the ability to introduce new evidence in district court--solely because of their inability to pay. This will disproportionately impact individuals, small businesses, and non-profit organizations. Meanwhile, those benefits would remain open to large8Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 16 Filed: 01/23/2018corporations and affluent individuals who can afford to shoulder the burden of paying for the government's lawyers.As a practical matter, the government's attorneys' fees in de novo actions can be substantial. A recent decision from the Eastern District of Virginia imposed attorneys' fees of $51,472.53 in a 15 U.S.C. § 1071(b)(3) trademark case--a case in which the applicant was successful. Booking.com B.V. v. Matal, No. 1:16-cv-00425LMB-IDD 2017 WL 4853755, at * 9 (E.D. Va. October 26, 2017) (basing its award on a salary chart prepared by the PTO). Another decision required the applicant to post a "conservative bond of $40,000" before permitting a Section 145 action to proceed, based partly on the PTO's estimate that it would spend $45,000 in attorney time on the case. See Taylor v. Lee, Nos. 1:15-cv-1607(LMB/JFA), 1:15-cv1684(LMB/JFA), 1:16-cv-12(LMB/JFA), 2016 WL 9308420, at *2 (E.D. Va., July 12, 2016). Under that decision, the patent applicant must essentially pre-pay the government's lawyer fees even before the plaintiff can conduct any aspect of the litigation.There is no discernible, legitimate policy rationale for requiring litigants challenging a PTO decision to pay the government's legal fees regardless of outcome. One court has suggested that Congress enacted the expense provision "to discourage applicants from undertaking this type of proceeding, which enables them to introduce new evidence . . . thereby raising the potential for gamesmanship."9Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 17 Filed: 01/23/2018Taylor, supra, 2016 WL 9308420, at *1. But new evidence may be necessary in the district court for a variety of reasons other than "gamesmanship." In fact, the Supreme Court in Kappos v. Hyatt, 132 S. Ct. 1690, 1700 (2012), was not persuaded by the proposition that an applicant would intentionally withhold evidence from the PTO with the goal of presenting that evidence for the first time to a non-expert judge at the district court. "An applicant who pursues such a strategy would be intentionally undermining his claims before the PTO on the speculative chance that he will gain some advantage in the § 145 proceeding by presenting new evidence to a district court judge." Id.Congress made the civil action route available to patent applicants for a reason--to allow them to persuade a district court, in a trial setting and limited only by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence, that they deserved patents denied by the PTO. Congress surely did not provide this route to patent applicants and then erect a roadblock that would eliminate its use. A decision favoring that roadblock would have an unjust chilling effect on small businesses, sole inventors, and others who cannot afford the additional costs of the agency's attorneys' fees, regardless of the merits of their inventions and civil actions. These implications must be avoided; the doors of justice must be open to all, regardless of individual prosperity.10Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 18 Filed: 01/23/2018II. "Expenses of the proceedings" Does Not Include the Government's Attorneys' Fees. Cases interpreting potentially fee-shifting statutes must begin with thefoundational presumption that fees are not shifted. As the Supreme Court has explained, "[o]ur basic point of reference when considering the award of attorney's fees is the bedrock principle known as the `American Rule.' Each litigant pays his own attorneys' fees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides otherwise." Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 252­53 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The American Rule is a intentional departure from the English rule, which authorizes fee awards to prevailing parties in litigation, i.e., "loser pays." Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714, 717 (1967). Early in our history, the Supreme Court resolved that the American Rule is "entitled to the respect of the court, till it is changed, or modified, by statute." Arcambel v. Wiseman, 3 U.S. 305, 3 Dall. 306 (1796).Congress codified the American Rule in 1853, explicitly permitting only the shifting of docket fees up to twenty dollars, absent other statutory authorization. See John F. Vargo, The American Rule on Attorney Fee Allocation: The Injured Person's Access to Justice, 42 Am. U. L. Rev. 1567, 1578 (1993) (citing Act of Feb. 26, 1853, ch. 80, 10 Stat 161 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. § 1923)). The 1853 Act was explicitly passed to overcome the "unequal, extravagant, and often oppressive system" of fee-shifting, when there were no constraints on the amounts lawyers11Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 19 Filed: 01/23/2018could charge for services. Id. Since then, the American Rule has been reaffirmed many times. See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 250 (1975) (citing cases from 1852, 1872, 1873, 1879, 1967, and 1974 by which the "Court has consistently adhered to [the] early holding [of Arcambel]").Departures from the American Rule have been recognized only in "specific and explicit provisions for the allowance of attorneys' fees under selected statutes." Baker Botts, LLP v. ASARCO LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2158, 2164 (2015) (quoting Alyeska, supra, 421 U.S. at 260). The Supreme Court has made clear that there should be no deviation from the American Rule unless "explicit statutory authority" exists to do so. Id. (quoting Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 602 (2001)).This principle is consistent with the underlying rationale of the American Rule itself--promoting fair access to the legal system: "[O]ne should not be penalized for merely defending or prosecuting a lawsuit, and . . . the poor might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights . . . ." Fleischman Distilling Corp., supra, 386 U.S. at 718. As Justice Goldberg noted in Farmer v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., "[i]t has not been accident that the American litigant must bear his own cost of counsel and other trial expense save for minimal court costs, but a deliberate choice to ensure that access to the courts be not effectively denied those12Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 20 Filed: 01/23/2018of moderate means." Farmer v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 379 U.S. 227, 237 (1964) (Goldberg, J., concurring).Courts must therefore look carefully at statutory language before departing from the American Rule, and a party seeking such a departure bears a heavy burden to overcome the "deeply rooted" adherence to the American Rule. Roadway Exp., Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 761 (1980) (examining the legislative history and finding "nothing" to support the inclusion of attorneys' fees in the "taxable costs" of litigation); Alyeska, supra, 421 U.S. at 271 (declining to depart from the American Rule because it "is deeply rooted in our history and in congressional policy"); F.D. Rich Co., Inc. v. U.S. for Use of Indus. Lumber Co., Inc., 417 U.S. 116, 128-31 (1974) (declining to interpret "costs" and "sums justly due" to include "attorney's fees").As Judge Stoll explained in dissent in the panel decision in this case, there is no support in the text or legislative history of Section 145 for the proposition that Congress intended the mere word "expenses" to require a departure from the American Rule and shift the PTO's attorneys' fees to the patent applicant. Indeed, over 200 federal statutes and almost 2000 state statutes provide for shifting of attorneys' fees, Vargo, supra, 42 Am. U. L. Rev., at 1588, and neither the PTO nor the courts have located a single one that does so by referring only to "expenses." See NantKwest, Inc. v. Matal, 860 F.3d 1352, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (Stoll, J.,13Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 21 Filed: 01/23/2018dissenting) (listing 18 independent examples of statutes distinguishing between "expenses" and "attorney's fees"). Adopting the PTO's position would therefore make Section 145 unique among all fee-shifting laws.That Section 145 is not designed to shift fees from one party to the other is also evident from the fact that it provides for an award of "all expenses" whether the patent applicant wins or loses. This non-discretionary feature of the statute undermines rather than supports the proposition that Congress intended the term "expenses" to encompass attorneys' fees. As the Supreme Court has explained, "generations of American judges, lawyers, and legislators, with [the American Rule] as the point of departure, would regard it as quite `inappropriate' to award the `loser' an attorney's fee from the `prevailing litigant.'" Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680, 683-84 (1983). Moreover, Section 145 and its predecessors have had this feature from the 1800s. See, e.g., Butterworth v. Hill, 114 U.S. 128, 129-30 (1885) (quoting § 4915 Rev. stat.). Yet a Section 145 civil action, as with its predecessor "bill in equity," has long been known as "a suit according to the ordinary course of equity practice and procedure." Kappos, supra, 132 S. Ct., at 1698 (quoting Butterworth v. United States ex rel. Hoe, 112 U.S. 50, 61 (1884)); see P.J. Federico, Evolution of Patent Office Appeals, 22 J. Pat. Off. Soc'y 920, 937 (1940) (explaining the equitable nature of Section 145's predecessor statute).14Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 22 Filed: 01/23/2018As the Supreme Court noted in Baker Botts, departures from the American Rule "tend to authorize the award of `a reasonable attorney's fee,' `fees,' or `litigation costs' and usually refer to a `prevailing party' in the context of an adversarial action." Baker Botts, supra, 135 S. Ct. at 2164. By contrast, Section 145: (1) requires only the payment of "expenses," not "fees"; (2) provides for payment only of the government's expenses, never the applicant's; and (3) does so in every Section 145 action, regardless of which party prevails. Any one of these features makes Section 145 unlike any other fee-shifting provision. The presence of all three compels interpreting the provision to exclude attorneys' fees.The Fourth Circuit has expressed doubt that the American Rule applies where, as here, the relevant statutory language makes no reference to "prevailing parties." Shammas v. Focarino, 784 F.3d 219, 223-24 (4th Cir. 2015), cert denied, 136 S. Ct. 1376 (2016). But that does not follow. Fee-shifting statutes generally contain a reference to the "prevailing party." Baker Botts, 135 S. Ct. at 2164. The absence of "prevailing parties" in Section 145 is strong indication that it is not a fee-shifting statute at all.44 The PTO's interpretation is not supported by Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific, 566 U.S. 560 (2012). Taniguchi held only that the word "interpreter" in 28 U.S.C. § 1920 does not include "translator," nothing more. Id. at 568. Taniguchi did not interpret the word "expenses."15Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 23 Filed: 01/23/2018Moreover, that the provision would shift only the PTO's fees, and never the applicant's, strongly suggests it is not a fee-shifting statute. The PTO is not a typical litigant that requires an award of attorneys' fees to be made whole. The agency's annual appropriations are determined in accordance with its collection of user fees, which it uses to pay its attorneys and other employees and cover other overhead costs, including those related to litigation. 35 U.S.C. § 42(c)(3)(A). The PTO is designed to be a self-funding agency that pays its staff without resort to reimbursement of attorneys' fees.Indeed, for nearly two centuries, the phrase "expenses of the proceedings" in Section 145 has been understood to mean that the applicant must pay only the PTO's out-of-pocket expenses for the proceedings. The PTO itself has historically not interpreted "expenses" in Section 145 to include attorneys' fees but only typical expenses, such as agency travel costs, expert witness fees, and the like. As the PTO has acknowledged, it did not seek reimbursement of the salaries of its legal staff under Section 145 or its predecessor until 2013. Shammas, supra, 784 F.3d at 230, n.4.5 Throughout this time, the PTO sought to recover its actual "expenses," such as travel expenses that its employees incurred travelling to depositions, Robertson v. Cooper, 46 F.2d 766, 769 (4th Cir. 1931), and expenses for printing the briefs and joint appendix on appeal, Watson v. Allen, 274 F.2d 87, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1959). See5 See also ABA Resolution 108A, supra, n.2. 16Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 24 Filed: 01/23/2018also Aktiebolag v. Samuels, No. 89-3127-LFO, 1991 WL 25774, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 1991) (expert witness fees); Cook v. Watson, 208 F.2d 529, 531 (D.C.C. 1953) (printing expenses).The PTO is not alone in historically interpreting "expenses" as not including fees. There is no indication in the history of interpreting Section 145 that Congress had the intention of awarding fees. Section 145 was carried forward into current law in 1952, see Kappos supra, 132 S. Ct., at 1697, against a backdrop of 82 years of no known relevant departure by judges, lawyers, and legislators from requiring the PTO to pay its own attorneys' fees. The equity statute that preceded Section 145--andincluded identical "all expenses" language--was invoked approximately 1,170 times between 1927 and 1940, and at no time was the language interpreted to require fee shifting. See P.J. Federico, supra, 22 J. Pat. Off. Soc'y, at 941. Therehas been no change to the language of Section 145 that would justify a departure from this longstanding interpretation.CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, "all the expenses of the proceedings" in 35 U.S.C. § 145 should be interpreted as not authorizing an award of the United States Patent and Trademark Office's attorneys' fees.17Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 25 Filed: 01/23/2018Respectfully submitted, January 23, 2018__/s/Charles W.

I. Adopting Petitioner's Stringent Test For The Statutory Requirement Of Definiteness Does Not Address The Concerns Motivating Current Patent Reform EffortsPetitioner's invitation to significantly tighten the application of the statutory definiteness requirement comes to the Court amid a groundswell of patent reform efforts from all branches of the government. Most of these efforts, however, have not sought to adjust the balance struck by patent law's substantive requirements for patentability. Instead, they have been in response to concerns over the litigation activities of some firms that own patents, but do not practice them.4 That is, the reform efforts have sought to target those activities while preserving the patent system's overarching purpose "to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts." U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 8. The Court should decline to adjust the patent system's statutory definiteness requirement4 Firms that own patents, but do not practice them (i.e., do not make, use or sell products or methods claimed by those patents) are commonly referred to as non-practicing entities ("NPEs"). Some NPEs use patents only to seek licensing revenue or settlements and judgments from patent infringement litigation. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 396 (2006) (Kennedy, J., concurring). A type of NPE that is perceived as employing unduly aggressive litigation tactics (such as bringing suit in the name of a shell company or suing hundreds of defendants simultaneously) is sometimes called a "patent assertion entity," or, pejoratively, a "patent troll."7here in a manner that would negatively affect all patents held by all patent owners.The majority of recent reform efforts have sought to remedy concerns over the perceived disparities in the burdens and costs borne by plaintiffs and defendants in patent infringement lawsuits, particularly in view of the rise, in recent years, of lawsuits initiated by patent assertion entities. These concerns are echoed by petitioner and its amici. But to address those concerns, the current reform proposals focus on procedural changes to the litigation process, including fee-shifting, rather than wholesale substantive changes to the requirements for patentability.For example, in June 2013, the President issued a set of legislative recommendations and executive orders for patent reform. See Fact Sheet: White House Task Force on High-Tech Patent Issues, Office of the Press Secretary (June 4, 2013), available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/ 04/fact-sheet-white-house-task-force-high-tech-patentissues. The President called for patent policies aimed at protecting innovators from frivolous litigation and ensuring high-quality patents, and his proposals included allowing courts greater discretion to award attorney's fees and protecting customers and other end-users from patent infringement liability.On the same day, the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit coauthored an editorial similarly aimed at patent8assertion entities. Randall R. Rader, et al., Op-Ed., Make Patent Trolls Pay in Court, N.Y. TIMES, June 4, 2013. The Chief Judge urged district courts to more vigorously exercise their authority under both the patent statute's existing fee-shifting provision, 35 U.S.C. § 285, as well as Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to discourage aggressive litigation and frivolous demands brought by some patent assertion entities. Id.Congress too is at work on patent reform, with a number of bills that would implement some of the President's proposals for curbing perceived abusive litigation practices by some patent assertion entities.5 Indeed, the House of Representatives has already passed one such bill, H.R. 3309, which includes provisions aimed at (1) heightening pleading requirements for claims of patent infringement, (2) making the award of fees and expenses to the prevailing party presumptive in patent-related cases, and (3) deferring discovery in patent-related cases until after the district court has construed the claims of the patents-in-suit. Innovation Act, H.R. 3309, 113th Cong. (as passed by the House of Representatives on Dec. 5, 2013). Also, in December 2013, the Senate conducted hearings on S. 1720, largely a counterpart to H.R. 3309, and that bill remains under consideration.5 See, e.g., H.R. 845, 113th Cong. (2013); H.R. 2024, 113th Cong. (2013); H.R. 2639, 113th Cong. (2013); H.R. 2766, 113th Cong. (2013); H.R. 3540, 113th Cong. (2013); S. 866, 113th Cong. (2013); S. 1013, 113th Cong. (2013); S. 1612, 113th Cong. (2013); S. 1720, 113th Cong. (2013).9A revision to the substantive requirements for definiteness, the ABA submits, would not address the litigation-related concerns motivating the reform efforts. Petitioner's request would affect all patents, not merely those asserted in overly aggressive litigation by particular types of patent assertion entities. As set out below, this Court's current jurisprudence strikes the right balance between the notice function of claims and the practical necessities involved in claim drafting; a more stringent definiteness requirement for issued patents would threaten that balance.II. This Court Has Long Required That The Definiteness Requirement Strike A Proper Balance Between Notice And Practical NecessityA well-functioning patent system demands claims that provide clear notice to the public.6 But it must also secure to inventors, "who rely on the promise of the law to bring the invention forth," the fruits of their labors. Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U.S. 722, 731 (2002). Like other doctrines that seek to maintain what this Court has termed "the delicate balance" between these competing interests, id., any test for determining whether a patent claim satisfies Section 112's definiteness standard must adequately account for the imprecisions inherent in reducing an invention to the form of words.6 As discussed below, the "public" in this context refers to persons of skill in the pertinent art, rather than to laypersons.10In contrast to the inflexible standard advocated by petitioner and its amici, which seeks to elevate notice above all other considerations, this Court and the Federal Circuit have long applied a more balanced approach that asks whether one of ordinary skill in the art--that person to whom the patent disclosure is directed--would understand what is claimed. This well-established approach is necessary for a robust patent system that protects innovation.A. This Court Has Recognized That Practical Necessity Demands Only Reasonable Certainty In The Application Of The Statutory Requirement For Definiteness1. Under 35 U.S.C. § 112, a patent specification "shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention."7 This statutory requirement, known as "definiteness," dates at least to the 1870 Patent Act, which obliged an applicant to "particularly point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement, or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery." Act of July 8, 1870, ch. 230, § 26, 16 Stat. 198, 201 (1870); see7 The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, Pub. L. No. 112-29, 125 Stat. 284 (2011), reformatted the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112 as § 112(b) in a manner that is not material to the issues before the Court. The revised provision requires that a patent application "shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention." Id.11Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 379 (1996); see also Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, § 6, 5 Stat. 117, 119 (1836) (requiring applicant to "particularly specify and point out the part, improvement, or combination, which he claims as his own invention or discovery").This Court has explained that a principle purpose underlying the definiteness requirement is to provide notice of what is claimed, to prevent "[a] zone of uncertainty which enterprise and experimentation may enter only at the risk of infringement claims." United Carbon Co. v. Binney & Smith Co., 317 U.S. 228, 236 (1942). However, the public notice provided by a patent specification is directed not to a layperson, but to one of skill in the art, and it is by that measure that definiteness must be determined. As the Court explained in an early case relating to a steel process patent:The specification of the patent is not addressed to lawyers, or even to the public generally, but to the manufacturers of steel; and any description which is sufficient to apprise them in the language of the art of the definite feature of the invention, and to serve as a warning to others of what the patent claims as a monopoly, is sufficiently definite to sustain the patent.Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., 185 U.S. 403, 437 (1902); accord Eibel Process Co. v. Minn. & Ontario Paper Co., 261 U.S. 45, 65 (1923) (paper-12making patent and its specification "were manifested to readers who were skilled in the art of paper making").2. For over a century, this Court's cases have recognized that the notice function of a patent claim must be tempered by the practical realities of claim drafting. In Eibel Process, for example, the Court considered an indefiniteness challenge to a patent disclosing a machine for making paper more quickly by harnessing the effects of gravity. 261 U.S. at 64-65. The patent described a critical limitation in relative, rather than absolute, terms--specifically, that one end of the paper-making machinery was to be maintained at a "substantial" or "high" elevation or pitch. Id. at 65-66. Though it observed that "[i]ndefiniteness is objectionable, because the patent does not disclose to the public how the discovery * * * can be made useful, and how its infringement may be avoided," the Court rejected both the challenge to the patent and the notion of a stringent definiteness requirement: "[i]t was difficult for [the patentee] to be more definite, due to the varying conditions" of paper stock and "the necessary variation in the pitch to be used to accomplish the purpose of his invention." Id. at 65. And more importantly, the Court explained, a person of ordinary skill in the art "had no difficulty" understanding what the patentee claimed. Id. at 6566.Likewise, in Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Hyde, a case involving an improved method for ore processing, the Court observed that "the certainty which the law13requires in patents is not greater than is reasonable, having regard to their subject-matter." 242 U.S. 261, 270 (1916); cf. Gen. Elec. Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U.S. 364, 372­373 (1938) (rejecting claims for failure of description but noting that "[t]he difficulty of making adequate description may have some bearing on the sufficiency of the description attempted"). The Minerals Separation patentee failed to specify the optimum amount of oil to be used for processing particular ores using the method, and instead claimed an indeterminate range (an unspecified "fraction" of one percent of the ore). 242 U.S. at 270­271. Yet the Court explained that the claims were nevertheless sufficiently described because the "range of treatment within the terms of the claims, while leaving something to the skill of persons applying the invention, is clearly sufficiently definite to guide those skilled in the art to its successful application." Id. at 271. Indeed, the practical necessities of claim drafting precluded requiring more: "it is obviously impossible to specify in a patent the precise treatment which would be most successful and economical in each case." Id. In contrast, the Court invalidated three claims that lacked any range or boundary that would permit a person of ordinary skill to understand what was claimed. Id.3. Similarly, this Court has in other contexts recognized that the notice function of claim language must be tempered by the need to avoid depriving inventors of the benefit of the patent bargain. Most notably, the Court has repeatedly declined to "speak14the death" of the doctrine of equivalents, which, like the Court's current approach to definiteness, permits some uncertainty in the scope of claim language. See Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., 520 U.S. 17, 21 (1997). Under that doctrine, which prevents infringers from evading a patent by making unsubstantial changes, a product "that does not literally infringe upon the express terms of a patent claim may nonetheless be found to infringe" if the product's elements are "equivalent[]" to those of the claim. Id.By permitting liability beyond the literal terms of the patent claim, the doctrine of equivalents unquestionably "renders the scope of patents less certain." Festo, 535 U.S. at 732. And it has engendered concerns from dissenting Justices that are similar to those raised by the petitioner with regard to the definiteness requirement. See id. at 732­733 (discussing history of dissenting views in cases and noting the doctrine may deter competitors "from engaging in legitimate manufactures," cause them to "invest by mistake in competing products that the patent secures," and result in "wasteful litigation * * * that a rule of literalism might avoid"). Yet this Court has in each instance "acknowledged this uncertainty as the price of ensuring the appropriate incentives for innovation." Id. at 732.The Court has explained why the law countenances this result: if "patents were always interpreted by their literal terms, their value would be greatly diminished. Unimportant and15insubstantial substitutes for certain elements could defeat the patent, and its value to inventors could be destroyed by simple acts of copying." Id. at 731. This is an inherent limitation of claim drafting, because "the nature of language makes it impossible to capture the essence of a thing in a patent application." Id. And while a patentee must particularly point out and distinctly claim his invention, "[t]he language in the patent claims may not capture every nuance of the invention or describe with complete precision the range of its novelty." Id.These principles are of equal force with regard to the definiteness requirement. The Court has never demanded a complete absence of ambiguity from draftsmen seeking to secure to inventors their discoveries, and it should not do so now.B. The Federal Circuit's Standard For Determining Definiteness Properly Looks To Whether A Person Of Ordinary Skill In The Relevant Art Would Understand What Is Claimed1. Consistent with this Court's focus on how a person of ordinary skill in the art would interpret a claim, the Federal Circuit has framed its standard for definiteness by stating: "If one skilled in the art would understand the bounds of the claim when read in light of the specification, then the claim satisfies section 112 paragraph 2." Exxon Research & Eng'g Co. v. United States, 265 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001).16Although its published opinions reflect various formulations of this standard, as the Federal Circuit has explained, "[t]he common thread in all of these cases is that claims were held indefinite only where a person of ordinary skill in the art could not determine the bounds of the claims, i.e., the claims were insolubly ambiguous." Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc. v. M-I LLC, 514 F.3d 1244, 1249 (Fed. Cir. 2008). As used by that court, "insolubly ambiguous" is not an expression of a rigid rule, as some have argued, but rather a shorthand manner of summarizing the myriad of ways in which a patent claim can fail to satisfy the definiteness requirement of Section 112. For example, the Federal Circuit has held claims indefinite where a patent term is entirely dependent on a person's aesthetic or subjective opinion, e.g. Datamize, LLC v. Plumtree Software, Inc., 417 F.3d 1342, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2005); where a person of ordinary skill cannot determine which of multiple techniques yielding different results should be used to measure a claimed numeric limitation, e.g. Honeywell Int'l, Inc. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 341 F.3d 1332, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2003); where a construction can be articulated, but a person of ordinary skill cannot translate the definition into meaningfully precise claim scope, e.g. Halliburton, 514 F.3d at 1251; where a typographical error in a claim could be corrected in multiple ways, but a person of ordinary skill cannot determine which is correct, e.g., Novo Indus., L.P. v. Micro Molds Corp., 350 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003); and where incurable technical defects are17present.8 To be sure, the phrase "insolubly ambiguous" is perhaps more susceptible to misinterpretation by district courts than more conventional formulations that the Federal Circuit has articulated in other cases. But the court's use of the phrase in cases where a person of ordinary skill would not know what is claimed demonstrates that the "common thread" in these cases is the definiteness principle articulated by this Court.2. Few patent practitioners would disagree that the types of claims identified in the cases noted above are indefinite. Petitioner's complaint involves a different kind of indeterminacy claim: that a claim should be found to be indefinite per se when the claim language is susceptible to more than one reasonable reading.But petitioner's proposed test is incompatible with this Court's indefiniteness jurisprudence. Otherwise, the mere amenability of an issued patent claim to more than one reasonable construction, without more, would have required a different result in Eibel Process, as either "substantial" and "high" could8 For example, a patent claim to a particular machine or system is indefinite where it contains a term that describes a function, but discloses no structural component to perform that function. See, e.g., Function Media, L.L.C. v. Google, Inc., 708 F.3d 1310, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2013). A patent claim may also be indefinite if a claim term lacks antecedent basis and the meaning is not reasonably ascertainable to a person of ordinary skill. Energizer Holdings, Inc. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 435 F.3d 1366, 1370­1371 (Fed. Cir. 2006).18plainly mean any number of reasonable things. See 261 U.S. at 65­66.Indeed, few patents will be so clear that no uncertainty can be raised as to the interpretation of their claims. To limit the inquiry to whether claim language is amenable to more than one reasonable interpretation, without more, as a test for definiteness would encourage litigants to advance "reasonable" interpretations of any term of an issued, presumedvalid patent, when the proper issue should be whether a court can resolve any real and concrete dispute between the parties regarding infringement or invalidity. Cf. United Carbon, 317 U.S. at 236 (purpose of requiring "reasonably clear-cut" claims is "to enable courts to determine whether novelty and invention are genuine").Disputes over the meaning of particular terms in patent claims are routine, and resolving them is the familiar province of the court. See Markman, 517 U.S. at 390­391. In that role, the court determines what a hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the boundaries of the claim to be in light of the patent specification and prosecution history. See Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312-1313 (Fed. Cir. 2005); see also Carnegie Steel, 185 U.S. at 432 (noting that a "claim of a patent must always be explained by and read in connection with the specification"). When there is a concrete dispute between the parties as to what a person of ordinary skill would understand a patent to claim, any uncertainty that may exist until a court has resolved19the dispute through claim construction is simply an unavoidable byproduct of both the adversarial system and an effort to balance, as this Court has required, clarity in claim scope and incentives to innovate. See Festo, 535 U.S. at 731.III. The Practical Effects Of Adopting Petitioner's Proposed Test Are Undesirable And Undermine The Purpose Of 35 U.S.C. § 112, Second ParagraphBeyond upsetting the balance between the notice function of claims and the necessary imprecision of claim drafting, invalidating claims when more than one reasonable construction can be asserted will negatively affect both patent litigation in the district courts and patent prosecution practice before the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office.First, accused infringers in patent litigation will have an incentive to frustrate the court's efforts to construe the asserted claims. Claim construction is a necessary predicate to the determination of infringement and many validity issues. Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., 90 F.3d 1576, 1581-1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Beachcombers Int'l, Inc. v. WildeWood Creative Prods., Inc., 31 F.3d 1154, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1994). If the existence of more than one reasonable claim construction establishes that a patent claim is indefinite, accused infringers will have a clear incentive to present multiple "reasonable" interpretations of the asserted claims, rather than advocating what they assert is the proper20construction of the claims, in an effort to establish that the claims are invalid as indefinite.9Further, if parties were to present genuinely opposing constructions of claim language, the trial court could conclude the claims at issue were valid-- as they are presumed to be--only if it determined that one of the parties' proposed constructions was not reasonable. Thus, the presentation of opposing, but presumptively reasonable, constructions would raise questions regarding the definiteness of the asserted claims in nearly every case. Moreover, a finding that a party's position was unreasonable would raise concerns for the determination of willful infringement or whether the case was "exceptional" for purposes of awarding attorney's fees. See Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc. v. W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc., 682 F.3d9 A focus on whether claim terms are susceptible to multiple "reasonable" interpretations likewise would encourage litigants to dispute the meaning of tangential terms regardless of whether disputes regarding those terms meaningfully impact infringement or invalidity in the specific case. Determining the precise outer boundary of a claim offers little benefit when an infringer's conduct or the prior art is squarely in the center of the claimed subject matter. See, e.g., Abbott Labs. v. Baxter Pharm. Prods., Inc., 471 F.3d 1363, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (in anticipation analysis, "numerical exactitude" not required where any added precision was not necessary to resolve invalidity question). Patent law should not require courts to expend judicial resources on resolving claim-construction disputes under the guise of indefiniteness if the dispute does not affect substantive questions of infringement, invalidity, or the like. See, e.g., Vivid Techs., Inc. v. Am. Sci. & Eng'g, Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (noting that "only those terms need be construed that are in controversy, and only to the extent necessary to resolve the controversy").211003, 1006 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Machinery Corp. of Am. v. Gullfiber AB, 774 F.2d 467, 473-474 (Fed. Cir. 1985).Finally, any benefits to be derived from petitioner's stringent definiteness requirement would be outweighed by its negative effects on both patent infringement litigation and patent prosecution practice before the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. As discussed above, this Court's and the Federal Circuit's balanced approach to indefiniteness accommodates the inherent difficulty of reducing an invention to words. If that balance were shifted in favor of a more stringent standard for issued patents, patent practitioners would be forced to draft many more claims to try to capture every possible variation of an invention and provide alternate claim language to steel against later possible determinations of indefiniteness. Such a practice would increase the burden of examination and lead to inefficient practice.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above, the ABA urges the Court to reaffirm that, in determining whether a patent claim satisfies the definiteness requirement of Section 112, second paragraph, the courts should continue to look to whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the bounds of the claim in light of the specification and prosecution history.22 Respectfully submitted.Of Counsel: JOHN P.

 I. THE RECORD JUSTIFIES REAUTHOR-IZATION.The Utility District's Section 5 argument relies on the premise that contemporary discrimination "of the type that justified § 5 is rare, if it exists at all, and cannot justify renewing § 5 for yet another generation." App. Br. 27. The record before Congress in 2006, however, was replete with evidence that precisely the type of behavior that justifies Section 5-- unconstitutional voting discrimination--persists across the covered jurisdictions and would be even more prevalent in Section 5's absence. The robust legislative record is more than sufficient, under this Court's precedents, to justify Section 5's reauthorization.1. The Utility District can argue that evidence supporting Section 5's reauthorization "is rare, if it exists at all," App. Br. 27, only by asserting that there must be a showing of "a systematic pattern of covered jurisdictions recently engaging in concerted efforts to game the system to the disadvantage of minorities by acting preemptively to impose new barriers to voting once old barriers are judicially deemed unenforceable." App. Br. 40-41.As an initial matter, the record before Congress contained just such a showing: It included extensive evidence that particular jurisdictions have received multiple Section 5 objections, and in some cases have faced a combination of Section 5 objections and Section 2 lawsuits, since 1982. See Br. of Louis Intervenors 15-19, 47-51. But in any event, the Utility District's narrow understanding of Section 5 is not correct. As the Government has pointed out: "Although this Court recognized in Katzenbach that `some' covered States had. engaged in such [gamesmanship], the Court repeatedly stated that it was the cumbersome nature of case-by-case adjudication of voting cases" that prompted Congress to adopt the preclearance mechanism and that gamesmanship was "only one aspect of the larger failure of traditional legislative bans on discrimination in voting." U.S. Mot. to Affirm 18-19 (quoting and citing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 318-314, 327328, 335 (1966)) (internal citations omitted). See also Boerne, 521 U.S. at 526 (explaining that the VRA's "new, unprecedented remedies," including Section 5, "were deemed necessary given the ineffectiveness of the existing voting rights laws and the slow, costly character of case-by-case litigation") (citing Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 313-315, 328).The validity of Section 5's reenactment thus does not hinge on Congress being able to point to a "systematic pattern of covered jurisdictions * * * gamfing] the system to the disadvantage of minorities." App. Br. 40. Instead, Congress has "wide latitude" in determining "measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions." Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519. Compare id. at 528 (stating that the "rationales" for upholding Section 4(e) of the VRA "rested onunconstitutional discrimination *** and Congress' reasonable attempt to combat it"). The record com-piled by Congress is replete with evidence both that"unconstitutional actions" persist and that Section 5 is an important tool to "remedy or prevent" them.a. Intentional Discrimination. Congress explicitlyfound, in re-enacting Section 5, that hundreds ofvoting-rule changes sought by covered jurisdictions between 1982 and 2006 "were calculated decisions to keep minority voters from fully participating in thepolitical process." Those calculated and intentionaldecisions--had the Attorney General not intercededunder the authority of the VRA--would have uncon-stitutionally deprived citizens of their right to vote. H.R. Rep. No. 109-478 at 21 (2006) ("2006 House Report'); see also ABA July 2006 Senate Letter ("Because of the persistence of discriminatory behav-ior in the election process, the Act remains an essen-tial tool in the struggle to preserve and protect voting rights for all Americans."); Bartlett v. Strickland, --- S. Ct. ---, 2009 WL 578634, at *16 (U.S. Mar.9, 2009) (op. of Kennedy, J.) (observing that "racialdiscrimination and racially polarized voting are notancient history" and that "[m]uch remains to be done to ensure that citizens of all races have equal oppor-tunity to share and participate in our democraticprocesses and traditions"). Congress's finding on thisscore is amply supported by the record it amassed: e In 2005, the Department of Justice "blocked a redistricting plan in the Town of Delhi, Louisiana, after finding it was motivated by intent to retrogress [and] would have eliminated an African-American opportunity district." Reauthoriz-ing the Voting Rights Act's Temporary Provi-10sions: Hearing on S. 2703 Before Subcomm. on Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights of S. Comm. on Judiciary, 109th Cong. 45 (2006) ("Senate Hearing") (Response of Debo P. Adegbile). In 2003, the Department of Justice blocked a proposed municipal annexation in the Town of North, South Carolina, finding that the town intentionally made a habit of allowing white petitioners to annex their property to the town-- and thus increase the white voting base--while "largely ignor{ing]" the requests of black residents to do the same. Senate Hearing at 60 (Response of Debo P. Adegbile) (citing Letter From R. Alexander Acosta, Assistant Attorney General, Department of Justice, to Mayor H. Bruce Buckheister (Sept. 16, 2003)). Following the 2000 census, the Department of Justice blocked the City of Albany, Georgia's redistricting plan, finding that the plan intentionally split what should have been a majorityblack ward. The Department's letter of objection concluded it was "implicit" that "the proposed plan was designed with the purpose to limit and retrogress the increased black voting strength in Ward 4, as well as in the city as a whole."

Michael Wiggins, Acting Assistant Attorney General, De-11partment of Justice, to Al Grieshaber Jr. (Sept. 23, 2002)) (quotation marks omitted).8 ¢ In 1999, officials in Dinwiddie County, Virginia moved a polling place from a hunt club with a large black membership to a church located as far as possible from the precinct's black population center. The Department of Justice objected to the change, finding that the polling place was moved for discriminatory reasons. 152 Cong. Rec. 87748 Guly 18, 2006) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (citing Letter From Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Department of Justice, to Benjamin W. Emerson (Oct. 27, 1999)). e In 1992, white officials in black-majority Hale County, Alabama physically held polling-place doors closed to prevent black voters from entering the precinct to cast votes. A black legislator who managed to pull one of the doors open to let voters in was arrested.

Dunne, Assistant Attorney General, Department of Justice, to Secretary-Treasurer Robbie Shirley (Dec. 23, 1991)). e In 1990, the City of Monroe, Louisiana attempted to annex white suburban wards to its city court jurisdiction. The Department of Justice objected, noting that the wards in question had been eligible for annexation since 1970 but that there had been no interest in annexing them until just after the first-ever black candidate ran for city court. 2006 House Report at 23 (citing Letter From John R. Dunne, Assistant Attorney General, Department of Justice, to Cynthia Young Rougeou, Assistant Attorney General, State of Louisiana (Oct. 23, 1990)). ¢ In 1988, the Department of Justice rejected a Lumber City, Georgia ordinance that containedcertain majority-vote and numbered-post re-quirements for city elections. The Department found that the requirements had blocked theelection of a black candidate and that they were "tainted, at least in part, by a proscribed pur-pose." McDonald Report at 434-435 (quotingLetter From William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney General, Department of Justice,to Ken W. Smith (July 8, 1988)) (quotationmarks omitted). These are far from the only examples of post-1982 intentional discrimination in the record before Con-13gress. On the contrary, as the Government has noted, "[bletween 1980 and 2000, the Attorney General interposed 421 objections based wholly or partially on discriminatory intent." U.S. Mot. to Affirm 21 (citing J.S. App. 76-77). Compare Boerne, 521 U.S. at 530 ("RFRA's legislative record lacks examples of modern instances of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry.").Furthermore, the witnesses who appeared before Congress testified that intentional discrimination is still a disturbingly widespread and frequent occurrence--a finding Congress adopted, as it was entitled to do. See 2006 House Report at 21. Debo P. Adegbile, Associate Director of Litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., testified that "the congressional record is replete with examples of continuing voting discrimination against racial minorities in the covered jurisdictions" and that a "surprisingly significant" number of the post1982 objection letters issued by the Department of Justice involve findings of intentional discrimination. Senate Hearing at 52, 73. As to Louisiana specifically, Adegbile testified that "[s]ignificant * * * voting changes adopted with retrogressive purpose" continue to be "commonplace." Id. at 130. Likewise, the National Commission on the Voting Rights Act ("NCVRA") concluded that "efforts to suppress the minority vote, while not as systematic and pervasive as those of the pre-Act South, are still encountered in every election cycle across the country." NCVRA Report at 7.The record also suggests that the numerical tally of intentional-discrimination objection letters and court findings understates the actual prevalence of uncon-14stitutional discrimination. As appellees have pointed out, since 1982, the Attorney General and the D.C. District Court have interposed more than 750 Section 5 objections to more than 2,400 proposed voting changes based on findings that those changes were discriminatory; an additional 1,100 changes have been abandoned or modified in response to moreinformation-request letters; and plaintiffs in covered states have been successful in more than 650 lawsuits under Section 2 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973a. US. Mot. to Affirm 15-16.The Utility District apparently would disregardthis evidence as insufficiently reflective of intentional discrimination. E.g., App. Br. 53. However, as to requests for more information, the evidence dem-onstrated, and Congress affirmatively found, that alocality's withdrawal of a proposed change often signals that the locality had an improper motive in the first place. 2006 House Report at 40-41. Furthermore, there was record evidence suggesting that many of the cases that resulted in discriminatoryeffect findings from the Department of Justice and the courts may also have involved discriminatory intent. As Professor Karlan explained in testimony before the Senate: "One consequence of the 1982 amendment of section 2 is that plaintiffs are rarelycalled upon to prove, and courts are rarely calledupon to find, that a defendant jurisdiction has engaged in purposeful racial discrimination that would violate the Constitution as well. This is not to say that such purposeful discrimination does not exist." Senate Hearing at 173 (testimony of Prof. Pamela S.Karlan).15b. Efficacy of Section 5. Congress likewise com-piled extensive record evidence demonstrating thatSection 5 is an effective--and irreplaceable--tool toremedy and prevent persistent unconstitutionalvoting discrimination. In addition to the pure num-bers of objection letters and withdrawn proposalsrecounted above, the evidence demonstrated that"the deterrent effect of Section 5 is substantial."NCVRA Report at 57; 24 (adopting NCVRAsee also 2006 House Report finding). After holdingat 10hearings across the nation and hearing from 100witnesses, the NCVRA recounted evidence that"fo]nce officials in covered jurisdictions becomeaware of the logic of preclearance, they tend tounderstand that submitting discriminatory changesis a waste of taxpayer time and money and interfereswith their own timetables, because the chances aregood that an objection will result." NCVRA Report at57; accord Senate Hearing at 169-170 (testimony ofProf. Karlan) (concluding that Section 5 performs adeterrent function and that the deterrent function is"especially important with respect to changes at thelocal level").The evidence also demonstrated that Section 5's deterrent effect continues to play a "critical role inminority citizens' political integration" because "thepolitical gainsthe passage ofminority citizens havethe Act are sufficientlyachieved sincerecent and theincentives for officials to ignore the interests ofminority voters are sufficiently attractive that back-sliding would occur in the absence of the Act's sub-stantive and procedural protections." Senate Hear-ing at 168-169 (testimony of Prof. Karlan); see alsoABA July 2006 House Letter 2 (stating that the Act's"special remedial provisions have enabled the federal16government to enforce the prohibition on discriminatory voting practices and mechanisms. These provisions have been very effective at enhancing the democratic principles that form the foundation of our nation.").Nor was the evidence before Congress supportive of the Utility District's assertion that Section 5 is no longer necessary because "[t]he voting-rights problems Congress identified in the 2006 record * * * are quickly and fully remedied by § 2 and other substantive prohibitions." App. Br. 27. To the contrary, the record demonstrated that private lawsuits are often cumbersome and unable to prevent the more pervasive forms of second-generation voting discrimination: last-minute attempts to move polling booths, eleventh-hour attempts to delay elections, and the like. As the General Counsel of the North Carolina State Board of Elections testified: "Section 2 cases are complex and can take several years to fully litigate at the trial level, exclusive of any appeals. In the meantime, the discriminatory voting change is put into effect, which would not happen under Section 5." Senate Hearing at 121 (testimony of General Counsel Don Wright). Wright explained that even if the Section 2 litigation is ultimately successful, "the damage is often already done: elections may have been held under an unlawful plan, providing candidates elected under that plan an advantage in terms of incumbency and fundraising under any remedial plan that might be adopted." Id.; see also Br. of Louis Intervenors 10-11 (cataloguing additional evidence).2. Rather than address the entirety of the record before Congress, the Utility District focuses on the17evidence of gamesmanship. App. Br. 43-54. But that approach ignores the broader purpose of Section 5that this Court acknowledged in Katzenbach. See383 U.S. at 314, 327-328 (discussing limitations of case-by-case litigation). And to the extent the Utility District contests the evidence before Congress--arguing, for instance, that Section 2 is up to the taskcurrently performed by Section 5--its argument would require this Court to ignore the extensiverecord from which Congress concluded that Section 5is essential for both confronting and deterring a myriad of unconstitutional voting discriminationattempts. In short, the Utility District forgets thatthis Court "owe[s] Congress' findings deference in part because the institution `is far better equipped than the judiciary to amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data bearing upon' legislative questions."Turner Broad. Sys. Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 195(1997) ("Turner IT') (quoting Turner Broad. Sys. Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 665-666 (1994) ("Turner P')).Il. BNTHOAEETURRNUEETILOAIFNTDYTHEIDGISNSEOTCRRTEIISCOTNTHO5EVREELRMIREMDEIYAT.DESDThe Utility District bases its argument for Section 5's unconstitutionality on Boerne's "congruence and proportionality" test, but the argument is not supported by either Boerne's holding or its animating logic.1. The Utility District contends, in effect, that (i) Boerne imposes on Congress a strict scrutiny-style least-restrictive-means requirement and (ii) Section 5 does not meet this standard because, among other things, Section 2 suffices to address the votingdiscrimination problems identified in the record.18rhatSheeoneevdw,ieewbvaee.ilgsdt.it,eedhrnaeecAtsdepp.titphhnriecseoBsrred.rCeneoftcue3terr6ldte-y3n7tt.hoiaaasslCsouBnemfegmirsrpinaedlgsmeoses,ywetohdrsabetkeeifnoBsgrfouorpedrrcaenoSecuenacattdtseieoors1nm96e-----to5this argument attributes to Boerne a test that thecase did not announce.tirely disregards Boerne'sIndeed, therecognitionargument en-that Congresshas the power to " `prohibit changes that have adiscriminatory impact'" as a way to reach demon-strable intentional discrimination--a power thatcannot be reconciled withrequirement. 521 U.S. ata532least-restrictive-means(quoting City of Romev.

This case simply does not trigger the concerns that animated Boerne. Congress found in reauthorizing Section 5 of the VRA that localities continue to enact unconstitutional--not just undesirable--voting rules. See supra at 9-14. Furthermore, Congress found that Section 5 has been used to block hundreds of voting laws and rules that were motivated by racial discrimination. J.S. App. 77. A claim that Section 5 does not target unconstitutional behavior, see App. Br. 42-56, disregards the substantial record compiled by Congress. As this Court has held, "[t]he Constitution gives to Congress the role of weighing conflicting evidence in the legislative process." Turner I, 520 U.S. at 199; see id. at 195 (court's sole obligation in reviewing constitutionality of a statute is "`to assure that, in formulating its judgments, Congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence,' " with substantiality measured "by a standard more deferential than we accord to judgments of an administrative agency") (quoting Turner I, 512 U.S. at 665-666).3. Nor can the impact of Section 5's preclearance requirement be fairly compared to the statute struck down in Boerne. Indeed, Boerne itself contrasted the VRA (including Section 5) with RFRA and held up the former as a model of congruent, proportional legislation. See 521 U.S. at 526. Boerne highlightedthe VRA's focus on a single class of state laws, itsexpiration date, and its geographical restrictions; all were features absent from RFRA. See id. at 525-526.An additional and important difference between RFRA and Section 5 of the VRA must be noted:20Section 5 does not strike down the vast majority oflaws within its scope; it instead merely delays their enactment for a period of weeks, giving the AttorneyGeneral time to identify those few that raise con-cerns of discrimination. See 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(a) (creating 60-day review period). It is inaccurate, inother words, for the Utility District to assert that Section 5 "preempts every change related to voting*** in covered jurisdictions." App. Br. 38 (emphasisdeleted). Section 5 affects every change related to voting; it preempts a small proportion of those proposed. This is a crucial distinction from Boerne,which addressed itself to a statute that "displacfed] laws and prohibit[ed] official actions of almost every description." 521 U.S. at 532 (emphases added).Boerne, in short, was a case about the categoricalprohibition of constitutional behavior; this is a case about contingent delay aimed at preventing uncon-stitutional behavior.

Flores, SgB P.2d S93 (1979), this Court addressed the question "whether an indigent party has the right to court-appointed counsel in a private child custody proceeding in which her spouse is represented by Alaska Legal ServicesCorporation (ALSC)." ld. al894. The Court answered this question in theaffirmative, holding "that the due process clause of the Alaska Constitution guarantees such a right." /d. (footnote omitted).7LEGALl 2764971 5.1ln reaching the conclusion that the "flexible" concept of due process requiredrecognition of this right,T the Court focused principally upon two critical factors:(i) the nature of the indigent party's interest at issue; and (ii) the nature of theproceeding in which the interest at stake was to be adjudicated.Regarding the first factor, this Courl observed that "[t]he interest at stake isone of the most basic of all civil liberties, the right to direct the upbringing of one'schild." /d. at 895. Elaborating on this point, the Coutl cited with approval severaldecisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, each supporling theproposition that parental rights "ha[ve] consistently been recognized . . . as beingamong the 'liberties' protected by the due process clause of the FederalConstitution."

Although the child custody action was between two private parties, the Court determined that the interests of the State warranted due process scrutiny, noting that "there is a strong state interest in divorce-child custody proceedings. . . .[L]egally binding marriages and divorces are wholly creations of the state [and] [a]ny provision for child custody in a divorce order is fully enforceable by the state." /d.at 8g5-96 (footnotes omitted). The Court concluded, "ln this case, Christine Flores7M. at BgS n.7, quoting Otton v. Zaborac, 525 P.2d 537, 539 (Alaska 1974)("Due process is flexible, and the concept should be applied in a manner which isappropriate in the terms of the nature of the proceeding."

Istands to lose a basic 'liberty' just as surely as if she were being prosecuted for a criminal offense." /d. at 896.Then, addressing whether, in light of the nature of the interest involved, the proceedings were of a character that should dictate appointment of counsel, this Court first noted that "[c]hild custody determinations are among the most difficult in the law," in that deciding what will be best for the child "requires a delicate process of balancing many complex and competing considerations that are unique to every case." /d. The Coutt continued:A parent who is without the aid of counsel in marshaling and presenting the arguments in her favor will be at a decided and frequently decisive disadvantage which becomes even more apparent when one considers the emotional nature of child custody disputes, and the fact that all of the principals are likely to be distraught. This disadvantage is constitutionally impermissible where the other parent if-l^a^ l; a--^ll a^iit-t--u^.l. lley S^..u--lP:^iPlleu Lu..y ¿^1 ^P..uLiui^ll'v c^^l^v^Þ^.l,lrsy. /d. (footnote omitted). Thus, this Court has already concluded, in Flores, that because of the fundamental nature of the right to parent and the extremely difficult, complex and emotionally-charged nature of child custody proceedings, due process requires the appointment of counsel to represent an indigent party if the other party was afforded counsel by a public agency. The only distinction between Flores and the present case is that the adversary party here had a private, rather than public, attorney -- a difference the ABA respectfully submits should be immaterial for purposes of either due process or equal protection analysis under the Alaska Constitution.oLEGALl 2764971 5.1A. Due Processln the Matter of K.L.J., 813 P .2d 276 (Alaska 1991 ), this Courl expanded its analysis in F/ores and applied the three-part balancing test afticulated by the Supreme Courl of the United States in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976), for evaluating claims under the Due Process Clause of the Alaska Constitution. As set out in ln the Matter of K.L.J., this test considers: (i) the private interest involved and affected by official state action; (ii) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of or adverse impact on that interest based on the application of existing procedures and the value, if any, of additional or alternative procedures; and (iii) the State's interests, including the financial and/or administrative burdens associated with the adoption of new or different procedures. 813 P.2d a1279, citing Keyes v.ilJiL,,¿^tinian,itn r<i rlJ|vn'ùa¡-n/. ,'A-ìt'l.a.¡roJ!l'¿.<ai, :I,tn','¡,t 7¿ÃL"nJ Þ: .4tÅu 2/1? ?Ã2 /Alaalzo lORq\ Ac fha f-nrrrf cfafod"[t]he crux of due process is an opportunity to be heard and the right to adequately present one's interests." /d. (citations omitted). With respect to "the right to adequately present one's interests," an indigent litigant's need for counsel has great urgency, for, as this Court has noted, " 'the right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel,' " Reynolds v. Kimmons, 569 P.2d799,801 (Alaska 1977), quoting Otton v. Zaborac, 525 P .2d at 539 (citing Powell v. Alabama, 297 U.S. 45, 68-69 (1932)).As regards the first element of the three-part due process analysis, there can be no doubt after Flores that the parental rights implicated by child custody disputes involve an interest that is fundamental. See 598 P.2d at 895 ("one of the most basic of all civil liberties [is] the right to direct the upbringing of one's child"). Similarly, inI o1EGA1127649715.1ln the Matter of K.L.J., this Courl recognized that "[t]he right to the care, custody, companionship and control of one's children 'undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.' " B',l3 P.2d air279, quoting Stanley v. Illinois,405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972)', see a/so ln re Adoption of 4.F.M.,15 P.3d 258, 268 (Alaska 2001) (noting that a parent's loss of the custody of his or her child may constitute "punishment more severe than many criminal sanctions" (citations omitted)); S.J. v. L.T.,737 P.2d 789,796 (Alaska 1986) ("parents should not be deprived of the fundamental rights and duties inherent in the parent-child relationship except for grave and weighty reasons" (citation omitted)); Turner v. Pannick,540 P.2d 1051, 1055-56 (Alaska 1975) (Diamond, J., concurring) ("right of parents to nurture and direct the destiny of their children" is "fundamental").Regarciing the seconei eiemeni of the three-pari 'oaiancing tesi, Fio¡-es has, again, established a heightened risk of erroneous deprivation when an indigent party lacks legal representation in a contested custody dispute, where "all of the principalsare likelyto be distraught.'598 P.2d at896; accord lnthe Matterof K.L.J.,813 P.2d at 280 (quoting Flores); see Jenkins v. Handel,10 P.3d 586, 590 n.12 (Alaska 2000) (child custody determinations are the most difficult in the law). The difficulties stem not only from the intense, emotionally-charged backdrop against which custodydecisions are ordinarily made, but also from the amorphous nature of the governing legal standard. See, e.9., Bellottiv. Baird,443 U.S. 622,655 (1979) (Stevens. J., concurring) (noting that the "best interests of the child" standard "provides little real guidance to the judge, and his decision must necessarily reflect personal and societal values and mores"); see also ln re Emilye A. v. Ebrahim A., 9 Cal. App. 4th11LEGALl 276497 1 5.11695,1709 (1992) (observing that "[]ew lay people are equipped to respond to the legal complexity of [custody] proceedings," especially when dealing with the "emotionally devastating potential loss of . . . their relationship with their children").Even putting the potentially wrenching emotional aspects of a child custody proceeding to one side, few lay parents are capable of effectively performing the essential advocacy functions that a custody case requires, absent the assistance of an attorney. The critical responsibilities "of finding the controlling legal principles[,] uncovering the relevant facts, following complex rules of evidence and procedure and presenting the case in a cogent fashion" that informed the ABA's deliberations in adopting Policy #112A (see ABA Report at 9-10 (Appendix A)), are integral features of all contested custody proceedings, which unrepresented pafties have lltlle, 1lIi arìy, Ç-¡-tìa--f- lc- e- u-i l u--.a-.-f. lyll19 uul. öuuusÞ5lully.King v. King, 174 P.3d 659 (Wash. 2007), illustrates the daunting challenges pro se parents can face in child custody disputes. Brenda King was "a housewife with a ninth-grade education and no money [who] was forced to act as her ownattorney during a five-day divorce trial." Jonathan Martin, Courf Ru/es lhaf SpousesAren't Entitled To Public Divorce Lawyers, Seattle Times, Dec. 7, 2007. Mrs. King's then-husband was represented by an attorney. ln representing herself during the course of the bitter dispute over custody of the couple's three children, Mrs. King "gave speeches when she was supposed to ask questions," "didr'ì't subpoena any witnesses," ar'ìd "didn't know how to present evidence against her then-husband, including Child Protective Services reports about him." /d; see a/so 174P.3d at 67376 (Madsen, J., dissenting) (Mrs. King "affirmatively did her own case harm"12 LEGAL12764971'.1because she "was unable to prevent the admission of evidence that a lawyer would have been able to keep out," "could not separate her emotions from her conduct as her own legal representative," and "had exhausted the court's patience" by the end of the trial).Having failed to bring to the attention of the coutl information favorable to her cause that an attorney would routinely present, Mrs. King, a stay-at-home mother who had taken care of her children full-time for the previous 10 years, lost the custody fight. As a result, she was permitted to see her children only every other weekend. Like so many others, the King case demonstrates clearly "how much [is] at stake at trial" for parents in custody disputes "[a]nd how complicated it is for someone without a law degree to present [their] story in any meaningful way in au--o-.u.if.-l^"f^u-u- f f l.,t ñu-a.l.v:itu -tr!^)U.-W,--t-r^i^ilålli^lì-il.trit, ùCf-ri^u^u,r,Li,Ji tL^t^tv r!v-^v^t- uDv^ tAlP^y^v^i;l^tLl^vÅtf, rA14LtL¡iv-r,tt¡,tçr¡ltri-). ,ì,nt lv"titv¡titlCases?, Seattle Times, May 31 ,2007 (internal quotation marks and citationomitted). Frase v. Barnhart, S4O A.2d 114 (Md. 2003), also highlights the significantneed for appointed attorneys who can assist indigent parents seeking to preserve rights to custody of their children. When Deborah Frase, mother of three, was incarcerated on a misdemeanor drug possession charge, her mother placed her youngest son in the care of the Barnhads, a family from the mother's church. Ms. Frase reclaimed her three-year old son six weeks after he went to live with theBarnharts, but the Barnhads then sued for custody of the boy. Unable to obtain free legal assistance, Ms. Frase was forced to represent herself in seeking to retain custody of her child.13LEGALl 2764971 5.1Although Ms. Frase spent hours attempting to prepare her case, she did not depose the Barnharts or othenvise seek discovery regarding their claims, failed to identify salient points of law, could not question witnesses effectively, missed critical objections, and had little understanding of the rules of evidence or procedure. See Brief of Appellant, Frase v. Barnhart,840 A.2d 114 (Md. 2003) (No. 6), at 29-31 (explaining that because Ms. Frase had only a "rudimentary grasp of Maryland's family law" gleaned from her research in the courlhouse library, she "was unable to challenge or limit [the Barnhart's] testimony" about disputed facts and "th[e] case was tried before the master and argued to the circuit court without a word of advocacy about the defining constitutional and family law issues"). The magistrate judge who heard the case ultimately found Ms. Frase to be a fit parent entitled to custociy oÍ her own chiici, but aiso attacheci severai eonejitions to the cusiociy awa¡-cj, including the requirement that the Barnhafts' son be permitted to have regular visitation with Ms. Frase's child.eThe strategic and substantive difficulties experienced by the pro se litigants in the illustrative King v. King and Frase v. Barnharl cases are also seen in the considerations that led this Court to conclude that due process principles under the Alaska Constitution required the appointment of counsel to represent an indigent litigant seeking to oppose the adoption of his child by his ex-wife's new husband ineMs. Frase was able to obtain counsel on appeal, and the Maryland Court ofAppeals vacated the custody determination on the grounds that the conditionsimposed by the lower court impermissibly infringed upon Ms. Frase's fundamentalright as a parent "to make child rearing decisiorìs."

There, in ovefturning the lower court's refusal to appointcounsel, this Court catalogued the unrepresented father's missteps in theproceedings below, including that he.failed to show the lower courl that garnishment of his income by theState was the functional equivalent of voluntary payments for thepurpose of satisfying his child support obligation (813 P.2d at 281);.failed to seek correction of the trial court's erroneous determination thathis indigency was not a justifiable cause for his failure to pay childsupporl, although the applicable Alaska statute -- AS 25.23.050(aX2) --expressly provides otheruuise (id. );.failed to effectively advance the argument that his indigency and lack oflegal sophistication, rather than a lack of care or concern, explained theapparent "half-heartedness" that characterized his attempts to maintaincontact with his child (/d.);.failed in his attempt to introduce documentary evidence that wouldhave demonstrated his continuing efforls to locate his daughter,Lu^u^u^d.u.^Þ^u +llLlU^l E^.:,v:ll^u^v^! ^tL-u .v^rt.,^.l^-> ñ| !^1+J'- ^iJrral-n,vnçrl!rr!)r calrrr¡Lt!frrasrnrfiLnrovfqaLrvl v \/rirvl'l,\t'.failed to object to the introduction of prejudicial evidence by his formerspouse because he did not know how to do so properly (id.); ando prejudiced his own case by his inability to articulate his interests orexplain his actions in a coherent and contextually appropriate manner(id. at281-82).These are all matters that this Court recognized would have been dramaticallydifferent if the unrepresented father had been provided an attorney, leading theCouft to conclude that "[o]verall, this case clearly demonstrates the need forappointed counsel." Id. at282.The foregoing authorities demonstrate that the parental rights implicated bychild custody determinations are fundamental, and the risks posed to those rightswhen an unrepresented indigent parent must litigate a contested custody proceeding15LEGALl 2764971 5.1against a party who is represented are severe. As to the final factor, the State's interest, this Court noted in ln the Matter of K.L.J., supra, when a father opposed the adoption of his child by his ex-wife's new husband, that "[flirst and foremost, the state has an interest in the children" and "[t]o this end, the state shares the parent's interest in an accurate and just decision; the interests of both the state and the parent in the availability of appointed counsel coincide here." 813 P.2d at 279-80 (citation omitted). Accordingly, "[t]he state's interest in its citizens receiving a just determination on such a fundamental issue cannot be open to question." Id. at 280. ln child custody matters like the case at bar, the interests of the State and the parent in an accurate and just determination similarly coincide.While the State also maintains a valid countervailing concern for the costsa--5^s^L-:l-ç¡l^ai.[-e,L:!¡L wl[f I a--P.^P^u:-lil:l^l.-lf lg u^^u,u,^il^Þ^ui t ít^\J-l il^lri\iJ^ra9^ç+rrr ilir+r¡ìvÂc^lr^rL+Ðê iinlr íLirriiolù v¡nvnrrfra\iv^lrr irh¡rav, Â\FuÈ,Ârsubmits that, as this Courl stated in ln the Matter of K.L.J., "'though the State's pecuniary interest is legitimate, it is hardly significant enough to overcome private interests as important as those here[.]"' ld. at 280 (citations omitted).Because the three factors of the balancing test suppod a conclusion that due process requires the appointment of counsel in cases such as this one, the ABA respectfully suggests that the distinction between F/ores and the case at bar -- i.e., that Mr. Olson's former spouse was represented by a privaúe attorney in theproceeding below - should not prevent a conclusion that the critical strategic and16LEGALl 2764971 5.1substantive disadvantages for the unrepresented indigent parent are precisely thesame in each situation.loB.

See Dep't of Health & Soc. Serys. v.

Brown,687 P.2d 264 (Alaska1984). Brown states, in pertinent partFirst, it must be determined at the outset what weight should be afforded the constitutional interest impaired by the challenged enactment. The nature of the interest is the most important variable in fixing the appropriate level of review. Thus, the initial inquiry underArlicle I, section 1 ... goestothe level of scrutiny. ... Depending onthe primacy of the interest involved, the state will have a greater or lesser burden in justifying its legislation.Second, an examination must be undertaken of the purposes served by the challenged statute. Depending on the level of review determined, the state may be required to show only that its objectives were legitimate, at the low end of the continuum, or, at the high end of the scale, that the legislation was motivated by a compelling state interest.Id. at 269i accord State v.

As discussed above, the fundamental nature of a parent's interest in exertingcontrol over the upbringing of his or her child has been repeatedly acknowledged bythis Court. E.g., tn re Adoption of A.F.M., 15 P.3d at 268; In the Matter of K.L.J., 813 P.2d a|279,283; S.J. v. L.T.,737 P.2d at 796; Flores, 598 P.3d at 895 (citingauthorities). A law failing to accord that fundamental interest equal weight asbetween similarly-situated parents must be justified by a compelling state interest.Brown, supra', see gene ralty Herrick's Aero-Auto-Aqua Repair Serv. v. Deparfmentof Transp. & Pub. Facilities, T54 P.2d 1111, 1114 (Alaska 19BB) ("The burden on the State increases in proportion to the primacy of the interest involved. Eventually thisburden reaches the equivalent of the federal compelling state interest test in those1BLEGALl 2764971 5.1cases where fundamental rights ... are at issue." (Citation omitted.)). Here, there is no compelling state interest that might justify denying one indigent parent a right to counsel where the adversary parent is represented by a private attorney, while granting that right to another indigent parent whose adversary is represented by a public sector attorney.AS 44.21.410(aX4) codified the ruling in F/ores that an indigent party is entitled to counsel in a child custody proceeding if the other parly is represented by counsel from a public agency,t' That legislative action, however, does not constitute a justification or provide a rationale for refusing a similarly-situated indigent parent appointed counsel based solely on the happenstance that the adversary pafty's counsel is private rather than public.

Those same daunting obstacles are faced by an unrepresented parent regardless of whether the lawyer representing the parent's adversary is public or private.

THE APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL FOR AN ¡NDIGENT LITIGANTIN A CONTESTED CUSTODY PROCEEDING WILL FOSTER FA¡RER, MORE RELIABLE OUTCOMES, ENHANCE JUDICIAL ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY, AND PRESERVE THE NEUTRALITY OF THE JUDICIAL ROLE A recurring theme in the Report of the Presidential Task Force on Access toCivil Justice that resulted in adoption of ABA Policy #112A in 2006 is the problem ofunequaljustice under law, as routinely encountered by those who lack the economicmeans to secure legal representation when their rights or interests are placed at risk¿uil-lu-^u.g.-fi^ I iUi.-lu^ :lf^;lláu:a^iu:.v,^g^s u^íl u^+l,lLtt^r-t ^P-l;.t,v^cål^tc ^y^ø-uiiL^arçÐ valr iLhlaltt \QrLíacirats. nÂùc tLlrratv TraqcrrL\- Fr rvlrrrv-v-¡ãobserved:On a regular basis, the judiciary witnesses the helplessness of unrepresented parties appearing in their courtrooms and the unequal contest when those litigants confront well-counseled opponents. Judges deeply committed to reaching just decisions too often must worry about whether they delivered injustice instead of justice in such cases because what they heard in court was a one-sided version of the law and facts.ABA Policy #1124, Report at 7.The serious, real-world implications of this phenomenon have beenspecifically, and repeatedly, acknowledged within the context of child custody cases,in which fundamental parental rights may hang in the balance. Thus, althoughdeclining to find a categorical federal due process right to counsel in a termination-of-parental-rights case in Lasslfe r v. Department of Socla/ Services of Durham20 1EGA1127649715 1County, 452 U.S. lB (1981), Justice Stewad, in his opinion for the majority,observedlf, as our adversary system presupposes, accurate and just results are most likely to be obtained through the equal contest of opposed interests, the State's interest in the child's welfare may perhaps best be served by a hearing in which both the parent and the State acting for the child are represented by counsel, without whom the contest of interests may become unwholesomely unequal.ld.at28. ln a similarvein, in Frase v. Barnhaft, supra, in concurring inthe majority'sdecision favorable to the unrepresented mother on the merits of the custody disputebut criticizing the majority's refusal to resolve the rightto-counsel issue, JudgeCathell of the Maryland Court of Appeals candidly acknowledged that anunrepresented parent, "when opposed by competent counsel for the opposing party(sometimes opposed by an organ of the State with its legions of lawyers), isnormally not afforded the equal protection of the laws, i.e., an equal access to justiceto which all citizens are entitled -- in spite of the efforts of this Courl to afford thatequality." 840 A.2d at 134-35 (Cathell, J., with whom Bell, C.J. and Eldridgê, J.,joined, concurring in the result).1212 As sixteen retired Washíngton State Court Judges asseded in an amicus brieffiled in the Washington State Supreme Coutl:fllndigent persons without counsel receive less favorable outcomes dramatically more often that those with counsel.

The types of legal errors that infected the proceedings in the trial courl in tn the Matter of K.L.J., sLlpra, could have been avoided had the appellant had the benefit of appointed counsel, as this Court expressly acknowledged. 813 P.2d aI281-82; see a/so Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 44 (Blackmun, J., with whom Brennan and Marshall, JJ., ioined, dissenting) ("The provision of counsel for the parent would not alter the character of the proceeding,which is already adversarial, formal, and quintessentially legal. lt, however, woulddiminish the prospect of an erroneous termination, a prospect that is inherently suostaniiai, given the gross eiisparity in power anci i-esoui-ees 'oetweei¡ the State and an uncounseled indigent parent."

Thus, as Justice Blackmun observed in dissenting in Lassifer from the majority's holding that case-by-case appellate review of parental neglect actions involving an unrepresented defendant should suffice to vindicate due process concerns:22LEGALl 2764971 5.1The pleadings and transcript of an uncounseled termination proceeding at most will show the obvious blunders and omissions of the defendant parent. Determining the difference legal representation would have made becomes possible only through imagination, investigation, andlegal research focused on the particular case. Even if the reviewingcouft can embark on such an enterprise in each case, it might be hardpressed to discern the significance of failures to challenge the State's evidence or to develop a satisfactory defense. Such failures, however, often cut to the essence of the fairness of the trial[.]"452 U.S. at 51. This Court expressly relied upon this reasoning in rejecting a case-by-case approach to the determination of the right to appointed counsel in In theMatter of K.L.J., 813 P.2d at 282 n.6, and instead ruled in favor of a categorical rightfor indigent litigants in the circumstances of that case. ln order to enhance fairnessand reliability, and to increase the public's awareness of such enhanced fairness and reliability,l3 the right to appointment of counsel on behalf of an indigent party inaü chiicj custociy proceeciings in which the aciversar-y paÌ-ty has an atioi'ney shouicisimilarly be recognized. This would benefit not only the unrepresented litigant, but the judicial processas a whole. While the prejudice suffered by an indigent parent whose request for appointed counsel is denied cannot be overstated, the unsatisfactory experiences ofthe judges who must preside over the ensuing proceedings also should beconsidered. No voices have been more outspoken with respect to the difficulties presented for the judiciary in those instances than those of jurists themselves.13 See, e.g., tndiana v.

WHEN CONSIDERING A REQUEST FOR RULE 60(b) RELIEF, A COURT'S ANALYSIS SHOULD BE CASE-SPECIFIC AND INFORMED BY EQUITABLE PRINCIPLESPaul A. Howell has been on Florida's death row since 1998. Through no fault of his own, no federal court has ever formally reviewed the constitutionality of his state conviction and sentence. First, his post-conviction counsel failed to file Mr. Howell's habeas petition within AEDPA's one-year limitations period. And second, when Mr. Howell requested equitable tolling of the limitations period, the district court applied the Eleventh Circuit's6equitable tolling rubric by which it was then bound, but which this Court later rejected in Holland v. Florida, 130 S. Ct. 2549 (2010). Mr. Howell now appeals to equity again, seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(6) based on the change in law announced in Holland, so that he may present the merits of his equitable tolling argument and, ultimately, of his habeas claims.Rule 60(b) permits federal district courts to relieve a party from final judgment for any of five enumerated reasons or for "any other reason that justifies relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). See also, Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863-64 (1988) (Rule 60(b)(6) does not particularize factors that justify relief but provides courts with authority adequate to enable them, in extraordinary circumstances, to vacate judgments when appropriate to accomplish justice); Marrero Pichardo v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir. 2004) (Rule 60(b)(6) "confers broad discretion on the trial court to grant relief when appropriate to accomplish justice" and "constitutes a grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular case" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).This Court recognized the need for such flexible equitable tools in its landmark decision in Holland, where it remarked that "often the exercise of a court's equity powers . . . must be made on a case-bycase basis." Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).7The ABA has long urged the use of flexible doctrines like Rule 60(b)(6) as a backstop for protecting due process rights, particularly in the capital context.9 It now requests that the Court reaffirm that lower courts must conduct a thorough and fact-sensitive analysis before denying requests for Rule 60(b) equitable relief.A. The Eleventh Circuit's Rule 60(b) Analysis Was Based on a Misreading of This Court's PrecedentUnlike other federal courts, the Eleventh Circuit based its denial of Mr. Howell's Rule 60(b) motion on its rigid understanding of Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005). In doing so, the Eleventh Circuit viewed this Court's rejection in Holland of its equitable tolling standard--the standard that had frustrated Mr. Howell's earlier attempts to obtain equitable relief--as no more than a "change in the interpretation of the statute of limitations for a federal habeas petition." Howell v. Sec'y, Fla., Dep't of Corrs., 730 F.3d 1257, 1260 (11th Cir. 2013). That is, the Eleventh Circuit interpreted Holland as effecting the same sort of change in the law that this Court held insufficient for Rule 60(b) relief in Gonzalez.9 E.g., ABA Policy #115E (adopted February 1990) (stressing,inter alia, the need for "adequate and sufficient tollingprovisions to permit full and fair consideration of a petitioner'sclaims in state court, federal court, and the United StatesSupremeCourt"),availableathttp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/directories/policy/1990_my_115e.authcheckdam.pdf.8The ABA respectfully asserts that the Eleventh Circuit failed to appreciate the magnitude of the change in the law that this Court mandated in Holland: Holland did not simply calibrate a cog in AEDPA's timing mechanisms; it provided a safety valve for those extraordinary cases when the mechanisms malfunction. The Eleventh Circuit's failure to recognize this ignores the very equitable principles Holland represents.At issue in Holland was whether and when a habeas petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling of AEDPA's statute of limitations. In concluding that equitable tolling was indeed available, the Court applied the "`rebuttable presumption' in favor `of equitable tolling.'" Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2552 (quoting Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1990)). It explained that "the presumption's strength is reinforced . . . by the fact that `equitable principles' have traditionally `governed' the substantive habeas law." Id. (quoting Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 693 (2008)). And consistent with these equitable principles, the Court rejected the Eleventh Circuit's equitable tolling rubric as "too rigid," and replaced it with a case-bycase, fact-sensitive analysis. Id. at 2554.Instead of recognizing the significance of the legal change effected by Holland, however, the Eleventh Circuit simply equated Holland with Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U.S. 4 (2000). Artuz--the underlying case in Gonzalez--addressed when, under AEDPA's timing provisions, a post-conviction filing in state court is "properly filed" under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2)9and, hence, tolls the federal limitations period. See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 527. The change of law at issue in Gonzalez, thus, involved Artuz's statutory interpretation of a timing mechanism that, when coupled with petitioner Gonzalez's lack of diligence, did not constitute the sort of "extraordinary circumstance" required under Rule 60(b). Id. at 53638.The decisions in Holland and Artuz both facially implicate AEDPA's statute of limitations, but they do not implicate the same mechanisms. Artuz decided between possible interpretations of when an appeal is "properly filed"; Holland resolved fundamental questions concerning the federal courts' equitable powers in the context of collateral review. Artuz was about drawing a line; Holland aimed to mitigate the "evils of archaic rigidity" that can sometimes flow from "more absolute legal rules." Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563. The Eleventh Circuit therefore erred in equating Artuz and Holland and applying Gonzalez as though it controlled Mr. Howell's case.Other courts have not read Gonzalez so rigidly. The Sixth Circuit, for example, distinguished it in Thompson v. Bell, 580 F.3d 423, 442 (6th Cir. 2009), a case involving a change in Tennessee state law concerning exhaustion of appeals. In addressing the district court's denial of a capital petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the district court erred when it mechanistically followed Gonzalez, instead of evaluating the change in Tennessee law, the policies implicated, and whether10a failure to recognize the change as extraordinarywould disserve the important interest in comity thatis enshrined in AEDPA. Id. at 442-43. Determiningthat the change in law, coupled with the relevantcircumstances,constitutedextraordinarycircumstances under Rule 60(b), the Sixth Circuitspecifically noted this Court's "admonition" that"`[c]onventional notions of finality of litigation haveno place where life or liberty is at stake andinfringement of constitutional rights is alleged.'" Id.at 444 (quoting Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1,8 (1963)).The Ninth Circuit also properly understood the flexible, holistic analysis required under Rule 60(b). In Jones v. Ryan, 733 F.3d 825 (9th Cir. 2013), the court stated, "[w]e have held that `the proper course when analyzing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion predicated on an intervening change in the law is to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the specific motion before the court.'" Id. at 839 (quoting Phelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. 2009)).10 The court then evaluated the petitioner's arguments "in light of the six factors articulated in Phelps." Id. The Ninth Circuit ultimately concluded that the change announced in Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012), on which the petitioner had relied, did not provide "`the truly extraordinary circumstances necessary to reopen [petitioner's] case.'" Jones, 73310 The Ninth Circuit undertook this task "in order to expedite and promote a full review," notwithstanding that it had determined that petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion was an impermissible successive habeas petition. Jones, 733 F.3d at 835, 838.11F.3d at 839 (quoting Phelps, 569 F.3d at 1133).11 However, the Ninth Circuit's use of a multi-factor test to "`evaluate the circumstances surrounding the specific motion,'" id., before it reached this conclusion runs contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's reliance on Gonzalez and lack of case-specific inquiry into the circumstances underlying Mr. Howell's motion. See also Diaz v. Stephens, 731 F.3d 370, 376-77 (5th Cir. 2013) (applying multiple equitable factors in determining whether change in law and relevant circumstances constituted extraordinary circumstances under Rule 60(b)).B. This Case Should Be Remanded to the District Court for Consideration of All Relevant Circumstances Underlying Mr. Howell's Request for Rule 60(b) ReliefFocused narrowly on Gonzalez, the district court and the Eleventh Circuit did not consider the facts and circumstances underlying Mr. Howell's request for relief. Those courts should have conducted a flexible, context-specific inquiry into whether the change in law wrought by Holland, together with the relevant circumstances of Mr. Howell's particular case, constituted exceptional circumstances under Rule 60(b). This context, the ABA respectfully asserts, should include consideration of the defects in Florida's capital counsel system at the time Mr.11 But see Barnett v. Roper, 941 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1120-21 (E.D. Mo. 2013) (holding that the change in law brought by Martinez, coupled with the capital nature of the case, amounted to extraordinary circumstances requiring petitioner's case to be reopened under Rule 60(b) and reviewed on the merits).12Howell first sought collateral review, together with the nature of Mr. Howell's punishment, in order "to do justice in a particular case." Marrero Pichardo, 374 F.3d at 55. These factors justify a remand to the district court with instructions to conduct the required evaluation.1. When Mr. Howell first sought equitable tolling of AEDPA's limitations period in 2004, the district court denied the request. It did so on the basis of the Eleventh Circuit's pre-Holland standard, which this Court later described as "overly rigid" and "difficult to reconcile with more general equitable principles." Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563, 2565. That standard "fail[ed] to recognize that, at least sometimes, professional misconduct that fails to meet [it] could nonetheless amount to egregious behavior and create an extraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable tolling." Id. at 2563 (emphasis added).As Justice Alito explained in his concurrence in Holland, "the AEDPA statute of limitations may be tolled if the missed deadline results from attorney misconduct that is not constructively attributable to the petitioner." Id. at 2568. See also Baldayaque v. United States, 338 F.3d 145, 154 (2d Cir. 2003) (Jacobs, J., concurring) ("[W]hen an agent acts in a manner completely adverse to the principal's interest, the principal is not charged with [the] agent's misdeeds." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Here, Mr. Howell has alleged facts that colorably suggest misconduct of this magnitude. For example, Mr. Howell's attorney's first communication with him did not occur until13"almost seven months after her appointment and two weeks after the deadline to file [Mr.] Howell's federal habeas petition had passed." Am. to Order on Emergency Mot. for Relief from J., Howell v. Crews, No. 4:04-cv-00299/MCR (Mar. 1, 2013), at 4. In an analogous situation, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the attorney's complete "fail[ure] to prepare and file" a petition, despite being retained nearly a year prior to the deadline, was an "extraordinary circumstance beyond [petitioner's] control" that justified tolling the AEDPA deadline. Spitsyn v. Moore, 345 F.3d 796, 801-02 (9th Cir. 2003).Similarly, Mr. Howell should have been permitted to present the facts and circumstances underlying his motion to demonstrate why his case is worthy of Rule 60(b) relief.2. Review of Mr. Howell's request for Rule 60(b) relief is also merited because of the state of Florida's capital counsel system during the time period when counsel was appointed for Mr. Howell.12 At that time, as now, Florida appointed post-conviction attorneys for indigent defendants and mandated experiential qualifications for these attorneys.13 The12 See generally Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy, supra note 7.13 Fla.

Stat. § 27.704(2) (1999) ("A private counsel or public defender under contract with the regional counsel must have at least 3 years' experience in the practice of criminal law, and, prior to the contract, must have participated in at least five felony jury trials, five felony appeals, or five capital postconviction evidentiary hearings or any combination of at least five of such14attorneys were not, however, required todemonstrate that they possessed the specific skillsand knowledge necessary to provide a competentdefense, nor were they required to receivespecialized training on the defense of capital cases,in contrast to the ABA's recommendations.14 As aresult, appointed capital counsel often made errorssuch as missing state post-conviction or habeas filingdeadlines.15Specifically, the ABA FloridaAssessment Team Report noted twelve separatecases in which state post-conviction motions orfederal habeas corpus petitions were filed betweentwo months to three years after the applicable filingdeadline.16The ABA Assessment Report also recounted public comments by Florida Supreme Court Justices.proceedings.")

The trial court must issue an order of appointment which contains specific findings that the appointed counsel meets the statutory requirements and has the high ethical standards necessary to represent a person sentenced to death.") (current version identical).14 ABA 1989 Guidelines, supra note 4, at 961, 976; ABA Policy #115E, supra note 9.15 See Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy, supra note 7, at 183 (citing numerous sources).16 Id.

Florida, 549 U.S. 327 (2006), (No. 05-8820), 2006 WL 1858832, at *1519).15For example, Justice Raoul Cantero stated that attorneys from the state's registry list who handled collateral death penalty appeals performed "`[s]ome of the worst lawyering'" he had seen.17 And Chief Justice Barbara Pariente stated that the court had "observed deficiencies" in registry counsel and endorsed "the need for increased standards for registry counsel, as well as a continuing system of screening and monitoring to ensure minimum levels of competence."18Other reports have cited numerous examples of poor trial lawyering throughout the 1990s, focusing on errors made by private attorneys. In one case, the trial judge had no choice but to remove two defense lawyers because of their deficient performance.19 As also reported:Even more troubling are accounts of the representation provided by the private `registry attorneys' in Florida's northern district. Lawyers working with that office have admitted they were unqualified, missed federal filing deadlines (apparently because they were unaware of them), and filed petitions containing no citations to the trial or appellate record or any judicial17 Id. at 183-84 (citing Marc Caputo, Justice Blasts Lawyers Over Death Row Appeals, Miami Herald, Jan. 28, 2005).18 Id. at 184 (citing Gary Blankenship, Registry Lawyers Defended at Committee Meeting, Fla. Bar News, Apr. 1, 2005).19 See, e.g., Christopher Slobogin, The Death Penalty in Florida, 1 Elon L. Rev. 17, 40-41 (2009).16authority; some, apparently overwhelmed, have simply `bailed out' of their assigned case.20As Justice Cantero stated, "an attorney familiar with a few burglary trials doesn't have the skills to replace someone devoted to the highly specialized Death Row appeals process, which takes years to learn and master."21In considering these and other post-conviction counsel "deficiencies," the unique nature of the death penalty itself provides critical context. As the ABA has concluded:Where human life is at stake, the federal courts' ability to reach and determine the merits of federal constitutional claims should be at the maximum. That unintentional counsel error could bar--and has barred--consideration of possibly meritorious claims in death penalty cases is unacceptable in a criminal justice system that values its integrity.22In Mr. Howell's case, Judge Barkett, a member of the Eleventh Circuit panel--who was also a member of the ABA's 1990 Task Force on habeas and the20 Id. at 41-42 (internal citation omitted). 21 Caputo, Justice Blasts Lawyers Over Death Row Appeals, supra note 17. 22 ABA Criminal Justice Section, Toward a More Just and Effective System of Review in State Death Penalty Cases, supra note 8, at 28.17death penalty--stated her continuing belief "that it is unconstitutional and immoral for death row inmates to lose a fundamental constitutional right because of their attorney's errors, especially when they are as egregious as those we deal with here." Howell, 730 F.3d at 1262 (Barkett, J., concurring).Mr. Howell's case is both a product and an example of a systemic failure. Florida did not appoint Mr. Howell post-conviction counsel until after six months of his one-year AEDPA filing period had already run. That attorney, in her first capital case, then waited to file the AEDPA motion until after its statute of limitations had passed. Apparently without conducting legal research, she assumed the limitations period had been tolled when she filed a motion in state court for an extension of time in which to file a post-conviction motion.

 I. CONGRESS'S BLOCKING OF NON-DISCRETIONARY COLASVIOLATES THE COMPENSATION CLAUSE The Compensation Clause provides that judges shall "receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office." U.S. Const. Art. III, § 1. A fundamental purpose of the Compensation Clause is to protect judicial pay from diminution through the political process. Through the Ethics Reform Act, Congress provided federal judges with an automatic, non-discretionary COLA whenever General Schedule employees also receive one in order to protect judicial salaries from diminution by inflation. See 28 U.S.C. § 461(a). Under the Act, "each [federal judicial] salary rate . . . shall be adjusted by an amount . . . as determined under section 704(a)(1)" of the Act,which provides that judicial salaries are to be adjusted annually by reference to the Employment Cost Index (reflecting inflation of private-sector salaries) and annualnon-discretionary salary adjustments for General Schedule employees (i.e., federalcivil servants). 28 U.S.C. § 461(a)(1); see also 5 U.S.C. § 5318 note. Congress's 2001 amendment of Section 140 did not affect, much less alter, this regime, because the Ethics Reform Act was a "specific[] authoriz[ation]" of appropriations for federal judicial pay enacted "[Jafter" Section 140. Pub. L. No. 97-92, § 140, 95Stat. 1183, 1200 (Dec. 15, 1981). It is thus exempt from Section 140 by its express terms. See Br. at 40-43.The history of the Ethics Reform Act confirms that Congress intended toprotect the federal judiciary from the political process. As explained byCongressman Fazio, one of the Act's sponsors, Congress expected that the Actwould "remove [judicial] salaries from their current vulnerability for politicaldemagoguery. Our objective is to maintain fair annual COLA's." 135 Cong. Rec. H29,483 (1989). Congressman Kastenmeier, chair of a key subcommitteeinvolved in the Act's passage, praised the Act's "provisions relating to a salaryincrease for Federal Judges [and] automatic COLA's for judges." Jd. at H29,497.Further, Congress inextricably linked judicial COLAs with other provisions in theAct that sharply reduced the ability of judges to earn outside income. See, e.g., id. at H29,484 (Congresswoman Martin stating, "[t]he Ethics Reform Act of 1989 is acomprehensive and interrelated package that either rises or falls on its merits -- one bill, indivisible.'').In light of Congress's express purpose to establish judicial COLAs as an "automatic" mechanism to ensure that judicial salaries keep pace with inflation, the subsequent blocking of COLAs when General Schedule employees have received them has led to a dramatic decrease in judicial pay and runs afoul of the Compensation Clause. A federal district court judge's salary of $40,000 in 1969 would have a value of $250,480 in 2012. In contrast, that judge's 2012 salary is $174,000. Thus, in real terms, a federal district judge's salary declinedapproximately 31 percent from 1969 to 2012.'° When this Court in Williams first considered the interaction between theEthics Reform Act and the Compensation Clause, it concluded that its hands were tied by the Supreme Court's decision in Will. According to the divided panel in Williams, Will held that the dispositive factor in the constitutionality of a Congressional repeal of "a statutorily-mandated judicial pay increase" is "the timing of the repeal action." 240 F.3d at 1029 (emphasis in the original). That is, according to the Williams majority, the Supreme Court in Will held that a rescission by Congress of a planned "automatic" pay increase for judges was not a'° Statistics regarding inflation and cost-of-living were compiled by using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator, http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl.violation of Article III if the pay increase had not yet "vested" when the President and Congress blocked it by statute. Jd. (citing Will, 449 U.S. at 229). The Williams majority reasoned that Will thus established that Congress can "prevent a planned increase in judicial compensation" without running afoul of the Compensation Clause so long as it "do[es] so before the date that the pay increase actually becomes `due and payable' as part of the judges' compensation package." Id. (quoting Will, 449 U.S. at 229).In so holding, the Williams panel overlooked significant differences between the Ethics Reform Act and the "compensation package" at issue in Will. For one, unlike the Ethics Reform Act, the legislation analyzed in Will did not establish automatic judicial salary adjustments. The salary adjustments were based on discretionary civil service adjustments. See Will, 449 U.S. at 203-04. For another, the judicial salary adjustments in Will were not part of a political bargain that limited judges' outside income, as are the COLAs at issue here. See, e.g., 135 Cong. Rec. at H29,484. And the Williams majority overlooked that, by the operation of inflation, refusal to permit a COLA necessarily reduces real judicial pay. Congress's blocking of non-discretionary COLAs at issue here thus does not repeal a discretionary determination to increase pay; rather, it constitutes a diminution of judicial compensation automatically payable pursuant to the EthicsReform Act. Will is therefore inapposite, and this Court should overrule its prior holding in Williams.This diminution of judicial pay, moreover, has reached a crisis point, creating an increasing threat to judicial independence and quality. As explained below, this threat will only increase and its pace quicken unless Williams is overruled and the Ethics Reform Act is permitted to operate as intended. Ii. THE CONTINUING EROSION OF JUDICIAL PAY SEVERELYTHREATENS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE Congress's repeated departures from the mandate of the Ethics Reform Act severely threaten judicial independence. Indeed, this systematic erosion of judicial compensation has forced judges to engage the political process, accelerated judicial attrition, and imminently risks diminishing the nation's ability to recruit the highest quality jurists--including jurists of minority and other diverse backgrounds. At the same time, delays in filling judicial vacancies and exploding case filings have placed increasingly heavier burdens on federal judges. This dual ratchet of eroding pay and growing demands threatens to subordinate the judiciary to Congress, in direct contravention of the Constitution. A. The Threat To Judicial Independence Is Grave The maintenance of an independent judiciary has been a cornerstone of American democracy since its inception. See O'Donoghue v. United States, 289 U.S. 516, 531 (1933) (linking the constitutional protection of an independent10Judiciary to the Declaration of Independence's reference to King George III making "`judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries"). The Constitution ensured the independence of the judiciary by granting federal judges lifetime tenure upon good behavior and by prohibiting diminution of judicial compensation. U.S. Const., Art. III, § 1; see THE FEDERALIST No. 79, at 472 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed. 1961) ("[n]ext to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support"). These protections were intended "to insulate the independent judiciary from the power of the other branches." Paul M. Bator, The Constitution as Architecture: Legislative and Administrative Courts Under Article IIT, 65 IND. L.J. 233, 258 (1990).Yet the judiciary is "beyond comparison the weakest of the three" branches of government because it has "no influence over either the sword or the purse." THE FEDERALIST NO. 78, at 465-66 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed. 1961). The Framers understood that Congress's failure to adjust judges' salaries for inflation could imperil judicial independence and quality. Alexander Hamilton observed that, as a result of "fluctuations in the value of money" over the life tenure of judges, "a stipend, which would be very sufficient at their first appointment, [could] become too small in the progress of their service." THE FEDERALIST NO. 79, at 473 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed. 1961).1]Hamilton's fear that inflation might ultimately render judicial salaries "penurious and inadequate," and thus weaken the judicial branch, now threatens to become a reality. Id.Indeed, Congress's repeated blocking of non-discretionary COLAs for federal judges threatens to realize Chief Justice Rehnquist's fear of "seriously compromis[ing] the judicial independence fostered by life tenure," Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Judicial Compensation, Statement Before the Nat'l Comm'n on the Pub. Serv. (July 15, 2002) ("Judicial Compensation''), in at least three ways.First, Congress's actions have left federal judges with no choice but to engage the political process in an attempt to secure the compensation to which they are statutorily entitled.'' The Framers recognized that "[i]n the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will." THE FEDERALIST No. 79, at 472 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed. 1961). They therefore expressed concern that "judges might tend to defer unduly to the Congress when that body was considering pay increases." Will, 449 U.S. at 219. These concerns are unquestionably implicated when, as now, judges must "implore Congress to restore fair compensation at the same time those same judges are sitting in review of congressional enactments." Hon. John M. Walker, Jr.,'' The Federal Judges Association has collected recent congressional testimony on the need for higher judicial pay. See http://www. federaljudgesassoc .org/docs.asp?id=16 (last visited July 6, 2012).12Current Threats to Judicial Independence and Appropriate Responses: A Presentation to the American Bar Association, 12 ST. JOHN'S J. LEGAL COMMENT. 45, 55 (1996).Such undue deference threatens not only to upset the Constitution's careful balance of powers among co-equal branches of government, but also to weaken public confidence in the judiciary's independence as a bulwark against legislative overreaching. Indeed, the Compensation Clause reflects a crucial lesson of America's colonial experience: that judges cannot function independently when their livelihood is subject to the whim of political actors. See Will, 449 U.S. at 217-20; Joseph H. Smith, An Independent Judiciary: The Colonial Background, 124 PENN. L. REV. 1104 (1976). Judicial participation in the political process over compensation matters thus threatens to harm public perception of the judiciary's integrity--particularly where Congress may be tempted to withhold COLAs as a response to judicial decisions it disfavors.Second, Congress's departure from the statutory mandate has exacerbated judicial attrition by compelling some judges to leave the bench prematurely for financial reasons. Federal judicial attrition was virtually nonexistent until the last twenty years. Since then, the growing exodus of judges from the federal bench has reached "sobering" proportions. Chief Justice John Roberts, 2006 Year End Report on the Federal Judiciary at 6 (2007) (2006 Year End Report'). As Chief13Justice Roberts explained, "many judges who must attend to their families and futures have no realistic choice except to retire from judicial service and return to private practice" in order to put children through college or to provide for unexpected financial needs. Jd. at 6-7; see also Urgent Need for Action at 14-15. Since Williams was decided more than 11 years ago, 63 federal judges have left the bench and returned to the private sector, with 25 judges resigning in the last five years alone. See AOUSC, Archive of Judicial Vacancies (2001-2012);"* see also 2006 Year End Report at 6-7. "We are in real danger of losing, through a gradual but steady decline, the highly qualified judiciary on which our nation relies." Judicial Security and Independence: Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 110th Cong. 75 (2007) (statement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy).Increasing attrition also affects judicial quality by imposing systemic costs on our judicial branch. The process of recruitment, appointment, and confirmation of new judges can take months or even years. And "[b]ecause it takes time for new Judges to gain [comparable] experience and skills, when an experienced judge leaves the bench, the nation suffers a temporary, but significant, loss in judicial productivity." Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 2002 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary 3 (2003).? Available at http://www.uscourts.gov/JudgesAndJudgeships/Judicial Vacancies/ArchiveOfJudicialVacancies.aspx (last visited July 6, 2012).14Finally, the declining value of judicial compensation risks diminishing the nation's ability to recruit individuals "of the first talents" to the federal bench. 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 429 (Max Farrand rev. ed. 1937) (remarks of General Pinkney). The Will Court recognized that the Compensation Clause was designed to assure "a prospective judge that, in abandoning private practice--more often than not more lucrative than the bench--the compensation of the new post will not diminish." 449 U.S. at 221. By doing so, the Clause historically "served to attract able lawyers to the bench and thereby enhanced the quality of justice." Jd.'? Yet commentators have found "substantial anecdotal evidence suggest[ing] that many of our most talented and experienced lawyers are unwilling to accept nomination to the federal courts" because of concerns about pay. Larry D. Thompson & Charles J. Cooper, The State of the Judiciary: A Corporate Perspective, 95 GEORGETOWN L.J. 1107, 1109 (2007) (citing Urgent Need for Action at 20).> See also Hatter, 532 U.S. at 568; Charles Gardner Geyh & Emily Fieldvan Tassel, The Independence of the Judicial Branch in the New Republic, 74 CHt.KENT L. REV. 31, 42 (1998) (noting that an aim of the Compensation Clause was "to ensure that judges receive salaries commensurate with their status as members of an independent branch of government"); 1 James Kent, Commentaries on American Law 294 (1826) (the guarantees of life tenure and undiminished compensation were designed to "secure a succession of learned men on the bench, who, in consequence of a certain undiminished support, are enabled and induced to quit the lucrative pursuits of private business for the duties of that important station').15The issue is not that prospective appointees expect to become wealthy from Judicial service, but "they [would] expect to receive, in real terms what the job paid when they took it." Fed. Judicial Compensation: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on the Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 110th Cong. 73 (2007) (statement of Justice Samuel Alito) ("Fed.Judicial Compensation"). Although federal judges enjoy the intrinsic rewards ofpublic service, those rewards are not inexhaustible. Congress's actions have created an ever-widening chasm between the real salaries of federal judges andtheir professional peers, including those working in firms, government, and lawschools, and threaten to render judicial compensation "penurious and inadequate," thus "breach[ing] faith with the Constitution." U.S. Comm'n on Exec., Legis. &Jud. Salaries, Report, Quality Leadership: Our Government's Most Precious Asset 189 (1986).This distortion in judicial pay has real--and regrettable--consequences forthe make-up of the federal judiciary. The declining compensation threatens to shrink the pool of prospective judges to a small segment of the profession that can afford to make the financial sacrifice that federal judicial service now requires. As a result, the federal bench is increasingly at risk of becoming /ess representative of the legal profession and of the public at large. In fact, judicial compensation 1s routinely cited as a significant reason why more African American, Asian16American, Latino and Native American candidates may not seek appointment to the federal bench. See, e.g., Letter from Karen K. Narasaki, President, Asian American Justice Center, to Howard L. Berman, Chairman, Subcommittee onCourts, the Internet and Intellectual Property (April 19, 2007);'* see also Coalition of Bar Associations of Color, Resolution Supporting Increase In Federal JudicialCompensation (May 26, 2010) (asserting that "the level of judicial compensation disadvantages minority candidates for the judiciary who often cannot afford the financial sacrifice required to serve as a federal judge"').'° Former Chief Justice Rehnquist succinctly summarized the danger the nation now faces: "Our judges will not continue to represent the diverse face of America if only the well-to-do or the mediocre are willing to become judges."

See generally Urgent Need for Action at 16-18. In 1969, federal judges made more than senior professors and law school deans. 2006 Year End Report at 2.

For example, an Internal Revenue Service lawyer can earn up to $174,000, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawyer can earn up to $212,000, and a Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer can earn up to $222,000. See Fed. Judicial Compensation, 110th Cong. 73-82 (statement of Justice Samuel Alito); see also Fact Sheet (noting that "[m]Jany federal employees can now receive compensation exceeding $200,000 annually"). In many high costof-living areas, the locality-adjusted salaries of some court employees exceed the pay of bankruptcy and magistrate judges and are nearly equivalent to the salaries earned by Article III judges. See Fed. Judicial Compensation, 110th Cong. 81 (statement of Justice Samuel Alito).These trends have not abated since this Court's decision in Williams. Instead, the gulf between the changes in real pay earned by judges and that earned by the average American worker has widened. Addendum la. The Ethics Reform Act was supposed to prevent this outcome by creating a statutory regime, unlike the one at issue in Will, in which salary adjustments would be self-executing and non-discretionary. Nevertheless, Congress refused to authorize the "nondiscretionary" COLAs in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1999. See Br. at 6-7, 9-11. Since Williams, Congress withheld them in 2007, 2010 and 2011 (and withheld COLAs for all federal employees in 2010 and 2011), resulting in an additional six percent20decline in real judicial salaries over those years. If federal judges had received all statutorily required COLAs, circuit and district court judges' salaries would be approximately $262,000 and $247,000, respectively--substantially higher than they are today." Addendum 2a.C. Judicial Workloads Continue To IncreaseThis decline in real judicial compensation has accompanied a dramatic increase in judges' workloads--so judges are now working harder for less pay. Over the last four decades, delays by the political branches in filling judicial vacancies and an explosion in case filings have combined to saddle federal judges with substantially heavier caseloads. There are currently 73 vacancies and 29 judicial emergencies on the federal bench." The total number of civil and criminal cases filed in the district courts has more than tripled over the past 40 years, from 110,778 new filings in 1969 to 367,692 in 2011." Asa result, the average caseload*> The cumulative effect of Congress's repeated denials of COLAs is also substantial: "a district court judge on the bench since 1993 failed to receive a total of $283,100 in statutorily authorized but denied pay. Appellate court judges have lost even more." Fact Sheet.** See Judicial Nominations, Office of Legal Policy, available at http://www .justice.gov/olp/judicialnominations1 12.htm (last visited July 6, 2012); Judicial Emergencies, U.S. Courts, available at http://www.uscourts.gov/ JudgesAndJudgeships/Judicial Vacancies/JudicialEmergencies.aspx (last visited July 6, 2012).° Compare Urgent Need for Action at 18, with Administrative Office of the United States Courts, 2011 Annual Report of the Director: Judicial Business of theUnited States Courts 1, 11 ("AOUSC 2011 Annual Report'), available at21for a federal district court judge increased 77.8 percent, from 339 to 603. The courts of appeals experienced an even larger explosion of case filings. Appellate filings jumped more than fivefold, from 10,709 in 1969 to 55,126 in 2011, with the average caseload for a circuit judge increasing a staggering 176.4 percent, from123 to 340."

Urgent Need for Action at 19.With each passing year, federal judges have adjudicated more cases, and yet have done so in exchange for declining compensation. If, contrary to the protections of the Compensation Clause, this diminution in pay continues, with the result that "judicial appointment ceases to be the capstone of a distinguished career and instead becomes a stepping stone to a lucrative position in private practice, the Framers' goal of a truly independent judiciary will be placed in serious jeopardy." 2006 Year End Report at 6.(continued...)http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/201 1/JudicialBusines s2011.pdf (last visited June 20, 2012).*® The workload statistics were calculated based on the actual number of district court and circuit court judges in office (610 and 162, respectively), not authorized judgeships (677 and 179, respectively).22CONCLUSION For the reasons set forth above, the Court should hold that the Compensation Clause of Article III of the United States Constitution prohibits Congress from withholding the periodic salary adjustments for Article III judges provided in theEthics Reform Act of 1989.23Dated:July 9, 2012Respectfully Submitted,/s/ Lawrence D.

REVIEW IS WARRANTED BECAUSE THE CONTINUING DIMINUTION OF JUDICIAL SALARIES THREATENS THE INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF THE NATION'S JUDICIARYThis Court should grant review to decide whether Congress' withholding of judicial cost-of-living increases established by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 violates the Judicial Compensation Clause, U.S. Const. art. III, § 1.1. Declining Pay Threatens Constitutional Goals. The continuing decline in judicial compensation threatens to undermine the dual objectives of the Compensation Clause. The Clause is the Framers' response to a lesson learned from colonial experience, namely that the judicial branch cannot function effectively if it is beholden to the other branches. See Joseph H. Smith, An Independent Judiciary: The Colonial Background, 124 PENN. L. REV. 1104 (1976). The Framers recognized that the judiciary is "beyond comparison the weakest of the three" branches of government, as it has "no influence over either the sword or the purse." THE FEDERALIST NO. 78, at 484 (Alexander Hamilton) (Henry Cabot Lodge ed. 1888). They included the guarantees of life tenure and undiminished compensation in Article III to ensure the quality and "complete independence of the courts of justice." Ibid.; United States v. Hatter, 532 U.S. 557, 568-569 (2001). As this Court has explained, these two constitutional objectives are "no less7important today than in earlier times." Hatter, 532 U.S. at 569.The Framers understood that Congress' failure to adjust judges' salaries for inflation could also imperil judicial independence and quality. As a result of "fluctuations in the value of money" over the life tenure of judges, Alexander Hamilton observed, "a stipend, which would be very sufficient at their first appointment, [could] become too small in the progress of their service." THE FEDERALIST NO. 79, at 492 (Alexander Hamilton) (Henry Cabot Lodge ed. 1888). Hamilton's fear that inflation might ultimately render judicial salaries "penurious and inadequate," and thus weaken the judicial branch, now threatens to become a reality. Id. at 491-492.Over the last 40 years, Congress has repeatedly tried and failed to develop a legal regime that would achieve the Framers' objectives by removing adjustments to judicial compensation from political debate. See United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 203205 (1980). The core problem with these efforts has been the congressional decision to link judicial salary adjustments to similar adjustments for members of Congress and other government officials.99 Congress reduced or rejected several COLAs under both The Federal Salary Act, Pub. L. No. 90-206, 81 Stat. 613, 624 (1967), and The Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1975, Pub. L. No. 94-82, 89 Stat. 419. Judicial Pay Erosion at 8. This Court found Congress' revocation of two judicial(Continued on following page)8When judicial and congressional salary adjustments are inextricably intertwined, the shifting political priorities that affect congressional pay invariably affect judicial compensation as well. The Framers' concerns about judicial independence are unquestionably implicated when, for example, judges must "implore Congress to restore fair compensation at the same time those same judges are sitting in review of congressional enactments." Hon. John M. Walker, Jr., Current Threats to Judicial Independence and Appropriate Responses: A Presentation to the American Bar Association, 12 ST. JOHN'S J. LEGAL COMMENT. 45, 55 (1996).2. The Decline in Real Judicial Pay Continues. Congress' repeated failure to insulate judicial compensation from the political process has resulted in substantial reductions in judicial pay.10 In real terms, a federal district judge's salary declined approximately 27 percent from 1969 to 2010.11 TheCOLAs in the 1970s to be unconstitutional because the increases had "vested" before Congress acted. Will, 449 U.S. at 224-229.10 See Richard A. Posner, The Federal Courts 21-34 (2d ed. 1996) (illustrating the decline in the real value of judicial salaries); Comment, Justice for Judges: The Roadblocks on the Path to Judicial Compensation Reform, 55 CATH. U. L. REV. 513, 515 (2006) ("Inflation has decreased judges' purchasing power and ability to maintain a constant standard of living.").11 Statistics regarding inflation and cost-of-living were compiled by using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator, http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/ cpicalc.pl. A salary of $40,000 in 1969 has a value of $237,611 in 2010.9decline in judicial pay is particularly acute when measured against the skyrocketing cost of significant family expenditures for which judges are often personally responsible, particularly housing and college tuition.12 From 1969 to 2006 the real cost of a house increased 42 percent and the real cost of a college education rose more than 126 percent.13While judicial compensation has fallen in real terms since 1969, the average American worker's inflation-adjusted wages have risen 19.5 percent.14 The diminution in judicial income is even more dramatic when compared to the salaries earned by other members of the legal profession--the pool from which federal judges are generally drawn. From 1969 to 2006, partner earnings at American law firms increased 74.1 percent in real terms to an average of $264,000. 2008 CRS Report at 24 (Table 2). Today, at 68 of the nation's 100 largest firms, average profitsper-partner have eclipsed the $1 million mark.15 In many cases, former judicial law clerks earn more in salary and bonuses in their first year in private12 Larry D. Thompson & Charles J. Cooper, The State of the Judiciary: A Corporate Perspective, 95 GEORGETOWN L. J. 1107, 1109 (2007) (citing Urgent Need for Action at 20).13 Id. at 1110. 14 Chief Justice John Roberts, 2006 Year End Report on the Federal Judiciary 3 (2007) ("2006 Year End Report"); Denis Steve Rutkus, CRS Report RL34281, Judicial Salary: Current Issues and Options for Congress (Sept. 16, 2008) ("2008 CRS Report"). 15 AmLaw 100, AMERICAN LAWYER (May 1, 2010).10practice than the federal judges for whom they clerked. See Paul A. Volcker, Judgment Pay, WALL ST. J., Feb. 10, 2007 (Op-Ed).Lawyers who opt for careers in teaching and the government also have fared better than federal judges in real terms. In 1969, federal judges made more than senior professors and law school deans. 2006 Year End Report at 2. Between 1969 and 2006, however, senior professors' real pay at the top 25 law schools rose 114.6 percent to an average of $330,000 and deans' real pay rose 95.7 percent to an average of $430,000. 2008 CRS Report at 24 (Table 2).A number of government lawyers likewise now earn as much or more than Article III judges. For example, an Internal Revenue Service lawyer can earn up to $174,000, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawyer can earn up to $212,000, and a Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer can earn up to $222,000. See Fed. Judicial Compensation: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on the Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 110th Cong. 73-82 (2007) (statement of Justice Samuel Alito). In many high cost-of-living areas, the locality-adjusted salaries of some court employees exceed the pay of bankruptcy and magistrate judges and are nearly equivalent to the salaries earned by Article III judges. Ibid.These trends have not abated since the Federal Circuit's 2001 decision in Williams. Instead, the gulf between the changes in real pay earned by judges and11that earned by the average American worker has widened. App., infra, 1a. The Ethics Reform Act was supposed to prevent this outcome by creating a statutory regime, unlike the one at issue in Will, in which salary adjustments would be self-executing and non-discretionary. The Williams court's misunderstanding of this distinction (see Pet. 21) has enabled Congress to elide the statutory mandate. Congress refused to authorize the "non-discretionary" COLAs in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1999. See Pet. 8-9, 12-13. Since Williams, Congress withheld them in 2007 and 2010, resulting in an additional three percent decline in real judicial salaries over the last three years. If federal judges had received all of the COLAs established by the Ethics Reform Act, circuit and district court judges' salaries would be approximately $262,000 and $247,000, respectively-- substantially higher than they are today. App., infra, 2a.3. Judicial Workloads Continue To Increase. The decline in real judicial compensation over the last 40 years has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in workloads. The total number of civil and criminal cases filed in the district courts has more than tripled during this period, from 110,778 new filings in 1969 to 353,052 in 2009.1616 Compare Urgent Need for Action at 18, with Administrative Office of the United States Courts, 2009 Annual Report of the Director: Judicial Business of the United States Courts 1, 4 ("AOUSC 2009 Annual Report"), available at http://www.uscourts.(Continued on following page)12As a result, the average caseload for a federal district court judge increased 75.2 percent, from 339 to 594. The courts of appeals experienced an even greater increase. Appellate filings jumped more than fivefold, from 10,709 in 1969 to 57,740 in 2009, with the average caseload for a circuit judge increasing 210.5 percent, from 123 to 382.17 Urgent Need for Action at 18-19; AOUSC 2009 Annual Report at 7. Individual judges' caseloads would have risen even more if it were not for the significant contributions of senior judges, who carry substantial caseloads despite retirement from regular active service. Urgent Need for Action at 19.The nature and complexity of federal caseloads also have changed significantly over the last 40 years. Federal statutory causes of action such as RICO, CERCLA, ERISA, CFAA, EEA, new cyber crime and cyber terrorism cases, immigration cases, the liberalization of class action requirements under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, and tightened judicial scrutiny of expert witnesses have all made federal cases progressively more complex in recent years. E.g., Manual for Complex Litigation 4th (Fed. Jud. Ctr. 2004); Referencegov/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/JudicialBusiness.aspx?doc=/uscourts/ Statistics/JudicialBusiness/2009/JudicialBusinespdfversion.pdf (last visited June 10, 2010).17 The workload statistics were calculated based on the actual number of district court and circuit court judges in office (594 and 151, respectively), not authorized judgeships (678 and 169, respectively).13Manual on Scientific Evidence 2d (Fed. Jud. Ctr. 2000). At the same time, new developments in intellectual property, medical science, social media, electronic commerce, and globalization all require judges to apply greater intellectual flexibility and procedural creativity to the cases before them. With each year that passes, federal judges must adjudicate more cases of greater complexity, and yet do so in exchange for declining compensation.4. The Threat To The Judiciary Is Grave. Judicial independence is endangered when federal judges must participate in the political process to obtain cost-of-living adjustments. The Framers expressed concern that "judges might tend to defer unduly to the Congress when that body was considering pay increases." Will, 449 U.S. at 219. Congress' actions under the Ethics Reform Act have left judges no choice but to engage with the legislature over compensation matters.18Judicial independence is also threatened when declining pay forces judges to leave the bench prematurely. Federal judicial attrition was virtually nonexistent until the last twenty years. Since then, "the numbers are sobering." 2006 Year End Report at 6. There has been a growing exodus of federal judges18 The Federal Judges Association has collected recent congressional testimony, including from members of this Court, on the need for higher judicial pay. Available at http://www. federaljudgesassoc.org/docs.asp?id=16 (last visited June 15, 2010).14from the bench, many of whom have returned to private life to put children through college or to provide for unexpected financial needs. 2006 Year End Report at 6-7. Chief Justice Roberts explained that "many judges who must attend to their families and futures have no realistic choice except to retire from judicial service and return to private practice." Ibid. Indeed, since Williams was decided almost 10 years ago, 53 federal judges have left the bench and returned to the private sector, with 15 judges resigning in the last three years alone. See AOUSC, Archive of Judicial Vacancies (2001-2010);19 2006 Year End Report at 6-7. Congress' failure to protect judicial salaries from inflation has "seriously compromise[d] the judicial independence fostered by life tenure." Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Judicial Compensation, Statement Before the Nat'l Comm'n on the Pub. Serv. (July 15, 2002).Judicial attrition likewise undermines the Compensation Clause's goal of ensuring judicial quality. The Will Court recognized that the Compensation Clause was designed to assure "a prospective judge that, in abandoning private practice--more often than not more lucrative than the bench--the compensation of the new post will not diminish." 449 U.S. at 221. By doing so, the Clause historically "served to attract able lawyers to the bench and thereby19 Available at http://www.uscourts.gov/JudgesAndJudgeships/ JudicialVacancies/ArchiveOfJudicialVacancies.aspx (last visited June 15, 2010).15enhance[ ] the quality of justice." Ibid.20 Today, however, "[w]e are in real danger of losing, through a gradual but steady decline, the highly qualified judiciary on which our nation relies." Judicial Security and Independence: Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 110th Cong. 75 (2007) (statement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy).Increasing attrition also affects judicial quality by imposing systemic costs on our judicial system. The process of recruitment, appointment, and confirmation of new judges can take months or even years. And "[b]ecause it takes time for new judges to gain [comparable] experience and skills, when an experienced judge leaves the bench, the nation suffers a temporary, but significant, loss in judicial productivity." Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 2002 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary 3 (2003).Finally, the declining value of judicial compensation has diminished the nation's ability to recruit individuals "of the first talents" to the federal bench. 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 429 (Max Farrand rev. ed. 1937) (remarks of20 See also Hatter, 532 U.S. at 568; Charles Gardner Geyh & Emily Field van Tassel, The Independence of the Judicial Branch in the New Republic, 74 CHI.-KENT L. REV. 31, 42 (1998); 1 James Kent, Commentaries on American Law 294 (1826) (the guarantees of life tenure and undiminished compensation were designed to "secure a succession of learned men on the bench, who, in consequence of a certain undiminished support, are enabled and induced to quit the lucrative pursuits of private business for the duties of that important station").16General Pinkney). Commentators have found "substantial anecdotal evidence suggest[ing] that many of our most talented and experienced lawyers are unwilling to accept nomination to the federal courts" because of concerns about pay. Thompson & Cooper, supra, at 1109. Judicial compensation is also cited as a significant reason why more African American, Asian American, Latino and Native American candidates do not seek appointment to the federal bench. Letter from Karen K. Narasaki, President, Asian American Justice Center, to Howard L. Berman, Chairman, Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property (April 19, 2007). The issue is not that prospective appointees expect to become wealthy from judicial service, but "they do expect to receive, in real terms what the job paid when they took it." Fed. Judicial Compensation Hearing, supra, 110th Cong. at 73 (statement of Justice Samuel Alito).Although federal judges enjoy the intrinsic rewards of public service, those rewards are not inexhaustible. Congress' actions have created an everwidening chasm between the real salaries of federal judges and their professional peers, which threatens to render judicial compensation "penurious and inadequate" and thus "breaches faith with the Constitution." U.S. Comm'n on Exec., Legis. & Jud. Salaries, Report, Quality Leadership: Our Government's Most Precious Asset 189 (1986). Former Chief Justice Rehnquist succinctly summarized the danger the nation now faces: "Our judges will not continue to17represent the diverse face of America if only the wellto-do or the mediocre are willing to become judges." Judicial Compensation, supra.Congress' use of automatic self-executing and non-discretionary annual cost-of-living adjustments in the Ethics Reform Act held the promise of removing judicial compensation from the pressures of politics, but that promise remains unfulfilled. This Court, not a divided court of appeals, should decide whether Congress' diminution of judicial compensation through periodic withholding of cost-of-living adjustments established by the Ethics Reform Act violates the Compensation Clause. For if judicial pay continues to decline, and "judicial appointment ceases to be the capstone of a distinguished career and instead becomes a stepping stone to a lucrative position in private practice, the Framers' goal of a truly independent judiciary will be placed in serious jeopardy." 2006 Year End Report at 6.18CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above and in the petition for a writ of certiorari, the petition should be granted.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: DREW S. DAYS III W. STEPHEN SMITH DEANNE E. MAYNARD JEREMY B. MERKELSONCAROLYN B.

The Fourth Circuit correctly held that under this Court's decision in Miller, no juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole for a crime that reflects transient immaturity rather than irreparable corruption. Curtailing Miller's holding would violate fundamental rule of law principles and call into doubt numerous legislative and judicial state actions that relied upon the Court's substantive rule in Miller.I. THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE UPHELD IN THIS CASEThe rule of law is ingrained in the fabric of American jurisprudence. It is a well-established principle that a constitutional rule is "binding upon the States and, under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution, it must be obeyed." Sims v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 538, 543­544 (1967). The supremacy of this Court's interpretation of the Constitution is beyond question. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803) ("It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is."). That interpretation is binding upon the States. See Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 309 (1821) ("Let it be remembered that the several State legislatures and7judiciaries, are all bound by the solemn obligation of an oath, to support the federal constitution.").As the Founders recognized: "To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them." Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist No. 78. The Court endorsed this foundational standard by its elaboration on the "principles of law." Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868, 889 (2009) (quoting Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765, 793 (2002) (Kennedy, J., concurring)). The legitimacy of the Court's power rests "in the end, upon the respect accorded to its judgments." Ibid. The rule of law only prevails if "a lower court in a system of absolute vertical stare decisis headed by one Supreme Court * * * follows both the words and music of Supreme Court opinion." United States v. Martinez-Cruz, 736 F.3d 999, 1006 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). It is axiomatic that "respect for the rule of law must start with those who are responsible for pronouncing the law." McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 529 (1991) (Marshall, J., dissenting).The Court is thus justifiably loath to overrule its prior decisions. "[Stare decisis's] greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal--the rule of law." Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 378 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring). Stare decisis is "a foundation stone of the rule of law." Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782, 798 (2014). It "promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the ju-8dicial process." Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827 (1991); see also Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 265 (1986) (stare decisis contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process by ensuring that decisions are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Penn. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 84 (1992) ("[N]o judicial system could do society's work if it eyed each issue afresh in every case that raised it. Indeed, the very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable." (citations omitted)).As the Court recently reiterated, overruling prior precedent requires "special justification," which is more than just "an argument that the precedent was wrongly decided." Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2422­2423 (2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2401, 2409 (2015) (departure from Court's precedent requires a "special justification--over and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly decided."). Rather, precedent should not be reconsidered unless it has become "unworkable" or a "doctrinal dinosaur." Kisor, 139 S. Ct. at 2411.The rule of law plays a critical role in this case. The Court in Miller ruled that no juvenile can be sentenced to life without parole, under any sentencing procedure, for a crime that reflects "transient immaturity" of youth rather than "irreparable corruption." Miller, 567 U.S. at 473, 479. This sentencing standard for juveniles has been binding on the States since 2012. The petitioner does not provide any special justification9for reconsidering that precedent; the Miller standard is neither "unworkable" nor a "doctrinal dinosaur."Petitioner argues that the court of appeals here interpreted Montgomery as modifying and substantially expanding the substantive rule in Miller. Not true. The court of appeals was entirely faithful to Miller and Montgomery. Citing Miller, the Court in Montgomery again explained that a life without parole sentence violates the Eighth Amendment except for "the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption." Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734 (citing Miller, 567 U.S. at 479-480). As the court of appeals noted, the Court in Montgomery explained that Miller announced a new "substantive rule of constitutional law" rendering life without parole an unconstitutional penalty for a class of defendants "whose crimes reflect the transient immaturity of youth," as opposed to "irreparable corruption." Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734. Thus, the Court in Montgomery did not modify or expand the Miller standard. It simply held that the Miller standard was a substantive rule of constitutional law and thus, retroactive to collateral challenges to convictions. Ibid.Although a mandatory life without parole sentencing scheme was the factual predicate in Miller, that predicate was not the necessary foundation for the Court's decision in Miller. Instead, it was the recognition that "children are constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing." Miller, 567 U.S. at 471-474. Miller did not turn on the procedure through which a juvenile life without parole sentence is imposed--that is, through a mandatory or discretionary scheme--but upon the nature of the sentence itself, which Miller described as the "harshest possible penalty," and its inherent excessiveness for juveniles whose10crimes reflect the transient immaturity of youth. Id. at 479. That is why Miller repeatedly stated that it "require[d]" sentencers "to take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison"--a requirement that necessarily applies to all juvenile life without parole sentences.The Court in Montgomery acknowledged the specific holding in Miller that "mandatory life-without-parole sentences for children `pose[] too great a risk of disproportionate punishment.'" Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 733 (citing Miller, 567 U.S. at 479). But then it immediately thereafter explained that "Miller requires that before sentencing a juvenile to life without parole, the sentencing judge take into account `how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison'" without distinguishing between mandatory and discretionary sentences. Ibid.The rule of Miller is that lower courts must, as the court of appeals here recognized, not only take into account a juvenile's "age before sentencing him or her to a lifetime in prison," Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734, but cannot impose such a sentence unless the juvenile is the "rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption," rather than transient immaturity, Miller, 567 U.S. at 479-480. That is the substantive rule of constitutional law that Montgomery held retroactive. There is no justifiable basis for the Court to overturn, distinguish, or otherwise alter the rule of law it announced in Miller. To do so would not only weaken the rule of law--but have far-reaching effects for juvenile sentencing schemes implemented by state legisla-11tures and courts throughout the country in reliance upon Miller.II. COURTS AND LEGISLATURES RELIED ON MILLER TO MODIFY THEIR SENTENCING REGIMESThe rule of law "fosters reliance on judicial decisions" when there is "evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles." Payne, 501 U.S. at 827. State courts across the United States have relied on the consistent legal principles of Roper, Graham and now Miller to resentence juveniles sentenced to life without parole. Since Miller, the consensus among States has concretely shifted towards taking the transient immaturity of youth into account in determining whether sentences of life without parole are appropriate under the U.S. Constitution and the respective state constitutions. Any limitation or modification of Miller here could send conflicting signals to the States and upend significant juvenile justice reforms that state legislatures and courts have made in the wake of Miller.The Court's ruling in Miller has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on state legislatures and courts throughout the country. Many states have amended their state laws or drafted new statutes to comply with Miller. Other states have developed protocols for resentencing or for considering parole and release. And in other states, courts have either addressed or continue to embrace the substantive rule of constitutional law decided by the Court. The American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations estimate that approximately 2,500 adults who were convicted as juveniles are impacted by these changes across the country. American Civil Liberties Union, Juvenile Life12Without Parole (Aug. 2, 2019).13 If the rule of law is to retain its vitality, the Court should not disturb its decision in Miller and allow states to continue to apply the Court's teachings as to juvenile sentencing issues through their legislative and legal processes.Since Miller, 28 states and the District of Columbia have now either banned or do not use juvenile life without parole as a sentencing option under any circumstance. See Josh Rovner, Juvenile Life Without Parole: An Overview 2, The Sentencing Project (July 23, 2019).14 When Miller was decided in 2012, this number was just five states. See Montgomery Momentum: Two Years of Progress since Montgomery v. Louisiana, The Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth (Jan. 25, 2018).15 Twenty states and the District of Columbia currently do not have any prisoners serving life without parole for crimes committed as juveniles, because laws have been enacted prohibiting such a sentence or because there are no individuals serving such a sentence. See Rovner, supra at 2.West Virginia's pre-Miller sentencing scheme involved a presumption against parole eligibility, but left it to the jury to "in their discretion recommend mercy," which meant parole eligibility after fifteen years. W. Va. Code Ann. § 62-3-15. After Miller, the West Virginia legislature outlawed juvenile life without parole prospectively and made juveniles currently serving life13 Available at https://www.aclu.org/issues/juvenile-justice/youthincarceration/juvenile-life-without-parole.14 Available at https://perma.cc/82Q6-B549.15 Available at https://perma.cc/R3EV-3FYJ.13without parole eligible for parole after 15 years. Id. §§ 61-11-23, 61-12-13b.Nevada's sentencing scheme, unlike West Virginia, did not involve a presumption in favor of life without parole for juveniles; it was a truly discretionary scheme. Nev. Rev. Stat. § 200.030(4) (2012). Nonetheless, following Miller, the Nevada legislature eliminated juvenile life without parole sentences, id. § 176.025 (2019), and established parole eligibility for most juveniles sentenced to life without parole after 15 years, id. § 213.12135(1)-(2).The majority of youth currently sentenced to life without parole are concentrated in just three states: Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, Facts About Juvenile Life Without Parole (Aug. 2, 2019).16 Each of these states has undertaken significant reforms to come into compliance with Miller. Louisiana has enacted a statute that provides juveniles serving life-without-parole sentences with automatic parole eligibility, unless the district attorney timely seeks life without parole ­ in which case the court must hold an individualized sentencing hearing before reimposing life without parole. La. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 878.1 (2017). Michigan has also begun a process for resentencing juvenile offenders, and, as of 2017, 86 juvenile offenders have been sentenced to a term of years, 47 became immediately eligible for parole, and 22 have been released. See Associated Press, 50-state examination (July 31, 2017).17 According to data from the Pennsylvania Department16 Available at https://perma.cc/9TGS-PQ32.17 Available at https://perma.cc/8WJN-WW83.14of Corrections, 416 of those serving juvenile lifewithout-parole sentences have been resentenced, and 189 have been released. Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, Juvenile Lifers Information (May 7, 2019).18Since Montgomery, at least nine states have banned or modified sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders through legislation and through the state courts. See Associated Press, supra. For example, although a California court had discretion to impose sentences of 25 years to life (with or without parole), California's intermediate court of appeals had interpreted the sentencing guidelines to establish a presumption in favor of life without parole. See People v. Gutierrez, 324 P.3d 245, 254-255 (Cal. 2014). PostMiller, the California Supreme Court determined that this presumption raised "serious constitutional concerns" under Miller, abrogated the lower court decisions that relied on the presumption, and remanded for resentencing, clarifying that sentencing courts must "consider all relevant evidence bearing on the `distinctive attributes of youth' discussed in Miller." Id. at 267, 269. After Miller, the California legislature enacted a statute that allows juveniles sentenced to life without parole to petition for resentencing; after Montgomery, it provided for automatic parole eligibility after 25 years. See Cal. S.B. 394 (amending Cal. P.C. §§ 3051 and 4081). Iowa, Missouri, Utah, Arkansas, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oregon and Washington have all similarly amended their juvenile sentencing laws to comport with Miller.

Marbury, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 177. The Court should reject the petitioner's outlier position and invitation to overrule or limit Miller, which could upend the States' substantial efforts to adhere to the rule of law.CONCLUSIONThe Court should affirm the judgment entered below.Respectfully submitted.CHRISTOPHER M.

A. PROVISIONS OF IIRIRA MUST BE CONSTRUED TO AFFORD RESPONDENTS A FORUM FOR MEANINGFUL JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS.1. In construing congressional enactments governing thejurisdiction nized that principlesof the federal courts, this Court grave questions of constitutional of separation of powers and duehas long recoglaw, implicating process, wouldarise if Congress deprived Article III courts of the power toreview colorable constitutional claims. E.g., Webster v. Doe,486 U.S. 592, 603109 (1977). Due adopted a strong(1988); Califanoto these grave presumption thatv. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99,concerns, the Court has Congress does not intendto intrude upon the courts' power and government acts within constitutionalduty to assure limits. Bowenthat the v. Mich-igan Academy of Family Physicians, 416 U.S. 667, 670(1986) (citing Marbury v. Madison, 137, 1263 (1803)); United States5 v.U.S. (1 Nourse,Cranch) 34 US.(9 Pet.) 8, 28-29 (1835). Because of the importanceproviding judicial review of claimed constitutional defects,administrative "only upon aaction showingof for of-`clear intent Abbott accord,and convincing evidence' should the courts restrict Laboratories v. Gardner,of a contrary legislative access to judicial review." 387 U.S. 136, 141 (1967);Lincoln y. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 195 (1993).

Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise,5 The Court has also stressed that judicial review of constitutional claims must be provided at a time and ina manner that would render such review meaningful. Thus, even where statutory language appears at first blush to require exhaustion of administrative remedies, such provisions have been interpreted to preserve initial district court jurisdiction over claims that would otherwise escape meaningful review. See Bowen, supra; Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, 544-45 (1988); Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 326-32 (1976). Notwithstanding seemingly-applicable exhaustion requirements, the Court has "upheld district court jurisdiction over claims considered wholly collateral to a statute's review provisions and outside the agency's expertise... where a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review." Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 212-13 (1994) (internal quotations and citations omitted); McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, 498 U.S. 479, 49697 (1991) (upholding district court jurisdiction over due process challenge to INS procedure where application of review provision would preclude "meaningful judicial review"). 2. Although the government contends that this canon of constitutional law and statutory interpretation applies with less force when the party seeking review is an alien, Pet. Br. at 39-40, this Court has never suggested that the constitutional significance of meaningful judicial review is diminished in the immigration context. Indeed, the nature and magnitude of the liberty interest at stake counsels that access to meaningful judicial review is particularly important to an alien facing deportation. The significance of an alien's due process interest in avoiding wrongful deportation cannot be overstated. As James Madison observed: If the banishment of an alien from a country into which he has been invited... where he may have formed the most tender of connections, where he may have vested his6entire property and acquired property... and where he may have nearly completed his probationary title to citizenship ..., if a banishment of this sort be not a punishment, and among the severest of punishments, it will be difficult to imagine a doom to which the norms can be applied. Mr. (James) Madison's Report, General Assembly of Virginia (January 7, 1800) (reprinted in The Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government, The Kentucky- Virginia Resolutions and Mr. Madison's Report of 1799, 36 (1960)). Consistent with these concerns, this Court has repeatedly recognized that the protections of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment apply to all persons within the United States, including aliens. See eg, Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228, 238 (1896); United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828, 838 (1987). In particular, the Court has held without exception that, in light of the significant deprivation that deportation imposes on the liberty of an alien, meaningful judicial review of the lawfulness of the deportation order is required. See Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 35 (1982) (the court, not Congress or the INS, must determine "whether the [deportation] procedures meet the essential standard of fairness under the Due Process Clause").? Judicial review is also particularly important in this context given the frequency with which deportation orders or related proceedings have been found unlawful. The federalSee also, Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 154 (1945) ("Meticulous care must be exercised lest the [deportation] procedure . . . not meet the essential standards of fairness."); Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86, 101 (1903); Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 285 (1922); Turner vy. Williams, 194 U.S, 279, 295 (1904) (Brewer, J., concurring) ("I do not believe it within the power of Congress to give ministerial officers a final adjudication of the right to liberty, or to oust the courts from the duty of inquiry respecting both law and facts.").7 courts have played an indispensable role in vindicating the constitutional rights of aliens against the INS's disregard of constitutional limitations on its authority. Courts have found that aliens in agency proceedings have been subjected to, for example: procedures that indisputably failed to satisfy the minimum standards of due process, see McNary, 498 U.S. at 487-89; a scheme to meet numerical targets for removal of Haitians at the expense of their rights to seek asylum in this country, see Haitian Refugee Center v. Smith, 676 F.2d 1023, 1029-32 (5th Cir. 1982), disapproved on other grounds, Jean y. Nelson, 727 F.2d 957, 976 n. 27 (11th Cir. 1984); and a pattern and practice of using misrepresentations, intimidation, coercive detention and transfer policies, and other measures intended to dissuade Salvadoran refugees from raising claims of asylum, see Orantes-Hernandez v. Meese, 685 F. Supp. 1488, 1494-1503 (C.D. Cal. 1986), affd sub nom. Orantes-Hernandez v. Thornburgh, 919 F.2d549 (9th Cir. 1990).*`Given the significant liberty interest implicated, review of statutory claims are equally necessary in the deportation context. See Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 123 n. 14 (1946) (even where Congress has made a deportation order "final," court retained power to review administrative decision to determine whether it had basis in fact). Even with respect to whether a deportation order is valid as a statutory matter, the agency's determinations have historically been found erroneous in a significant number of cases, See P. Schuck and T. Wang, Continuity and Change: Patterns of Immigration Litigation in the Courts, 1979-1990, 45 Stan. L. Rev. 115, 167 (1992) (finding that aliens prevailed in the courts in approximately 23-36% of "statutory cases" principally involving final orders of deportation or exclusion between 1979 and 1990). As the Seventh Circuit has recently acknowledged, "The proceedings of the [INS] are notorious for delay, and the opinions rendered by its judicial officers, including the members of the Board of Immigration Appeals, often flunk minimum standards of adjudicative rationality." Salameda v. INS, 70 F.3d 447, 449 (7th Cir. 1995) (Posner, C.J.). See also INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 452 (1987) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (commenting on the INS's "seemingly purposeful blindness" to a statutory "standard entrusted to its care").8 3. The importance of the interest at stake and the historical prevalence of constitutional violations in this particular context counsel in favor of an unflinching application of the presumption in favor of meaningful judicial review. Courts have consistently found jurisdiction over challenges to the procedures and policies employed by the INS prior to the commencement of deportation proceedings, in recognition of the importance of providing meaningful judicial review and of the unsuitability of the procedures governing review of an order of deportation (e.g, 8 U.S.C. § 1105a (1994)) for.review of collateral claims that require a factual record for proper resolution. See McNary, supra; Smith, 676 F.2d at 1032-33; Jean v. Nelson, 727 F.2d 957 (11th Cir. 1984), affd as to remand, 472 U.S. 846 (1985). As the Third Circuit noted after surveying the caselaw, the district courts were deemed to retain their general federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 "when the challenged administrative practice, policy or regulation precluded adequate development of the administrative record and consequently meaningful review through the procedures set forth in § 1105a, and/or when the challenged practice was collateral and divorced from the substantive aspects underlying the alien's claim of asylum." Yi v. Maugans, 24 F.3d 500,506 (3d Cir. 1994).°5The doctrine that matters collateral to an order of deportation or issues requiring factual development are not within the scope of the former § 1105a has its genesis in this Court's opinion in Cheng Fan Kwok v. INS, 392 U.S. 206 (1968), as well as in the Court's jurisprudence in general administrative law cases noted above. In Cheng Fan Kwok, the Court held that § 1105a's limitation on district court jurisdiction extended only to "final orders of deportation" and did not encompass matters that could not be determined in deportation proceedings, such as whether regional INS district directors lawfully exercised their discretion to stay deportation of an otherwise removable alien. If the alien seeks review of such collateral matters, the Court stated, "the alien's remedies would, of course, ordinarily lie first in an action brought in the appropriate district court." Id. at 210. As noted, numerous courts9Accordingly, Section 242 of the INA, as amended byIIRIRA, should be interpreted to preservejurisdiction upon which important constitutionalthese courts and statutoryrelied rights ofdeportation.district court to vindicate aliens facingB.MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO MAY, IN APPROPRIATE REQUIRE PROMPT ACCESS COURTS.JUDICIAL FORUM CIRCUMSTANCES, TO THE DISTRICTMihrtdasbmlthiraeaelsraesrqtaioatUeutttnvipnyeihratdefcneerheoaoesgawlfruutbfsnhtol--uaadaiealgtpctoiechvns.ifneiersatnscPdechjEsyevatulitCtuirndioayesrtwttulouwihiorfadaotutftgopnal'ioreepfcsde,jrebicuaseleaod'lnjniratscoruscd.tutoueriepnfvaiprsflisarafMteenpoo.cirwrdrcptfeNououdouadTstptrrerphehirtunriyeeodonmco,nspecaeect,rlerohiepdsuevrrsuccitutonrrolihepoceenaenwrtessiotaodfmie.l.utderturaheoihntfepearmoTiTotpsauhohretguneeiaaisshtwlo,isfo--nicocusnCraltltaoolcahddauoieedjrupmuqetalrrduvCdcmoeiaaoavcocittuuioihnlnhersrdaaaoa-.etdelst-t review of claims would be inappropriate in this and many other cases.eoocfflhiag1tli.ahbleielncTiigothyenmesdptofiroCttrtouhuaetrnliteco'IgnesaNalSli'ozofsapctialinpaoirfinoaomnc.cteoufdianulIrnhieMsrsceMNccoaorfNrroardyhr,eydrf,eortsseutrpmaarmteauia,snnc.liiannissTggshfeiulalolnfursetraasrlelaipviteoieninen'v-wsseof appeals have followed this instruction and concluded that judicialreview of matters not encompassed by a final order of deportation (thusoutside the scope properly raised in E.g., Olaniyan y,of the exclusive review provisions of an original action brought in the federal INS, 196 F.2d 373, 376-77 (10th Cir.§ 1105a) were district courts. 1986); Tooloeev.

The judicial review provision at issue in McNary, 8 U.S.C. § 1160(e), precluded review of an adverse determination and provided that judicial review could be obtained in the court of appeals pursuant to §1105a if and when an order of deportation was issued. However, the Court held that this procedure failed to provide for a meaningful review of the aliens' claims.Evidence of such constitutional defects in INS proce-dures "would have been irrelevant in the processing of aparticular individual application." administrative review. process didId. notat 497, The address theprocedural and constitutional claims brought by theagency's kind of respon-dents, and the record of proceedings in any individualeligibility determination would not have included evidencepertaining to the INS's procedures and practice.

Thus, the that § 110Sa did not the development ofto the court of appeals was deemed the requirement of meaningful review. Court's opinion in McNary confirmed apply to a collateral claim that required a factual record in the district courts.il ZThe factors that formed the bases of the Court's holding in McNary are fully applicable to Respondents' claim. As in McNary, Respondents do not challenge in the District Court proceeding the substantive grounds on which the charges against them are purportedly based, such as whether they have failed to maintain student status or overstayed their visas. As Petitioners concede, evidence regarding the agency's motivation in deciding to initiate proceedings against these Respondents or evidence regarding the agency's conduct towards similarly situated alie--nise., evidence pertaining to the elements of Respondents' selective enforcement claim -- would be irrelevant and could not be developed in agency proceedings.® Accordingly, applying the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the former § 1105a, or®The need for a factual record distinguishes the instant case from this Court's decision in INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), a case which amicus curiae Criminal Justice Legal Foundation contends brings Respondents' claim within the scope of exclusive appellate review procedures of § 1105a. In Chadha, the Court held that the appellate courts had jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of the "legislative veto" on a petition for review of a final order of deportation, because such an order "includes all matters on which the validity of the final order is contingent, rather than only those determinations actually made at the hearing." Id. at 937. Amicus fails to distinguish, however, between legal issues (e.g. constitutional validity of the legislative veto) implicated by a deportation order and issues requiring a factual record for proper resolution. Even if Chadha establishes appellate jurisdiction, pursuant to § 1105a, to resolve a legal claim requiring no fact finding, such review would not be applicable to Respondents' selective enforcement claim, given the need for a factual record. See Olaniyan, 796 F.2d at 376; Tooloee, 722 F.2d at 1437.Massieu v. Reno, 91 F.3d 416 (3d Cir. 1996), a case which Petitioners erroneously contend is in conflict with the opinion below, is not to the contrary. The court in Massieu held that a challenge to the constitutionality of Section 241 (a) (4) (C) (i) of the INA should be brought in the court of appeals pursuant to § 1105a. As the district court in that case noted, because the case involved a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, the "claims... present[ed] `pure questions of law' for(continued)12to"UfhtSeh.geennepearwtraicc4t9§i7cc.1ao72ln5s2tei(qtauu)it,viaolnteaonltRaenosdfpoanstdtaeotntuattlso'rdyenccilalalaiimmosf.w"jouudMlicdcNiaalrreys,ruelvti4e9iw8nPanedt2i.tiroeRnveeecrrsosginnugirzgietnhgetihratthecoRnnesesiepsdtoenndftoerntpdsoesvietcliaoonpninrgoevceeraivfeamcatmnueyaalnyiernaegrcfsou,rl"d~ iTqmr(lhuecelceeoawuosnnhrmttiidiiTinc.nohnghaniuftrSeuidejdnlneu)golr.yCi"9isa1rdgcirMeuceFaintv.tsci3ioysdenidweiefduwadtaocunt4vlo.-i2tdnf3iRneqtrdnuh(eioeeqnm,sugatoicitn9ooiw1unno5rguatvltaFdhM.ieoalfuaSbpbguerlaapeopnpppr.soeef,saoqilru6tsi8icsr1o,ulenpfadorir6amt9)soh4.rwatatneh(tvaDgte.enncoeNfor.muaJall.adrgfif1nean9odca9tetl6rul)aaby.lleoMt§cIut8eaiffticonhsnahIroeln1Nscac7ngURetutsd1eaOu.sseiIi0tracSssdR5thboty.§oearaAlnetiC,rino(ptyra1.caparntt2tla)Mhpy5aiirefecr2ogcy§avcoNt(nea(c.eovhraa3tnb"1nueaie)r)olcr1ddaroyeytem0ssf,8smib5olnopoantjaicirtUrfoa(udtkaoohs.ewbardhecvtnShlaciit)wirs.tsoieti(rsaiCdnicss4eitdis.oethftqo)icetnrihaunvtiariendisieltnsedrj§toguihdehu"n(entoed1ang1ieuri2dt)9ovlroetc.5miCn9fidhecan2iaoe4lodttln()ureeohidbvrTntnrca,§hosah)tconcitnitesul(ts1rraw(iatn2tgi4tomtohci5)mhoiunpiatedensv2lsovoere,e(ef(dsdeeftMr.Bbehiab)ncer4bayn)fNe9bsupg(Lien8hspaRicn4t(oeereoakdi)uaeueispsycaUllm(rinppl.odsoptmgAeSofmhis)a.tnpalahrndltoseadesoifosoterliiaotfnanstlsglnactsefiapsrdftsa4damnpetaaa9cp'ideatvtart4tptaioodun,dlltrotddyoacseniearltp.adrsetatornc)htdfhieasodeo;emctMcctn.ooolarrconniureneifeslsncdxdsevevfuidleseeaioioddiduurreevreeceecsdwwemfaraiitetrelasvhresir,-eeteo-anosiotfs8Prior to this case, the INS had consistently (and successfully)awcteeGhraogxhesng,cotuerrepdtabdoteCraipoyno"ortibnirheottaolatiwvtd.naiteshaotIeneNrvS.riern,momeiIrqaMndNun6ceSei8dr,Nd6raerimsst$yFoeo5.l,n9b2etwtladhyhseeFet.d7urh2.8pdaed4"ito,sntrtt98i7hh9tce8e3htU7,e.vIScaa.Nnol1.dCuiS0mrd.0iit43tnyai§rs(pg9&tuo1turrfh1eas0dtnua.5ianCavnii(ert1no.a4r}rdittee1os(rc9(So48tr)§r2heod)pf2.l3y(uCd41ipe7r9Aop.b(9nor4bir)n)et.1ofwa9tht7aiiwt7bSchao)leahsn;eet(continued)13 review of their claim if the Court interprets 28 U.S.C. § 2347(b) to authorize the court of appeals, on an appeal from a final order of removal, to remand the case to the district court for the development of a factual record. Regardless of whether a remand procedure under § 2347(b) is available or appropriate in some situations, a remand to the district court will not always assure that a constitutional claim would be afforded meaningful review.a. First, Petitioners seek to require a threshold evidentiary showing that would "as a practical matter" foreclose meaningful judicial review. McNary, 498 U.S. at 497. Under Petitioners' proposal, the alien would be required "at the time the petition for review is filed, to proffer specific evidence indicating that the decision to initiate deportation proceedings had been made for a constitutionally forbidden reason." Pet. Br. at 48-9 n. 23 (emphasis added). Remand would then be allowed "only in the very rare case where the court of appeals concludes that the alien's submission, if credited, refutes the government's explanation for the charging decision [and] therefore, requires resolution of disputed questions of material fact." Id.Petitioners fail to note that evidence of the government's reasons underlying its charging decisions are exclusively in the control of the government. Accordingly, such evidence would be inaccessible to aliens as a general matter without(continued) such a remand is in fact available under § 2347(c) or § 2347(b) (3). See Reply Brief for the Petitioners, 1989 U.S. Briefs (LEXIS) 1332, Part (b) & n. 10. In subsequent cases before the courts of appeals, however, the INS reversed its position again and argued that § 1105a(a) (4) prohibits the court of appeals from considering evidence not contained in the record of the agency proceeding. See e.g., Makonnen v. INS, 44 F.3d 1378, 1385 (8th Cir. 1995); Osaghae v.

United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)). Inlight of this concern, the Court has repeatedly emphasizedin a variety of contexts the necessity for prompt resolution ofcolorable First Amendment claims. For example, the Courthas stressed that state courts, when enjoining activity poten-tially "strictprotected proceduralby the First Amendment, must safeguards, including immediateprovide appellatereview." National Socialist Party of America v. Village ofSkokie, 432 U.S. 43, 44 (1977) (citations omitted). TheCourt has also applied a relaxed determining whether lower courtstandard of finality in rulings are appealable,`Congress' understanding of § 1252(f), as shown in the HouseReport, also demonstrates that the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that § 1252(g) incorporates § 1252(f) by reference. Given that Congress intended to allow access to the district courts for aliens to whom § 1252(f) applies, Petitioners' interpretation of § 1252(g) would lead to the anomalous result that only those aliens who had been in deportation proceedings prior to the effective date of other provisions of § 1252 would be denied access to the district courts. Under that view, such aliens would be subject to a stricter limitation on access to judicial review than aliens to whom Congress intended ail provisions of IRIRA to apply. Such an interpretation would be flatly inconsistent with Petitioners' own premise that Congress intended IIRIRA generally to limit judicial review from that which was available under prior law. Thus, amicus submits that it is far more consistent with the intent of Congress to construe § 1252(g) as incorporating the jurisdiction preserving elements of other subsections of § 1252, such as § 1252(f) (1), prior to their nominal effective date.18 where uncertainty regarding important questions of First Amendment law would likely deter the free and unfettered exercise of speech. E.g., Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 54-56 (1989); Cox Broad. Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 485-86 (1975). Finally, the Court has "allowed persons subject to claimed unconstitutional restrictions on their freedom of expression to challenge that restriction" without resorting. to designated administrative procedure, in cases where "the loss or postponement of precious First Amendment rights ... was a concomitant of the available administrative procedure." Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 528 n. 3 (1977) (Burger, C.J., dissenting). Cf PUC of California v. United States, 355 U.S. 534, 540 (1958) ("where the only question is whether it is constitutional to fasten the administrative procedure onto the litigant, the administrative agency may be defied and judicial relief sought as the only effective way of protecting the asserted constitutional right"); McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 148 (1992).Similarly here, the inability to obtain a prompt determination of constitutional claims implicating the First Amendment would have the impermissible effect of silencing the contributions of aliens to the public debate on matters of national and international concern. Without prompt access to the district courts, aliens may be subjected to selective enforcement of the immigration laws for protected activities without being able to present their claims to any adjudicatory body until deportation proceedings and administrative appeals that routinely take years to complete have concluded.""This fact establishes the crucial distinction between the instant case and this Court's cases holding that, even where the First Amendment is implicated, federal courts ordinarily should not enjoin pending state court proceedings, such as Cameron vy. Johnson, 390 U.S. 611 (1968),(continued)19Other types of irreparable injuries prompt judicial review in the districtmay also necessitate courts. For example,the INS's practice of coercing aliens with potentially meri-torious asylum claims to agree to voluntarily depart theiscnuojpuurnraty,ry,--woauolnpdcreacptraiencseeanlttiheantanoiwstahsceoreernccjeoodmipneeidlnltoiinn g"vOorclaaunsnetteasrof-ilHyie"rrrneapdnaedpraaerbztl,-eing, the statutory right to seek asylum and the constitutionalright to minimally adequate procedure can no longer bevindicated. Accordingly, the Court should refrain from hold-ing that the exclusive review provisions of § 1252 can bemechanically applied to all claims that arguably fail withinits reach.C. PROVIDING PROMPT ACCESS TO DISTRICTCOURTS FOR RESOLUTION OF COLLATERALCLAIMS PROMOTES THE EFFICIENT ADMIN-ISTRATION OF IMMIGRATION LAWS AND ISCONSISTENTWITHCONGRESSIONALINTENT.Although Petitioners contend that purported intent of Congress in enactingthey rely IIRIRAupon the to stream-line, consolidate and expedite the process of removing analien from the United States, the goals of judicial andadministrative efficiency and expedited removal can and willbe served in appropriate instances by permitting initialreview of a collateral claim. As the Court has noted, the(continued) upon which Petitioners rely. Under the Supremacy Clause, state courts are required to hear a defendant's federal claims in the first instance. See .@.g., Howlett v, Rose, 496 U.S. 356 (1990). Moreover, consistent with principles of federalism, state courts are presumed equally capable as federal courts of providing an adequate hearing to such claims. See e.g., Younger v. Harris, 410 U.S. 37 (1971). Neither consideration applies to the proceedings of the immigration courts, which could not even consider Respondents' constitutional challenge.20"application of the exhaustion doctrine is `intensely practical' " and should be "guided by the policies underlying the exhaustion requirement." Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.S. 467, 484 (1986) (quoting Matthews, 424 U.S. at 331 n. 11); Abbott Laboratories, 387 U.S. at 149-50 (stating that doctrine of finality may be applied in a "pragmatic" and "flexible" way); see also Rafeedie v. INS, 880 F.2d 506, 529-30 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (Ginsburg, C.J., concurring) (Congress does not "in codifying an exhaustion rule, ... inevitably and inexorably mean[] to preclude early judicial review even when requiring exhaustion in a specific case would serve none of the purposes motivating the requirement and would threaten grievous harm to the person seeking review"). In this and many other cases in which the courts have found district court jurisdiction, the interpretation of IIRIRA urged by Petitioners would fail to serve the intent of Congress to expedite resolution of claims relating to the removal of aliens.1. In this case, adopting the government's proposal would neither eliminate any layer of judicial review nor lead to a more expeditious removal (assuming that removal would be lawful) of Respondents. As noted, Respondents' _ claim is entirely collateral to the determination of whether they are deportable on the basis of the substantive charges against them. See City of New York, 476 US at 483. Because Respondents' claim is outside the scope of INS's decisional authority, Respondents would be required under Petitioners' proposal to go through the multiyear process of deportation hearings and administrative appeal, while holding their constitutional claim in abeyance. At the conclusion of that process, they would present their claim to the court of appeals for determination as to whether a remand is necessary, adding another element to the court of appeals' tasks on direct review of an order of removal.21 Accepting the District Court's preliminary findings (affirmed by the Ninth Circuit) regarding the merits of Respondents' claim, a remand would be necessary even under the stringent standard proposed by Petitioners.'? Once the case is remanded to the district court, a hearing on the claim of selective enforcement would then begin. At the conclusion of district court proceedings, the court of appeals would then review that judgment and either uphold or invalidate the orders of removal accordingly. If Respondents ultimately prevail, the significant burdens of the deportation proceedings -- on Respondents, on the government and on the free speech interests of Respondents and others -- would have been incurred for no purpose. If the government ultimately prevails, it would have done so without eliminating any layer of review: indeed, Petitioner's proposal would have added an additional layer of appellate court review.'*"Due to the lack of discovery, Respondents would not likely be ableto present the evidence upon which the District Court's findings were based. That possibility, of course, provides no warrant for favoring Petitioners' approach. See Part B.2, supra.Although Petitioners raise the specter of unmeritorious or frivolouscases brought in the district courts for the sole purpose of delaying deportation proceedings, declaratory judgment actions in this context are extremely rare, According to INS statistics, 1,648,986 aliens were apprehended by the INS in 1996. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 1996 Statistical Yearbook, 173, Table 58 (1996). The vast majority (1,572,798) departed voluntarily, while over 68,000 aliens were deported or excluded pursuant to an order of removal. Jd. In comparison, federal courts resolved only 138 declaratory judgment actions (the bases for which are not revealed by the statistics) brought against the INS involving exclusion or deportation. Id., 194, Table 76. Allowing appropriate cases to go forward in the district courts under the standards developed by the federal courts in interpreting former § 1105a, therefore, will not result in the district courts being inundated with frivolous suits. Moreover, the district courts are certainly capable of assessing the merits of such cases and properly refusing to enjoin any agency proceedings.seepafetcyse tewesutedessneassaepaschases ttniesssesty22joncTteafmeCunoeshhfifsortse,nufsOvisaoseasnatlcrp,hdhiCmlywtapetieouyovcorxtatetusiaphhtmiltenmeereeodsddruBsornteishrcetotoelhtasotaiCeoisa,vshgdodbveehbcniuRernrtewagnreoaeesrgdslnRtebseglpnhreeisinoeaeessnvtennahen'gpawddsdesn,oool,oefnuennabidcslptvd4nuseodroiist2trfnnrioae'0dstedngeaicbstetbmtenndhd'eiaUdese.ln.trtiratSioiees.evocuTnDuvvroniniehgieptisle,exradtaattwepretpwhtteihadepfhCadca4nleuoottti8dfiluict5icooren-PacounRtCe8torraeto7aidntditsuepososomhtfrrptpnfeiistiro(onatIonAnrinuspTpedposoedtrfrrRpeptqiisorIernouta'crotaaRnthitehpetaalAsreesemtilpse,srovrpmlaveorceyugpacweabonneollsovfentnsapeutaeachirstliacrlmyo)oeldes-.,-.o.nr-f jcaauennrddd2i.usrdpeairdcIatmnwciidtooneiunieclsdedt,"wraashtiacinavvpseeresme,variernoseytuushsloeltuyerodcfveafslioit.nuhdeniatdnIy,nceaoPsntfeehotseriastmei,owdouhnesepesrorosre-'wtcaaastlpdtilrieoesondtprooifcso"terjpdduaedtcritocpeurirroaotn-ln MpttchhlrceeaoNscsaeamrdgeyouref,irntecsasyl,sieuihsnpatsrshnaeo;itsncyosHanattasdeitjmitiuisitdscauuiatnecl:ialotynRiranealvgtfihuoeaglrtnae,hdteeeidtrs,hteCaiettmnhucmttrleiooargruiyrgmahevtr.diiigotShsndtmesipftoeshloct,fitactiuaesisss.burptoaSrhaneaaddet; RRNOH11eoer99en.s9a9roc60ne,)a)t;;tCeea9sg41-aCM4-HiL5aon1ee,mngr2ptan0Fleoaa4.psnsC3pddS,leeirzvcvv..,a.11t0N9i3a9Tvo2s.i6hnulop,ErrOo(Wanf9I;b9LtR4uth,0hrJeega8hC9Fien9,r5.x7.92h6dva.6u9F31Ns1.49e9t299lid58s(o)onW;Fn7..(4,D292rtd.eWhsqa(ulu9p5WtCitr3iearhar1rse;.shmC.eiW1rn(a.v99t.lt9Oht1c1e)Rwt9r;eo.9snuC1Eoil)rl,d.2v.,. ill-serve the policies underlying the requirement. caalhgiaeIelnfnlceyanntogewatlohiuetelondbtfuharedcdeievnanoggsteendceoyfps'uosbrastdtampatianinttoitinseartlnrcaatrnoiefnvsoeotuunrlpcbarerwsoifcnueglaendadibnebghrssauovbaijdioen-rcb,taorsdtetehhdere23to issue an order of removal that would be valid on the substantive grounds alleged but may be defective on a collateral constitutional or statutory ground. Given that the agency will not entertain the alien's claim during the administrative proceedings, and that no judicial determination thereof can be made until the proceedings conclude, the agency would presumably continue to subject other aliens to the same unlawful practices'in the meantime. By the time that such a claim could be reviewed in the federal courts, this may result in innumerable removal orders (and actual removals) of uncertain validity.If the alien's claim is ultimately upheld, the agency wouldhave wasted considerable resources in ders that suffer from the same defect. agency would have two choices.

MINN. CODE OF JUD. CONDUCT Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i). Like many states, Minnesota patterned its Code of Judicial Conduct on the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct. Minnesota's announce clause is identical to its counterpart in the 1972 ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct. See ABA MODEL CODE OF JUD. CONDUCT Canon 7(B)(1)(c) (1972).5 The current ABA Model Code provision on this subject contains somewhat different language, reading in relevant part that a judicial candidate "shall not . . . make statements that commit or appear to commit the candidate with respect to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court." ABA MODEL CODE OF JUD. CONDUCT Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(ii) (1990).As interpreted by the Eighth Circuit, the Minnesota clause "prohibits candidates only from publicly making known how they would decide issues likely to come before them as judges,"6 ­ the same scope as current ABA Canonlending prestige of their office to advance private interests of others); In re Fadeley, 802 P.2d 31, 44 (Or. 1990) (per curiam) (upholding constitutionality of Oregon Code of Judicial Conduct prohibiting judges from personally soliciting campaign contributions).5 A survey of the different restrictions on judicial election speech that the states have adopted is set forth in the Appendix to this brief.6 Republican Party of Minn. v. Kelly, 247 F.3d 854, 881-82 (8th Cir. 2001).55(A)(3)(d)(ii). Subsequently, the Minnesota Supreme Court issued an order agreeing with that interpretation. See In re Code of Judicial Conduct, No. C4-85-697 (Minn. Jan. 29, 2002) (`the announce clause . . . shall be enforced in accordance with the interpretation of that clause by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Republican Party of Minnesota v. Kelly").Minnesota's announce clause has the same scope as the corresponding provision in the 1990 ABA Model Code ­ namely, it prevents judicial candidates from seeking political support on the basis of commitments or apparent commitments on how they would decide cases if elected.II.THE ABA MODEL CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT REFLECTS THE AMERICAN LEGALPROFESSION'S LONG-STANDING VIEW THAT JUDGES SHOULD NOT CAMPAIGN ON HOW THEY WOULD DECIDE ISSUES, IF ELECTEDThe ABA, acting on behalf of the legal profession, has for more than three-quarters of a century promoted model regulations that prohibit judicial candidates from seeking election on the basis of commitments to render decisions in future cases. As early as 1924, its Model Canons of Judicial Ethics cautioned that a candidate for judicial office "should not announce in advance his conclusions of law on disputed issues to secure class support." ABA CANONS OF JUD. ETHICS Canon 30 (1924).A half-century later, a revised Model Code retained much the same restriction by prohibiting judicial candidates from expressing views on disputed legal or political issues. ABA MODEL CODE OF JUD. CONDUCT Canon 7(B)(1)(c) (1972). The current Model Code narrowed the limitation to6"cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court." ABA MODEL CODE OF JUD. CONDUCT Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(ii) (1990).The history of what became the 1990 Model Code began with a survey of authorities in the field of judicial ethics conducted by the Judicial Code Subcommittee of the ABA's Standing Committee on Ethics and Responsibility. The Subcommittee received assistance from many leading attorneys, judges, legal scholars, and liaisons from ABA entities and other groups with a particular interest in judicial ethics. Included among those who provided comments were representatives of the ABA Judicial Administration Division Coordinating Committee, the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Center for Judicial Conduct Organizations, the American Judicature Society, the Josephson Institute for the Advancement of Ethics, and the Conference of Chief Justices.The Judicial Code Subcommittee compiled extensive background material, including codes from every United States jurisdiction, law review articles, statistical studies and other research material from the literature of judicial ethics and judicial discipline. Included among those materials were unpublished papers and ongoing research of individuals active in the field of judicial ethics and discipline. The Subcommittee received particular assistance from advisory opinions on judicial ethics that highlighted the problems encountered most often by judges. Finally, the Subcommittee consulted the codes of judicial conduct recently adopted in several jurisdictions and the study materials developed by the drafting committees in those jurisdictions.7In 1987, the Judicial Code Subcommittee circulated a questionnaire with specific questions concerning each section of the seven Canons of the 1972 Code and the Compliance section. The questionnaire was sent to federal and state judges in every jurisdiction, all state judicial conduct organizations, the Conferences of the ABA Judicial Administration Division, the American Judicature Society, and many other interested groups and individuals.In 1988, the Subcommittee held public hearings at the ABA Midyear and Annual Meetings. Those hearings were attended by members of the judiciary, representatives of judicial conduct organizations, representatives of a variety of public groups and individuals responding to a general invitation to the public to present oral and written comments to the Subcommittee. All questionnaire responses and other comments were given careful consideration, and many suggestions received were incorporated in the May 1, 1989 Discussion Draft.7More than 4,800 copies of the Discussion Draft, along with a request for comments and suggestions, were distributed to: (1) those to whom the original questionnaire was sent (including state and specialty bar associations); (2) all ABA entities; and (3) many additional federal and state judges. Formal public hearings were held at the 1989 ABA Annual Meeting and, in September 1989, in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Informational programs on the Discussion Draft were presented to the May 1989 Conference on Professional Responsibility, the Sixth Circuit Judicial Conference, the July 1989 meeting of the Conference of Chief Justices, several state bar meetings,7 JUDICIAL CODE SUBCOMM. OF THE ABA STANDING COMM. ON ETHICS & PROF. RESPONSIBILITY, DRAFT REVISIONS TO THE ABA CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT (May 1, 1989)8and the meeting of the ABA Judic ial Administration Division Coordinating Committee. After that extensive process, the ABA adopted the current 1990 ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct.The 1990 Model Code contains a revised version of the announce clause that had appeared in its predecessor, the 1972 Model Code. The 1990 revision to that clause was explained in an earlier Discussion Draft, which noted that "the phrase `announce his views on disputed legal or political issues' was an overly broad restriction on speech that could not be practicably applied in its literal terms."8 What replaced that phrase was "the more specific language prohibiting the making of any statements that commit or appear to commit the candidate with respect to matters likely to come before the candidate's court."9Thus, the provision of the ABA Model Code that corresponds with Minnesota's announce clause was narrowly drawn after an extensive deliberative process that8 Id. at 55-56 (May 1, 1989); see LISA L. MILORD, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ABA JUDICIAL CODE 50 (1992); M. Peter Moser, The 1990 ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, 4 GEO. J. LEGAL ETHICS 731, 765 nn.127 & 129 (1991) (noting competing arguments over the language adopted); see also Robert M. Brode, Note, Buckley v. Illinois Judicial Inquiry Board and Stretton v. Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court: First Amendment Limits on Ethical Restrictions of Judicial Candidates' Speech, 51 WASH. & LEE L. REV. 1085, 1117-21 (1994) (discussing the change to this provision in the 1990 Model Code and predicting that it would pass muster under the Seventh Circuit's analysis in Buckley).9 ABA STANDING COMM. ON ETHICS & PROF. RESPONSIBILITY, REPORT TO THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES NO. 112 (Aug. 1990); see M. Peter Moser, supra note 7, at 765 n.127. The only other change ultimately made to the provision was to replace the phrase "cases or controversies" with the phrase "cases, controversies or issues." M. Peter Moser, supra.9included a broad spectrum of the American legal profession.III.MINNESOTA'S NARROWLY TAILORED RESTRICTION SERVES COMPELLING STATEINTERESTSThe state "may regulate the content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest." Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. Fed. Communications Comm'n, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). Under that standard, Minnesota's announce clause, as interpreted by the Minnesota Supreme Court and the Eighth Circuit, is constitutional.A. Minnesota's Clause Is Narrowly TailoredMinnesota's clause proscribes a narrow range of campaign speech by judicial candidates ­ namely, their statement of how they would decide issues likely to come before the courts. That was the interpretation given to the clause by the Eighth Circuit. Republican Party of Minn. v. Kelly, 247 F.3d 854, 881-82 (8th Cir. 2001). By recent order, Minnesota Supreme Court expressly adopted the Eighth Circuit's interpretation. In re Code of Judicial Conduct, No. C4-85-697 (Minn. Jan. 29, 2002).The narrow restriction now imposed by Minnesota received support even from courts that have invalidated broader restrictions on judicial campaign speech. For example, in Deters v. Judicial Retirement & Removal Commission, 873 S.W.2d 200, 203 (Ky. 1994), the Kentucky Supreme Court upheld language identical to the 1990 ABA Model Code, while earlier invalidating the10formulation of the announce clause in the 1972 Model Code in J.C.J.D. v. R.J.C.R., 803 S.W.2d 953, 956-57 (Ky. 1991). Similarly, in Buckley v. Illinois Judicial Inquiry Board, 997 F.2d 224, 230 (7th Cir. 1993), the Seventh Circuit struck down the language identical to the 1972 Model Code, yet the court recognized that "promises to rule in particular ways in particular cases or particular types of cases are within the state's regulatory power." Further, in American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, Inc. v. Florida Bar, 744 F. Supp. 1094, 1097-98 (N.D. Fla. 1990), the court again held that the announce clause in the 1972 Model Code was too broad, but the court also noted that a judicial candidate "`cannot, consistent with the proper exercise of his judicial powers, bind himself to decide particular cases in order to achieve a given programmatic result.'" Id. (quoting Morial v. Judicial Comm'n, 565 F.2d 295, 305 (5th Cir. 1977)).As interpreted, the clause at issue allows judicial candidates to discuss a myriad of proper topics. As in all other states, judicial candidates in Minnesota are free to discuss their qualifications, their opponents' qualifications, their general approach to judicial decisionmaking, and their views on critical issues that relate to their duties of judicial administration, such as court backlog, hiring of court personnel, the need for additional resources, efficiency of the courts, or jury selection and service. See Editorial: What Judicial Candidates May Say, AM. JUDICATURE, at 4 (July-Aug. 2000). Candidates are prohibited only from committing or appearing to commit to how they would decide future matters before their courts.The prohibited statements do not contribute to an informed electorate, as petitioners contend. See Brief of Petitioners Republican Party of Minnesota, et al. at 29-31; Brief of Petitioners Gregory F. Wersal, et al. at 34-38. If11judicial candidates committed themselves to future decisions, they would be subject to disqualification or recusal from making those decisions once they were elected; and any decisions rendered in conformity with prior campaign commitments would likely be subject to challenge on due-process grounds. See Randall T. Shepard, Campaign Speech: Restraint and Liberty in Judicial Ethics, 9 GEO. J. LEGAL ETHICS 1059, 1081-90 (1996) (hereinafter cited as Shepard, Campaign Speech).B. Minnesota's Clause Serves Compelling Interests in Maintaining Judicial Independence and Impartiality, Preserving Public Confidence in the Judiciary, and Guaranteeing Due Process of LawEnsuring the independence and impartiality of the judiciary is unquestionably a compelling interest that justifies regulation of speech. Stretton v. Disciplinary Bd., 944 F.2d 137, 142 (3d Cir. 1991). "[T]he principle of impartial justice under law is strong enough to entitle the government to restrict the freedom of speech of participants in the judicial process." Buckley, 997 F.2d at 230. "A State may also properly protect the judicial process from being misjudged in the minds of the public." Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 565 (1965).The proscription in Minnesota's clause reflects the unique role that judges play in American governmental structure. "Judges remain different from legislators or executive officials, even when all are elected, in ways that bear on the strength of the state's interest in restricting their freedom of speech." Buckley, 997 F.2d at 228. "[S]tates need not treat candidates for judicial office the same as candidates for other elective offices" because "the judicial12office is different in key respects from other offices." Am. Civil Liberties Union of Fla., Inc., 744 F. Supp. at 1097.In deciding cases that come before them, judges are generally bound by controlling precedent or by statutory or constitutional provisions that may apply. 10 America's judges have historically, and properly, been distinguished from officers of the other two branches of government in this most fundamental regard: they must decide cases impartially. Judges do not represent constituencies, as do legislators and executives; and they do not make their judicial decisions with the purpose in mind of pleasing those who have elected them. That fundamental distinction between the judicial branch and the legislative and executive branches is the essence of judicial independence and impartiality, a basic element of the rule of law critical to the American system of justice.One responsibility of the judiciary in the American experiment in democracy is to check the excesses of factions, as identified by Madison and discussed by Hamilton. See THE FEDERALIST NO. 10 (James Madison), NO. 78 (Alexander Hamilton). The fulfillment of that responsibility requires that the judiciary be able to exert its authority without fear or favor in order to ensure that its legitimacy, dependent on public perceptions of fairness and impartiality in the judicial process, remains intact. Cf. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 407 (1989) ("The legitimacy of the Judicial Branch ultimately depends on its reputation for impartiality and nonpartisanship.").10 Judges are often "confined from molar to molecular motions," being limited to deciding the cases before them with due regard for controlling precedent and legislative intent. So. Pac. Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting).13Permitting judicial candidates to commit or appear to commit themselves in advance on matters likely to come before their courts would create at least the appearance of partiality in the judicial decision making process. The ultimate result would be to undermine the public's trust in the judiciary's independence and threaten the rule of law. 11 Thus, Minnesota's clause serves the state's compelling interest in preserving public confidence in the judiciary. Cox, 379 U.S. at 565.A third compelling interest implicated here is the guarantee of due process of law. That constitutional guarantee would be threatened if judicial candidates were allowed to make campaign commitments about matters likely to come before their courts. See Shepard, Campaign Speech, 9 GEO. J. LEGAL ETHICS at 1083-90.As this Court has recognized, "[t]rial before an `unbiased judge' is essential to due process." Johnson v. Miss., 403 U.S. 212, 216 (1971) (citation omitted). Thus, in Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 531-35 (1927), the Court held that judges may not share in the fines collected from defendants found guilty in their courts.12 Such an interest is11 Cf. REPORT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA SPECIAL COMM'N TO LIMIT CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURES (1998); REPORT OF THE OHIO CITIZENS COMM. ON JUDICIAL ELECTIONS (1995); SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS, STATE BAR OF TEXAS & TEXAS OFFICE OF COURT ADMIN., THE COURTS AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN TEXAS ­ AN INSIDER'S PERSPECTIVE (1995) (all noting adverse impact on public perceptions of the judiciary caused by contributions to judicial campaigns).12 Accord Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U.S. 813, 823-25 (1986) (vacating judgment that enhanced the legal claim of the justice who authored the state court's opinion); Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57, 58-62 (1972) (indirect interest in city's finances was sufficient to bar mayor from serving as judge); In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136-39 (1955) (improper for a judge to serve as a one-person grand jury in matters that came before his court)14implicated here, because of a judicial candidate's personal and direct interest in gaining judicial employment.Invalidating Minnesota's Code provision would prevent the states from making a critical distinction between the election of jud ges and of other elected officials. Minnesota has a compelling interest in maintaining that distinction, so as to protect the integrity of its courts, preserve public confidence in the judiciary, and guarantee due process rights to all litigants. The state's compelling interest amply justifies its narrowly tailored prohibition of statements by judicial candidates of how they would decide matters likely to come before their courts.CONCLUSIONThe judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,ROBERT E. HIRSHON Counsel of RecordAmerican Bar Association 750 N. Lake Shore Drive Chicago, IL 60611 Telephone: 312.988.5000Of Counsel: Reagan Wm. Simpson Warren S. Huang
This case presents the question whether defense counsel may unilaterally override the client's explicit direction to seek an acquittal by contesting guilt, and instead pursue the opposite strategy of admitting guilt at trial in the hope of leniency. Under the Sixth Amendment--as well as under longstanding policies of the ABA and the Louisiana State Bar Association--the answer to that question is no.2 "At a hearing held on November 14, 2008[,] the trial court noted that [two] experts [had] found [Mr. McCoy] competent to stand trial." JA38.5This case arises from the 2011 trial of Petitioner Robert McCoy for the murders of his estranged wife's son, mother, and step-father. A month prior to trial, Mr. McCoy's counsel, Larry English, told him that the case could not be won and that Mr. McCoy's best strategy would be to plead guilty, but Mr. McCoy rejected that advice. Two weeks before the trial date, Mr. English informed his client that, despite Mr. McCoy's stated intentions regarding his case, and his pro se alibi notice, Mr. English would not offer any alibi evidence, and would be conceding Mr. McCoy's guilt in an effort to save his life. Mr. McCoy expressly opposed this strategy and informed both counsel and the trial court of his opposition. He sought new trial counsel or to represent himself, but the trial court denied his request as untimely.At trial, Mr. McCoy attempted to advance his innocence claim, but was ignored and contradicted by his lawyer from the outset of the trial to its end. Even after Mr. McCoy testified that he was innocent, and explained that he was out of state and therefore could not have committed the crimes, Mr. English told the jury that Mr. McCoy had committed the murders, that the prosecution had been relieved of its burden of proof, and that there was no alibi defense. A unanimous jury convicted Mr. McCoy of all three counts of first degree murder. The Louisiana Supreme Court denied the appeal and affirmed the three convictions and death sentences.Amicus respectfully urges this Court to hold, consistent with longstanding Sixth Amendment6principles and with rules and guidelines of the ABA, that a lawyer may not confess his client's guilt to the jury over the client's express objection. ABA rules, standards, and guidelines as well as state law counterparts3 provide guidance on the appropriate role of attorneys in assisting their clients. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003). Here, Mr. English's unilateral decision to overrule his client's stated objective of contesting guilt violated rules of the ABA and the Louisiana State Bar Association governing attorney-client relationships, as well as the constitutional rights that inform those rules.I. THE SIXTH AMENDMENT GRANTS THE CLIENT THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVES OF HIS OR HER DEFENSEABA policies governing the allocation of authority in an attorney-client relationship are based on and implement the constitutional guarantees of the accused. One such principle is the notion that the attorney is an assistant to the client. Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 820 (1975) (noting that the Sixth Amendment "speaks of the `assistance' of3 The Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct are largelymodeled after the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.See AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, State Adoption of the ABAModelRulesofProfessionalConduct,https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/alpha_list_state_adopting_model_rules.html (last visited November 20,2017) (Louisiana first adopted the ABA's Model Rules of Pro-fessional Conduct in 1986).7counsel, and an assistant, however expert, is still an assistant"). The attorney, as an assistant, is obliged to respect the client's autonomy to make fundamental decisions about his or her case. As this Court has explained, the Sixth Amendment "grants to the accused personally the right to make his defense," because it is the defendant "who suffers the consequences if the defense fails." Id. at 819-20. "Unless the accused has acquiesced in such representation, the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for, in a very real sense, it is not his defense." Id. at 821.The principle that fundamental decisions are committed to the client--such as the decisions whether to plead guilty, to testify, or to appeal-- appropriately respects the client's ultimate right to control the core objectives of his or her defense. See Gannett Co. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 382 n.10 (1979) ("As part of th[e] right to make a defense, the [Sixth] Amendment speaks of the `assistance' of counsel, thus contemplating a norm in which the accused, and not a lawyer, is master of his own defense.") (citing Faretta, 422 U.S. at 819-20).As this Court explained in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), an attorney's role as "assistant to the defendant" creates "the overarching duty to advocate the defendant's cause and the more particular duties to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution." Ibid. at 688. Prior to Strickland, this Court explained that "fundamental" decisions in a case include "whether to plead8guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or take an appeal." Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751 (1983) (citing ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE §§ 4-5.2, 21-2.2 (2d ed. 1980)). For such decisions, this Court has "recognized that the accused has the ultimate authority." Id.; see also Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 93 n.1 (1977) (Burger, J., concurring) ("[S]uch basic decisions as whether to plead guilty, waive a jury, or testify in one's own behalf are ultimately for the accused to make.") (citing ABA PROJECT ON STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE, THE PROSECUTION FUNCTION AND DEFENSE FUNCTION § 5.2 (App. Draft 1971)).The decision whether to confess guilt at trial-- like the decision whether to plead guilty at the outset of a case and the decision to testify--is a fundamental decision that implicates a defendant's Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination. See State v. Carter, 14 P.3d 1138, 1148 (Kan. 2000) (holding that a refusal to present defendant's innocence defense, and conceding the defendant's involvement, betrayed "the defendant by deliberately overriding his plea of not guilty"). Indeed, a defendant's right to contest guilt at the pleading stage means little if counsel is permitted to undermine the defendant's wishes with repeated public statements about the defendant's guilt during trial. Timing should not determine whether a client who has exercised the fundamental right to refuse to admit guilt in a criminal case may be overruled by his or her counsel.Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175 (2004), is fully consistent with the proposition that counsel may9not override a client's express decision to contest guilt. Defense counsel in Nixon "attempted to explain . . . [his proposed concession] strategy to Nixon at least three times," but, unlike Mr. McCoy in this case, "Nixon was generally unresponsive during their discussions. He never verbally approved or protested [his counsel's] proposed strategy." Nixon, 543 U.S. at 181 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). The Court held that "when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course." Id. at 178.Here, in contrast to Nixon, Mr. McCoy was fully engaged with his defense, and unequivocally expressed his opposition to Mr. English's strategy of conceding guilt. Mr. McCoy's testimony on his own behalf at trial makes clear that his consistent objective was to maintain his innocence and seek an acquittal. The trial court nonetheless required Mr. McCoy to proceed to trial with an attorney intent on admitting his guilt. Mr. English's conduct-- including undermining Mr. McCoy's alibi both before and after he testified--overrode Mr. McCoy's objective, violating his right to control the basic goals of his own defense.Mr. McCoy expressly objected to the implementation of a concession strategy, and the lower courts have recognized that Nixon is inapposite under such circumstances. See People v. Bergerud, 223 P.3d 686, 693, 699 n.11 (Colo. 2010) (en banc) (distinguishing Nixon where "attorneys had effectively10conceded [the client's] guilt to lesser homicide offenses despite [the client's] desire to defend against the charges and seek acquittal" on grounds that "the defendant explicitly objected to counsel's actions on his behalf") (emphasis in original); Cooke v. State, 977 A.2d 803, 847 (Del. 2009) ("[W]here, as here, the defendant adamantly objects to counsel's proposed objective to concede guilt and pursue a verdict of guilty but mentally ill, and counsel proceeds with that objective anyway, the defendant is effectively deprived of his constitutional right to decide personally whether to plead guilty to the prosecution's case, to testify in his own defense, and to have a trial by an impartial jury. The right to make these decisions is nullified if counsel can override them against the defendant's wishes.") (emphasis in original).The ABA guidelines on which the Nixon Court relied offer no support for the decision below. The Nixon Court, for example, cited commentary to ABA Guideline for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases § 10.9.1, which explains that in capital cases where "the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous . . . `avoiding execution [may be] the best and only realistic result possible.'" Nixon, 543 U.S. at 191 (quoting ABA GUIDELINES FOR THE APPOINTMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF DEFENSE COUNSEL IN DEATH PENALTY CASES § 10.9.1 CMT (rev. ed. 2003) [hereinafter GUIDELINES]). While it may be true that conceding guilt in the hope of avoiding death is a reasonable strategic decision in some cases, the decision remains the client's to make. Neither the Sixth Amendment nor the ABA's Guidelines au-11thorize counsel to force an admission of guilt upon an objecting client simply because counsel believes it is good litigation strategy. See GUIDELINES § 10.9.1(f) ("Counsel should not accept any agreedupon disposition without the client's express authorization."). Because Mr. McCoy expressly exercised his right to reject Mr. English's proposed concession strategy, Nixon is not controlling.II. ABA AND LOUISIANA STATE BAR ASSOCIATION GUIDELINES PROTECT THE CLIENT'S SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ADMIT OR CONTEST GUILTA. ABA and Louisiana State Bar Association Ethical Rules Confirm the Constitutional Guarantee That Clients Control the Fundamental Objectives of Their RepresentationThe ABA rules, standards, and guidelines relevant to this case closely track the constitutional principle that the client has the ultimate say over the objectives of his or her defense, and accordingly, advise that the decision whether to concede or contest guilt belongs to the client. Specifically, ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2 ("Rule 1.2") and its Louisiana counterpart, Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2, govern the scope of representation and the allocation of authority between a client and his or her counsel. Rule 1.2 clearly establishes that a lawyer's role is to execute the client's objectives and dictates that a lawyer "abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation"--in the case of Mr. McCoy, to seek an12acquittal--and "consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued." MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT r. 1.2(a) (AM. BAR ASS'N 2014); see LA. RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT r. 1.2(a) (2017). Rule 1.2 and its accompanying commentary are well established and embody longstanding policies that have been universally embraced by the legal community.Certain basic decisions are left to clients and may not be overruled by defense counsel, including the fundamental decision whether to plead guilty. "In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify." MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT r. 1.2(a); see ABA CRIMINAL JUSTICE STANDARDS FOR THE DEFENSE FUNCTIONS § 4-5.2(b)(ii) (4th ed. 20015) [hereinafter STANDARDS] ("The decisions ultimately to be made by a competent client, after full consultation with defense counsel, include[s]: what pleas to enter . . . ."); GUIDELINES § 10.5(c) CMT. ("Some decisions require the client's knowledge and agreement."). "A lawyer's duty under Rule 1.2(a) to defer to certain client decisions in a criminal matter is a necessary corollary of a criminal defendant's constitutional right to make decisions regarding matters that are `fundamental' or `substantive' because they derive from constitutional guarantees." ELLEN J. BENNETT ET AL., ANN. MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT § 1.2 (8th ed. 2015) (collecting cases).Although a decision to admit guilt at trial-- unlike the decision to plead guilty, see Nixon, 54313U.S. at 188--may not always require the client's express prior consent, a lawyer cannot force the client to adopt such a strategy over his or her objection. Where a client expressly objects to conceding guilt, the decision to admit guilt is akin to pleading guilty in its "material impact on the case." GUIDELINES § 10.5(c); see Carter, 14 P.3d at 1148. Such an admission takes away the client's constitutional right to decide for himself whether to defend against the charges. It compromises both the client's right to testify and the corresponding right to remain silent. Admitting guilt at trial over the client's express objection is no different from forcing the client to plead guilty at the case's outset under the Constitution and ABA policies.The contrary rule adopted by the Louisiana Supreme Court undermines the attorney-client relationship. As the ABA guidance recognizes, an attorney has a practical need to maintain the client's trust, as well as an obligation to advance the client's lawful objectives. "In the initial meeting with a client, defense counsel should begin the process of establishing an effective attorney-client relationship. This includes assuring the client of confidentiality, establishing trust, explaining the posture of the matter, discussing fees if applicable, and inquiring about the client's objectives for the representation." STANDARDS § 4-3.3(a) (emphasis added); see also id. § 4-3.1(b) ("At an early stage, counsel should discuss with the client objectives of the representation . . . ."); GUIDELINES § 10.5(a) ("Counsel at all stages of the case should make every appropriate effort to establish a relationship of trust with the client . . . ."). In capital cases, the14ABA advises that "[c]ounsel at all stages . . . engage in a continuing interactive dialogue with the client concerning all matters that might reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the case, such as . . . the development of a defense theory; . . . presentation of the defense case; [and] . . . potential agreed-upon dispositions of the case." GUIDELINES § 10.5(c). While "[c]ertain decisions relating to the conduct of the case are for the accused[, and] others are for defense counsel, . . . counsel should give great weight to strongly held views of a competent client . . . ." STANDARDS § 4-5.2(a).Here, two weeks before trial, well past "an early stage" in the case as prescribed by ABA Criminal Justice Standard for the Defense Functions § 43.1(b), Mr. English announced to his client his intention to "concede that [Mr. McCoy] had killed the three victims." JA286. Not only did Mr. English fail to "give great weight to [Mr. McCoy's] strongly held views," STANDARDS § 4-5.2(a), he disregarded Mr. McCoy's ultimate choice to maintain his innocence. Instead, Mr. English pursued his own personal strategy for "sav[ing Mr. McCoy's] life." JA286. And the day two weeks before trial that Mr. McCoy learned about Mr. English's concession strategy was, as Mr. English himself admitted, "essentially the end of [the] professional relationship." Id.The Constitution, Rule 1.2 and its Louisiana counterpart clearly required Mr. English to "abide by [Mr. McCoy's] decisions concerning the objectives of representation," and "consult with [Mr. McCoy] as to the means by which they [we]re to be15pursued." MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT r. 1.2(a); see LA. RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT r. 1.2(a). "A lawyer who fails to carry out the objectives of a representation chosen by the client violates Rule 1.2." BENNETT ET AL., ANN. MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT § 1.2 (collecting cases); see, e.g., Taylor v. State, 28 A.3d 399, 408 (Del. 2011) ("[A]n irreconcilable conflict existed between [the defendant's] desired result, a not guilty verdict, and his counsel's proposed strategy of raising the defense of guilty but mentally ill [("GBMI")] at trial. . . . [T]he trial judge denied . . . [defense counsel] the opportunity to present GBMI to the jury . . . . This ruling protected [the defendant's] individual right to determine whether or not to present a defense of GBMI to the jury . . . .") (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).The principle that the client must be permitted to make fundamental decisions relating to whether to admit or contest guilt is consistent with the substantial discretion that attorneys have to determine trial tactics and strategy. The ABA has long maintained that "[d]ecisions that involve tactics and trial strategy may constitutionally be made by the lawyer after consultation with the client." BENNETT ET AL., ANN. MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT § 1.2; see STANDARDS § 4-5.2(d) ("Strategic and tactical decisions should be made by defense counsel, after consultation with the client where feasible and appropriate. Such decisions include how to pursue plea negotiations, how to craft and respond to motions and, at hearing or trial, what witnesses to call, whether and how to conduct crossexamination, what jurors to accept or strike, what16motions and objections should be made, what stipulations if any to agree to, and what and how evidence should be introduced."). Consultation, while not mandatory for every decision relating to investigation or trial strategy, ensures that the attorney's assistance remains in line with the client's objectives for his or her defense. What counsel may not do, under the Sixth Amendment or ethical rules, is overrule the client's express decision to maintain innocence or admit guilt.Finally, the trial court compounded Mr. English's failure to pursue Mr. McCoy's ultimate goal with decisions that increased the likelihood that Mr. McCoy's objectives would be bypassed. Specifically, the trial court denied Mr. McCoy's request for new counsel as untimely and allowed Mr. English to advance a concession strategy, despite having notice of Mr. McCoy's repeated and strenuous objections. See JA460-JA461; JA505-JA506.B. Respecting Client Control Over Fundamental Decisions Is Consistent With the Ethical Duty of Candor to the TribunalThe Louisiana Supreme Court erred in its conclusion that Mr. English's conduct was necessary to avoid violating the duty of candor toward the tribunal by eliciting false or perjured testimony. See JA208. That duty, which is enshrined in ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3 and its Louisiana counterpart, Louisiana Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3, is not at issue here. "The prohibition against offering false evidence only applies if the lawyer knows that the evidence is false. A lawyer's17reasonable belief that evidence is false does not preclude its presentation to the trier of fact." MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT r. 3.3 CMT. 8 (emphasis added); see id. CMT. 9 ("Because of the special protections historically provided criminal defendants . . . Rule [3.3] does not permit a lawyer to refuse to offer the testimony of such a client where the lawyer reasonably believes but does not know that the testimony will be false. Unless the lawyer knows the testimony will be false, the lawyer must honor the client's decision to testify.").Although his post-trial declaration claimed that he was "convinced that the evidence against Robert McCoy was overwhelming," JA286, there is no evidence that Mr. English knew Mr. McCoy's testimony (or the other evidence he sought to offer) was false. In fact, Mr. English noted that "[t]hroughout the entire period of [his] representation, Mr. McCoy adamantly maintained his innocence and claimed that he was out of state at the time of the killings." JA284-JA285. Even a good faith disagreement with such an innocence strategy does not implicate the duty of candor to the tribunal. Respecting a client's stated refusal to admit guilt is not akin to knowingly offering false testimony to a court, and only the latter is prohibited.To be sure, "the Sixth Amendment does not require that counsel do what is impossible or unethical. If there is no bona fide defense to the charge, counsel cannot create one and may disserve the interests of his client by attempting a useless charade." United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 n.19 (1984). That said, where a criminal defendant18wishes to maintain his or her innocence during trial, defense counsel is obliged, at minimum, to hold the prosecution to the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See id. ("[E]ven when no theory of defense is available, if the decision to stand trial has been made, counsel must hold the prosecution to its heavy burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt."). Defense counsel may hold the prosecution to its burden by undermining the prosecution's case through various means, including rigorous cross-examination. Such a strategy effectuates the client's stated goal of contesting guilt but does not entail violating the duty of candor to the tribunal.Had Mr. English been presented with proposed testimony that he knew to be false, which did not happen here, he would have had other means with which to address that concern short of conceding his client's guilt. For example, an attorney has the option to seek withdrawal from the case. See MODEL RULES OF PROF'L CONDUCT r. 3.3 CMT. 15. Further, an attorney can refuse to participate in the presentation of affirmative evidence that the attorney knows to be false during the defense case. See id. CMT. 5 (Rule 3.3(a)(3) "requires that the lawyer refuse to offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false, regardless of the client's wishes"). Under no circumstances is a lawyer ethically required, or allowed, to overrule the client's decision to defend the charges and tell the jury the client is guilty.***Longstanding ABA guidance rooted in the Sixth Amendment clearly provides that the client, not19counsel, must be permitted to decide the core objectives of a case. Accordingly, fundamental decisions such as whether to contest or concede guilt must be left for the client to make. To require a client to concede guilt, notwithstanding his or her clear objection, is at odds both with the Constitution as well as the relevant ABA rules, standards, and guidelines that implement basic constitutional principles governing the right to defend oneself and to the assistance of counsel.CONCLUSIONThe judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court should be reversed.20Respectfully submitted,HILARIE BASS 
 I. THE ABA CRIMINAL JUSTICE STANDARDS REJECT INFLEXIBLE MONEY-BAIL SYSTEMS, WHICH ARE DEFICIENT AS A MATTER OF POLICY AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW A. The ABA Has Long Viewed Inflexible Money-Bail Systems AsInherently Discriminatory, Deleterious To The Rights Of The Accused, And Unnecessary To Ensure Justice The ABA has long been concerned about the deleterious effects of inflexible money-bail systems, under which an accused person's right to release depends on his ability to pay an amount that may bear no relation to his individual circumstances, the protection of public safety, or the needs of the administration of justice. The ABA's examination of money bail was stimulated by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's address to the ABA House of Delegates in August 1962, in which Attorney General Kennedy, surveying the problems of access to justice facing the indigent, identified "[t]he problem of bail" as having "received too little attention," and stressed that "the indigent defendant who cannot offer security for his appearance is denied [the] opportunity [to establish his innocence]. He cannot provide for his family and for his defense, and cannot take an active part to prove his innocence."44 Kennedy, Address, American Bar Association House of Delegates, San Francisco, California, Aug. 6, 1962, at 5, available at https://www.justice.gov/ sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2011/01/20/08-06-1962%20Pro.pdf.- 7 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 18The First Edition of the ABA's Criminal Justice Standards, adopted by the House of Delegates in 1968, reflected the ABA's fundamental judgment that an accused person's right to liberty--and right to mount an effective defense to criminal charges--should not be determined by that person's financial resources. Although the ABA did not advocate for the abolition of all monetary conditions on release, the First Edition of the Standards urged that "[r]eliance on money bail should be reduced to minimal proportions" and should be "required only in cases in which no other condition will reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance." American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Pretrial Release--Approved Draft, 1968, § 1.2 ("First Edition"); see also id. §5.3(a) ("Money bail should be set only when it is found that no other conditions on release will reasonably assure the defendant's appearance.").Commentary accompanying the First Edition of the Standards recognized the grave constitutional and policy concerns with overuse of money bail.5 The commentary explained that bail "inevitably discriminates against the poor," noting studies showing that a significant percentage of defendants could not make a bail5 Unlike the Standards themselves, which set forth black-letter principles adopted by the ABA House of Delegates, commentary accompanying the Standards is not adopted by the House of Delegates. The commentary accompanying the Standards therefore "does not necessarily represent the official position of the ABA," but it nonetheless "serves a useful explanation of the blackletter standards." See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Pretrial Release at ii (3d ed. 2007).- 8 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 19of $500. See First Edition at 1. The commentary also emphasized that pretrial detention can prevent a defendant "from contributing to the preparation of his defense," leading to worse outcomes for the very defendants least able to afford effective counsel. Id. at 3. More generally, the commentary recognized the human toll of unnecessary pretrial detention, which subjects a defendant "to the psychological and physical deprivations of jail life," risks him "los[ing] his job if he has one," and shoulders the "innocent members of his family" with the burdens of his detention. Id. at 2-3; see also id. at 23 ("[U]nnecessary pretrial detention involves unconscionable costs both to individual defendants and their families and to the public which must pay the financial price of detention.").The First Edition of the Standards also expressed the ABA's judgment that money bail should rarely be necessary to serve legitimate interests of the criminal justice system: protecting the public and ensuring the defendant's appearance in court. For defendants who have secure ties to the community, non-monetary conditions of release should usually be sufficient to ensure their court appearance; for those who are inclined to flee anyway, money bail is unlikely to deter them from doing so. Thus, jurisdictions should look to the defendant's community ties, rather than arbitrary monetary amounts, as the best security for the defendant's appearance in court: "[I]f a quick but careful inquiry is made into the facts concerning the defendant's roots in the community a vastly more rational bail- 9 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 20decision can be made," and "risk of financial loss is an insubstantial deterrent to flight for a large number of defendants whose ties to the community are sufficient to bring them to court." First Edition at 2.The Second Edition of the ABA's Pretrial Release Standards, adopted by the ABA House of Delegates in 1979 after a decade of further study, continued and sharpened the ABA's criticism of excessive use of money bail. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, ch. 10, Pretrial Release (2d ed. 1979) ("Second Edition"). The Second Edition again stressed that "[r]elease on monetary conditions should be reduced to minimal proportions" and that money bail "should be required only in cases in which no other conditions will reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance." Id. at Standard 10-1.3(c). The Second Edition also recommended that "[w]hen monetary conditions are imposed, bail should be set at the lowest level necessary to ensure the defendant's reappearance and with regard for the defendant's ability to post bond." Id. As the accompanying historical background explains, this additional emphasis against excessive use of money bail made explicit a point that was previously implicit--"that a monetary condition ought not to be imposed except in amounts necessary to achieve its legitimate purpose." Id. at 10.14.This continued insistence on a limited role for monetary conditions of release reflected the ABA's serious concerns about the constitutionality of- 10 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 21inflexible money-bail schemes, which result in incarceration of individuals for the sole reason that they cannot pay for their freedom. See Second Edition at 10.7810.79 (citing, inter alia, Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), and Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395 (1971)). As the commentary to the Second Edition stressed, although money-bail systems are common, "[i]n practice ... monetary conditions rarely serve their legitimate function," and "[a]lthough release on monetary condition is the oldest form of pretrial release, it is also the least desirable." Id. at 10.78.In addition, the Second Edition of the Standards articulated ABA policy on a point directly relevant here: If it is necessary to impose a monetary condition on a defendant's pretrial release, then that monetary condition should preferably be in the form of an unsecured bond, rather than a secured bond or an unsecured bond accompanied by a partial cash payment. See id. at Standard 10-5.4(d). In other words, only in very rare circumstances should a defendant be required to pay any sum of money to the court before he is released. Rather, it should ordinarily be sufficient to require the defendant to agree to pay a sum of money if he fails to appear as required.B. Given The Grave Concerns Raised By Overuse Of Money Bail, The ABA's Criminal Justice Standards Caution Against Its Use Without Consideration Of The Defendant's Individual CircumstancesThe ABA comprehensively reviewed pretrial release practices, including the use of monetary conditions for release, in the Third Edition of its Criminal Justice- 11 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 22Standards, adopted by the ABA House of Delegates in 2007 and currently in force. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pretrial Release (3d ed. 2007). As those Standards explain, two decades' worth of additional study and experience have confirmed the ABA's conclusions that an inflexible money-bail system serves no legitimate public safety purpose, needlessly harms persons accused of crimes, and imposes unnecessary costs on the public. Monetary conditions of release should never be drawn from an inflexible schedule, should be imposed only after consideration of the defendant's individual circumstances, and should never prevent the defendant's release solely because the defendant is unable to pay.Standard 10-1.4 expresses the ABA's conclusion that money bail should rarely be used to secure a defendant's appearance in court, and that when monetary conditions of release are necessary, an unsecured bond should be preferred to a secured bond. As the Standards explain, jurisdictions should "adopt procedures designed to promote the release of defendants on their own recognizance or, when necessary, unsecured bond." Standard 10-1.4(a). Jurisdictions should impose financial conditions only "when no other conditions will ensure appearance," and should always "consider releasing the defendant on an unsecured bond." Standard 10-1.4(c). Furthermore, the Standards underscore that monetary conditions should be used only to ensure appearance--they "should not be employed to respond to concerns for public safety." Standard 10-1.4(d). The Standards also stress,- 12 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 23without qualification, that a bail system should not make it impossible for accused persons to gain release solely because of their indigence: "The judicial officer should not impose a financial condition of release that results in the pretrial detention of a defendant solely due to the defendant's inability to pay." Standard 10-1.4(e).In particular, the Standards recognize the problems with rigid bail schedules, in which the amount of bail is fixed in advance by the nature or name of the charge. The Standards provide that financial conditions "should never be set by reference to a predetermined schedule of amounts fixed according to the nature of the charge." Standard 10-5.3(e) (emphasis added). Instead, consistent with the demands of due process, the Standards urge that "[f]inancial conditions should be the result of an individualized decision taking into account the special circumstances of each defendant, the defendant's ability to meet the financial conditions and the defendant's flight risk." Id. (emphasis added). Furthermore, because of the burden financial conditions may impose on the indigent, the Standards call on jurisdictions to consider conditions of release other than a secured bond in conducting these individualized determinations. Standard 105.3(a) ("Financial conditions other than unsecured bond should be imposed only when no other less restrictive condition of release will reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance in court."); see also Standard 10-5.3(d) (providing that a- 13 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 24judicial officer imposing financial conditions should first consider an unsecured bond).The commentary accompanying the Third Edition of the Standards emphasizes a range of serious concerns about excessive use of financial conditions and lack of individualized determinations, not only for the defendant accused of a crime but also for the public. Unwarranted pretrial detention infringes on defendants' constitutional rights, "making it difficult for the defendant to consult with counsel, locate witnesses, and gather evidence" and placing a particularly heavy burden "on poor defendants and on racial and cultural minorities." Standards at 32-33. "Pretrial detention also strains the defendant's family relations and is likely to result in loss of employment." Id. at 33. And jurisdictions must bear the costs of the detention, expending "scarce public resources for construction and operation of new jail facilities." Id.For these reasons, jurisdictions should follow the "least restrictive conditions principle" in ordering pretrial release and should never set bail so high that a person cannot meet it because he lacks the means to do so: "If the court finds that unsecured bond is not sufficient, it may require the defendant to post bail; however, the bail amount must be within the reach of the defendant and should not be at an amount greater than necessary to assure the defendant's appearance in court." Id. at 43-44 (emphasis added).- 14 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 25Commentary to the Standards elaborates on reasons why jurisdictions should never follow a preset bail schedule. Most fundamentally, the nature or name of the charge against the defendant may have little to do with the need for particular conditions on release. To the contrary, to ensure the defendant's appearance in court and to protect public safety, it is far more sensible to consider the particular circumstances of the case, including the defendant's risk of flight and (if monetary conditions are necessary) the defendant's financial situation. See Standards at 5051 (commentary to Standard 10-1.7); id. at 111 (commentary to Standard 105.3(a)). Moreover, inflexible money-bail standards inevitably discriminate against indigent defendants who cannot make bail in even small amounts. As the commentary explains, a money-bail system that does not consider the defendant's individual circumstances, including his ability to pay, "undermin[es] basic concepts of equal justice": "`In a system which grants pretrial liberty for money, those who can afford a bondsman go free; those who cannot stay in jail.'" Id. at 111-112 (quoting Freed & Wald, Bail in the United States 21 (1964)). II. AN INFLEXIBLE MONEY-BAIL SYSTEM HARMS INDIGENT CRIMINALDEFENDANTS AND DOES NOT SERVE THE FAIR AND PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE A. Money Bail Burdens Indigent Criminal Defendants Extensive research has shown that overuse of money bail adversely affects indigent defendants in serious ways, undermining the fairness, effectiveness, and- 15 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 26credibility of our criminal justice system. In addition to depriving persons of their liberty because of their financial situation, money bail often impairs their ability to mount a defense to the charges against them and wreaks havoc with their lives.First, even a few days in jail can disrupt a defendant's life, leading to longterm negative consequences. Indigent defendants cannot work or earn income while detained and may lose their jobs while waiting for a hearing, making it even more difficult to make bail. See Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 532-333 (1972). Children may be left unsupervised, and elderly or sick relatives may have no one else to take care of them. Defendants living in shelters may lose housing for missing curfews or for prolonged absence. See Pinto, The Bail Trap, N.Y. Times Magazine (Aug. 13, 2015). Given indigent defendants' already diminished level of economic security and often shaky social safety nets, a prolonged pretrial detention may trigger a downward spiral, even if they are ultimately acquitted.Yet for many indigent defendants, there is no option other than to wait in jail. Defendants and their families are frequently unable to afford a fixed monetary bond or a nonrefundable 10 or 20% commercial surety fee. Indeed, in many cases a commercial surety is not even an option; many bail bondsmen will not even offer small bonds--meaning that, ironically, indigent defendants who are charged with the least serious offenses may be more likely to stay in jail. See Montopoli, Is the U.S. Bail System Unfair?, CBS News, Feb. 8, 2013. Data show that many- 16 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 27defendants are unable to meet even relatively small bond amounts; in New York City, for example, only 26% of criminal defendants made bail set at less than $500 at arraignment, and only 7% made bail set at $5,000 (the median amount for a felony). Phillips, A Decade of Bail Research in New York City 51 tbl. 7 (New York Criminal Justice Agency, Inc., Aug. 2012). Even for those defendants who are ultimately able to secure the necessary resources, the process of doing so may take days, leading to many of the same adverse consequences.6Second, pretrial detention frustrates the legal rights of indigent defendants. While detained, defendants find it difficult to communicate with or engage counsel--especially in jurisdictions that do not appoint counsel immediately after a defendant is taken into custody. See Leipold, How the Pretrial Process Contributes to Wrongful Convictions, 42 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1123, 1130 (2005). Detention also impairs defendants' ability to prepare a defense; by the time of release, evidence may have already been lost and witnesses' memories faded.6 In rural areas, long distances and limited staff further increase the likelihood of prolonged detention before a defendant's first appearance before a judicial officer. It is therefore particularly important to find alternatives to inflexible money-bail systems in those jurisdictions. See Vetter & Clark, The Delivery of Pretrial Justice in Rural Areas: A Guide for Rural County Officials (National Association of Counties, 2012). The ABA's Criminal Justice Standards state that "the defendant should in no instance be held by police longer than 24 hours without appearing before a judicial officer," Standard 10-4.1, but in many areas of the country, suspects are held for much longer times.- 17 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 28For more than fifty years, researchers have found that pretrial detention leads to worse case outcomes for indigent defendants. See Rankin, The Effect of Pretrial Detention, 39 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 641 (1964). Even when controlling for factors such as current charge, prior criminal history, and community ties, research has shown that defendants detained in jail are more likely to be convicted, more likely to be sentenced to a prison term, and more likely to receive a longer sentence than defendants released during the pretrial period. See Rational and Transparent Bail Decision Making: Moving From a Cash-Based to a Risk-Based Process 2 (Pretrial Justice Inst., MacArthur Found. 2012); Phillips, Pretrial Detention and Case Outcomes, Part 1: Nonfelony Cases 55-56 (New York City Criminal Justice Agency, Inc., 2007). These consequences are particularly perverse because they may weigh heaviest on the lowest-risk defendants; one study found that low-risk defendants detained for the entire pretrial period are more than five times more likely to be sentenced to jail compared to low-risk defendants released at some point before trial, and nearly four times more likely to be sentenced to prison-- with sentences that, on average, are nearly three times longer. See Lowenkamp et al., Investigation the Impact of Pretrial Detention on Sentencing Outcomes 11 (Arnold Found., Nov. 2013).Third, the prospect of prolonged pretrial detention may encourage premature guilty pleas from defendants who are innocent or have potential defenses to the- 18 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 29charges. In many cases, the anticipated time of pretrial detention may exceed the length of an actual sentence; for some minor crimes, defendants may not face incarceration at all. See Bibas, Plea Bargaining Outside the Shadow of Trial, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 2464, 2492 (2004) (noting that defendants charged with misdemeanors or lesser felonies are more likely to be incarcerated before than after conviction). When given the choice between immediate release and trial after prolonged detention, many defendants reasonably decide to plead guilty. See Boruchowitz et al., Minor Crimes, Massive Waste 32-33 (National Ass'n of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Apr. 2009). That prospect is directly contrary to the purpose of financial conditions on release, which is solely to ensure the defendant's appearance. See Standards at 44 (commentary to Standard 10-1.4(d)) ("Money bail should not be used for any reason other than to respond to a risk of flight."); cf. id. at 112 (commentary to Standard 10-5.3(c)) ("Threats of unaffordable bail in order to compel defendants to cooperate with the government are ... inappropriate.").B. An Inflexible Money-Bail System Does Not Advance The Interests Of Pretrial JusticeFor all of its costs to indigent defendants, money bail--particularly when imposed without regard to a defendant's individual circumstances--often fails to advance the primary interests of a pretrial release system: ensuring that released defendants appear for their court dates, and keeping high-risk defendants in- 19 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 30detention. See Standard 10.1-1. Instead of basing pretrial detention status on individualized risk factors, money-bail systems often end up linking pretrial detention status primarily to the defendant's ability to pay, which benefits neither indigent defendants nor public safety. See Cohen & Reaves, Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants in State Court 3 fig. 3 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, Nov. 2007) (showing direct relationship between the bail amount and likelihood of detention).The available evidence indicates that money bail is rarely necessary to ensure court appearances. The District of Columbia does not use money bail, and yet it maintains appearance rates for released defendants of 90%--as compared to a national average of less than 80%.7 Indeed, one recent study found that defendants whose releases were conditioned on unsecured bonds appeared for their court dates at slightly higher rates than those posting secured bonds, with the exception of the highest-risk category of defendants. See Jones, Unsecured Bonds: The As Effective and Most Efficient Pretrial Release Option 11 (Pretrial Justice Institute 2013).8 By contrast, research has shown significant increases in7 Compare Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Columbia, Performance Measures, http://www.psa.gov/?q=data/performance_measures (data as of June 30, 2015) with Cohen & Reaves, Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants in State Court 8 fig. 5 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, Nov. 2007). 8 See also Abell Foundation, The Pretrial Release Project: A Study of Maryland's Pretrial Release and Bail System 48 (2011) (citing studies finding higher or similar appearance rates for defendants released on non-financial bail- 20 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 31appearance rates from alternative approaches, such as supervised release or simply giving notice before a court date. See Lowenkamp & VanNostrand, Exploring the Impact of Supervision on Pretrial Outcomes 17 (Arnold Found., 2013); Herian & Bornstein, Reducing Failure to Appear in Nebraska: A Field Study, Nebraska Lawyer 11, 12-13 (Sept. 2010).At the same time, excessive use of money bail imposes heavy costs on the criminal justice system. Approximately 61% of inmates in local jails--more than 400,000 individuals--are awaiting trial at any given time. See Minton & Golinelli, Jail Inmates at Midyear 2012 - Statistical Tables 5-6 tbls. 2-3 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, May 2013). At an average daily cost per inmate from $50 to as high as $500, the total annual cost of pretrial detention is estimated to be $9 billion, or 11% of total spending on corrections. See Council of Economic Advisers, Issue Brief, Fines, Fees, and Bail 8 (Dec. 2015). This immense cost to States and local jurisdictions yields little in the way of public safety, and yet it also represents a grave deprivation of liberty for thousands of indigent defendants.C. A Consensus Has Developed That Inflexible Money-Bail Systems Are Unfair And Do Not WorkThe ABA is not alone in its opposition to inflexible money-bail systems. Numerous organizations across the spectrum of the criminal justice system havecompared to financial bail), available at http://www.abell.org/sites/default/files/ publications/hhs_pretrial_9.01(1).pdf.- 21 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 32also emphasized the importance of conducting individualized assessments insetting conditions for pretrial release and minimizing the use of money bail.9 In9 Nat'l Ass'n of Counties, The American County Platform and Resolutions 2015-2016, at 111, 113, 115-116 ("NACo recommends that all counties establish a written set of policies and procedures aligned with state statute, national professional standards, and best practices on the pretrial release decision."); Conference of Chief Justices, Resolution 3, at 2 (adopted Jan. 30, 2013) ("[T]he Conference of Chief Justices commends and endorses the Policy Paper on Evidence-Based Pretrial Release and joins with Conference of State Court Administrators to urge that court leaders promote, collaborate, and accomplish the adoption of evidence-based assessment of risk in setting pretrial release conditions and advocate for the presumptive use of non-financial release conditions[.]"); Ass'n of Prosecuting Attys, Policy Statement on Pretrial Justice ("Pretrial services employing validated risk assessments provide useful data and offer practical information essential to making informed decisions during court proceedings and determining conditions of supervision and sentencing, when appropriate."); Am.

As recently as March 14, 2016, the Department of Justice reminded courts that they "must not employ bail or bond practices that cause indigent defendants to remain incarcerated solely because they cannot afford to pay for their release." Dear Colleague Letter from Gupta, Principal Dep. Ass't Att'y Gen., Civil Rights Division and Foster, Director, Office for Access to Justice 2 (Mar. 14, 2016); see also Brown, ABA President, Letter to Editor, The Justice Department Makes the Right Call, Wash. Post, Mar. 18, 2016. There is no serious dispute among criminal justice stakeholders that inflexible money-bail schemes have no place in the American justice system.States and local jurisdictions have followed suit. Currently, 21 States expressly provide for a presumption in favor of releasing defendants on personal recognizance or an unsecured bond, and 16 require courts to impose the least restrictive condition on pretrial release. See Widgery, National Conference of State Resolution ­ Pretrial Supervision (enacted June 2010) ("[P]retrial supervision has proven a safe and cost effective alternative to jail for many individuals awaiting trial[.]"); see also Nat'l Ass'n of Pretrial Services Agencies, Standards on Pretrial Release (3d ed. 2004).- 23 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 34Legislators, Guidance for Setting Release Conditions (May 13, 2015); cf. Standard 10.1-6 (recognizing "policy favoring release"); cf. Standard 10.1-2 ("In deciding pretrial release, the judicial officer should assign the least restrictive condition(s) of release."). State court systems are also increasingly using fact-sensitive riskassessment tools, rather than inflexible bail schedules, to evaluate appropriate conditions on a defendant's pretrial release. See Arnold Found., Press Release, More Than 20 Cities and States Adopt Risk Assessment Tool To Help Judges Decide Which Defendants To Detain Prior to Trial (June 26, 2015); cf. Standard 10-1.10 ("Every jurisdiction should establish a pretrial services agency or program to collect and present the necessary information, [and] present risk assessments[.]"). Local jurisdictions have explored the use of these tools for years, and 15 States have now authorized their use by statute, with six States--Delaware, Colorado, Kentucky, New Jersey, South Carolina, and West Virginia--requiring such assessments for all defendants. Evaluations of these policies have further strengthened the conclusions that pretrial release determinations should take the defendant's individual circumstances into account, and that monetary conditions of release should play a limited role. See Schnacke et al., The Jefferson County Bail Project: Lessons Learned from a Process of Pretrial Change at the Local Level 12 (Pretrial Justice Institute, June 2014); Klute & Heyerly, Report on Impact of House Bill 463: Outcomes, Challenges, and Recommendations 5-6 (KY Pretrial Servs., June 2012).- 24 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 35In sum, evidence and experience show that an inflexible money-bail system has no place in a modern system of criminal justice. In the few circumstances where a financial condition of release is necessary to ensure a defendant's appearance at trial, a court can impose one, provided that it is tailored so that a defendant is not held in jail merely because he cannot afford to pay the bond. But in the great majority of cases, money bail--and certainly a money-bail system in which the amount of the bail is mechanically set by reference to a schedule of charges, with no consideration of the defendant's ties to the community or financial circumstances--should be unnecessary, and will only hobble the accused person's ability to muster a defense to the charges against him while imposing a grave human toll. III. THE COUNTY'S INFLEXIBLE BAIL SCHEME ILLUSTRATES THECONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS WITH MONEY BAIL The ABA's Criminal Justice Standards are founded on the basic constitutional premise that an individual should not be incarcerated solely based on his inability to pay. Faithful application of the Standards--including individualized risk assessments, the imposition of only the least restrictive conditions, and a general presumption in favor of pretrial release--should ensure that defendants' constitutional rights will be protected. Here, however, the County's pretrial release system falls far short of ABA guidelines, and has resulted in violations of both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses.- 25 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 36In Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), the Supreme Court made clear that depriving an individual of "conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he cannot pay ... would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment." Id. at 672-673. Consistent with that principle, the Court has rejected government policies and practices in a wide range of contexts that have the effect of "punishing a person for his poverty." Id. at 671 (revocation of probation for inability to pay fine); see, e.g., Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971) (incarceration for inability to pay traffic fines); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 240-241 (1970) (incarceration beyond statutory maximum due to inability to pay fine); Smith v. Bennett, 365 U.S. 708, 711 (1961) (inability to pay fee to file petition for writ of habeas corpus); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 19 (1956) (inability to cover cost of transcript on appeal).Before overriding a defendant's "strong interest in liberty," jurisdictions must recognize the "importance and fundamental nature" of the right to pretrial release and must carefully consider whether the government has advanced "sufficiently weighty" interests to the contrary. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750-751 (1987). Inflexible money-bail systems that rely on preset bail schedules, like the one Rutherford County uses, do not meet that standard. As the Fifth Circuit explained in Pugh v. Rainwater, 572 F.2d 1053 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), when the appearance of an indigent defendant can be assured by an alternate form of release,- 26 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 37"pretrial confinement for inability to post money bail would constitute imposition of an excessive restraint." Id. at 1058. Following the Fifth Circuit's reasoning, even if money bail might be constitutionally acceptable in certain circumstances, it can never be the only option available to indigent defendants.In addition to treating defendants differently and arbitrarily depending on their financial status, inflexible money-bail systems violate the fundamental constitutional requirement that individuals must generally be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before being deprived of their liberty or property. Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80 (1972). When ability to pay is at issue, the defendant must be given notice that ability to pay may be a "critical question" in the proceedings, and given an opportunity to provide information about his financial status. Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 446-448 (2011). Then, the court must actually take that information into account and make an "express finding ... that the defendant has the ability to pay." Id. at 447-448. In the context of pretrial release, therefore, if a jurisdiction considers imposing a monetary condition of release, it must take account of the defendant's individual ability to pay, the availability of less restrictive alternatives, and the need for pretrial detention in the first place. Inflexible money-bail systems do not satisfy this due process requirement; the preset bail schedule is outcome-determinative. As indigent defendants are given no opportunity to challenge these schedules, they are unconstitutional.- 27 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 38CONCLUSION The order of the district court entering a preliminary injunction should be affirmed.Of Counsel: Paul R.Q.

The judge or judicial officer decides whether to release a defendant on personal recognizance or unsecured appearance bond, release a defendant on a condition or combination of conditions, temporarily detain a defendant, or detain a defendant according to procedures outlined in these Standards. The law favors the release of defendants pending adjudication of charges. Deprivation of liberty pending trial is harsh and oppressive, subjects defendants to economic and psychological hardship, interferes with their ability to defend themselves, and, in many instances, deprives their families of support. These Standards limit the circumstances under which pretrial detention may be authorized and provide procedural safeguards to govern pretrial detention proceedings.Standard 10-1.2. Release under least restrictive conditions; diversion and other alternative release optionsIn deciding pretrial release, the judicial officer should assign the least restrictive condition(s) of release that will reasonably ensure a defendant's attendance at court proceedings and protect the community, victims, witnesses or any other person. Such conditions may include participation in drug treatment, diversion programs or other pre-adjudication alternatives. The court should have a wide array of programs or options available to promote pretrial release on conditions that ensure appearance and protect the safety of the community, victims and witnesses pending trial and should have the capacity to develop release options appropriate to the risks and special needs posed by defendants, if released to the community. When no conditions of release are sufficient to accomplish the aims of pretrial release, defendants may be detained through specific procedures.Standard 10-1.4. Conditions of release(a) Consistent with these Standards, each jurisdiction should adopt procedures designed to promote the release of defendants on their ownA1Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 43recognizance or, when necessary, unsecured bond. Additional conditions should be imposed on release only when the need is demonstrated by the facts of the individual case reasonably to ensure appearance at court proceedings, to protect the community, victims, witnesses or any other person and to maintain the integrity of the judicial process. Whenever possible, methods for providing the appropriate judicial officer with reliable information relevant to the release decision should be developed, preferably through a pretrial services agency or function, as described in Standard 10-1.9.(b) When release on personal recognizance is not appropriate reasonably to ensure the defendant's appearance at court and to prevent the commission of criminal offenses that threaten the safety of the community or any person, constitutionally permissible non-financial conditions of release should be employed consistent with Standard 10-5.2.(c) Release on financial conditions should be used only when no other conditions will ensure appearance. When financial conditions are imposed, the court should first consider releasing the defendant on an unsecured bond. If unsecured bond is not deemed a sufficient condition of release, and the court still seeks to impose monetary conditions, bail should be set at the lowest level necessary to ensure the defendant's appearance and with regard to a defendant's financial ability to post bond.(d) Financial conditions should not be employed to respond to concerns for public safety.(e) The judicial officer should not impose a financial condition of release that results in the pretrial detention of a defendant solely due to the defendant's inability to pay.(f) Consistent with the processes provided in these Standards, compensated sureties should be abolished. When financial bail is imposed, the defendant should be released on the deposit of cash or securities with the court of not more than ten percent of the amount of the bail, to be returned at the conclusion of the case.Standard 10-1.7. Consideration of the nature of the charge in determining release optionsAlthough the charge itself may be a predicate to pretrial detention proceedings, the judicial officer should exercise care not to give inordinate weightA2Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 44to the nature of the present charge in evaluating factors for the pretrial release decision except when, coupled with other specified factors, the charge itself may cause the initiation of a pretrial detention hearing pursuant to the provisions of Standard 10-5.9.Standard 10-5.3. Release on financial conditions(a) Financial conditions other than unsecured bond should be imposed only when no other less restrictive condition of release will reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance in court. The judicial officer should not impose a financial condition that results in the pretrial detention of the defendant solely due to an inability to pay.(b) Financial conditions of release should not be set to prevent future criminal conduct during the pretrial period or to protect the safety of the community or any person.(c) Financial conditions should not be set to punish or frighten the defendant or to placate public opinion.(d) On finding that a financial condition of release should be set, the judicial officer should require the first of the following alternatives thought sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the defendant's reappearance:(i) the execution of an unsecured bond in an amount specified by the judicial officer, either signed by other persons or not;(ii) the execution of an unsecured bond in an amount specified by the judicial officer, accompanied by the deposit of cash or securities equal to ten percent of the face amount of the bond. The full deposit should be returned at the conclusion of the proceedings, provided the defendant has not defaulted in the performance of the conditions of the bond; or(iii) the execution of a bond secured by the deposit of the full amount in cash or other property or by the obligation of qualified, uncompensated sureties.(e) Financial conditions should be the result of an individualized decision taking into account the special circumstances of each defendant, the defendant's ability to meet the financial conditions and the defendant's flight risk, and shouldA3Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 45never be set by reference to a predetermined schedule of amounts fixed according to the nature of the charge.(f) Financial conditions should be distinguished from the practice of allowing a defendant charged with a traffic or other minor offense to post a sum of money to be forfeited in lieu of any court appearance. This is in the nature of a stipulated fine and, where permitted, may be employed according to a predetermined schedule.(g) In appropriate circumstances when the judicial officer is satisfied that such an arrangement will ensure the appearance of the defendant, third parties should be permitted to fulfill these financial conditions[.]A4Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 46
I. Section 1117(a) Does Not Require Willfulness To Award A Trademark Infringer's ProfitsThe court of appeals' decision rests on a rule the Lanham Act does not support. When a plaintiff proves trademark infringement,3 § 1117(a) gives the court3 The ABA notes two things about the Lanham Act and its terminology. First, courts and litigants often use different labels4broad discretion to award (or not to award) the infringer's profits. Although some circuits have restricted that discretion by requiring a threshold showing of willful infringement--including the Second Circuit, whose law governed here--that requirement did not come from Congress.A. The Statute's Plain Language Does Not Require WillfulnessStatutory interpretation begins, of course, with the plain language. Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 251 (2010) ("We must enforce plain and unambiguous statutory languagefor infringement claims under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)--e.g., trademark infringement, federal unfair competition, false designation of origin, or false association, to name a few. Labels aside, all of these claims are the same. See 5 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair Competition § 27:14 (5th ed. 2018) ("Section [1125(a)] is a federal claim for infringement of unregistered marks"). For consistency, this brief will use the blanket term "trademark infringement."Second, petitioner's question presented mentions only § 1125(a), but the Court's holding here will also necessarily govern profits awards for trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1114. Both statutes create the same infringement claim, the only difference being that § 1114 requires the plaintiff to own a federal registration, while § 1125(a) does not. See Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744, 1752 (2017) (citing Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992)). Section 1117(a) makes no substantive distinction between the two infringement claims. See § 1117(a) (authorizing profits awards for "violation[s] . . . of a mark registered with the Patent and Trademark Office [§ 1114]" and for "violation[s] under [§] 1125(a)"). Petitioner brought infringement claims under both statutes, Compl. ¶¶ 29­40, and it won a verdict on both, Pet. App. 106a­107a.5according to its terms."). And in the case of § 1117(a), the Court's analysis can end there too.The text of § 1117(a) does not require willfulness to award a trademark infringer's profits. The only place § 1117(a) mentions willfulness (or any similar concept) comes in a clause covering trademark dilution claims under § 1125(c), not infringement claims. See § 1117(a) ("When a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, a violation under section 1125(a) or (d) of this title, or a willful violation under section 1125(c) of this title, shall have been established . . . ." (emphasis added)).This textual difference shows that, when Congress wants to require willfulness, it knows how to do so. See Hardt, 560 U.S. at 252 ("The contrast between these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the availability of [a monetary remedy]."). In fact, it has done so in many other places throughout the Lanham Act. E.g., § 1117(c)(2) (requiring willfulness to trigger the highest level of statutory damages for counterfeiting); § 1118 (requiring willfulness to order the destruction of materials diluting a mark under § 1125(c)); § 1125(c)(5)(B) (requiring willfulness for a dilution plaintiff to access the remedies in § 1117(a) and § 1118); see also, e.g., § 1114(2)(D)(iii) (requiring "bad faith intent to profit" to hold a domain name registrar or registry liable for damages); § 1117(b)(1) (requiring "intentional[]" use of a known counterfeit mark to trigger mandatory trebling of profits or damages); § 1125(d)(1)(A)(i) (requiring "bad faith intent to profit" for a cyber-piracy claim).6The 1999 amendment to § 1117(a) does not change the analysis.4 Regardless of the statue's iterative history, the language must mean what it says. Cf. Mission Prod. Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC, 139 S. Ct. 1652, 1664 (2019) ("[T]his mash-up of legislative interventions says nothing much of anything about the content of [the statute's] general rule."). It expressly requires willfulness for dilution claims and then--in the very same sentence--imposes no such requirement for infringement claims. There is no ambiguity. See Hardt, 560 U.S. at 252 (holding that an ERISA feeshifting statue does not limit awards to the prevailing party: "The words `prevailing party' do not appear in this provision. . . . Instead, [the statute] expressly grants district courts `discretion' to award attorney's fees."). Thus, the analysis need go no further.B. Interpreting The "Principles Of Equity" Clause To Require Willfulness Contradicts Plain Meaning And PrecedentBecause § 1117(a)'s plain language does not require willful infringement, the courts adopting that requirement have found it in other places. Some courts have anchored their holdings to the statute's clause making all awards "subject to the principles of equity." See, e.g., Stone Creek, Inc. v. Omnia Italia Design, Inc., 875 F.3d 426, 442 (9th Cir. 2017) ("Our holding . . . that4 The court of appeals, bound by pre-1999 Second Circuit precedent, focused on whether the 1999 statutory amendment changed the law to make that precedent obsolete. See Pet. App. 24a­32a. Accepting for sake of argument the court's conclusion that the amendment did not change the law, see id. at 32a, the question remains whether § 1117(a) has ever required willfulness for infringement claims. It has not.7a plaintiff can secure the defendant's profits only after establishing willfulness . . . is based entirely on an interpretation of that unaltered language."); see also Pet. App. 30a (noting a "split in the courts" about the meaning of this statutory clause).5The "principles of equity" clause, though, cannot support this reading. The courts of equity had "broad remedial powers." United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 366 U.S. 316, 328 n.9 (1961) (citing Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329 (1944)). And crucial here, "Congress would not be deemed to have restricted those broad remedial powers . . . without explicit language doing so in terms, or some other strong indication of intent." Id. Yet construing § 1117(a)'s "principles of equity" clause to always require willful infringement does just that. It5 Other courts have looked outside the statute altogether. See, e.g., George Basch Co. v. Blue Coral, Inc., 968 F.2d 1532, 1539­40 (2d Cir. 1992) (relying primarily on the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition to support a willfulness requirement). Although one Restatement does conclude that willfulness should be required as a normative matter, it acknowledges differing views among the courts. See Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 37 cmt. b (noting "multiple rationales" for awarding profits); id. cmt. e (recognizing that "several cases" have awarded profits even though the defendant acted "in good faith"). Also, a different Restatement supports the contrary view that, at least when used to prevent unjust enrichment, the profits remedy does not necessarily require any particular mental state. See Restatement (Third) of Restitution & Unjust Enrichment § 51(2) ("The value for restitution purposes of benefits obtained by the misconduct of the defendant, culpable or otherwise, is not less than their market value." (emphasis added)); id. cmt. a (explaining that § 51(2) applies to "innocent converters" and "unwitting infringers").8transmutes an open-ended reference to principles historically promoting courts' broad discretion into one that immutably demands something narrow and specific in all cases. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 651 (2010) (noting "equity's resistance to rigid rules").Fighting against the plain language, respondents urge a more restrictive reading. See Opp. 31­34. They argue that Congress intended the "principles of equity" clause to incorporate a "pre-existing common law rule" supposedly requiring willful infringement. Id. at 33.The first problem, again, is that Congress did not say this. But respondents' position also rests on an incorrect historical premise. It is true that many preLanham Act decisions denied a profits award at least partly because the infringement was not willful. See Opp. 31­32 & n.5 (collecting examples). Few of those decisions, however--and none from this Court-- invoked an absolute rule to reach that result. Rather, in most of them, the courts did exactly what equity requires, and what the Lanham Act still requires today: they considered, and based their decision on, the specific facts before them. See, e.g., Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Sanders, 331 U.S. 125, 132 (1947) (affirming the denial of a profits award: "In view of these various circumstances it seems to us that [an] injunction will satisfy the equities of the case." (emphasis added)); Saxlehner v. Siegel-Cooper Co., 179 U.S. 42, 42 (1900) (reversing a profits award against all four infringers where one acted in good faith and the other three made only minimal sales); McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245, 256­58 (1877) (reversing a9profits award because of the plaintiff's "long standing" acquiescence and "inexcusable" delay in bringing suit).Also, this Court's pre-Lanham Act decisions awarding profits refute respondents' restrictive view of the common law. In Mishawaka Rubber & Woolen Manufacturing Co. v. S.S. Kresge Co., this Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision limiting a profits award to only the amount the plaintiff "affirmatively prove[d]" came from the infringement. 316 U.S. 203, 207 (1942). The Court remanded for a re-assessment of profits under the correct burden of proof, which requires the defendant to prove its sales not resulting from the infringement. Id. at 206­08. And the Court ordered that remand even though the infringement was not willful--over the dissent of three Justices on that very point. See 316 U.S. at 208­09 (Black, J., dissenting) (noting that the infringement was "found by both courts below to have been without fraudulent intent"); see also Mishawaka Rubber & Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S.S. Kresge Co., 119 F.2d 316, 324 (6th Cir. 1941) (emphasizing "no finding of fact" and "no evidence" of bad intent). Mishawaka's result would make little sense if the common law required willful infringement as a prerequisite.Such a prerequisite would also cut against the reasoning of Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros. & Co., 240 U.S. 251 (1916). Affirming a profits award, the Court there held that profits awards in trademark cases reflect an "equitable measure of compensation, on the theory of a trust ex maleficio." Id. at 259, 263. And as this Court has explained elsewhere, a trust ex maleficio "may be fastened upon a wrongdoer irrespective of intention." Jennings v. U.S. Fidelity &10Guaranty Co., 294 U.S. 216, 222 (1935) (emphasis added) (citing 1 & 3 John Norton Pomeroy, Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence §§ 155, 1044, 1046 (3d ed. 1905)).Finally, § 1117(a)'s legislative history does not support inferring a willfulness prerequisite from the "principles of equity" clause. In fact, "[t]he legislative history does not discuss [Congress'] reasons for adding" that clause at all. James M. Koelemay Jr., Monetary Relief for Trademark Infringement Under the Lanham Act, 72 Trademark Rep. 458, 485 (1982).In short, the best reading of § 1117(a)'s "principles of equity" clause is the most straightforward one: it refers to traditional and flexible equitable principles, not rigid bright-line rules. To the extent courts have extracted a willfulness prerequisite from it, their interpretation contradicts the plain language and this Court's precedent.II. A Rigid Willfulness Prerequisite Conflicts With How Trademark Law Usually OperatesBeyond its tension with the statutory language, adopting a strict prerequisite of willful infringement would conflict with how trademark law generally operates. As this Court has recognized--and as trademark practitioners can widely attest--"`most issues in trademark law'" are "fact-intensive." Hana Fin., Inc. v. Hana Bank, 135 S. Ct. 907, 911 (2015) (quoting 3 McCarthy, supra, § 17:26); accord, e.g., Marlene B. Hanson & W. Casey Walls, Protecting Trademark Good Will: The Case for a Federal Standard of Misappropriation, 81 Trademark Rep.11480, 504 n.86 (1991) (same observation by an in-house trademark attorney at a major U.S. corporation).Absent congressional action, trademark law tends to favor flexible legal standards over bright-line rules. This is partly because, as Professor McCarthy explains in his preeminent treatise, modern trademark law derives from the "extremely flexible" common law tort of unfair competition. 1 McCarthy, supra, § 1:8 & n.1 (quotation omitted); see id. § 2:7. As the Federal Circuit's predecessor court once similarly observed, "[T]rademark law must necessarily be flexible responding to particular circumstances disclosed by particular fact situations thereby making a hard and fast rule in these cases anathema to its concept and application." Interstate Brands Corp. v. Celestial Seasonings, Inc., 576 F.2d 926, 928 (C.C.P.A. 1978).This theme of flexibility permeates the Lanham Act, which "significantly changed and liberalized the common law to dispense with mere technical prohibitions." Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co., 514 U.S. 159, 171 (1995) (quotation omitted). Perhaps the most obvious example comes from the Act's test for trademark infringement: likelihood of confusion. See B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1293, 1301 (2015). "No mechanistic formula or list can set forth in advance the variety of elements that comprise the market context from which likelihood of confusion must be determined." Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 21 cmt. a. For this reason, every circuit uses a multifactor balancing test to evaluate the likelihood of confusion. 4 McCarthy, supra, § 24:30. And every circuit makes clear that the test is flexible and holistic, not mechanical:12These [likelihood-of-confusion] factors imply no mathematical precision, but are simply a guide to help determine whether confusion is likely. They are also interrelated in effect. Each case presents its own complex set of circumstances and not all of these factors may be particularly helpful in any given case.Custom Mfg. & Eng'r, Inc. v. Midway Servs., Inc., 508 F.3d 641, 650 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Homeowners Grp., Inc. v. Home Mktg. Specialists, Inc., 931 F.2d 1100, 1107 (6th Cir. 1991)); accord, e.g., Jordache Enters. v. Hogg Wyld, Ltd., 828 F.2d 1482, 1484 (10th Cir. 1987) ("This list is not exhaustive. All of the factors are interrelated and no one factor is dispositive."); Piper Aircraft Corp. v. Wag-Aero, Inc., 741 F.2d 925, 934 (7th Cir. 1984) ("None of these factors is determinative."); Plus Prods. v. Plus Discount Foods, Inc., 722 F.2d 999, 1004 (2d Cir. 1983) ("[E]ach [factor] must be considered in the context of all of the other factors.").This is just one example. Across many substantive issues, this Court has held that the Lanham Act eschews rigid rules in favor of flexibility and discretion for courts. See, e.g., B & B Hardware, 135 S. Ct. at 1306 (issue preclusion: rejecting a "categorical" rule that would prevent decisions of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board from having preclusive effect in court litigation, and holding instead that Board decisions "should be given preclusive effect on a caseby-case basis" (quotation omitted)); KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc., 543 U.S. 111, 121­23 (2004) (fair use: rejecting a bright-line rule that would require a defendant asserting fair use13under 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4) to disprove consumer confusion, but holding that courts may consider the extent of likely confusion as "relevan[t]" in assessing fair use); Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 173 (functionality: holding that the Lanham Act "liberalized the law" on functionality and "left the courts free to reevaluate the preexisting legal precedent"); id. at 171 (acquired distinctiveness: explaining that the Act abolished the bright-line rule at common law prohibiting descriptive marks from ever becoming protectable marks (citing Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir. 1976) (Friendly, J.))).This preference for case-by-case decisionmaking applies equally to trademark remedies. See, e.g., Lindy Pen Co. v. Bic Pen Corp., 982 F.2d 1400, 1410­11 (9th Cir. 1993) ("[W]e express a distinct preference for those opinions permitting relief based on the totality of the circumstances."), superseded by statute on other grounds, Trademark Amendments Act of 1999, Pub. L. No. 106­43, 113 Stat. 218. Even before the Lanham Act, few absolute rules dictated when a court could award (or deny) a trademark infringer's profits. Champion Spark Plug, for example--decided a few months before the Lanham Act went into effect-- emphasized the lack of willful infringement as just one of "various circumstances" supporting the denial of profits. 331 U.S. at 131­32. But only a few years earlier in Mishawaka, the Court reached a different result, remanding for a presumptive increase in the profits award even though the infringement was not willful. See Mishawaka, 316 U.S. at 206­08; see also p. 9, supra. These outcomes are not inconsistent. Rather, they show how awards for trademark infringement14have historically turned on the case-specific equities, not any hard-and-fast rules.Far from restricting courts' discretion in this area, the Lanham Act expressly and repeatedly preserves it. Section 1117(a) makes all awards for infringement-- including profits, actual damages, and costs of court-- "subject to the principles of equity." § 1117(a); see also Part I.B, supra. It gives courts broad discretion to adjust awards "according to the circumstances of the case." § 1117(a). For profits awards, the statute authorizes these discretionary adjustments both upward and downward, setting no floor or ceiling. See id. For damages awards--which must initially be awarded by a jury if any party exercises its Seventh Amendment right--the court can award "any sum above the amount found [by the jury] . . . not exceeding three times." Id.; see also Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 477­78 (1962) (holding that trademark infringement claims for actual damages trigger the right to a jury). The statute also allows (but tellingly, does not require) courts to award attorney's fees to the prevailing party in any "exceptional" case, § 1117(a), a standard this Court has held to be highly flexible and fact-specific. See Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572 U.S. 545, 554 (2014) (holding that the exceptional-case standard defies any "precise rule or formula" and allows "case-by-case exercise of [courts'] discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances" (quotation omitted)).6 In this respect,6 Octane Fitness interpreted the Patent Act's fee-shifting statute, which uses the same language as § 1117(a). The circuits thus uniformly hold that Octane Fitness also governs fee awards under § 1117(a). E.g., Sleepy's, LLC v. Select Comfort Wholesale15profits awards are similar to the other § 1117(a) remedies--dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case, and subject to the broad discretion of the district court that has gained intense familiarity with those facts and circumstances.On a whole host of issues, then, the Lanham Act promotes courts' discretion to make case-by-case decisions. The rule followed below cuts against that grain. Of course, no one disputes that Congress can legislate bright-line rules dictating one trademark issue or another. As explained, it has done so several times in analogous contexts. See p. 5, supra. Yet it has not done so on the question presented here. Unless and until it does, the Court should not endorse a judicially created rule that undermines trademark law's generally flexible contours.III. Willfulness Is A Relevant Factor, But Making It An Absolute Prerequisite Would Restrict Courts' Discretion To Consider Broader Equities, With No Real BenefitAt least by some courts' account, it is "`necessary'" as a policy matter to require willful infringement before awarding profits under § 1117(a). E.g., Pet. App. 22a (quoting George Basch, 968 F.2d at 1540). This is so, those courts say, because any other rule-- including one that simply trusts district courts to exercise their equitable judgment--would risk the "`conceivably draconian impact that a profits remedy might have in some cases.'" Id.Corp., 909 F.3d 519, 530­31 (2d Cir. 2018) (collecting circuit cases).16In the ABA's view, this concern about draconian impacts is overstated. It overlooks that forcing a willfulness prerequisite onto courts and parties creates its own set of drawbacks. And worse, those drawbacks seem to come with no real offsetting benefit.By definition, the willfulness rule followed below limits judges' discretion to fashion appropriate equitable relief. But "there is no substitute for the court applying its experience, wisdom, and judicial acumen to the facts at hand." Anne Gilson LaLonde, Gilson on Trademarks § 14.03[2] (Matthew Bender ed. 2018); see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009) (emphasizing courts' ability to make "contextspecific" decisions through "judicial experience and common sense"). This maxim is "especially true of an award fashioned pursuant to the Lanham Act," where "[g]reat latitude is given the trial judge." Drake v. E. I. DuPont deNemours & Co., 432 F.2d 276, 279 (5th Cir. 1970); see also Park `N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 218 (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting courts' "broad power to do equity" in Lanham Act cases).Yet in the circuits that currently require willfulness, courts lose much of their discretion. In those jurisdictions, the equitable analysis under § 1117(a) becomes a "two-step process: (1) a finding of willfulness or bad faith; and [then] (2) a weighing of the equities." E.g., W. Diversified Servs., Inc. v. Hyundai Motor Am., Inc., 427 F.3d 1269, 1273 (10th Cir. 2005). Those courts cannot even start to analyze the case's overall equities--which are supposed to matter most, both under the statute and throughout17centuries of equity jurisprudence--until they make a threshold finding of willful infringement. See, e.g., id.All of this is not to say, however, that willfulness is unimportant. Even in the circuits that do not require willfulness, profits awards still correlate strongly with the infringer's bad faith. See, e.g., Seatrax, Inc. v. Sonbeck Int'l Inc., 200 F.3d 358, 372 & n.9 (5th Cir. 2000) ("[O]ur independent research [does not] reveal[] any cases from this circuit where an accounting of profits has been awarded without a finding of willfulness.").But this correlation is not inexorably true in all cases, nor should it be. An award of profits can serve at least three distinct purposes, two of which do not necessarily require a willful infringer. See 5 McCarthy, supra, § 30:59 (outlining three purposes of profits awards: (1) as a measure of the plaintiff's damages; (2) to prevent unjust enrichment; and (3) to deter a willful infringer). If a court awards profits for the first purpose (as it is entitled to do under settled remedial principles), then inflexibly requiring willful infringement makes little sense--the trademark owner seeks only to be made whole. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Speicher, 877 F.2d 531, 535 (7th Cir. 1989) ("[I]t is hard to see how the defendant's equities could ever be superior to the plaintiff's if all the plaintiff were seeking was his actual losses."). As for the second purpose, while some unjust-enrichment scenarios involve willful infringement, some do not. See Restatement (Third) of Restitution & Unjust Enrichment § 51 cmt. c (noting that "unwitting infringers" may nonetheless owe "restitution for the market value of the rights they have `taken'").18The willfulness prerequisite's "two-step process" (W. Diversified Servs., 427 F.3d at 1273) thus mechanically and artificially constrains the court's remedial authority. Without willful infringement, the analysis ends at step one, and the court never reaches the broader equities. This restriction on judicial discretion can prove unfortunate, as a profits award is sometimes the only practicable way to compensate a trademark owner. See Hard Candy, LLC v. Anastasia Beverly Hills, Inc., 921 F.3d 1343, 1353 (11th Cir. 2019) ("The Lanham Act permits recovery of profits because actual damages are often difficult to prove.").A rigid willfulness prerequisite also comes with few (if any) overriding benefits, despite restricting courts' discretion and despite artificially elevating the importance of one issue across all stages of the case. The principal benefit of a bright-line rule, at least in general, is "clarity and predictability." Roell v. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580, 596 (2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting). That benefit becomes significantly more elusive, however, if the bright-line rule depends first on deciding a fact-intensive question like willfulness. See, e.g., Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U.S. 358, 372­73 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring) (explaining that whether to adopt or reject a bright-line rule may depend partly on "any practical gain" (quotation omitted)). Whether a trademark infringer acted willfully is a highly casespecific decision that is often difficult to make. See James M. Koelemay Jr., A Practical Guide to Monetary Relief in Trademark Infringement Cases, 85 Trademark Rep. 263, 271­76 (1995) (listing twentytwo factors courts have deemed relevant to evaluating willfulness). And even once that finding is made-- which often will not occur until late in the case--it still19does not necessarily resolve the profits question. The court can still rely on other facts and equities to deny a profits award, even if the infringement was willful. See George Basch, 968 F.2d at 1540 ("Having stated that a finding of willful deceptiveness is necessary in order to warrant an accounting for profits, we note that it may not be sufficient."); 5 McCarthy, supra, § 30:59 ("[A]n accounting of profits is never automatic and never a matter of right.").In a similar vein, courts' broad discretion to deny (or reduce) profits awards for equitable reasons-- whether or not the infringement was willful-- mitigates the concern about "`draconian impact[s].'" Pet. App. 22a (quoting George Basch, 968 F.2d at 1540). Section 1117(a) never requires a court to award profits, or to award them in any particular amount. If the court finds a profits award to be "excessive," the statute expressly gives authority to "enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the circumstances of the case." § 1117(a); accord 5 McCarthy, supra, § 30:90 ("[T]rial judges have wide discretion to exercise the power to modify monetary awards."). Preventing draconian impacts thus requires no bright-line rule. Courts can avoid them by simply exercising their statutory authority.Put simply, the conventional wisdom used to justify bright-line rules does not apply in this context. And regardless, the theoretical benefit of a bright-line rule cannot justify adopting one despite the statutory language. This Court has recently rejected bright-line rules for just that reason, including in other intellectual property cases. See, e.g., Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 1979, 1988­89 (2016)20(holding that the "objective reasonableness" of a losing party's positions is an "important factor" in awarding attorney's fees under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 505, but not a "controlling" factor because the court must "view all the circumstances of a case on their own terms"); Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 136 S. Ct. 1923, 1933­34 (2016) (rejecting "any rigid formula" for awarding enhanced damages for patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 284, and instead affirming courts' "discretion . . . to take into account the particular circumstances"); Octane Fitness, 572 U.S. at 554 (similar holding for attorney's fee awards in patent cases under 35 U.S.C. § 285). Like those statutes, § 1117(a) calls for a holistic, case-by-case view of the equities.Finally, the flexible standard adopted by several circuits will give courts all the tools they need to reach the appropriate result in the cases before them. Every circuit agrees that a trademark infringer's intent is relevant--often highly relevant--to evaluating a potential award of profits under § 1117(a). See Pet. 13­ 15; Opp. 24­27. The difference is, some circuits let district courts give that factor the weight it deserves in each particular case, while others have largely taken the decision out of the district courts' hands. The latter rule, followed below, needlessly divests courts of their statutory and historical discretion to make fair and equitable decisions. This Court should return that discretion.21CONCLUSION The court of appeals' judgment should be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.Respectfully submitted,TRAVIS R.

Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003). In Wiggins, this Court relied on the ABA Guidelines as an appropriate benchrnark for determining whether counsel'sconduct "fell below an objective standard of reasonableness" under Strickland. Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 521-24. The Courtconcluded that where "counsel abandoned their investigation of petitioner's background after having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources," counsel did not meet the norms expressed in the ABA Guidelines. Id. at 524 (citing ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1(C) and § 11.8.6).There is also consensus among the lower federal courts that the ABA Guidelines evidence prevailing norms against which counsel's conduct should be measured.Based on this history and precedent, the ABA submits that its Guidelines are indicative of prevailing professional§ For example, the Sixth Circuit has concluded that "the ABA standards for counsel in death penalty cases provide the guiding rules and standards to be used in defining the `prevailing professional norms' in ineffective assistance cases," adding "clarity, detail and content to the More generalized and indefinite 20-year-old language of Strickland." Hamblin, 354 F.3d at 486; see also Smith v. Mullin, 379 F.3d 919, 942 (10th Cir. 2004) (citing ABA standards as guides for determining reasonable attorney performance); Allen v. Woodford, 366 F.3d 823, 845 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting Supreme Court's reliance on the 4BA Guidelines in Wiggins); Roccisano v. Menifee, 293 F.3d 51, 60 (2d Cir, 2002) (referring to the ABA Standards as "well established principles" ofeffective assistance of counsel); Carter v. Bell, 218 F.3d 581, 596-600(6th Cir. 2000) (relying on ABA Guidelines and concluding that counsel's failure to investigate defendant's family, social or psychological background constituted ineffective assistance of counsel).8 norms by which defense counsel's conduct should be evaluated for reasonableness under Strickland. Because theyreflect professional norms that prevailed in the 1980s, the ABA Guidelines are an appropriate benchmark against which counsel's conduct should be judged in this case.If. UNDER THE ABA GUIDELINES, COUNSEL AREEXPECTED TO CONDUCT A THOROUGHINVESTIGATION OF MITIGATING ANDAGGRAVATING EVIDENCE, INCLUDING ATHOROUGHINVESTIGATIONOF THECLIENT'S BACKGROUND.Lawyers handling capital cases cannot make key strategic decisions in consultation with their clients that are either constitutionally or ethically sufficient without conducting a reasonably complete and thorough background investigation including investigating both mitigating and aggravating evidence. Lawyers have an independent. duty to see that this investigation is conducted, and must not delegate. the responsibility to others, including experts hired by counsel. Lawyers also have a duty to conduct a thorough background investigation even if the client and his or her family members are not cooperative.A. Counsel Has A Duty To Conduct A Thorough Investigation In Preparation For The Penalty Phase.A lawyer has an obligation to act with reasonable diligence and prompiness in representing his or her client. See Model Rules of Prof! Conduct R. 1.3 (2002). A lawyer's execution of that obligation at all times during the representation enables the client "to participate intelligently in decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and the means by which they are to be pursued." /d. at R. 1.4 cmt. 5. In the context of representing a client in a capital case, and the penalty phase in particular, the obligation to act9Twcoiotuhnsseartlei'sasfsyondatebhcleiiesriopnerstohimcptaotlneiosnbsvleisgtaaintgdiaotnedsi,lithgeceonuccnelsieealnptp'lsmiuessbtacdikprguerrcostuluyned.toathorough investigation of all reasonably availablebackground reasonablyinformation. Only when. fully armed available information obtained from awith the thoroughinvestigation can counsel effectively advise the client withrespect to different courses of action and comport with ModelRule 1.4. Id. at R. 1.4,The ABA Guidelines specifically address how counsel should fulfill those ethical obligations in the context of defending a capital case. The Guidelines reflect the fact that prevailing professional norms in death penalty cases require that "at every stage of the proceedings, counsel has a duty to investigate the case thoroughly." Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.7 cmt. (citations omitted). The ABA Guidelines recommend careful preparation by counsel for the penalty phase through investigation, consultation with the client, analysis of the prosecution's case and evaluation of all reasonably available evidence in mitigation. See ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1, § 11.8.3, § 11.8.5, and § 11.8.6. Specifically, the Guidelines require counsel to conduct sufficient investigation "to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor." ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1(C); see also § 11.8.6.; see also Wiggins, 539 US. at 524-525.Prior to the adoption of the ABA Guidelines, the ABA promulgated standards emphasizing that counsel has the responsibility in a capital case to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background -- including investigating information relevant to sentencing -- from the inception of the representation. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice § 4-4.1 cmt. (2d ed. 1980) (`It is the duty of10 the lawyer to conduct a prompt investigation into the circumstances of the case and to explore all avenues leading to the facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction.").° "Counsel cannot responsibly advise a client about the merits of different courses of action,the client cannot make informed decisions, and counsel cannot be sure of the client's competency to make such decisions, unless counsel has first conducted a thorough5 The notion that effective performance in a capital case requires athorough investigation was widely accepted among practitionersthroughout the 1980s. Articles and attomey handbooks from that timestress that defense counsel in 2 capital case should investigate thedefendant's background, including by reviewing a defendant's priorconviction records, prison records, juvenile court records, school records,and records relating to childhood abuse and substance abuse. See GaryGoodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in DeathPenalty Cases, 58 N.Y.U, L. Rev. 299, 323-24 (1983) ("Trial counsel hasa duty to investigate the client's life history, and emotional andpsychological make-up ....

Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319 (1989) (quotingCalifornia v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 545 (1987) (O'Connor,J., concurring)), rev'd on other grounds, Atkins v. Virginia,536 U.S. 304 (2002).To prepare effectively for the penalty phase, counsel should explore at a minimum, all reasonably available sources of mitigation evidence. See generally ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1. A reasonable background investigation for the penalty phase includes a review of all reasonably available documents and records. Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.7 cmt.; see also ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1(D)(2)(c). The ABA Guidelines advise that counsel should even "seek13 necessary releases for securing confidential records[.]" ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1(D)(2)(d).. Those background "[rJecords from courts, government agencies, the military, employers, etc. - can contain a wealth of mitigating evidence, documenting or providing clues to childhood abuse, retardation, brain damage, and/or mental illness, and corroborating witness' recollections." Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.7 cmt. (citations omitted).As the ABA Guidelines explain, sources of mitigation information for the penalty phase may include: charging documents, interviews with the client, interviews with family members, interviews with witnesses, interviews with others familiar with the client's life history, police reports and other physical evidence in possession of the police, review of thescene, the client's background records, and expert witnesses. ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1(D). Counsel should research those sources to develop `and consider ali reasonably availablemitigation evidence regarding the client in the following areas:medical history, (mental and physical illness or injury, alcohol and drug use, birth trauma, and developmental delays); educational _ history (achievement, performance and behavior); special educational needs (including cognitive limitations and learning disabilities); military history (type and length of service, conduct, special training); employment and training history (including skills and performance, and barriers to employability); family and social history (including physical, sexual or emotional abuse); prior adult and juvenile record; prior correctional experience (including conduct on supervision and in the institution, education or training, and clinical services); and religious and cultural influences.14 ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1, see also § 11.8.6 (B); Updated ABA Guidelines §10.7 cmt. ("Counsel should use all appropriate avenues . . . to obtain all potentially relevant information pertaining to the client, his or her siblings and parents, and other family members, including but not limited to: a. school records, b. social service and welfare records, c. . juvenile dependency or family court records, d. medical records, e. military records, f. employment records, g.criminal and correctional records, h. family birth, marriage, and death records, i. alcohol and drug abuse assessment or treatment records, and j. INS records"). If counsel'sinterviews with the client do not immediately suggest that relevant mitigation evidence is available, or if the client does not want to put forth mitigating evidence, counsel should nonetheless investigate all available sources.This Court and other courts have emphasized that obtaining available records pertaining to the client's background is a critical element of investigation in death penalty cases. In Wiggins, this Court held that the lower court unreasonably applied Strickland in part because defense counsel's investigation did not extend beyond the pre-sentence investigation report and the Department ofSocial Services' records when other records, of the kind recommended by the ABA Guidelines, were available. Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 530-31. In Williams, this Court found that counsel was ineffective where they "failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered extensive recordsgraphically describing Williams' nightmarish childhood, not because of any strategic calculation, but because they incorrectly thought that state law barred access to such records." Williams, 529 U.S. at 365. There is consensus in the lower federal courts that counsel must obtain background records in order to conduct a constitutionally sufficient investigation. See Hamblin, 354 F.3d at 491 (counsel failedto review client's mental health records, school records, and15IQ tests); Ainsworth v. Woodford, 268 F.3d 868, 874 (9th Cir.2001) ("even though [counsel] obtained school records,counsel records,failed to examine [. . .] employment records, prison records, past probation reports, andmedical militaryrecords"); (counsel childhoodJermyn failed abuse);v.

Counsel failed to obtain fundamentalrecords of Mr. Rompilla's background, including schoolrecords, and records of his prior adult and juvenileconvictions, all of which were readily available to trialcounsel in close proximity to the courtroom.

Jd. at 279-81.Even when counsel interviewed some members of the family,counsel failed to inquire about the client's past. Id.While this Court has noted that it must avoid the "distorting effects of hindsight." Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, the records that counsel failed to obtain showed: that Mr. Rompilla had experienced an extremely traumatic childhood under conditions of extreme poverty, parental neglect and abuse; that his IQ was repeatedly found to be in the mentally retarded range, and he was not able to advance functionally16past the third grade level; that he mental health abnormalities schizophrenia, paranoia, neurosishad on anddemonstrated serious scales measuringobsessive/compulsiveda2sil8hsc4ooourhldod(elSrilshos;avmiv.teaenrd,oRbottmJah.pi,aitnledldhiaes,sfehrnao3tdm5i5ngoe)tx.Fhh.ei3rbdiTtfehaatdemi2la7yt3eh-smi7tse4it,mombroyen2ry7s8of-t7hw9da,oetbuill2cdi8ot1ua-nht8sai2evn,legbolstered all of that evidence.

Jd. at 525-26. That is particularlyimportant with respect to the investigation of aggravating evidence.Several lower federal courts, as well, have cited ABAGuidelines as evidence of professional norms concerning the investigation of aggravating evidence. Allen v. Woodford, 366 F.3d 823, 844-45 (9th Cir. 2004) (investigations in the penalty phase of a capital case should include "efforts to discover all reasonably available . . . evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor"); Hamblin, 354 F.3d at 490 (same); Starr v. Lockhart, 23 F.3d 1280, 1285 (8th Cir. 1994) ("basic concerns" of capital counsel "are to neutralize the aggravating circumstances . . . and to present mitigatingevidence"; counsel was ineffective because he failed to challenge aggravating factors).In most cases, investigation of aggravating evidence will invoive at least a thorough review of the defendants' prior convictions and juvenile convictions.Counsel must . . . investigate prior convictions, adjudications, or unadjudicated offenses that could be used as aggravating circumstances or otherwise come into evidence. If a prior conviction is legally flawed, counsel should seek to have it set aside. Counsel may also find extenuating circumstances that can be offered to lessen the weight of a conviction, adjudication, or unadjudicated offense. Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.7 cmt. (citations omitted); seealso Esslinger v. Davis, 44 F.3d 1515, 1529-30 (11th Cir. 1995) (counsel failed to investigate non-capital defendant's18criminal record, which was used to enhance sentence); Lewisv. Lane, 832 F.2d 1446, 1453-58 (7th Cir. 1987) (counsel failed to investigate portions of capital defendant's criminal record that were used to establish an aggravating factor). A review of the records from the client's prior convictions may provide valuable clues concerning mental health, or concerning other witnesses who possess potential mitigating testimony that might be offered in response to the aggravating evidence. See Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.7 cmt.; see also Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 527 (in assessingreasonableness, a court must consider "whether the known evidence would lead a reasonable attorney to investigatefurther').In this case, had counsel conducted even a minimalinvestigation into the aggravating evidence that theprosecution gave notice would have discoveredit intended to introduce, counsel key mitigating evidence.

Counsel's Duty To Conduct A Thorough Investigation Is Not Excused Merely Because The Client Or Family Members Are Uncooperative.inThe responsibility ofpreparation for theconducting a thorough investigationcapital sentencing proceeding restssolely with defense counsel. ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1(A).19 That duty is separate from, and a necessary predicate to, the client's ultimate decision whether to present available mitigating evidence at the sentencing hearing. The duty also exists regardless of the cooperation counsel receives from the client or the client's family in gathering mitigation evidence or in investigating aggravation evidence.It is not uncommon for clients facing the death penalty to be recalcitrant or otherwise unhelpful with respect to the penalty phase investigation. See, e.g., Douglas v. Woodford, 316 F.3d 1079, 1087 (9th Cir. 2003); Silva v. Woodford, 279 F.3d 825, 839-41 (9th Cir. 2002); Carter, 218 F.3d at 596;Smith v. Stewart, 140 F.3d 1263, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998); Dobbsv. Turpin, 142 F.3d 1383, 1387 (11th Cir. 1998).Counsel should bear in mind that much of theinformation that must be elicited for thesentencing phase investigation is very personal and may be extremely difficult for the client todiscuss. . . . Obtaining such information [likechildhood sexual abuse] typically requiresovercoming considerable barriers, such as shame,denial, and repression, as well as other mental oremotional impairments from which the client maysuffer.,Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.7 cmt.The fact that it may be difficult to elicit this personal information does not excuse counsel from the duty to ask the client and others all questions necessary to probe for mitigating evidence, and to investigate through other sources,like school records, records from social service agencies, military records, prison records, and records from other criminal convictions. "[I]f a client forecloses certain avenuesof investigation, it arguably becomes even more incumbent upon trial counsel to seek out and find alternative sources of information and evidence, especially in the context of a20 capital murder trial." Silva, 279 F.3d at 847; see also Coleman v. Mitchell, 268 F.3d 417, 449-50 (6th Cir. 2001) ("[D]efendant resistance to disclosure of information does not excuse counsel's duty to independently investigate."); Carter, 218 F.3d at 596 ("The sole source of mitigating factors cannot properly be that information which defendant may volunteer; counsel must make some effort at independent investigation in order to make a reasoned, _ informed decision as to their utility.").Moreover, while the decision whether to present to the fact finder any mitigation evidence may rest ultimately with the client, the ABA Guidelines make clear that "[{t]he investigation for preparation of the sentencing phase should be conducted regardless of any initial assertion by the client that mitigation is not to be offered." ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1(C). See also Dobbs, 142 F.3d at 1388 ("{Llawyers may not `blindly follow' [clients' commands not to present mitigating evidence]. Although the decision whether to use mitigating evidence is for the client, . . . `the lawyer first must evaluate potential avenues and advise the client of those offering possible merit."") (quoting Thompson v. Wainwright, 787 F.2d 1447, 1451 (11th Cir. 1986)).Family members and others who know the client personally can prove a reliable and valuable resource in the penalty phase investigation. Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.11 cmt. (those with personal knowledge of the defendant "can provide vivid first-hand accounts of the poverty and abuse that characterize the lives of many capital defendants"); see also ABA Guidelines § 11.8.34F)(1) (counsel should investigate the "client's life and development, from birth to the time of sentencing") However, in some instances, those individuals do not assist the investigation, perhaps because they do not trust counsel, do not understand what information may be helpful to the21 mitigation case, or simply have no direct knowledge of mitigating evidence. See Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.7 cmt. (family members may suffer from the same impairments as the client). This may be the case particularly where a client's past includes abuse, troubling medicai history, or clear signs of mental deficiency.In this case, counsel did not interview all of the familywitnesses apparently because the client and some familywitnesses were unhelpful. Rompilla, 355 F.3d at 279-81(Sloviter, J., dissenting). There is also evidence that evenwhen counsel interviewed some members of the family,counsel failed to inquire about the client's past. Id.Counsel's deficient performance cannot be excused uncooperativeness on the part of the defendant andby hisfamily. That lack of cooperation made it all the moreimportant that counsel investigate other sources ofmitigation. Counsel should not assume that interviewsyielding little in the absence of interviews withthe way of mitigation evidence equate with such evidence. Quite the opposite. If family members are not fruitful in the way ofmitigation information, counsel should intensify their searchfor background records of the client and investigate otherpotential mitigation sources. Counsel also should attempt tointerview other extended family members, and "virtuallyeveryone else who knew the client and his family, includingneighbors, teachers, clergy, case workers, doctors,correctional, probation, or parole officers, and others."Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.7 cmt. (citations omitted); seealso ABA Guidelines § 11.8.3(F)(1).E. Counsel Should Not Delegate To Experts TheDetermination Of The Scope Of The Investigation.Defense counsel should consult with experts in preparation for the penalty phase of a capital trial, for expert witnesses are an important component of the penalty phase.22 Areas in which experts may be helpful include: deciphering the prosecution's aggravation case; rebutting the prosecution's aggravation case; and presenting mitigation topics in defense counsel's case. ABA Guidelines § 11.4.1(D)(7). Experts can also be used "to provide medical, psychological, sociological, cultural or other insights into the client's mental and/or emotional state and life history that may explain or lessen the client's culpability for the underlying offense(s); to give a favorable opinion as to the client's capacity for rehabilitation, or adaptation to prison; to explain possible treatment programs; or otherwise support a sentence less than death[.]" Updated ABA Guidelines § 10.11. However, counsel cannot, consistent with prevailing professional norms, delegate his or her duty to investigate to experts.The duty to investigate remains with counsel, regardlesswhether counsel consults with experts. See ABA Guidelines§ 11.4.1.Counsel must not simply delegate theresponsibility for conducting a thorough investigation of theclient's background to expert witnesses. Nor should counselassume that experts will independently obtain backgroundinformation needed to carry out their role effectively. Ratherthan delegate the duty to investigate to experts, counselshould ensure that experts are apprised of and provided allreasonably available information necessary and helpful to theexpert's role in the mitigation case. Jd.This Court and others have echoed the ABA's longstanding view that counsel has an "obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background," whether or not she hires expert witnesses. Wiggins, 539 U.S. at.522; see Smith v. Stewart, 189 F.3d 1004, 1012 (9th Cir. 1999) ("A lawyer who should have known but does not inform his expert witnesses about essential information going to the heart of the defendant's case for mitigation does not23 function as `counsel' under the Sixth Amendment."); see also Bean v. Calderon, 163 F.3d 1073, 1079 (9th Cir. 1998) ("When experts request necessary information and are denied it, when testing requested by expert witnesses is not performed, and when experts are placed on the stand with virtually no preparation or foundation, a capital defendant has not received effective penalty phase assistance of counsel").In this case, Mr. Rompilla's counsel attempted to justifytheir failure to investigate records of their client'sbackground by claiming that they relied on experts (who mayhave been engaged in preparation for the guilt/innocencephase and not the penalty phase), to tell them what recordswere needed for the experts' analysis. Rompilla, 355 F.3d at280-81 (Sloviter, J., dissenting). Although experts mayrequest certain documents or access to particular witnesses tocomplete their analysis, counsel should not assume that anypotential source of mitigation evidence is not importantbecause it was not requested by the expert. Counsel shouldinstead independently seek to procure through investigationother mitigating evidence that may enhance the expert'sanalysis. Counsel's reliance upon experts to define the scopeof their mitigation investigation was not in accordance withprevailing professional norms reflected in the ABAGuidelines.`24 CONCLUSIONThe ABA respectfully submits that Third Circuit Court of Appeals should bethe decision reversed.of theTERRI L.

I. AS A CLASS, JUVENILE OFFENDERS DO NOT POSSESS THE HEIGHTENED MORAL CULPABILITY REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY THE DEATH PENALTY.A. To Deserve A Sentence Of Death, A Defendant Must Possess A Degree Of Moral Culpability Beyond That Necessary To Find Guilt.The Court's jurisprudence establishes that, in order to satisfy the Eighth Amendment, the death penalty must be used only in cases where the conduct of the defendant or the nature of the crime demonstrates a heightened level of moral culpability beyond that needed to establish guilt. Thus, since Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976), capital punishment has been permitted in the United States only for those who commit the most egregious crimes. Following this principle, the Court has held that execution is an impermissible punishment for the rape of an adult woman, Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584 (1977), and for a felony murderer who "did not take life, attempt to take it, or intend5to take life . . . ." Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 789-93 (1982). Indeed, even "the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State . . . ." Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 319 (2002). Only those offenders who are capable of and exhibit heightened moral culpability ­ beyond that sufficient to impose criminal liability ­ are subjected to the possibility of a death sentence. For the reasons explained below, youths under eighteen cannot be said to possess the degree of moral culpability required to justify a sentence of death.B. Juveniles Have A Lesser Culpability Than Adults.Many areas of the law have long acknowledged what society (especially parents) has long understood ­ that juveniles are less culpable than adult offenders because they are more likely as a group to be less capable than adults of fully comprehending the consequences of their actions and controlling their behavior. Historically, children were treated under Anglo-Saxon criminal law as if they were mental incompetents. Children under the age of seven were presumed conclusively to be incapable of criminal acts because they were thought to be unable to know right from wrong or to engage in the requisite intentional conduct. See Clay v. State, 143 Fla. 204, 208 (Fla. 1940) ("[i]t is well established at common law that a child under the age of 7 years is conclusively presumed to be incapable of committing a crime . . . ."); see also Jeffrey Fagan, Atkins, Adolescence, and the Maturity Heuristic: Rationales for a Categorical Exemption for Juveniles from Capital Punishment, 33 N.M. L. Rev. 207, 226 (2003) ("Fagan"). At the same time, the criminal law generally created a rebuttable presumption of incapacity for children between the ages of seven and fourteen, a presumption that the prosecution bore the burden to overcome. See People v. Olsen, 36 Cal. 3d6638, 647 (Cal. 1984) (". . . statute creates a rebuttable presumption that children under the age of 14 are incapable of knowing the wrongfulness of their actions and, therefore, are incapable of committing a crime"); Clay, 143 Fla. at 208 ("the common law rule raises a presumption of incapacity of an infant between the ages of 7 and 14"). These presumptions at law were based on an "unwillingness to punish individuals incapable of forming criminal intent and thus incapable of assuming responsibility for their acts." Andrew Walkover, The Infancy Defense in the New Juvenile Court, 31 UCLA L. Rev. 503, 512 (1984).As the law evolved, it departed from the "incapacity" theory and instead concluded that children lacked culpability because they had a reduced capacity for sense and reason and lacked the ability to "function as moral agents rationally choosing their evil designs." Martin R. Gardner, The Mens Rea Enigma: Observations on the Role of Motive in the Criminal Law Past and Present, 1993 UTAH L. Rev. 635, 662 (1993). As this Court has stated:youth is more than a chronological fact. It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage. [As a result,] [o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition that [juveniles] . . . are less mature and responsible than adults.Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 115 (1982). It thus is widely acknowledged in the law that "[juveniles] are more vulnerable, more impulsive and less self-disciplined than adults . . . [and] may have less capacity to control their conduct and to think in long-range terms than adults . . . ," characteristics that explain "[t]he reasons why juveniles are not trusted with the privileges and responsibilities of an7adult . . . ." Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 834-35 (1988) (plurality opinion) (citations omitted).Society's recognition that juveniles under eighteen do not possess the same capacity for mature reasoning that adults have is so deeply engrained that state and federal legislation has universally given juveniles distinct status in many areas of the law. See Thompson, 487 U.S. at 823-25 (plurality opinion). These legislative determinations include numerous age-based classifications that recognize eighteen as the minimum age that juveniles must attain before they are capable of making rational, informed decisions and taking responsibility for their actions. Consequently, juveniles are accorded a status different from adults in a number of areas of the law, including contract law and family law, as well as in several areas regulating conduct, such as the right to vote, to drink alcohol, and a growing body of restrictions on when and with whom juveniles under eighteen may operate automobiles. Id.; see generally, Fagan, supra, at 223-24.In Atkins, the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of mentally retarded offenders based on evidence that mentally retarded persons have "diminished capacities" that render them less socially and mentally developed than non-mentally retarded adults. Their diminished cognitive functioning ­ and the corresponding limitations and challenges that flow therefrom ­ so reduce their moral culpability that the Court has drawn a bright-line rule holding unconstitutional the imposition of the death penalty on the mentally retarded. 536 U.S. at 321. Specifically, the Court in Atkins found:[m]entally retarded persons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and are competent to stand trial. Because of their8impairments, however, by definition they have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others.Id. at 318. The Court further recognized that mentally retarded persons "often act on impulse rather than premeditated plan," are susceptible to influence, and are generally followers. Id. These deficits render the mentally retarded unable to appreciate the correlation between their actions, the consequences of those actions and the subsequent punishment for those actions, and therefore unable to alter their actions in accordance with their moral judgment. "[These] deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but they do diminish their personal culpability." Id.Juveniles share nearly all of the developmental characteristics of the mentally retarded that support their categorical ineligibility for the death penalty. Like the mentally retarded, juveniles have decreased abilities to regulate their actions, understand the correlation between their actions and the consequences of those actions, and to appreciate the impact of the resulting punishment for their actions.4 Moreover, recent scientific research supports the4See William Gardner, A Life-Span Rational-ChoiceTheory of Risk Taking, in Adolescent Risk Taking78-79 (Nancy J. Bell & Robert W. Bell eds., 1993);Laurence Steinberg & Elizabeth Cauffman, Maturityof Judgment in Adolescent Decision Making, 20 Law& Hum. Behav. 249 (1996) (noting that juvenileshave lesser capacity in the following components of9conclusion that the brains of juveniles are less developed than those of non-mentally retarded adults.5 Moreover,the decision-making process: (1) autonomous choice, (2) self-management, (3) risk perception, and (4) calculation of future risks); William Gardner & Janna Herman, Adolescents' AIDS Risk Taking: A Rational Choice Perspective, Adolescents in the AIDS Epidemic 24 (William Gardner et. al. eds., 1990) (noting that juveniles give disproportionate weight to the short term effects of their actions); and B. Bradford Brown, Peer Groups and Peer Cultures, in At the Threshold: The Developing Adolescent 171 (S. Shirley Feldman and Glen R. Elliot eds., 1990)("Feldman & Elliot") (noting that juveniles are more susceptible to peer influence than non-mentally retarded adults).5See Patricia Spear, The Adolescent Brain and Age-Related Behavioral Manifestations, 24 Neuroscience& Biobehavioral Revs. 417 (2000); E. R. Sowell etal., In Vivo Evidence for Post-Adolescent BrainMutation in Frontal and Striatal Regions, 2 NatureNeuroscience 859 (1999); Elkohon Goldberg, TheExecutive Brain: Frontal Lobes and the CivilizedMind (Oxford University Press 2001) pp. 144-145; A.A. Baird et al., Functional Magnetic ResonanceImaging of Facial Affect Recognition in Children andAdolescents, 38 J. Am. Academy of Child &Adolescent Psychiatry 195 (1999); Elizabeth S. Scottand Laurence Steinberg, Blaming Youth, 81 Tex. L.Rev. 799, 801 (Feb. 2003)(citing Ronald Dahl, AffectRegulation Brain Development, and Behavioral/Emotional Health in Adolescence, 6 CNS Spectrums60 (2001)).10juveniles have fewer life experiences to inform their decision making. Thus, like the mentally retarded, while juveniles may know the difference between right and wrong and may be competent to stand trial, they are less competent decision makers than non-mentally retarded adults because they have underdeveloped decision making capacities.In light of their developmental similarities, what the Court said of the mentally retarded in Atkins applies equally to juvenile offenders: "Because of their [deficiencies] in areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of their impulses, they do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct." 536 U.S. at 306. These deficiencies reduce juvenile offenders' moral culpability so significantly that a categorical bar on the imposition of the death penalty is constitutionally required.C. As With The Mentally Retarded, Neither Retribution Nor Deterrence Justifies The Execution Of Juvenile Offenders.Atkins also recognized that the two purported justifications for the death penalty ­ retribution and deterrence ­ are not served by executing the mentally retarded. Again, because their cognitive impairments prevent them from "[acting] with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious criminal conduct," the retribution or "just deserts" rationale for the death penalty is inapplicable to the mentally retarded. 536 U.S. at 306. Similarly, the deterrence justification is without force because the cognitive impairments of mentally retarded individuals "make it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information." Id. at 320.11These same rationales apply as well to juvenile offenders. Because the retribution justification for the imposition of the death penalty is based principally on the moral culpability of offenders, and because juveniles are less morally culpable than adults, the retribution rationale for the death penalty is also inapplicable to juvenile offenders.Nor is deterrence served by executing juvenile offenders, rather than imposing severe prison sentences for their crimes. As discussed above, the state of adolescence can be characterized by poor impulse control, an inability to envision the consequences of one's acts, and a belief in one's own invincibility. Because of these characteristics, the threat of the death penalty does not add any meaningful deterrent effect beyond the threat to a juvenile of being tried as an adult and imprisoned for life.There is an additional reason why the death penalty is inappropriate for juvenile offenders that makes juveniles even less deserving of the death penalty: society generally recognizes that juvenile offenders are more capable of rehabilitation than adults.D. Juveniles, Like The Mentally Retarded, Face A Special Risk Of Wrongful Conviction And Of Receiving Unjustified Death Sentences.An additional and equally compelling reason for instituting a categorical rule against the execution of juvenile offenders is the heightened risk of a tragic miscarriage of justice, either through the conviction of a factually innocent defendant of a capital crime or the unjustified imposition of a death sentence. As the Court in Atkins concluded:12[t]he risk "that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty," Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605 (1978), is enhanced, not only by the possibility of false confessions, but also by the lesser ability of mentally retarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or more aggravating factors. Mentally retarded persons may be less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes.Atkins, 536 U.S. at 320-21. Like the mentally retarded, juveniles are less effectively protected by important safeguards that serve to assure reliable results in criminal trials and sentencing proceedings. This deficiency, coupled with their immaturity, could "jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against [them]." See Atkins, 536 U.S. at 306-07.First, juveniles' developmental limitations subject them to the increased possibility of being wrongfully convicted of capital crimes they did not commit. In particular, juveniles, like the mentally retarded, are more susceptible to coercion and more likely to be intimidated into making false confessions than are adults.Indeed, there are a number of cases where it has been determined by objective evidence that juveniles falsely confessed to crimes they did not commit, including grisly crimes. The Central Park Jogger case is a well known example of a situation where juveniles made such erroneous13confessions and were exonerated only after they completed their lengthy sentences.6 Likewise a teenage offender ondeath row in Texas was recently found, on the basis of DNAevidence, to have been innocent of a rape and murder to which he confessed as a juvenile.7These examples are part of a disturbing pattern as demonstrated by a recent study of exoneration cases since 1989, conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan School of Law, where the defendants' convictions were nullified by official acts by governors, courts or prosecutors because of compelling evidence that they were not guilty. Gross, Jacoby, Matheson, Montgomery & Patil, Exonerations in the United States, 1989 through 2003 (April 19, 2004).8 This examination found that 44% of the juveniles exonerated during that period had falsely confessed to crimes they did not commit. Id. at 20-21. See also Drizin & Leo, The Problem of False Confessions in the Post-DNA World, 82 N.C. L. Rev. 891, 966-68 (2004)(describing 40 false confessions by juveniles).The higher risk of wrongful conviction among juveniles is unsurprising in view of developmental deficiencies described in Section I.B. above that make6See People v. Wise, 752 N.Y.S.2d. 837 (N.Y. App.Div. 2002).7See UPI, Judge Frees Wrongly Convicted Man (Jan.16, 2001); Henry Weinstein, DNA Testing ClearsTexas Murderer and "Accomplice," p. A-1 (LosAngeles Times, (Oct. 14, 2000).8This report can be accessed at:http://www.law.umich.edu/ NewsAndInfo//exonerations-in-us.pdf.14juveniles less able than adults to assist in their defense at trial. Juveniles are less capable than adults of communicating with and giving meaningful assistance to their counsel. Juveniles tend to telescope the future and do not appreciate long-term consequences of their actions, impairing their ability to make appropriate decisions regarding plea bargains and other aspects of their legal strategy. Juveniles also lack sufficient experience to help them recognize exculpatory facts and communicate them to their counsel. As the Court held in the case of the mentally retarded, these limitations weigh against imposing the death penalty against juveniles. See Atkins, 536 U.S. at 320-21.Juveniles, like the mentally retarded, likewise risk an increased possibility of being wrongly convicted of capital offenses when lesser degrees of homicide are the appropriate verdicts. Juveniles face this risk not only because of the factors discussed above, but because they are more likely to exaggerate their roles in crimes due to pressure from peers or older co-defendants, out of a desire to show off, or in order not to show their fear. See generally, Eddings, 455 at 115; Thompson, 487 at 835; Feldman and Elliot.Finally, like those with mental retardation, juveniles are exposed to an increased risk of being sentenced to death in cases where, were all available mitigating evidence presented, the sentence would be less than death. In particular, juveniles are less able than adults to assist in developing mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of their trial. The characteristics of adolescence that subject teenagers to a greater risk of wrongful conviction or a capital conviction (e.g., their lack of experience in recognizing exculpatory facts and their susceptibility to exaggerating or mischaracterizing their role) also are similar to characteristics of the mentally retarded that the Court found impedes their ability to "make a persuasive showing of15mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or more aggravating factors." See Atkins, 536 U.S. at 320. These characteristics are common among sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds, not just among youth aged fifteen and below.In particular, juveniles' immaturity and/or embarrassment often impedes their disclosure of prior emotional, physical or sexual abuse, crucial evidence that frequently forms the bedrock of mitigation in capital proceedings. Similarly, juveniles are less likely than adults to disclose mental health problems or to have their mental illnesses diagnosed, and by virtue of their age, are less likely to have received treatment for existing disorders. Dorothy Otnow Lewis et. al., Neuropsychiatric, Psychoeducational and Family Characteristics of 14 Juveniles Condemned to Death in the United States, 145 American Journal of Psychiatry 584 (May 1988). Thus, the corroborating evidence so necessary to prepare adequate mitigation defenses often has not been presented to juries in juveniles' death penalty trials, leading to death sentences in instances where such sentences would be inappropriate if all the mitigating facts were known.II. THERE IS A GROWING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT THE DEATH PENALTY IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS.In Atkins, the Court held that Eighth Amendment claims of excessive punishment must be based on society's evolving standards of decency:A claim that punishment is excessive is judged not by the standards that prevailed in 1685 when Lord Jeffreys presided over the16"Bloody Assizes" or when the Bill of Rights was adopted, but rather by those that currently prevail. As Chief Justice Warren explained in his opinion in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958): "The basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man . . . The Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society." Id. at 100-01.536 U.S. at 311-12. The Court went on to note that "evolving standards should be informed by 'objective factors to the maximum possible extent,'" and "that the 'clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country's legislatures.'" Id. at 312 (quoting Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 1000 (1991); Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 331 (1989)).The Court considered such objective evidence regarding state legislation in each of its two most recent decisions regarding the constitutionality of the death penalty for juveniles. In Thompson v. Oklahoma, the Court relied on the fact that every state with a death penalty statute on the books required that the defendant be at least sixteen at the time of the capital offense, and thus set sixteen as the minimum age for eligibility for the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment. 487 U.S. at 829. When the Court refused to increase the minimum age to eighteen in Stanford v. Kentucky, the Court found that 25 of the 37 death penalty states permitted the execution of juvenile offenders. 492 U.S. at 370.National standards regarding the execution of juvenile offenders have substantially evolved since the Stanford decision. As the Supreme Court of Missouri here17found, since 1989, five more states have established eighteen as the minimum age for capital offenses.9 This trend,moreover, is steadily progressing: since the time of theMissouri Court's decision in this case below, South Dakotaand Wyoming enacted laws raising the minimum eligible age for the death penalty to eighteen years.10By contrast, no state has lowered the minimum age from eighteen since the Court's Stanford decision. As a result, and taking into account the Missouri Supreme Court's ruling here, only 19 of the 50 states ­ little more than one third of all states and less than 50% of the 39 states that allow the death penalty -- now permit the execution of offenders under eighteen. Moreover, eighteen is the minimum statutory age for the federal death penalty in both the civilian and military courts.11In Atkins, the Court also looked at evidence other than enacted legislation, holding that "the objective evidence,9Montana, Indiana and Washington raised theminimum age to eighteen, while Kansas and NewYork enacted death penalty legislation thatestablished eighteen as the minimum age. See Stateex rel Simmons v. Roper, 112 S.W.3d 397, 408 (Mo.2003).10 Senate Bill 182, 2004 S.D. SB 182; Original House Bill No. 5, 2004 Wyo. Sess. Laws 29 (to be codified at Wyo. Stat. 6-2-101(b)). In addition, the New Hampshire legislature passed legislation raising the minimum age to eighteen only to see that legislation vetoed by the governor. Senate Bill 513, 2003 N.H. SB 513 (vetoed May 10, 2004).11 See Simmons, 112 S.W.3d at 408.18though of great importance, did not 'wholly determine' the controversy." Atkins, 536 U.S. at 313 (quoting Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. at 597). For example, the Court relied on the fact that only a few states with laws permitting the execution of the mentally retarded actually engaged in such executions in practice. Atkins, 536 U.S. at 316. The Missouri Court explained in detail how the same is true today with respect to juveniles. Only twelve states currently have juvenile offenders on death row, and only seven states have actually executed a juvenile since 1976.12 In this small group of states, only 22 juveniles have actually been executed, and thirteen of them (almost 60 percent) have been executed in Texas alone.13 This high concentration of executions of juvenile offenders in a single state further illustrates that such executions are not the norm for most of our society. These developments evidence a compelling national consensus that 18 should be the minimum age for the application of the death penalty.It is especially telling that the solidifying national consensus against the execution of juveniles comes during an era when states otherwise are lowering the age for juvenile offenders to be treated as adults and expanding the class of crimes that subject juveniles to adult jurisdiction and punishment. Yet, since Stanford, despite the trend towards more vigorous application of adult criminal jurisdiction to12 The ABA has developed a web page entitled Juvenile Death Penalty Resources & Information, which contains detailed statistics regarding the execution of juveniles and the number of juveniles on death row. The address of this web page is http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/juvjus/resources.html13Id.19juveniles, no state has joined the diminished ranks of those willing to execute juvenile offenders. State and federal legislators, and the public they represent, recognize that, when it comes to juveniles, the death penalty is different.The consensus against the execution of juvenile offenders also is evidenced by the positions of national organizations with interest, expertise, and experience in this issue, including the ABA, the leading organization representing the legal profession. While it is true that the ABA opposed the death penalty for juvenile offenders prior to the Stanford decision, the ABA reconfirmed that position subsequent to Stanford when it supported a moratorium against the death penalty until, inter alia, the death penalty has been eliminated for juvenile offenders. ABA, Report with Recommendations No. 107 (February 1997).Finally, the United States is virtually alone among the world's nations in permitting the execution of juvenile offenders, a factor this Court considered in Thompson and again in Atkins. Thompson, 487 U.S. at 830-31; Atkins, 536 U.S. at 316 n.21. Since 2000, the only other countries reported to have executed juveniles are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran and Pakistan, and of these countries, Pakistan recently has raised the death penalty eligibility age to eighteen.14 Moreover, the executions of juvenile offenders in these countries were under special circumstances, leaving the United States as the only country in the world that openly continues to execute juvenile14 Amnesty International, The Exclusion of Child Offenders From the Death Penalty Under General International Law, 6 (July 2003).20offenders within the framework of its regular criminal justice system.1515Id.21CONCLUSIONFor the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Missouri Supreme Court should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,Dated: July 19, 2004Dennis W.

 I. FOR SECTION 3599°S RIGHT TO ANATTORNEY TO BE MEANINGFUL, THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP MUST INCLUDE BOTH KNOWING, RATIONAL COMMUNAI NDCDEA CIT SIOI N-O MAKN ING BY THE CAPITAL HABEAS PETITIONERS AND AN APPROPRIATE STAY WHEN THEY ARE NOT COMPETENT TO PARTICIPATE. This Court, in its unanimous opinion last term in Martel v. Clair, stated that when Congress passed thelegislation now known as 18 U.S.C. § 3599, which governs the appointment of counsel in capital cases, it did so in light of "the seriousness of the possible penalty and... the unique and complex nature of the8 litigation." 132 S. Ct. 1276, 1284-85 (2012) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3599(d) (2006))."°The ABA respectfully asserts that for the right to appointment of counsel to be meaningful, the appointment must result in an attorney-client relationship in which there is a right to knowing, rational communication and decision-making by the capital habeas petitioners and, in appropriate circumstances, a right to a stay of proceedings when they are not competent to participate. Further, the lawyers appointed under § 3599 must retain their ability to comply with their licensing jurisdictions' formulations of the Model Rules. This requires that the lawyers maintain, as far as reasonably possible, normal lawyer-client relationships, and when the lawyers reasonably believe that their clients cannot adequately act in the clients' own interests, that they initiate protective actions that, in appropriate circumstances, may include a request for a stay of proceedings.The ABA notes that, in Tibbals v. Carter, Respondent Mr. Carter's brief addresses § 3599 in the alternative. While the ABA, in this brief, addresses only § 3599 as it applies to the duties of lawyers under the Model Rules, the ABA agrees with Respondent Carter that the courts have inherent equitable power to impose stays as a matter of discretion.9 A. Effective Legal RepresentationRequires That Lawyers Comply With The Licensing States' Formulations Of Model Rule 1.14 When Representing Clients Who Are Not Competent As the Court stated in Martel, § 3599 "seeks to promote effective representation for persons threatened with capital punishment" and "aims in multiple ways to improve the quality of representation afforded to capital petitioners and defendants alike." 132 S. Ct. at 1285. It sets requirements, inter alia, for counsel's level of legal experience and rates of compensation, "in part to attract better counsel." Id. These measures "reflec[t] a determination that quality legal representation is necessary' in all capital proceedings to foster `fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty." Id. (quoting McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 855, 859 (1994))."? In order for there to be "effective" and "quality" representation when a client is not competent, lawyers must comply--at a minimum--with their licensing jurisdictions' formulations of Model Rule 1.14(a) and (b).?"| See also McFarland, 512 U.S. at 859 ("By providing indigent capital defendants with a mandatory right to qualified legal counsel in these proceedings, Congress has recognized that federal habeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in promoting fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty."). " Arizona Rule of Professional Conduct 1.14, pertinent to Mr. Gonzales petition, and Ohio Rule of Professional Conduct 1.14, pertinent to Mr. Carter's petition, mirror Model Rule1.14.10 Model Rule 1.14(a) provides:(a) When a client's capacity to make adequately considered decisions in connection with a representation is diminished, whether because of minority, mental impairment or for some other reason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the client. A "normal client-lawyer relationship presumes that there can be effective communication between the client and lawyer." Ethics Op. at 110 (citing Model Rule 1.4(a)).* The relationship also presumes "that the8 Model Rule 1.4(a) states that a lawyer shall: (1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client's informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(e), is required by these Rules; (2) reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client's objectives are to be accomplished; (3) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter; (4) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and (5) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer's conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.Model Rule 1.4(a) is consistent with the common law tradition,11 client, after consultation with the lawyer, can make considered decisions about the objectives of the representation and the means of achieving those objectives." Ethics Op. at 110 (citing Model Rule 1.2(a)).*When a normal attorney-client relationship is impaired, the lawyer should "continue to treat the client with attention and respect, attempt to communicate and discuss relevant matters, and continue as far as reasonably possible to take action consistent with the client's directions and decisions." Id. (citing Comment 1 to Model Rule 1.14(a)). However, in these circumstances, Model Rule 1.14(b) provides:which some federal appellate courts have relied on in concluding that there is a right to competence in habeas proceedings under § 3599. E.g., Rohan ex rel. Gates v. Woodford, 334 F.3d 803, 807-08 (9th Cir.) (discussing competence in phases of proceedings; concluding that, at common law, competence was tied to "capacity for rational communication"), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1069 (2003); Holmes v. Buss, 506 F.3d 576, 578 (7th Cir. 2007) (citing Rohan); cf. Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981) (noting that attorney-client privilege "recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer's being fully informed by the client") (citation omitted).Model Rule 1.2(a) states: "[A] lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and... shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued." See also, ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (rev. Feb. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1009 (2003) ("Overcoming barriers to communication and establishing a rapport with the client are critical to effective representation.").12 When the lawyer reasonably believes that the client has diminished capacity, is at risk of substantial physical, financial or other harm unless action is taken and cannot adequately act in the client's own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective action, including consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability to take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem, conservator or guardian. In the absence of Model Rule 14(b), where the client's impairment is such that the lawyer is unable to comply with her responsibilities to the client under the Model Rules, the lawyer would have no choice but to withdraw. Ethics Op. at 112 (citing Model Rule 1.16(a)(1)) (withdrawal required where "representation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct"). In fact, "[b]ecause the relationship of client and lawyer is one of principal and agent, principles of agency law might operate to suspend or terminate the lawyer's authority to act when a client is incompetent." Id. at 110. In considering whether to proceed under Model Rule 14(b) or Model Rule 1.16(a)(1), the lawyer must carefully consider the ramifications to the client: The particular circumstances may also be such that the lawyer cannot withdraw without prejudice to the client. For instance, the client's incompetence may develop in the middle of a pending matter and substitute counsel may not be able to represent the client effectively due to13 the inability to discuss the matter with the client. Ethics Op. at 112; see also Model Rule 1.16(b) (stating that a lawyer may withdraw if "(1) withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client"). Without concluding that a lawyer can never withdraw based on the incompetency of a client, the authors of the Ethics Opinion believed that "the better course of action, and the one most likely to be consistent with Rule 1.16(b), will often be for the lawyer to stay with the representation and seek appropriate protective action on behalf of the client." Ethics Op. at 112 (citing Model Rule 14(b)). That is, the Model Rules permit a narrow exception to the normal responsibilities of a lawyer to the client by "permitting the lawyer to take action [under Model Rule 14(b)] that by its very nature must be regarded as `adverse' to the client." Jd. at 113-14. Further, although Model Rule 14(b) permits a lawyer to seek the appointment of a guardian in appropriate circumstances, and while the federal habeas statute anticipates that a petition may be filed by someone acting on the petitioner's behalf in some circumstances, see 28 U.S.C. § 2242, "[t]he appointment of a guardian is a serious deprivation of the client's rights and ought not be undertaken if other, less drastic, solutions are available." Ethics Op. at 112. Before taking this step, the lawyer must make "the requisite determination on his own that a guardianship is necessary and is the least restrictive alternative." Id. at 114. Similarly,14 Although not expressly dictated by the Model Rules, the principle of respecting the client's autonomy dictates that the action taken by a lawyer who believes the client can no longer adequately act in his or her own interest should be the action that is reasonably viewed as the least restrictive action under the circumstances. Id. at 112. Accordingly, the ABA asserts that when a lawyer appointed under § 3599 determines that an incompetent capital habeas client cannot adequately act in his or her own interest, the lawyer must be able to pursue "the least restrictive action under the circumstances," and this must include moving for a stay of proceedings in appropriate circumstances. See id. The ABA therefore requests that this Court conclude that appointment of counsel under § 3599 requires an attorney-client relationship that includes the right both to knowing, rational communication and decision-making by the capital habeas petitioner and, in appropriate circumstances, a stay of proceedings when the habeas petitioner is not competent to participate.15 B. Courts Should Use A Flexible StandardIn Determining Whether A Stay Is Appropriate Under The Circumstances. As the ABA Task Force on Mental Disability and the Death Penalty stated in its Report on Death Penalty and Persons with Mental Disabilities: Many issues raised in collateral proceedings can be adjudicated without the prisoner's participation, and these matters should be litigated according to customary practice. However, collateral proceedings should be suspended if the prisoner's counsel makes a substantial and particularized showing that the prisoner's impairments would prevent a fair and accurate resolution of specific claims... . Id. at 674 (citing, inter alia, Council v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 597 S.E.2d 782, 787 (2004)); Catoe, 597 S.E.2d at 787 ("[T]he default rule is that [post-conviction review] hearings must proceed even though a petitioner is incompetent. For issues requiring the petitioner's competence to assist his [post-conviction] counsel, such as a fact-based challenge to his defense counsel's conduct at trial, the [post-conviction] judge may grant a continuance, staying review of these issues until petitioner regains his competence."). Clearly, a showing that a client's incompetence will prevent a fair and accurate resolution of specific claims should be sufficient grounds for a stay, and where the lawyer makes such a showing, the court should stay the proceedings. See Carter v. Florida, 706 So. 2d 873, 875 (Fla. 1997) ("There can be no question that a capital defendant's competency is crucial to a proper16determination of a collateral claim when the defendant has information necessary to the development or resolution of that claim.").However, the showing required should be flexible, depending on the prisoner's impairments and the circumstances of the case. For example, a stay may also be appropriate where incompetency prevents the determination of whether the client has viable claims. See, e.g., People v. Owens, 564 N.E.2d 1184, 1187 (Il. 1990) ("[[llinois Supreme Court Rule 651] is not satisfied where appointed counsel cannot determine whether a post-conviction petitioner has any viable claims, because the petitioner's mental disease or defect renders him incapable of communicating in a rational manner. In either circumstance, the appointment of an attorney is but an empty formality.") (internal citations omitted); Richard J. Bonnie, Mentally Ill Prisoners on Death Row: Unsolved Puzzles for Courts and Legislatures, 54 Cath. U. L. Rev. 1169, 1180 (2005) ("[A] prisoner's impairments could obscure potentially valid claims, preventing counsel from finding out about them at all, or could inhibit his effective participation in an evidentiary hearing involving specific claims that are known to counsel.").Further, a stay may be appropriate even when all of the facts relevant to the case appear to be widely known. In claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, for example, what was presented at trial will be set out in the record. However, a competent defendant may enhance his counsel's understanding of the importance of information known by counsel and provide information that was not presented, thereby enhancing his counsel's ability to demonstrate an unappreciated17 importance of presented as well as missing information to the court. See, e.g., Holmes v. Buss, 506 F.3d at 580 (noting that in pursuing post-conviction relief a client "may--if mentally competent--be able to convey to his lawyers a better sense of the alleged misbehavior of the prosecutor and of defense counsel than the trial transcript and other documentation provide").Also, as to "strategic" choices--even those commonly perceived to be within the expertise of appellate counsel--it may be necessary for a client to be able to communicate with counsel when, under the Model Rules, they are choices for the client to make. As stated by the Seventh Circuit:When the issue is competence to appeal, the tactical question whether to plead incompetence and if one prevails perhaps remain on death row for the rest of one's life, or to press for a new trial even at the risk of another conviction and another death sentence, becomes allimportant, and it is a question on which input from the petitioner is vital. It's not really a lawyer's decision at all, though the lawyer can advise on the likelihood that habeas corpus relief will be granted and, if so, that the petitioner will again be sentenced to death and perhaps have then no basis for seeking relief. Holmes v. Levenhagen, 600 F.3d 756, 758-59 (7th Cir. 2010). Finally, a stay may be appropriate where the lawyer informs the court that, contrary to his obligations to the client under the Model Rules, the18 lawyer cannot conscientiously accede to his client's instructions because of evidence casting doubt on the client's mental competency. See, e.g., Rees v. Peyton, 384 U.S. 312, 313-14 (1966) (directing trial court to determine "whether [Rees] has capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation or on the other hand whether he is suffering from a mental disease, disorder, or defect which may substantially affect his capacity in the premises").As the Report on Death Penalty and Persons with Mental Disabilities explained:Thorough post-conviction review of the legality of death sentences has become an integral component of modern death penalty law, analogous in some respects to direct review. Any impediment to thorough collateral review undermines the integrity of the review process and therefore the death sentence itself. Id. at 674. As illustrated in each of the circumstances above, a prisoner's competence to communicate rationally with counsel may be such an impediment. They also illustrate the variety and complexity of some of the difficulties that lawyers confront when attempting to establish that a stay is appropriate under the circumstances of their clients' incompetence and the facts of their cases. Accordingly, the ABA requests that this Court hold that appointment of counsel under § 3599 requires both knowing, rational communication and decisionmaking by capital habeas petitioners and an appropriate stay of the proceedings when they are not19competent to participate, and that it also requires that the courts use a flexible standard, based on the particular incompetency of a petitioner and the circumstances of the case, in determining whether a stay is appropriate.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae the American Bar Association respectfully requests that the decisions of the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and Ninth Circuits be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: Kevin M.

I. THIS COURT'S PETRELLA HOLDING APPLIES TO PATENT CASES.The ABA's position in this case is dictated by the Court's holding in Petrella v. Metro-GoldwynMayer, 1354 S. Ct. 1962 (2014), that a laches defense is not available where a statute has a damagelimitations period that already accounts for delay. The Court's holding in Petrella applies equally to patent cases because the Patent Act also includes limitations on recovery based on a plaintiff's delay.In Petrella, this Court examined whether the equitable defense of laches could bar damage relief on a copyright infringement claim brought within a three-year limitations period. The Court held that it could not: "[l]aches, we hold, cannot be invoked to preclude adjudication of a claim for damages brought within the three-year window" of the Copyright Act. Petrella, 1354 S. Ct. at 1967. In so holding, the Court noted that the principal purpose of a laches defense is to supply relief from claims for which there was no applicable statute of limitations. Where Congress has provided a statutory limitations period, as in the Copyright Act, that limitations period indicates the6Congressional view as to unacceptable delay, making resort to the laches doctrine unnecessary.The Copyright Act and the Patent Act contain similar limitations periods. The Copyright Act provides that "[n]o civil action shall be maintained unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued." 17 U.S.C. § 507(b). Similarly, the Patent Act mandates that "no recovery shall be had for any infringement committed more than six years prior to the filing of the complaint or counterclaim for infringement in the action." 35 U.S.C. § 286. Although the Copyright Act's limitation could be labeled a statute of limitations and the Patent Act's limitation a damages-limitation period, as the Federal Circuit noted below any difference between the two labels "is irrelevant to the resolution of this case under Petrella." SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Products, LLC, 807 F.3d 1311, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015).Nothing in the Patent Act, its legislative history, or the case-law justifies deviating from the Court's reasoning in Petrella. The statute's text provides no language incorporating a laches defense, or even a suggestion of intent by Congress to establish a laches defense in patent cases. Nor is there unambiguous legislative history or a sufficiently developed common law to contradict that interpretation.To the contrary, in at least one case predating enactment of 35 U.S.C. § 286, the Court held that "[l]aches within the term of the statute of limitations is no defense at law." United States v. Mack, 295 U.S.7480, 489 (1935). Presuming the statute intended to retain the substance of common law at the time it was enacted, Mack suggests that Congress did not enact Section 282 of the Patent Act with an intent to preserve a laches defense, and the inclusion of a sixyear damages window in Section 286 only reinforces that conclusion. Expanding laches to bar claims brought within the limitations period would not only contradict previous decisions of this Court, it would preclude the uniformity sought by Congress. Petrella, 1354 S. Ct. at 1974-75.II. SOUND JUDICIAL POLICY COUNSELS AGAINST APPLYING LACHES TO PATENT DAMAGES.A. LACHES ENCOURAGES RUSHED FILINGSPatent litigation is among the most complex and lengthy types of litigation faced by parties and courts,6 often requiring the use of Special Masters for claim construction.7 The laches defense acts as a bar to claims for damages occurring within the six-year limitations period and, thereby, serves as a strong incentive to patent holders to quickly file claims of infringement. Out of fear that they may lose rights if they do not act quickly enough, laches encourages patentees to file prematurely--before the allegations of infringement have crystalized, the investigation of6 See Jennifer F. Miller, Should Juries Hear Complex Patent Cases, 2004 Duke Law & Technology Review 4. 7 See Neil A. Smith, Complex Patent Suites: The Use of Special Masters for Claim Construction, 2 Landslide 1, Sept.-Oct. 2009 http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/events/dispute_re solution/Smith_Complex_Patent_Suits.authcheckdam.pdf.8the facts is complete, and assessment of applicable defenses has been vetted fully. Retaining laches as a defense also requires patent owners to mount an expensive and likely lengthy federal lawsuit to stop seemingly innocuous infringements, even those that appear not yet to amount to a harm worthy of policing. This incentivizes litigation over other approaches, such as marketplace competition or industry partnerships such as those favored by research universities. It also may disproportionately impact those entities with large patent portfolios, such as manufacturers, for which it may be a struggle to actively police infringement.The dilemma laches creates for intellectual property owners is far from fiction: plaintiffs risk either losing their right to recover, or sometimes choosing to rush to file before having all of the evidence or having completed negotiations, and risk litigating a weaker case and even the imposition of sanctions.8 A patentee deemed to have slept on their rights by "failing to exercise timely its right to exclude . . . in effect, authorizes the public to infringe--to `make, use, offer to sell, or sell' a patented invention-- during the laches period." Odetics, Inc. v. Storage Tech. Corp., 185 F.3d 1259, 1273 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (emphasis added). The period of delay triggering this rescission of patent rights is measured from the time that the patentee knew or should have known of the defendant's infringement, with the patentee having8 The Fourth Circuit has described laches as applied in trademark cases as creating a filing conundrum, putting potential plaintiffs on the "horns of a dilemma." Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser­Roth Corp., 81 F.3d 455, 461-62 (4th Cir. 1996).9an affirmative duty to police the market for infringement. Wanlass v. General Elec. Co., 148 F.3d 1334, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 1998).As a result, courts have ruled that the laches doctrine barred recovery in cases involving delays of only three or four years, well short of the six-year statutory period. Rosemount, Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 727 F.2d 1540, 1550 (Fed. Cir. 1984); MCV, Inc. v. King­Seeley Thermos Co., 870 F.2d 1568, 1571­72 (Fed. Cir. 1989). In a recent case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a laches defense to a patent infringement claim based on a period of delay of a mere five months. Romag Fasteners, Inc. v. Fossil, Inc., 817 F.3d 782, 784 (Fed. Cir. 2016).The significant incentives that now exist for rational patent owners to rush to file to avoid a laches-based bar is in direct conflict with the efforts of the Court and of Congress to discourage patent owners from filing vague, premature, or overly aggressive complaints of patent infringement. Specifically, it contradicts efforts to curb "patent trolling"--the overly aggressive filing or threat of filing of unsubstantiated, frivolous claims of patent infringement. To deter premature filings of complaints in patent cases, on December 1, 2015, the Court abolished Rule 84 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, putting an end to the use of Form 18's notice pleading and the filing of complaints that merely allude to patent infringement.99 The new rules were adopted on April 29, 2015. Letters from Chief Justice John G. Roberts to Speaker John A. Boehner and10Over the last several years, Congress has been working diligently to pass legislation to curb patent litigation abuses. Among the list of important provisions included within this legislation are those intended to discourage patent owners from filing premature and incomplete claims of infringement by requiring patent owners to provide within the original complaint or initial disclosures highly-detailed, factbased allegations of infringement.10 On October 22, 2014, Senator Orrin Hatch, the Chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, unveiled an innovation agenda for the 114th Congress that sought to discourage abusive patent litigation by, in part, requiring heightened pleading standards in all patent cases.11 In his 2014 State of the UnionVice President Joseph R. Biden (April 29, 2015), available at http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/frcv15_5h25.p df; The National Law Review, Supreme Court Adopts Amendments to Federal Rules That May Deter Patent Infringement Lawsuits, Especially Those Filed by NonPracticing Entities, http://www.natlawreview.com/article/supreme-court-adoptsamendments-to-federal-rules-may-deter-patentinfringement#sthash.NU8URFvA.dpuf (Nov. 3, 2015). 10 S. 1137, the "Protecting American Talent and Entrepreneurship Act (PATENT Act)" and H.R. 9, the "Innovation Act"; see also Brian T. Yeh and Emily M. Lanza, Congressional Research Service Report, Patent Litigation Reform Legislation in the 114th Congress (July 19, 2015) ("The Innovation Act and the PATENT Act would require parties alleging patent infringement in a civil action to include in the court pleadings specified details concerning each claim of each patent infringed, and the acts of the alleged infringer."). 11 Press Release of Senator Orrin Hatch, Hatch Unveils Innovation Agenda for the 114th Congress (Oct. 22, 2014)11Address, President Obama called on Congress to help curb frivolous patent litigation.12Discouraging patent owners from rushing to file complaints in federal court, or from suing over mere minor infringements, has been a priority for all three branches of Government. Maintaining a legalregime that encourages rush filing is in conflict with those efforts. To achieve uniformity, and avoid incentivizing "patent trolling" and premature patent infringement litigation, the Court should hold that patent laches may not be invoked to preclude a claimfor damages brought within the Congressionallyprescribed time window.B. LACHES SETTLEMENTDISCOURAGESRetaining laches, despite the Congressionallymandated six-year statutory limitations period, will also discourage pre-suit settlement negotiations. Apatent owner's engagement in license negotiations will not necessarily excuse delay, particularly where those discussions start and stop, as they often do. A.C. Aukerman Co. v. Miller Formless Co., 693 F.2d 697, 700 (7th Cir. 1982). Rather than encouraginghttp://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/releases?ID=64333cc6-14bc-469e-ade7-213b956eef71. 12 On January 29, 2014, in his State of the Union Address to Congress, President Obama called on Congress to "pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly and needless litigation." Kate Tummarello, The Hill, President calls for patent reform in SOTU(Jan. 28, 2014), http://thehill.com/policy/technology/196754obama-calls-for-patent-reform.12patent owners to take the time to work through complicated licensing negotiations and validity disputes out of court, retaining laches encourages patent plaintiffs to break off those discussions early and rush to court out of fear of an assertion of laches.III. ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS WILL REMAIN FOR PARTIES SUED FOR PATENT INFRINGEMENTPetrella's holding allows for laches to continue to bar, in egregious circumstances, claims for injunctive relief or other prospective equitable relief. Petrella, 1354 S. Ct. at 1977-78. Where the patent owner's delay is egregious, such that the unreasonable delay in bringing suit is necessary to protect a substantial business investment, the patent owner should not be entitled to injunctive relief.Requesting that the Court remove laches as a defense to pre-suit damages, while also recommending that it prohibit recovery of injunctive relief in egregious circumstances, is not asking the Court to take inconsistent positions. Rather, it is simply advocating following Petrella, where the Court noted that allowing a suit for damages within the statutory window "will put at risk only a fraction of the income" the accused infringer has earned during the entire term. Petrella, 1354 S. Ct. at 1978. The absence of laches will work no unjust hardship on innocent third parties, such as consumers who have already purchased covered products. Id. Prohibiting injunctive relief in egregious cases seems a reasonable exception needed to protect an infringer's13substantial business investment undertaken based on an indisputable belief that the patent owner would not sue.In the face of true misconduct by the patent owner, parties accused of patent infringement may avail themselves of the equitable estoppel defense. While equitable estoppel requires "affirmative conduct by the patentee inducing the belief that it abandoned its claims against the alleged infringer," laches requires no such misleading acts by the patent owner. A.C. Aukerman Co., 960 F.2d at 1042. Instead, laches can be found based on the silence or inaction of the patent owner in the face of mere constructive knowledge of infringement. Id. at 1042­ 43. Therefore, equitable estoppel is the appropriate mechanism for policing true misconduct by the patent owner, and does not create the same incentives to rush to litigate that laches does. Moreover, where applicable, the equitable estoppel defense serves as a complete bar to a patent owner's claim of infringement when the patent owner engages in intentionally misleading conduct. Id. at 1043 (emphasis added).Neither will the removal of laches as a defense to damages within the damages window affect defenses challenging the validity of a patent. Claims that it will do so have been grossly overstated.13 Most patents are invalidated based on a showing that13 Brief of Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. as Amici Curiae in Support of Defendants-Appellees at 6, SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Products, LLC, 807 F.3d 1311, 1321 (Fed.

This is provenprimarily based on earlier patents or other widelyavailable publications describing the invention--prior art.15 While at some point in our historypublished documents may have been hard to find, inthis modern digital age, such evidence of priorinvention will always remain accessible at the click ofa mouse.16The internet provides digitalpermanence--what goes on the internet stays there.Digital archives, such as the Wayback Machine,capture and preserve nearly everything published onthe internet.17 The loss of the laches defense will14 Consistent with the America Invents Act of 2011, the U.S.switched to a first-inventor-to-file system, effective March 16, 2013. 15 While 35 U.S.C. § 102 defines prior art as inventions described in a patent, printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention, the vast majority of claims are rejectedor invalidated based on earlier patents or other printed publications. See e.g., Manual of Patent Examining Procedure § 2256, Prior Art Patents and Printed Publications Reviewed by Examiner in Reexamination [R-07.2015] ("Typically, the primary source of prior art will be the patents and printed publicationscited in the request for ex parte reexamination."). 16 Few if any patent applications that were filed during the period of the establishment of the original internet-based companies, often referred to as the "dot-com" era, around 1995 or so, remain viable at this point. Many have already beenrendered unenforceable for failure to pay escalating USPTO patent maintenance fees, or have either expired or are about to expire. This is because, for patent applications filed after June 8, 1995, the patent term lasts 20 years from the filing date of the earliest application to which priority is claimed. 17 See In re Epstein, 32 F.3d 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Databaseprintouts of abstracts which were not themselves prior art publications were properly relied on as providing evidence that15likely have no real effect on future accused infringers' ability to mount an invalidity defense, because in the age of digital permanence, there is little risk that evidence necessary to an invalidity defense will be lost.In Petrella, the Court rejected arguments that laches was needed to encourage plaintiffs to file earlier to preserve evidence useful to defending against liability and avoid prejudice to the defendant caused by lost documents or fading memories. It noted instead that the passage of time "is at least as likely to affect plaintiffs [who have the burden of proving infringement] as it is to disadvantage defendants." Petrella, 134 S. Ct at 1076-77. Concerns regarding the potential loss of evidence during the significantly shorter twenty-year patent term would appear to provide even less justification for preserving the laches defense than under the Copyright Act's much longer term of the life of the author plus 70 years.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the ABA respectfully submits that this Court should hold that the doctrine of patent laches cannot be applied to bar pre-suit legal damages in patent cases during the statutory six-year damages period, but is available under extraordinary circumstances to curtail claims for injunctive relief and other prospective equitable relief.the software products referenced therein were "first installed" or "released" more than one year prior to applicant's filing date).16 Respectfully Submitted,Of Counsel:Paulette BrownDonika P.

OREGON.A. The Apodaca Court Agreed On TheImportance Of Thorough JuryDeliberations,AttentionToMinorityViewpoints,AndCommunity Confidence In JuryVerdicts.Despite their differing opinions, every member of the Apodaca Court agreed on the importance of thorough jury deliberations, attention to minority viewpoints, and community confidence in jury verdicts. The plurality,® concurring, and dissenting§ The 2005 Jury Trial Principles, Principle 4, and its Commentary are reproduced in full in the Appendix to this brief.8 The Apodaca plurality was joined by Justice Powell in deciding Johnson, making the opinion in that case one for the Court. Johnson involved a parallel issue but, because the trial in that case had preceded Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 14510opinions disagreed,unanimous decisionhowever, on the effect non-rules would have on the jury'sdeliberative process.406 U.S. 356, 361 members would notCompare Johnson v.

Since that time, however, extensive studies have been conducted that support reconsideration of that ruling.When the ABA revised its Criminal Justice Standards in 1978, it explained that several changes(1968), the applicability of the Sixth Amendment was not in contention. The empirical assumptions expressed in the Court's opinion in Johnson therefore represent those of the Apodaca plurality as well as Justice Powell, who echoed these assumptions in his opinion concurring in Johnson and concurring in the judgment in Apodaca.11 in the standards, including the shift to unanimous jury verdicts, were made "to reflect the experience gained in the past decade and new perspectives in the wide-ranging topic of jury trial." 1978 Criminal Justice Standards, supra, Commentary at 15.4. In its 2005 Principles for Juries and Jury Trials, the ABA discussed empirical studies showing that a nonunanimous decision process reduces the reliability of jury determinations, silences minority viewpoints, and erodes confidence in the criminal justice system. 2005 Principles for Juries and Jury Trials, Principle 4.B Commentary, supra, at 22. Also in the 2005 Principles for Juries and Jury Trials, the ABA concluded that studies had demonstrated that another justification for non-unanimity -- a reduction in hung juries and retrials -- was overstated. Id. at 23.In light of this amassed data, which shows that the non-unanimous process in criminal jury trials does not foster thorough jury deliberations, attention to minority viewpoints, or community confidence in jury verdicts, the ABA suggests that Apodaca's holding should be reconsidered.1¢10 This Court has been particularly receptive to empirical evidence when assessing the constitutional contours of the jury trial right. See Ballew v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 223, 231 n.10 (1978) (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (noting that social science research on jury size "provide[s] the only basis, besides judicial hunch, for a decision about whether smaller and smaller juries will be able to fulfill the purpose and functions of the Sixth Amendment').12B. Non-Unanimous VerdictsTheReliabilityOfDeterminations.Reduce JuryIn the Commentary to Principle 4.B of the 2005Jury Trial Principles, theempirical data had shownABAthatconcluded thatnon-unanimousdecision rules materially alter jury deliberations anddecrease the reliability of verdicts, stating:Implicit in [the historical preference forunanimous juries] is the assumption thatunanimous verdicts are likely to be moreaccurate and reliable because they requirethe most wide-ranging discussions -- onesthat address and persuade every juror.Empirical assessment tends to support thisassumption. Studies suggest that whereunanimity is required, jurors evaluateevidence more thoroughly, spend more timedeliberating and take more ballots.... Incontrast, where unanimity is not requiredjuries tend to end deliberations once theminimum number for a quorum is reached.2005 Jury Trial Principles, supra, at 22 (citing Dennis J.

Non-Unanimous Verdicts Allow Juries To Reach A Quorum Without Seriously Considering Dissenting Viewpoints.Empirical studies also do not support the Apodaca plurality's prediction that dissenting viewpoints "will be heard" even under nonunanimous decision rules. Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 413 (plurality opinion); see also Johnson, 406 U.S. at 361 ("We have no grounds for believing that majority jurors . . . would simply refuse to listen to arguments presented to them in favor of acquittal, terminate discussion, and render a verdict.").14jcuornysiAsdreerpterhdeeseAnBatnAadtifvoaelulnned,sjsur"oUr--sneaancpihemrospuuoasidnetdve.or"fdivcites2w00[]m5uprsotJtuercbyteTrial Principles, Principle 4.B Commentary, supra, at2458;(citing Hastie etValerie P.

The ABA also concluded that"minority jurors participate more actively whendecisions must be unanimous." Id.Researchers have found that, in contrast to the "deliberate, ponderous atmosphere" characteristic ofdeliberations of unahimous juries, "larger factions inmajority rule juries adopt a more forceful, bullying, persuasive style," possibly "because their members realize that it is not necessary to respond to all opposition arguments when their goal is to achieve a faction size of only eight or ten members." Hastie etal., supra, at 112; see also Saks, supra, at 40("Compared to unanimous rule juries, quorum rulejuries have been found to deliberate less equitably(that is, the distribution of talking is skewed moreextremely, with the talkative jurors talking more andthe untalkative talking less than in unanimous rulejuries).").Further, evidence indicates that women andracial minorities are particularly likely to hold dissenting viewpoints on juries and to have those opinions discounted under a non-unanimous decisionrule. See Taylor-Thompson, supra, at 1264 ("If--as is often true--the views of jurors of color and femalejurors diverge from the mainstream, nonunanimous decisionmaking rules can operate to eliminate the voice of difference on the jury."). As Justice Stewart15warned, "Under [Apodaca and Johnson], nine jurors can simply ignore the views of their fellow panel members of a different race or class." Johnson, 406 U.S. at 397 (Stewart, J., dissenting). In related areas implicating Sixth Amendment rights, this Court has stringently protected the participation of women and minorities on juries. See, ¢g., J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 185 (1994); Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 59 (1992); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89 (1986).Researchers also have found that permitting nonunanimous verdicts "discourage[s] meaningful examination of opposing viewpoints" and thus "impoverishes deliberations." Taylor-Thompson, supra, at 1264. Further, as panels are required to reach unanimity, "jurors at the extremes may be driven to a compromise, which they would otherwise reject, and a fairer verdict may result." 1996 Criminal Justice Standards, supra, Standard 15-1.1 Commentary, at 126 (citing Edwin P. Schwartz & Warren F. Schwartz, Decisionmaking by Juries Under Unanimity and Supermajority Voting Rules, 80 Geo. L.J. 775 (1992).As then-Circuit Judge Anthony Kennedy recognized in 1978, unanimous decision rules facilitate deliberation by ensuring that dissenting voices are heard and accepted or rejected, thus lending "particular significance and conclusiveness to the jury's verdict." United States v. Lopez, 581 F.2d 1338, 1341 (9th Cir. 1978) (Kennedy, J.).16D.

Johnson, 406U.S. at 377 (Powell, J., concurring in the judgment).Studies of hung juries largely negate those concerns,however, and instead bolster arguments favoringunanimity.The ABA's research has shown that juries rarely hang because of one or two obstinate jurors. 2005 Jury Trial Principles, Principle 4.B Commentary, supra, at 23 (citing Taylor-Thompson, supra, at 1317). To the contrary, "[glenerally, when deadlocksoccur, they reflect genuine disagreement over theweight of the evidence and arise within juries thathad substantial differences in verdict preference atthe outset of deliberations," id. (citing Paula L.Hannaford-Agor et al., Are Hung Juries a Problem?,National Center for State Courts (2002), at 7,available athttp://www.ncsconline.org/WC/PuHbalsitciaetioetnsa/l.R, esI_nsJiudreiesth_eHuJnugrJy,uriseuspErax,ecSatumP1u66b-.6p7d;f,a;ndSaks, supra, at 41).As other research shows, eccentric or irrationalholdout jurors do not normally derail unanimity.

Kalven & Zeisel, supra, at 457. In fact,in a study of civil cases, the judges agreed with hold-out jurors over forty percent of the time when a non-unanimous verdict was rendered, and disagreed withthe jury in approximately twenty percent of the casesin which the verdict was unanimous. Diamond et al.,supra, at 222. "[T]he agreement between the judgeand the holdout jurors on a substantial number ofcases suggests that the conflict on some of thesejuries posed precisely the kind of challenge to themajority position that a deliberative process shouldwelcome." Id.Finally, research has shown only a small increase in the number of hung juries when jury unanimity isrequired: one survey of trial judges found that only 5.6% of criminal juries hang when unanimous verdicts are required, while 3.1% deadlock when majority verdicts are allowed. 2005 Jury TrialPrinciples, Principle 4.B Commentary, supra, at 23(citing Kalven & Zeisel, supra, at 461). The costs of hung juries also are exaggerated, as shown by a study of California cases in which only twenty-six percent of cases in which the jury deadlocked19resulted in a retrial; all other cases wereby guilty plea or dismissal. Leo J.

THE RECORD SUPPORTS CONGRESS' CONCLUSION THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF SECTION 2 LITIGATION IS NOT AN ADEQUATEREMEDY IN COVERED JURISDICTIONSPetitioner and its amici argue that Section 2 litigation and case-by-case enforcement can adequately address present-day discrimination and should lead the Court to strike down Section 5 preclearance. The record compiled during the 2006 reauthorization contradicts that argument and led Congress to the opposite conclusion: that "case-bycase enforcement alone is not enough to combat" voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions. H.R. Rep. No. 109-478 at 57 (2006). Although Section 2 litigation is unquestionably useful, the record documents that many of the harms caused by voting discrimination are not later remediated through Section 2 litigation.That is because elected officials enact, interpret, and enforce laws and policies, starting on the day they take office. Post-election Section 2 litigation cannot turn the clock back and undo the effects of these legislative choices. The following sections highlight materials in the legislative record that document why Section 2 litigation alone is not a sufficient remedy in jurisdictions with a history of voting discrimination. These materials reinforce why Section 5 preclearance remains necessary to prevent the fundamental harms to representative government that voting discrimination causes.7A. Prospective Remedies From Successful Section 2 Litigation Do Not Undo Substantial Harms Flowing From Past Discriminatory Elections.Elections held under a discriminatory regime cause significant harms that are not remedied, years later, by forward-looking Section 2 remedies. Congress emphasized the magnitude of harms from abridgements of the right to vote: "The right to vote is the most fundamental right in our democratic system of government because its effective exercise is preservative of all others." H.R. Rep. No. 109-478 at 6 (citing Reynolds v. Simms, 377 U.S. 533 (1964)). Indeed, "there is no right more fundamental than the right to participate in our democratic form of Government," because, "[t]he ability of our citizens to cast a ballot for their preferred candidate ensures that every voice is heard, most importantly, the right to vote safeguards our freedoms and all other rights enshrined in the Constitution." To Examine the Impact and Effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act: Hearing before the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 1 (2005) ("Impact and Effectiveness") (statement of Congressman Chabot).Even when Section 2 litigation results in a finding that an election was discriminatory, a court is illequipped to undo the harms that flowed from that election, as lawyers well-versed in the remedies available for Section 2 litigants told Congress. For example, Donald M. Wright, General Counsel for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, testified from his personal experience that during the several years it takes to fully litigate a Section 2 case, "the discriminatory voting change is put into effect, which would not happen under Section 5." Reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act's Temporary Provisions:8Policy Perspectives and Views from the Field: Hearing before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 121 (2006) ("Views from the Field"). As a result, "even after a successful Section 2 case is brought to stop a discriminatory voting change, the damage is often already done: elections may have been held under an unlawful plan, providing candidates elected under that plan an advantage in terms of incumbency and fundraising under any remedial plan that might be adopted." Id.The congressional record repeatedly emphasizes this incumbency advantage that Mr. Wright highlighted. Several former and then-current elected officials--Republican and Democrat alike--reported to Congress that the incumbency benefits enjoyed by officials elected under a discriminatory regime are unlikely to be remedied by litigation that concludes years after they were elected. Colorado's former Lieutenant Governor testified to that precise point:Whether the incumbent achieved it by an illegal scheme, as you characterize it, or was simply elected to the position, the reality is that incumbents enjoy an advantage as it relates to opposition candidates. I mean, that has been proven clearly across the board in terms of the record of incumbency and the ability to hold on to offices.Voting Rights Act: Evidence of Continued Need: Hearing before the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the House Judiciary Comm., 109th Cong. 97 (2006) ("Continued Need") (testimony of Joe Rogers). So did numerous others.99 See, e.g., Impact and Effectiveness at 13-14 (testimony of Jack Kemp, former member of Congress and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development); id. at 43-44 (testimony of9When it comes to the incumbency advantage, "[i]t does little good to establish months, perhaps years after an election is over that the law was violated and that citizens were deprived of the opportunity to exercise their franchise in a meaningful and effective manner." Voting Rights Act: Section 5 of the Act-- History, Scope, and Purpose: Hearing before the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the House Judiciary Comm., 109th Cong. 5 (2005) ("History and Purpose") (Congressman Nadler). Even if the election regime is changed for future elections as a result of successful Section 2 litigation, "[i]ncumbency can then preclude a subsequent remedy at the polls." Id.Witnesses also made clear that many other harms flow from discriminatory elections during the time it takes to litigate a Section 2 case. E.g., The Continuing Need for Section 5 Pre-Clearance: Hearing before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 15 (2006) (testimony of Pamela S. Karlan, Associate Dean, Stanford University School of Law) ("Continuing Need") ("Section 2 is not an adequate substitute for Section 5 because it allows the changes to go into effect, and that means you can go through several election cycles while the litigation is going on where the discriminatory change is in effect."); Views from the Field at 7 (statement of Debo Adegbile, Associate Director of Litigation, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.) ("but for Section 5, those voting changes, those redistricting plans would have gone into effect and would have served to minimize the opportunity of AfricanAmericans in a State with a long and welldocumented history of discrimination to participateMarc H. Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League and former Mayor of New Orleans).10in the political process. They would have been left to try to find lawyers to bring complex Section 2 cases, and all the while they would have suffered from discrimination.").Decisions in Section 2 cases litigated since the 1982 VRA reauthorization reinforce this point.10 In one case, for instance, the court found that an at-large election scheme that had been in place for 27 years was specifically intended to be racially discriminatory and had "render[ed] the ability of the black voters to elect their representative substantially inferior to that of whites." Dillard v. Baldwin Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 686 F. Supp. 1459, 1467 (M.D. Ala. 1988). As a result, "black citizens of Baldwin County have been effectively left unrepresented because the school board representatives in the county may for the most part ignore the interests of blacks in the county without fear of political consequences." Id. (emphasis added). And, as the evidence established, "the Baldwin County Board of Education has been particularly unresponsive to the black citizens' concern about race relations in the county's schools, in particular concerns arising out of school desegregation and the apparent resulting displacement of black administrators." Id. Still, the court-ordered remedy only changed the situation going forward; it could not remedy nearly three decades of black children10 A significant portion of the congressional record consists of reports and accounts of voting rights litigation that occurred during 1982-2006. Congress reviewed the litigation reports and examined the underlying case law. See S. Rep. No. 109-295 at 65 (2006) (explaining staff's review of the case law). The examples discussed in this brief are drawn from these record materials.11attending school while the school board was free to ignore their interests.Similarly, in Bone Shirt v. Hazeltine, 336 F. Supp. 2d 976 (D.S.D. 2004), the court held that a 2001 redistricting plan "dilute[d] the Indian vote and violates § 2 of the Voting Rights Act," finding "that Indians in Districts 26 and 27 have been denied an equal opportunity to access the political process." Id. at 1052. In reaching this conclusion, the court found that "South Dakota is largely unresponsive to the needs of Indians." Id. at 1043. In particular, the court catalogued numerous ways that three legislators from District 26 who took office under the 2001 plan "repeatedly voted against legislation that was of particular concern to, and supported by, Indians." Id. The court identified over a dozen pieces of such legislation that one or more of these legislators opposed or helped defeat. Id. 1043-46. It described how Indians from District 26 "frequently contact[ed]" another district's representative rather than their own representative. Id. at 1046. The remedy for the VRA violation, however, would only apply prospectively. Id. 1053. Votes that had been cast contrary to Indian interests were not revisited, and the legislators continued to serve their term in office.As cases like Baldwin County and Bone Shirt demonstrate, during the time discriminatory election procedures are utilized, citizens whose votes are marginalized (or worse) may be subjected to the discriminatory policies and practices of improperly elected officials.Litigation of an extended duration--while improperly elected officials continue to make decisions--is not an anomaly in individual enforcement actions. For example, it took seven12years for a court to order Lafayette County, Mississippi to develop a remedial plan to cure a Section 2 violation in how the County Board of Supervisors was elected. See Houston v. Lafayette Cnty., 20 F. Supp. 2d 996 (N.D. Miss. 1998). Elections continued to be held under the unlawful plan during the litigation. Id. at 998. As a result, improperly elected members of the Board of Supervisors made untold numbers of decisions over the course of nearly a decade that directly impacted Lafayette County's residents. Supervisors are responsible for "adopting the annual budget, setting tax rates, adopting orders, resolutions, or ordinances which involve county affairs, promoting growth and development of Lafayette County, appointing certain individuals to carry out the daily business of the county such as Attorney, Comptroller, County Administrator, Engineer, Purchase Clerk, and Road Manager, and many other duties as mandated by State Law."11In another case, it took the plaintiffs eight years to obtain a ruling that a South Carolina legislative delegation system that historically "arose against the backdrop of a white supremacist movement" and "sought to diminish African-American voting power" violated the "one person, one vote" requirement derived from the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Vander Linden v. Hodges, 193 F. 3d 268, 270, 272 (4th Cir. 1999); see also Continued Need at 964-68 (Report by Voting Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union) ("ACLU11 Board of Supervisors Page, Overview, Lafayette County, Mississippi, http://lafayettecoms.com/HTML/Main.html?Board of Supervisors Page (last visited Feb. 1, 2013).13Report").12 Throughout these eight years, thedelegations performed numerous governmentalfunctions including "approving or recommendingexpenditures for various activities, approving localschool district budgets, initiating referendaregarding special-purpose governing bodies in publicservice districts, approving reimbursement ofexpenses for county planning commissioners,approving county planning commission contracts,altering or dividing county school districts, reducingspecial school levies, submitting grant applicationsfor park and recreation facilities, and making orrecommending appointments." Id. at 276. Theconsequences of years of decisions by theunconstitutionallegislativedelegationsunquestionably lasted long after the unlawful systemwas dismantled.As one final example, no mayoral or city council elections were held in Butler, Georgia, for nine years, while Section 2 litigation was pending. Chatman v. Spillers, 44 F.3d 923 (11th Cir. 1995). Ultimately, the Eleventh Circuit had to direct the district court to dissolve its stay and order a special election. When that election occurred, two black candidates were elected to the city council for the first time in the city's history. Continued Need at 828-30 (ACLU Report).In these cases, and numerous others, the courts ordered forward-looking relief--leaving victims to hope that, in the next election, they would not be denied an equal voice in governance. But the legislative legacies of officials elected through the12 The Fourth Circuit eventually resolved the "one person, one vote" issue in plaintiffs' favor, without needing to reach plaintiffs' other voting claims. Vander Linden, 193 F. 3d at 272.14discriminatory practices would undoubtedly be felt long after the next election.B. The Congressional Record Documents Numerous Obstacles To Individual Voting Rights Actions.Congress' conclusion that case-by-case enforcement actions would be insufficient to combat voting discrimination in jurisdictions with a history of discrimination is further buttressed by the evidence it compiled documenting impediments to litigating individual actions. Voting rights lawyers told Congress that these cases are especially complex, difficult, time consuming, and expensive. The inordinate amount of resources and expertise it typically takes to successfully litigate such cases creates real obstacles, even to filing suit.In upholding the VRA in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, the Court acknowledged the historical fact that case-by-case litigation has previously proven inadequate to stop voting discrimination in some jurisdictions. 383 U.S. 301, 328 (1966) ("Congress had found that case-by-case litigation was inadequate to combat widespread and persistent discrimination in voting, because of the inordinate amount of time and energy required to overcome the obstructionist tactics invariably encountered in these lawsuits."). It emphasized this point again in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. One v. Holder. 557 U.S. 193, 197-98 (2009) ("Another series of enforcement statutes in the 1950s and 1960s depended on individual lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice. But litigation is slow and expensive, and the States were creative in `contriving new rules' to continue violating the Fifteenth Amendment `in the face of adverse federal court decrees.'") (citation omitted).15The 2006 legislative record confirms that the difficult and complex nature of individual voting rights litigation persists as a stumbling block to reliance on Section 2 alone. Section 2 litigation remains "slow and expensive." Northwest Austin, 557 U.S. at 197. If anything, testimony from lawyers in the field reveals that such litigation has only gotten slower, more expensive, and more arduous since Katzenbach. Section 2 cases are among the most difficult cases to prosecute and have become more complex as voting discrimination has evolved from the blatant forms of discrimination that characterized the 1965 record to subtler but persistent discrimination like vote dilution that is more likely to be at issue today. H.R. Rep. No. 109478 at 6 ("Discrimination today is more subtle than the visible methods used in 1965. However, the effect and results are the same, namely a diminishing of the minority community's ability to fully participate in the electoral process and to elect their preferred candidates of choice.").The following record materials illustrate the nature of individual enforcement actions. Section 2 cases are enormously complex."The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts ranks different types of cases by complexity and Section 2 cases, and voting rights cases in general, have among the highest rating. They are up there with securities cases and antitrust cases in the complexity and time requirements rating. A Section 2 case is not a picnic. It is one of the hardest things to do that there is, and Section 5 was designed exactly to avoid that kind of difficulty." Understanding the Benefits and Costs of Section 5 Pre-Clearance: Hearing before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 20 (2006)16(testimony of Armand Derfner, Attorney with Derfner, Altman, & Wilborn) ("Benefits and Costs"). Section 2 cases impose an extraordinary workload on courts and parties."According to a study published by the Federal Judicial Center, voting rights cases impose almost four times the judicial workload of the average case" and "are more work intensive than all but five of the sixty-three types of cases that come before the federal district courts." An Introduction to the Expiring Provisions of the Voting Rights Act and Legal Issues Relating to Reauthorization: Hearing before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 141 (2006) (responses of Laughlin McDonald, Director, ACLU Voting Rights Project) ("Introduction to Expiring Provisions"). Section 2 cases are resource-intensive and take years to litigate."Section 2 requires costly and time-consuming litigation. It also requires the bad change to go into effect and even be implemented for several election cycles before challengers can gather enough evidence to mount a successful court challenge, which is also incredibly costly, and although there is some attorney fees involved, you can never get back the money you put into section 2 cases." History and Purpose at 92 (testimony of Nina Perales, Regional Counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund)."The costs by minority voters to hire a private attorney under section 2 * * * can run in the millions of dollars." Impact and Effectiveness at 42 (testimony of Ann Marie Tallman, President and General Counsel, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund); see also Views from the17Field at 121 (response of Donald M. Wright) (typical voting rights cases can take several years to litigate).13"Adequate legal, financial and human resources did not exist in Mississippi in the past 40 years to bring a lawsuit in lieu of every one of the 169 objections that have been issued. Those resources do not exist today, and given persistent socio-economic disparities between Blacks and whites, I have little hope that this reality will change in the near future." Modern Enforcement of the Voting Rights Act: Hearing before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 109th Cong. 96 (2006) (response of Robert B. McDuff, Attorney and Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of the Mississippi Center for Justice) ("Modern Enforcement").A private plaintiffs' attorney reported that "we had to put in over 2000 hours representing the plaintiffs, in addition to many more hours that the Justice Department put in" on a successful 2001 suit challenging the method for electing the County Council for Charleston, South Carolina. Benefits and Costs at 80 (answers of Armand Derfner); see13 Compounding the burden for victims of discrimination, a putative plaintiff must have the resources up-front to hire and fund the lawyers, the necessary cadre of experts, and all of the associated litigation costs for multi-year litigation. Petitioner's suggestion that concerns about costs may be addressed by a post-litigation award of fees, Pet. Br. 33, does not comport with reality. Voting rights lawyers repeatedly told Congress that potential litigants simply do not have the resources to take on the substantial expenses that the plaintiff bears--often for years--in these cases and that even in successful cases, voting rights lawyers do not expect to be fully compensated. History and Purpose at 92 (testimony of Nina Perales); Views from the Field at 121 (response of Donald M. Wright).18also Impact and Effectiveness (statement of Joe Rogers); H.R. Rep. No. 109-478 at 39. Section 2 cases require extensive expert testimony."A typical Section 2 case requires at a minimum a demographer to draw plans to prove geographic compactness, and a statistician to prove political cohesion and legally significant white bloc voting. In addition, a typical case may require the services of a political scientist, a historian, an anthropologist, or other specialist." Introduction to Expiring Provisions at 141 (responses of Laughlin McDonald)."To be appropriately presented, these cases requirecostly experts including historians, social scientistsand statisticians, among others."ModernEnforcement at 96 (response of Robert B. McDuff).Expert fees alone can total "more than one hundred thousand dollars." Views from the Field at 121 (response of Donald M. Wright). There is a small bar of attorneys with the experience and qualifications to litigate Section 2 cases."Having litigated a great number of voting rights matters in the State of Mississippi, I know that there are not enough lawyers who specialize in this area to carry the load." Modern Enforcement at 96 (response of Robert B. McDuff)."It is a very small bar of [lawyers] who do Section 2 litigation and who have the expertise to do it." Continuing Need at 15 (testimony of Pamela S. Karlan).Voters in "local communities and particularly in rural areas * * * do not have access to the means to bring litigation under Section 2," even though "they19are often the most vulnerable to discriminatory practices such as racially disparate annexation practices, that have significant impact on their property values, standing[sic] of living and their ability to participate equally in the election process." History and Purpose at 84 (statement of Anita Earls, Director of Advocacy, Center for Civil Rights); see also Continuing Need at 15 (testimony of Prof. Pamela S. Karlan) ("When you get down to the local level, the national organizations often are not involved, they are not aware of what is going on"). Section 2 cases are ill-suited to preserving litigation victories.A number of the cases in the legislative record demonstrate that individual enforcement actions require multiple rounds of litigation, as recalcitrant jurisdictions simply change their tactics after initial defeats and continue to employ discriminatory electoral procedures after conceding, or after a court finding, that their election procedures were unlawful under Section 2. When this happens, hard-earned victories and their resultant remedies are of little value unless litigation is reinstituted. And during the reinstituted litigation, discrimination victims continue to be denied their fundamental rights and continue to be subject to the actions and legacy of incumbent officials who continue to be elected based on discriminatory procedures.For instance, after plaintiffs challenged the City of Foley, Alabama's at-large election method under Section 2--and won--Foley responded by implementing a racially discriminatory annexation policy, and the plaintiffs had to sue all over again. Dillard v. City of Foley, 926 F. Supp. 1053 (M.D. Ala.201995).14 In that next round of litigation, the city entered into a consent decree acknowledging that the plaintiffs had established a prima facie violation of Section 2 and the Constitution in the annexation policy. Id. at 1059.Similarly, another Alabama jurisdiction--North Jones--conceded that "its at-large system for electing members of the town council was racially discriminatory in violation of [Section] 2" and entered into a consent decree. Dillard v. Town of North Jones, 717 F. Supp. 1471, 1473 (M.D. Ala. 1989). Despite North Jones' admission, plaintiffs had to return to the district court as a result of the very next election. This time, the court found that North Jones had moved from a discriminatory atlarge system to a system in which the mayor intentionally discriminated against black candidates by refusing to provide them with necessary registration forms and refusing to swear them in after they were elected. Id. at 1476; see also S. Rep. No. 109-295 at 126-27.** *As these examples from the legislative record make clear, the evidence before Congress concerning the modern nature of Section 2 voting rights litigation14 Foley was a part of the so-called "Dillard litigation" initiated in the 1980s and continuing through the 2000s that eventually "raised claims against a total of 183 Alabama cities, counties, and school boards that employed at-large methods of election, including Shelby County." Shelby Cnty. v. Holder, 811 F. Supp. 2d 424, 442 (D.D.C. 2011). Petitioner Shelby County was a party in that litigation. Shelby County entered into a consent decree and agreed to alter its electoral system. See Dillard v. Crenshaw Cnty., 748 F. Supp. 819, 821-23 (M.D. Ala. 1990) (describing Shelby County's involvement in the Dillard litigation).21and its remedies was more than sufficient to support Congress' conclusion that Section 2 litigation is not sufficient to address voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions and is not an adequate substitute for Section 5's preclearance requirements.C. The Record Documents The Efficacy Of Section 5 In Protecting Section 2 Victories, Preventing Additional Harms, And Avoiding New Discriminatory Actions.Congress compiled extensive evidence that Section 5 fills the gaps left by Section 2 remedies. It "has enabled the Federal Government and court to stay one step ahead of covered jurisdictions that have a documented history of denying minorities the protections guaranteed by the Constitution." H.R. Rep. No. 109-478 at 65. Among other benefits, preclearance prevents relitigation of victories and effectively blocks new discriminatory measures from being implemented before they can result in further injuries. And in so doing, it protects the integrity of future elections and our system of government.Congress specifically found that Section 5 "ha[s] been and continue[s] to be a shield that prevents backsliding from the gains previously won." Id. at 53. It made that finding based on a record that demonstrated Section 5's efficacy in blocking deliberate, repeated attempts by covered jurisdictions to reenact a voting regime that a court previously had struck down as discriminatory. Id. at 39-40.Among others, in 1995, the Mississippi state legislature attempted to resurrect a dual registration system "under the guise of complying with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA)," even though a federal court had struck down the22same system as discriminatory years earlier. Id. at 39.15 But, "[k]nowing that maintenance of the two registration systems had previously been struck down as discriminatory, the State refused to submit the change for preclearance under Section 5." Id. Following a Section 5 enforcement action, and a unanimous decision by this Court holding that the state must submit its plan, see Young v. Fordice, 520 U.S. 273 (1997), Mississippi finally submitted its plan to the Department of Justice ("DOJ") for preclearance. DOJ objected, and the system was not reinstituted. See Continued Need at 91 (statement of Joe Rogers).In a similar fashion, in 2003, South Carolina "`enacted legislation adopting the identical method of elections for the board of trustees of the Charleston County School District that had earlier * * * been found to dilute minority voting strength in violation of Section 2,'" H.R. Rep. No. 109-478 at 39 (quoting Continued Need at 401 (ACLU Report)). When the DOJ denied preclearance, the state was prevented from re-implementing the same system that previously had been struck down. Id. at 40.As the Mississippi and South Carolina examples (and others16) demonstrate, Section 5 prevented the victims of past voting discrimination from having to use Section 2 litigation to challenge--again--the same discriminatory system a court had already15 The earlier victory had required plaintiffs to endure seven years of litigation. See Mississippi State Chapter, Operation PUSH, Inc. v. Mabus, 932 F.2d 400 (5th Cir. 1991); Mississippi State Chapter, Operation PUSH, Inc. v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1241 (N.D. Miss. 1987).16 For additional examples of Section 5 objections spurred by a jurisdiction's attempt to evade or undermine the effect of a successful Section 2 action, see Federal Resp.'s Br. at 36 n.5.23struck down and from having to live under it again while they did so.Congress also considered numerous reports from witnesses, many of them lawyers on the front lines of voting rights litigation, documenting examples of new or additional discriminatory actions that Section 5 effectively blocked, often without first demanding that the victims suffer the discriminatory voting practice.For example, Albany, Georgia submitted a proposed redistricting plan following the 2000 census that was rejected by the DOJ under Section 5. In its objection, the DOJ noted that the black population in Ward 4 had steadily increased over two decades, but redistricting had decreased the black population in Ward 4 "`in order to forestall the creation of a majority black district.'" Continued Need at 400 (ACLU Report) (quoting Letter from J. Michael Wiggins, Acting Assistant Attorney General, to Al Grieshaber Jr. (Sept. 23, 2002). The DOJ's objection concluded that the plan was implicitly designed "`with the purpose to limit and retrogress the increased black voting strength in Ward 4.'" Id. Absent Section 5, these "elections would have gone forward under a plan in which purposeful discrimination was `implicit,' and which could only have been challenged in time consuming vote dilution litigation under Section 2." Id. at 400-01; see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-478 at 37-38.In another example, in Kilmichael, Mississippi, three weeks before a 2001 municipal election with an "unprecedented number" of black candidates, "the town's mayor and the all white five-member Board of Aldermen canceled the election." Continued Need at 1282 ("Promises to Keep: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act in 2006"). In objecting to this change24under Section 5, the DOJ found "that the cancellation occurred after Census data revealed that African Americans had become a majority in the town." Id. After the town failed to reschedule the election, DOJ directed it to hold one in 2003, where Kilmichael's first black mayor was elected. Id.; see also H.R. Rep. No. 109-478 at 36-37.As a final example, in Waller County, Texas, two students at historically black Prairie View A&M University were candidates for local office in 2004. "[A] month before the election, the Waller County Commissioners' Court voted to reduce the availability of early voting at the polling place closest to campus, from seventeen hours over two days to six hours in one day." Continued Need at 185 (Report by the National Commission on the Voting Rights Act). Early voting was crucial, because the election was scheduled during spring break. After a Section 5 action was filed seeking to prevent the county from implementing this change without preclearance, "[c]ounty officials abandoned the change and restored the additional eleven hours," which mooted the suit but provided relief before the election. Id. at 186. As a result, "[a]bout three hundred Prairie View students took advantage of the early voting period, compared to the sixty who would vote on the day of the primary, and the Prairie View student running for a seat on the commissioners' court narrowly prevailed." Id.As these examples and all the others in this brief reinforce, the record Congress compiled in 2006 documents in detail the continuing need for Section 5 and the reasons that victims of voting discrimination cannot rely solely on Section 2 litigation to fight discrimination in covered jurisdictions. Based on the record it compiled, Congress reasonably concluded25that there remains a continuing need for Section 5 preclearance.** *As Chairman Sensenbrenner aptly put it, "[t]here is no more fundamental right than the right to vote because in a democracy, only the right to vote can protect all the other rights." H.R. Rep. No. 109-478 at 117. The ABA agrees that no right is more "central to our system of Government" than the right to vote, id., and it urges the Court to uphold the VRA reauthorization.CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons and those in Respondents' briefs, the Court should affirm the decision of the D.C. Circuit and uphold the constitutionality of the 2006 Voting Rights Act reauthorization.Respectfully submitted,OF COUNSEL: JESSICA L. ELLSWORTH KATIE D. BURKELAUREL G.

 I. Those suffering from severe mental illness at the time of their crimesshould not be executed. A. Executing the severely mentally ill serves neither retribution nordeterrence. The death penalty's principal "social purposes" are retribution and deterrence. Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 318-19 (2002). The underlying logic is that the worst crimes and offenders deserve the harshest punishment--and that imposing this penalty will help prevent similar crimes in the future. In cases involving severe mental illness, however, this logic breaks down. Individuals suffering from severe mental illness are exceedingly vulnerable, and often victims themselves of a failing mental health system. Imposing the death penalty on them is therefore disproportionate--not just. Moreover, individuals suffering from severe mental illness have a substantially impaired capacity to act rationally. The central premise of deterrence theory accordingly does not apply to them, and executing them does not advance deterrence. To serve as retribution, "[c]apital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution." Roper v. Simmons, 5435U.S. 551, 568 (2005) (quotation marks omitted). Individuals with severe mental illness lack that "extreme culpability." As a general matter, severe mental disorders, in "their acute state," are "typically associated with delusions (fixed, clearly false beliefs), hallucinations (clearly erroneous perceptions of reality), extremely disorganized thinking, or very significant disruption of consciousness, memory and perception of the environment." Resolution 122A at 6. Those suffering from severe mental illness also have a substantially impaired capacity to understand others' reactions and respond appropriately to them. ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 29. The lack of insight into their own illness reinforces their diminished capacity to understand others' reactions. Id.; see Nat'l All. on Mental Illness, Schizophrenia, http://bit.ly/2ydBq6k (last visited Oct. 2, 2019).These symptoms diminish the moral culpability of defendants who were suffering from them at the time of their crimes. A person does not have the extreme moral culpability necessary to face the death penalty when his illness impairs his ability to interpret reality accurately, to comprehend fully the consequences of his actions, and to control those actions in committing a crime. See Resolution 122A at 5-6; ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 25. And "it is contradictory that a person belonging to a more vulnerable group in society, would also, at the same time, be among the most culpable individuals who possess the highest level of culpability," ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 25, as constitutionally required to sentence6someone to death. See Atkins, 536 U.S. at 319 (recognizing that "the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify" the death penalty); Canape v. State, No. 62843, 2016 WL 2957130, at *3 (Nev. May 19, 2016) (unpublished disposition) ("[M]urder, while reprehensible, does not qualify as the worst of the worst.") (quotation marks omitted).Importantly, and contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that the severely mentally ill are more likely to commit violent crimes. Rather, the evidence shows that people with severe mental illness contribute very little to the rate of violence, and are much more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Multiple studies confirm that "severe mental illness alone d[oes] not predict future violence." Eric B. Elbogen & Sally C. Johnson, The Intricate Link Between Violence and Mental Disorder: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, 66 Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 152, 152 (2009) (noting historical, clinical, dispositional, and contextual factors that, in conjunction with severe mental illness, may correlate with violent behavior). In fact, less than 3 to 5% of U.S. crimes involve people with mental illness. Jonathan M. Metzl & Kenneth T. MacLeish, Mental Illness, Mass Shootings, and the Politics of American Firearms, 105 Am. J. Pub. Health 240, 241 (2015) (citing Paul S. Appelbaum, Violence and Mental Disorders: Data and Public Policy, 163 Am. J. Psychiatry 1319, 1319-21 (2006)); see Thomas Insel, Nat'l Inst. of Mental Health, Understanding Severe Mental Illness7(Jan. 11, 2011), http://bit.ly/30V7o3x ("Most people with [severe mental illness] are not violent, and most violent acts are not committed by people with [severe mental illness]."). When people with mental illness do act violently, these acts "are usually the result of lack of needed mental health services." Nat'l All. on Mental Illness, Violence and Gun Reporting Laws, http://bit.ly/2Y4G7Pm (last visited Oct. 2, 2019). They are not the product of an unusually culpable state of mind.The same deficiencies that make individuals with severe mental illness less culpable also make effective deterrence impossible because individuals who cannot think rationally cannot be deterred. The disorder at issue in this case provides a useful illustration of how severe mental illness interferes with deterrence. Symptoms of schizoaffective disorder include confused and disordered thinking, trouble with logical thinking, problems with attention, and declining educational performance. See Am. Psychiatric Ass'n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 8788, 99 (5th ed. 2013) (DSM-5). Individuals who suffer from this disorder may also have uncontrollable racing thoughts when in a manic episode, and difficulty concentrating when in a depressive episode. Id. at 124-25. Many such individuals also have an impaired capacity to communicate. Symptoms can include a loss or a decrease in the ability to initiate plans, speak, or express emotion. See id. at 99. And in certain8cases (as here, in earlier stages of these proceedings), defendants with schizoaffective disorder refuse to speak about their illness altogether, including to their attorney or close family members.They may also exhibit delusional or paranoid thinking. As a result, they are less able to logically analyze past mistakes and experiences, and to draw appropriate conclusions, which impair their capacity to engage in logical reasoning in a variety of ways. See DSM-5 at 99. Moreover, those diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder going through a depressive episode may be overwhelmed by their feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, hindering logical reasoning. See id. at 125. And as with many individuals with severe mental illnesses, those with schizoaffective disorder may have little to no impulse control. This includes bizarre behavior or abnormal movements, and, especially when manifested through a manic episode, can lead to increased risky behavior. Id. at 88, 124.Capital punishment "can serve as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation." Atkins, 536 U.S. at 319 (quoting Enmund v. Florida, 458 U.S. 782, 799 (1982)); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 445 (2008) (explaining that in order to "justify the [death] penalty on grounds of deterrence," one must assume "the offender behaves in a rational way"). For the reasons just given, people suffering from severe mental illness have a "diminished ability to un-9derstand and process information, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, or to control impulses," Atkins, 536 U.S. at 320, and are therefore unlikely to engage in this sort of calculation--i.e., to control their conduct based on the threat of the death penalty as a punishment. See ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 26. Thus, exempting from execution those who were suffering from severe mental illness at the time of their crimes would have no appreciable effect on deterrence-- either for those who do not suffer from such illness, who would continue to face the death penalty, or for those who do, who cannot make the kind of rational calculus that deters criminals from the most heinous behavior.B. Severe mental illness jeopardizes the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings.Independently, severe mental illness jeopardizes the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings. Our criminal justice system depends on a robust adversarial presentation to ensure that capital punishment is meted out only to the worst offenders. But the same "characteristics" that render severely mentally ill defendants less culpable and less susceptible to deterrence undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards. ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 31-33; see Atkins, 536 U.S. at 317. As a result, death penalty prosecutions are inherently less reliable for defendants who suffer from severe mental illness.10First, the legal system must avoid executing the innocent, and an exemption from execution for the severely mentally ill furthers that objective. As the Supreme Court has recognized, "the possibility of false confessions" increases the "risk `that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty.'" Atkins, 536 U.S. at 320 (quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605 (1978)). And studies show that defendants suffering from mental illness are especially susceptible to confessing to crimes they did not commit. See, e.g., Steven A. Drizin & Richard A. Leo, The Problem of False Confessions in the Post-DNA World, 82 N.C. L. Rev. 891, 973-74 (2004) (finding that persons with mental illness are particularly vulnerable to giving false confessions); see also Allison D. Redlich et al., Self-Reported False Confessions and False Guilty Pleas Among Offenders with Mental Illness, 34 L. & Hum. Behav. 79, 87 (2010) (22% of those with mental illness report giving a false confession). These defendants also have a diminished understanding of their Miranda rights--another factor that contributes to the likelihood of false confessions. See, e.g., Richard Rogers et al., Knowing and Intelligent: A Study of Miranda Warnings in Mentally Disordered Defendants, 31 L. & Hum. Behav. 401, 408 (2007) (only 10% of defendants with mental illnesses have a good understanding of the rights afforded under Miranda).11The severely mentally ill are also less able to urge mitigation. On the contrary, although severe mental illness ought to be mitigating, jurors often treat such a disease as a de facto aggravating factor instead. See, e.g., Stephen P. Garvey, The Emotional Economy of Capital Sentencing, 75 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 26, 57-58 (2000); Ellen Fels Berkman, Note, Mental Illness as an Aggravating Circumstance in Capital Sentencing, 89 Colum. L. Rev. 291, 299 (1989); see also Marla Sandys et al., Aggravation and Mitigation: Findings and Implications, 37 J. Psychiatry & L. 189 (2009) (finding that jurors' sentencing decisions are often based on their assessment of future dangerousness and lack of remorse, while mitigation evidence is ignored). In fact, a defendant's insanity or incompetence claim is one of the strongest correlates with a death sentence. See generally David Baldus et al., Equal Justice and the Death Penalty (1990).No doubt, this is largely driven by the significant effect on decision making caused by the symptoms of their severe mental illness, as well as the fact such individuals are typically poor witnesses. For example, "severe mental illness may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse due to the defendant's psychotic behavior and/or the side effects of psychotropic medication." ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 32 (quotation marks omitted); cf. Atkins, 536 U.S. at 320-21 (intellectually disabled defendants "are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes"). During a12psychotic episode, for example, a severely mentally ill individual may become agitated, make inappropriate comments, and may be unable to control their movements--all of which can be interpreted by jurors as dangerous, impulsive behavior. See ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 23. Persons with schizophrenia in particular are often concrete thinkers with limited insight, may exhibit diminished speech output, and may be relatively unhelpful or inaccurate historians about their lives. See Joe Hennell, Mental Illness on Appeal and the Right to Assist Counsel, 29 J. Contemp. Health L. & Pol'y 350, 354 (2013).On the other hand, when heavily medicated, these defendants may display a flat demeanor or look (and even fall) asleep as a side-effect of their medication, all of which gives the impression that they are remorseless. See Ronald S. Honberg, The Injustice of Imposing Death Sentences on People with Severe Mental Illness, 54 Cath. U. L. Rev. 1153, 1164 (2005). Thus, as discussed above, reliance on severe mental illness as a mitigating factor "can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury." See Atkins, 536 U.S. at 321. Indeed, the stigma of mental illness sometimes leads defendants to refuse any mitigating evidence to be presented about their illness at all, as happened here during appellant's trial.Finally, those with severe mental illness are at an unacceptable risk of wrongful conviction and execution because their disorders impair their ability to assist in13their own defense. ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 32, 34; cf., e.g., Atkins, 536 U.S. at 320-21 (intellectually disabled "less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel"); Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 78 (2010) ("Juveniles mistrust adults and have limited understandings of the criminal justice system and the roles of the institutional actors within it."). Severe mental illness may cause defendants to forget or confuse exculpatory evidence, and makes communication with counsel very difficult, complicating an attorney's already challenging task of securing a notguilty verdict or, more likely, presenting mitigation evidence to secure a verdict less than death, even when such evidence is proffered. ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 23, 33-34.Paranoid delusions can also make the severely mentally ill distrustful of their attorneys and their attorneys' motives. ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 23. At bottom, the "very characteristic that diminishes the mentally ill defendant's culpability jeopardizes his attorney's ability to prepare and present the case that would persuade the jury to return a life sentence." Scott Sundby, The True Legacy of Atkins and Roper: The Unreliability Principle, Mentally Ill Defendants, and the Death Penalty's Unraveling, 23 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts. J. 487, 514 (2014).For these reasons, severely mentally ill defendants "face a special risk of wrongful execution," Atkins, 536 U.S. at 321, either because they cannot prove their innocence or they cannot persuade the jury that their illness is a mitigating factor.14C. The emerging consensus is that executing the severely mentally ill is wrong.The consensus of the U.S. legal and mental health professional organizations confirms that it is wrong to execute individuals who were suffering from mental illness at the time of their crimes. Cf. Atkins, 536 U.S. at 316 n.21 (citing brief of American Psychological Association and American Psychiatric Association, among others, as evidence of a "professional consensus" among those with "germane expertise . . . opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon a [intellectually disabled] offender"). The ABA, for example, adopted this position over a decade ago, after careful study and deliberation. See generally Resolution 122A. The American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, and the National Alliance on Mental Health worked in conjunction with the ABA to develop that position, and adopted almost identical policies shortly thereafter. Am. Psychological Ass'n, Associations Concur on Mental Disability and Death Penalty Policy, 38 Monitor on Psychology 14 (Jan. 2007), http://bit.ly/2Y7CNCX; see Am. Psychological Ass'n Council of Representatives, Council Policy Manual, ch. IV, Mental Disability and the Death Penalty (2006), https://bit.ly/2oC5gjk; Nat'l All. on Mental Illness, Death Penalty, http://bit.ly/2SHZ83X (last visited Oct. 2, 2019). Mental Health America subsequently adopted a similar position. Mental Health Am., Position Statement 54: Death Penalty and People with Mental Illness (June 14, 2016), http://bit.ly/2OuuUTw. These policies reflect a settled consensus among legal and15mental health professionals that executing defendants with severe mental illness iscategorically wrong.This consensus is working its way into state laws. State legislatures have re-cently progressed towards adopting bans on executing the seriously mentally ill, withseven States that still have the death penalty introducing and nearing passage of suchbans this year alone.3 "It is not so much the number of these States that is significant,3 Death Penalty Info. Ctr., Recent Legislative Activity, http://bit.ly/2ycHUm7 (last visited Oct. 2, 2019); see Arizona SB 1192 (introduced January 28, 2019 and referred to Rules Committee and Judiciary Committee); Kentucky SB 17 (prefiled August 31, 2018, reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee February 7, 2019, sent to Rules Committee February 8, 2019, recommitted to the Judiciary Committee March 1, 2019); Missouri SB 462/HB 353 (SB 462 first read February 27, 2019 and referred to the Senate Judiciary and Civil and Criminal Jurisprudence Committee March 11, 2019, committee conducted hearing on the bill April 16, 2019; HB 353 prefiled December 19, 2018, referred to Committee on Health and Health Policy, committee conducted hearing April 29, 2019); Ohio HB 136/SB 54 (HB 136 introduced March 19, 2019, referred to Criminal Justice Committee; SB 54 introduced February 19, 2019, referred to Judiciary Committee, PASSED in committee by a vote of 11-1 on May 30, 2019; PASSED the full House by a vote of 76-17 on June 5, 2019); Tennessee HB 1455/SB 1124 (both introduced February 6, 2019; HB 1455 referred to House Judiciary Committee February 11, 2019, assigned to Criminal Justice Subcommittee February 13, 2019, favorably reported out of subcommittee on March 13, 2019; SB 1124 referred to Senate Judiciary Committee on February 11, 2019); Texas HB 1936 (filed February 19, 2019, read first time and referred to Criminal Jurisprudence Committee March 5, 2019, PASSED Committee 5-3 April 5, 2019; PASSED the House on May 9, 2019 by a vote of 77-66); Virginia SB 1137 (prefiled December 30, 2018, PASSED Senate Courts of Justice Committee (8-6) January 14, 2019, PASSED Senate (23-17) January 17, 2019, referred to House Committee for Courts of Justice January 21, 2019); see also Indiana SB 155 (introduced January 4, 2017 and referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee); North Carolina SB 666 (filed with the Senate April 4, 2017). But see Arkansas HB 1494 (defeated by the House Judiciary Committee, March 7, 2019); South Dakota SB 71 (defeated by the Senate on February 13, 2019).16but the consistency of the direction of change." Atkins, 536 U.S. at 314-15; see id. (noting States that had adopted categorical bans on executing the intellectually disabled in the nearly 15 years since the Court previously considered the issue).D. Existing procedural and substantive protections are inadequate to address these concerns.Legal rules that focus on competency to stand trial, competency to be executed, or the insanity defense all fail to provide appropriate relief for cases in which defendants suffer from severe mental illness. See ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 19-25. That is because competency rules do not focus on the defendant's mental state at the time of the crime: they focus on his competency either to stand trial or to be executed--and therefore do not address the defendant's culpability or the fairness of applying the death penalty to him. See Haleigh Reisman, Note, Competency of the Mentally Ill and Intellectually Disabled in the Courts, 11 J. Health & Biomedical L. 199, 212 (2015).On the other hand, the insanity defense, which does focus on the defendant's mental state at the time of the crime, is too narrow in its scope, and too sweeping in its effect: it applies in only a handful of cases involving defendants with very particular manifestations of mental illness, and in those cases it eliminates criminal liability altogether. ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 20-21. And in practice, it has proven incapable of adequately protecting the severely mentally ill from execution. See, e.g., id. at 22 (citing Baldus, supra); Brooke Butler & Adina W. Wasserman,17The Role of Death Qualification in Venirepersons' Attitudes Toward the Insanity Defense, 36 J. Applied Soc. Psychol. 1744, 1744, 1753 (2006). Exempting from execution (but not from all liability) those defendants with severe mental illness "provides a middle ground protection for individuals who do not fit the extremely narrow insanity defense requirements, but who have significant mental impairments that make them undeserving of the death penalty." ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 2.II. The ABA's position is compelled by federal Supreme Court precedent, which applies a fortiori in Nevada, where the State's ban on "cruel or unusual" punishments is broader than the Eighth Amendment.In Atkins, 536 U.S. 304, and Roper, 543 U.S. 551, the Supreme Court categorically barred the execution of intellectually disabled individuals and juveniles, for reasons that apply equally to those suffering from symptoms related to severe mental illness at the time of their crimes. See Resolution 122A at 6-8. "[A] careful comparison of the language used in Atkins to describe the characteristics of intellectual disability that lower a defendant's culpability and the symptoms characteristic of severe mental illness, shows how much the reasoning of the Court applies with equal force to defendants with mental illness." ABA Mental Illness White Paper at 29.In Atkins, the Court held that "death is not a suitable punishment for a[n intellectually disabled] criminal," 536 U.S. at 321, first because the moral culpability of such individuals falls below the level required to impose a sentence of death, id. at18318-20. "[B]y definition," the intellectually disabled have "diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others," all of which results in lower moral culpability for their crimes. Id. at 318; see also Roper, 543 U.S. at 570 (juveniles are less morally culpable and thus have "a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their whole environment" due to their "vulnerability and comparative lack of control over their immediate surroundings"). And because "the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify" the death penalty, "the lesser culpability of" an intellectually disabled defendant surely "does not merit that form of retribution." Atkins, 536 U.S. at 319. Thus, "an exclusion for" intellectual disability is "appropriate." Id.; see also Roper, 543 U.S. at 571 ("The same conclusions follow from the lesser culpability of the juvenile offender. . . . Retribution is not proportional if the law's most severe penalty is imposed on one whose culpability or blameworthiness is diminished, to a substantial degree, by reason of youth and immaturity.").These same impairments render the death penalty ineffective at deterring the intellectually disabled from committing capital crimes. Intellectually disabled defendants are less able to "process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon that information." Atkins,19536 U.S. at 320; see also Roper, 543 U.S. at 571 ("As for deterrence, it is unclear whether the death penalty has a significant or even measurable deterrent effect on juveniles . . . . [T]he absence of evidence of deterrent effect is of special concern because the same characteristics that render juveniles less culpable than adults suggest as well that juveniles will be less susceptible to deterrence.").Second, the impairments suffered by the intellectually disabled jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings--a "second," independent "justification for a categorical rule making such offenders ineligible for the death penalty." Atkins, 536 U.S. at 320-21. This is not only due to an enhanced possibility of false confessions, the Court reasoned, but also because the intellectually disabled have a "lesser ability" to "make a persuasive showing of mitigation." Id. at 320. Moreover, such individuals are generally "less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel" and make "typically poor witnesses," giving off the "unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes." Id. at 320-21. At a minimum, reliance on intellectual disability "as a mitigating factor" is often a "two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood" that, too often, juries unjustifiably treat as an aggravating factor instead. Id. at 321.Finally, noting the public consensus on the issue, Atkins, 536 U.S. at 314-16, the Court concluded that executing those with intellectual disability is "cruel and unusual punishment[]" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, id. at 307, 321. The20Atkins Court confirmed its "independent evaluation" of whether the death penalty should ever be imposed on an intellectually disabled criminal by looking to the "consensus reflected in th[e] deliberations" of "the American public, legislators, scholars, and judges . . . over the question." Id.As explained in Part I, supra, all of the considerations that drove the Supreme Court in Atkins and Roper apply with full force to defendants afflicted by severe mental illness. These individuals' deficiencies parallel those of the intellectually disabled in all material respects, and as a result render the retribution and deterrence rationales for the death penalty unsuitable to the severely mentally ill. See supra Part I.A. Their inability to contribute to their own defense undermines the fairness of capital proceedings. See supra Part I.B. It is also "fair to say that a national consensus has developed against" executing of the severely mentally ill, Atkins, 536 U.S. at 316 & n.21.These arguments apply with even greater force in Nevada. The State Constitution prohibits "cruel or unusual punishments," Nev. Const. art. 1 § 6 (emphasis added), as compared to the Eighth Amendment of the federal Constitution, which prohibits "cruel and unusual punishments," U.S. Const. amend. VIII (emphasis added). As this Court has instructed, the "language of a constitutional provision is applied in accordance with its plain meaning, unless the language is ambiguous." Halverson v. Sec'y of State, 124 Nev. 484, 488 (2008). And by its plain terms, the21Nevada Constitution is less concerned that a punishment found to be cruel is also "unusual" (i.e., against the consensus); rather, a punishment that is either cruel or unusual is unlawful in Nevada. See People v. Bullock, 485 N.W.2d 866, 872 (Mich. 1992) (prohibition against "cruel or unusual" punishments in state constitution broader than prohibition of "cruel and unusual punishments" under U.S. Constitution); Tillman v. State, 591 So. 2d 167, 169 n.2 (Fla. 1991) (same), superseded by Fla. Const. art. I, § 17; People v. Anderson, 493 P.2d 880, 882 (Cal. 1972) (same), superseded by Cal. Const. art. I, § 27. Thus, under the Nevada Constitution, a public consensus may not be a prerequisite for this Court to find that executing the severely mentally ill violates Nevada's ban on cruel or unusual punishments. That said, the existing and deepening consensus against executing the severely mentally ill surely presses in favor of recognizing, at the very least, a state constitutional rule, even if this Court is unsure whether such executions violate the Eighth Amendment.Individuals suffering from severe mental illness during the commission of an offense "should be tried and punished when they commit crimes," just like those who are intellectually disabled. See Atkins, 536 U.S. at 306; see also supra Part I.D. But the proper approach "rests on the traditional understanding that significant cognitive or volitional impairment attributable to a severe disorder or disability often renders the death penalty disproportionate to the defendant's culpability, even though the offender may still be held accountable for the crime." Resolution 122A22at 10. It accounts for the fact that severe mental illness jeopardizes the reliability andfairness of capital proceedings and it recognizes that the public has branded execut-ing the severely mentally ill as wrong. That approach strikes the appropriate balance,and should be adopted by this Court.CONCLUSION The judgment below should be reversed.Judy Perry Martinez President AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION 321 N.

L.The States' Highest Judicial DisciplinaryCourts MattersHavetheUltimateAuthorityto ResolveFor many years, the ABA has been committed to Strong and effective regulation of state judiciaries through state judicial conduct organizations acting in tandem with the highest courts in each state. In 1978, the ABA adopted the Standards Relating to Judicial Discipline and Disability Retirement, which functioned as a national model for judicial disciplinary enforcement. In 1979, to assist jurisdictions in the implementation of these standards, the ABA developedthe Model Rules for Judicial Discipline and Disability Retirement, and, in 1994, the ABA adopted the Model Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement("MRJDE").The MRJDE expressly promote the ABA's longstanding policy that the highest court in each state should have the inherent authority to discipline judges. The MRJDE contain provisions detailing the role the states' highest courts should play in judicial disciplinary matters.

DISCIPLINARY ENFORCEMENT Rules 6, 15, 24,25 & cmt. (1994).Consistent with the MRJDE, by 1981, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had established judicial conduct organizations vested with authority to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate cases of judicial misconduct. See JEFFREY M. SHAMAN, ET AL., JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND ETHICS § 1.03 at 7 (3d ed. 2000) (hereinafter, "JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND ETHICS"); MARLA GREENSTEIN, HANDBOOKFOR JUD. CONDUCT COMMISSIONS, Appendix C (2002). Those organizations alsohave authority to impose or recommend to a higher body a variety of sanctions ranging from admonition to removal after it has been determined that misconduct has occurred. Jd. In 47 states and the District of Columbia, the highest courtsreviewimposeformalformalsanctions imposed by the judicial conduct organizations and/orsanctions based on the organizations' recommendations. SeeCYNTHIA GRAY, STUDY OF STATE JUD. DISCIPLINE SANCTIONS, Table II (2002).A number of courts also have recognized the traditional and effective roleStates have played as "laboratories of democracy" in the regulation of the legalprofession. See Golas v. Homeview Inc., 106 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir, 1997) (Bownes, J.,concurring) (citing Boyle v. Anderson, 68 F.3d 1093, 1109 (8th Cir. 1995), cert.denied, 516 U.S. 1173 (1996)). In Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. GardenState Bar Association, 457 U.S. 423 (1982), the United States Supreme Courtreversed a decision by the Third Circuit holding that a federal court need notabstain under the Younger doctrine in the analogous context of a challenge to theconstitutionality of New Jersey's disciplinary rules for lawyers. In concluding thatabstention was proper in that case, the Supreme Court unequivocally affirmed thea? reTheDeloanwlayres,tatesIlliinnoiwsh,ichandsanOcktlioanhsomaar.e SANCTIONS, Table II (2002).

Under Younger, the states should have the Opportunity to revise their codes without federal intervention to reflect the unique circumstances present in each state.The states possess similarly compelling interests and duties with respect to the regulation of their judiciaries. In a case involving a constitutional challenge to the disciplinary suspension of a judge, one federal court has cited these very interests and duties in support of its decision to abstain under the Younger doctrine:DssaItntgiaaastticeedniespctliilinnittnnteeaihrrreneeygssttpsl,patoirinnottciehefdnefjei,osdicinnientphegledsithnecaorefuoxyrriitsmtppaorwstoiiofcsatehiirveeoisdnniadnnitgdcoosfateeitmmhwpephhtaiharcedtshiiisazmcloeiaspftlfaietdhcnemtafirunyneisxdtstaatstrmreuaeasontprjtieduoanidnlsngiaeosrono.yffjctrcShuoeouessmnptppicroacenejtesummrsiiietbfoniiotcgrlesiCstotyhutwerhhettifoboleresnotefitafnhatieesdtAujprjujepudouedfidiaciclaactilsthila'eiarnrtygyh'epscrocrnosoeitscfmnatelpttiedeeltc'ugautsrritieintscoyta i,nstapilfrazoanoergdfnasorir.iunage.snh.strdtpesost. pnhaeTdewcohifatenjrugedfWnitohcreeteissoiatstrrhyeq.uVjoeidufsurdttgiiytichoinenaiiolsarfDostert v.

May 29, 2003) ("Like the Supreme Court in Middlesex, this Court cannot presume that the state court will not safeguard Judge Griffen's federal constitutional rights. . . . These proceedings implicate important interests in the State of Arkansas in monitoring the conduct of its own judges, as demonstrated by the fact that the State of Arkansas has organized this Commission to investigate and resolve issues related to such conduct"). Having adopted their own versions of the MRJDE, deference should be paid to the states' traditional role in administering complex areas of regulation. See Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 US. 315 (1943); Minot v. Eckardt-Minot, 13 F.3d 590, 593 (2d Cir. 1994),In light of the states' traditional role and compelling interests in regulating their judiciaries, matters relating to judicial discipline should be resolved in state, not federal, forums. Even when there is a challenge to the facial constitutionalityof a state's code regulating judicial conduct, the state should have the opportunityto limit or narrow the provision to avoid any constitutional infirmity which mayexist. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the New York Court of Appeals' recent decisions in Jn re Raab, No. 91, 2003 N.Y. LEXIS 1411 (N.Y. June 10, 2003) (reviewing constitutional challenge to state's rules governing judicial conduct) and In re Watson, No. 78, 2003 N.Y. LEXIS 1415 (N.Y. June 10, 2003) (same), state courts are fully capable of determining the constitutionality of their codes of judicial conduct under the United States Constitution. Thus, the district court's judgment should be reversed.II.Affirmance of the Judicial DisciplinaryDistrict Court's Judgment Efforts Throughout the NationWouldUndermineThe critical role that the New York provisions in question play in preservingthe integrity, impartiality, and independence of the judiciary is reflected in theadoption of similar provisions by virtually every jurisdiction in the United States.The New York provisions are identical to or substantively the same as portions ofCanons 1, 2, and 5 of the 1990 ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct. SeeAppendix "A." With the exception of Montana (which has adopted canons ofjudicial ethics similar to the 1924 ABA Canons of Judicial Ethics), the remaining49 states, the District of Columbia, and the federal judiciary have adopted codes ofjudicial conduct based on the 1990 ABA Model Code, the 1972 ABA Model Code,> The cases cited in Section II(B) of this provisions similar to the New York provisions of state courts to address federal constitutionalbrief which have upheld the constitutionality of at issue in this case further demonstrate the ability challenges. See discussion infra, pp. 12-13.or a combination of both. Those jurisdictions' codes also contain provisionsidentical to or substantively the same as one or more of the New York provisionsthat were held to be unconstitutional. See Appendix "BoConsequently,affirmance of the district court's judgment in this case would have legalrepercussions that would extend far beyond New York's borders and wouldsignificantly undermine judicial disciplinary efforts throughout the country.Iii.The New York Provisions Profession's LongstandingCampaigningin Question Reflect Views on Judicialthe American Legal Conduct and JudicialA.The Standards of Conduct Embodied Date Back Almost 80 Yearsin the NewYorkProvisionsAs shown above, the New York provisions in question are largely based onCanons 1, 2, and 5 of the 1990 ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct. Thosecanons reflect the legal profession's longstanding views on judicial conduct andjudicial campaigning. This consensus is reflected not only by the almost universaladoption of portions of Canons 1, 2, and 5 by the states but also by those canons'existence in substantively similar form for almost 80 years.Canon 2 (and to a lesser extent, Canon 1) of the 1990 ABA Model Code clearly can be traced back to Canon 4 of the 1924 ABA Canons of Judicial Ethics,'* While the 1924 Canons "were intended to be enforceable set of rules," much of the conduct those subject of regulation almost 80 years later under CONDUCT AND ETHICS § 1.02 at 3.an ideal guide of canons sought to the present ABAbehavior, rather than an regulate has remained the Model Code. JUDICIALwhich stated that "[a] judge's official conduct should be free from impropriety and the appearance of impropriety." ABA CANONS OF Jup. ETHICS Canon 4 (1924); see also E. WAYNE THODE, REPORTER'S NOTES TO CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT at 49 (1973). Provisions of Canon 5 of the 1990 ABA Model Code regulating the political activity of judges and judicial candidates may be traced back to the 1924 Canons. Recognizing the deleterious effect such activity can have on thejudiciary's integrity and independence, Canon 14 exhorted judges "not [to] beswayed by partisan demands." ABA CANONS OF JUD. ETHICS Canon 14 (1924),More specific to the particular concerns the New York provisions at issue inthis case sought to address, the drafters of the 1924 Canons warned of the influencea judge's personal politics may have not just on the actual performance of thejudicial function but on the public's perception of how that function is performed:cabmiaqinasuaatneskcsedsieirtitseniidsswzgoatimentlsWnesle,hn,sitolpsafioettafltnoioardoitscnriheecpwniaocthllnoitipienotoltvtllieireictaditasaiblpnbjcuoeluattetelodiocfgohrfeneietpsceshqaean,urtwttitehyroaroenstddupamaasisarbpnptktioeaiyaccrngistohagofuiiminsucrnenirssdpetsoanpo,ftderiertaohbrsntenehooeitnshnhoaiiagellnspcirutc.pbiriawlvitvreiagitichnryetHgpspweeesrcdnooodrmspnoohvaobrootefyyupsenmlietrpednipmoniooletolninoinatsfttsvi.iocctiaahooadllefsfHe committeeshould neither accept nor retain a nor act as party leader, nor engageactivities. ...place on generallyany party in partisan10Id. at Canon 28; see also id. at Canon 30 ("[A candidate for judicial position] should do nothing while a candidate to create the impression that if chosen, he willadminister his office with bias, partiality or improper discrimination').While the general standards of conduct embodied in Canons 1, 2, and 5 dateback almost 80 years, the present language of those canons has existed in virtuallyidentical form since 1972, when the 1924 Canons were replaced with the 1972ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct.1.02 at 3, 5.°See JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND ETHICS, §The New York provisions in question -- largely based on the 1990 ABA Model Code and 1972 ABA Model Code -- reflect a consensus of the legal profession, including the judiciary, regarding judicial conduct and judicial campaigning.

The ABA also received assistance from many leading lawyers, judges, legal scholars, and liaisons from ABA entities and other groups with a particular interest in judicial ethics. Following this extensive process, the ABA adopted the present 1990 ABA Model Code.®B.The Courts Have Canons Similar toConsistently the New YorkUpheld the Constitutionality Provisions in QuestionofThe legal profession's longstanding and widespread acceptance of thestandards of conduct embodied in the New York provisions in question is furtherdemonstrated by the fact that constitutional challenges to the provisions in questionhave largely failed.

 I. Appropriate Weight Must Be Given To The Rules Regulating theMissouri Bar That Mandate Individual Public Defenders Provide Competent And Diligent Representation. In this case, the Special Master recognized that individual public defenders have significant professional and ethical obligations to their clients that cannot be properly met due to excessive caseloads. The Special Master found that individual public defenders face an untenable dilemma when they are assigned too many cases. He stated, "There is not enough time in the day to properly represent all the defendants assigned, but the defender must adequately defend clients because there is no immunity from the profession's ethical requirements nor from civil liability for legal malpractice." Report at 5. Nevertheless, the Special Master concluded, "Caseload limitation by monthly cutoff goes a long way toward solving the public defender dilemma, but makes the problem worse for everyone else." Id. The ABA respectfully asserts that in evaluating the issues in this case, appropriate weight must be given to the ethical and professional obligations of the6Missouri Rules. Those Rules clearly require that all lawyers including the individual public defenders - provide competent and diligent representation.The effects of excessive caseloads on the representation of indigent defendants and on the indigent criminal defense systems have been studied by organizations, including the ABA, in the half-century since Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963).7 Consistent with the results of these studies, the ABA's7 For example, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gideon v. Wainwright,SCLAID conducted four public hearings at which 32 witnesses from 22 statespresented testimony on excessive caseloads; SCLAID then produced its report,Gideon's Broken Promise: America's Continuing Quest for Equal Justice(UGideon'sBrokenPromise "),availableathttp://www.americanbar.orglcontent/dam/abalmigrated/legaIservices/sclaidldefenderlbrokenpromise/right to counsel in criminal proceedings fullreport.authcheckdam.pdf (last visited May 12, 2011). This report concluded that indigent defenselawyers "frequently are burdened by overwhelming caseloads . . . in defensesystems that fail to provide the bare necessities for an adequate defense (e.g.,sufficient time to prepare, experts, investigators, and other paralegals), resulting inroutine violations of the Sixth Amendment obligation to provide effectiveassistance of counsel." ld. At 38. The report also concluded that "ethical7Formal Opinion 06-441 concluded that all lawyers, including individual public defenders, must move to withdraw from cases when, because of excessive caseloads, they are unable to furnish representation in compliance with their ethical duties. App. at AI. Further, under Formal Opinion 06-441, when court-appointed lawyers are unable to effectively take on additional representations because of existing caseloads, they should advise the court not to make any new appointments. Id. "The Rules provide no exceptions for lawyers who represent indigent persons charged with crimes." Id. at 3.8To be sure, Formal Opinion 06-441 is based on the ABA Model Rules as amended through August 2003, rather than the rules of any particular jurisdiction.violations routinely are ignored not only by the lawyers themselves, but also byjudges and disciplinary authorities." Id. At 39.8 Compare ABA STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE, Defense Function Standard4-I.3(e),availableathttp://W\¥w.americanbar.org/publications/criminal iustice section archive/crimjust standards dfunc blk.html (last visited May 12, 2011) (requiring that defensecounsel "not carry a workload that, by reason of its excessive size, interferes withthe rendering of quality representation, endangers the client's interest in the speedydisposition of charges, or may lead to the breach of professional obligations.").8But the Missouri Rules are based on the ABA Model Rules, and both rules require that a lawyer "provide competent representation to a client." Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 41.1; ABA Model Rule 1.1. This includes both knowledge and skill, and the time for the "thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation." Id. As the comments to both rules emphasize, an essential element of the competent handling of any matter includes "adequate preparation." Comment 5 to Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 4-1.1; Comment 5 to ABA Model Rule 1.1.Similarly, the Missouri Rules and the ABA Model Rules require a lawyer to act with "reasonable diligence and promptness in representing the client." Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 4-1.3; ABA Model Rule 1.3. The comments to the rules explain that this obligation requires that a lawyer's "work load be controlled so that each matter can be handled competently." Comment 2 to Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 4-1.3; Comment 2 to ABA Model Rule 1.3. Thus, in taking on a new matter, the lawyer must consider the impact of the new representation on current clients. The lawyer must not take on any representation when there is a significant risk that the new representation "will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client." Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 4-1.7; ABA Model Rule 1.7(a)(2).A lawyer must follow these rules at the outset and during the course of the representation. The lawyer "shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if: (1) the9representation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct." Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 4-1.16(a)(1); ABA Model Rule 1. 16(a)(1). And, where counsel is court-appointed, counsel should not seek to avoid court appointments except for good cause, which includes representation that "is likely to result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct." Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 4-6-2(a); ABA Model Rule 6.2(a).Indeed, the Special Master recognized the import of the ethical and professional obligations that undergird the Missouri Rules. The ABA respectfully asserts that, in this Court's evaluation of the issues before it, appropriate weight must be given to the clear requirement of the Rules that all clients must be represented competently and diligently. II. Appropriate Weight Must Be Given To The Responsibility of ThePublic Defender Office To Ensure That Its Lawyers Provide Competent And Diligent Representation. In considering the effects of excessive caseloads, the ABA's Formal Opinion also considered the ethical responsibility of the Public Defender Office and concluded that Model Rule 5.1 requires that "[i]f any subordinate lawyer's workload is found to be excessive, the supervisor should take whatever additional steps are necessary to ensure that the subordinate lawyer is able to meet her ethical responsibilities in regard to the representation of her clients." App. at A7. The10ABA believes that, when evaluating the effects of the caseload limitations on the criminal justice system as a whole, appropriate weight must be given to the Public Defender Office's responsibility to ensure that the individual public defender lawyers provide competent and diligent representation to each of their clients.Formal Opinion 06-441 states that the supervisor must monitor the workloads of subordinate lawyers to ensure that the workload of each lawyer is appropriate. This includes "consideration of the type and complexity of cases being handled by each lawyer; the experience and ability of each lawyer; the resources available to support her, and any non-representational responsibilities assigned to the subordinate lawyers." Id. The Formal Opinion also states, "If a supervisor knows that a subordinate's workload renders the lawyer unable to provide competent and diligent representation and the supervisor fails to take reasonable remedial action, the supervisor is responsible for the subordinate's violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct." Id. at 9.In 2009, SCLAID recognized that ABA policy, including Formal Opinion 06-441, did not include an action plan to assist defender organizations in complying with their ethical and professional responsibilities when faced with excessive caseloads. SCLAID accordingly issued its "Eight Guidelines of Public Defense Related to Excessive Workloads," a copy of which is attached as Appendix B, which were adopted as ABA policy in 2009. The Eight Guidelines11set out steps the public defense provider should take to identifY exceSSIve workloads. Guideline 1 urges the public defense provider to assess whether excessive workloads are preventing its lawyers from fulfilling performance obligations. App. at AI7-AI8. Guidelines 2-4 discuss the need for continuous supervision and monitoring of workloads, training of lawyers respecting their ethical duty when confronted with excessive workloads, and the need for the provider to determine if excessive workloads exist. Id at AI9-A22. Guidelines 6-8 address the range of options that the provider and its lawyers should consider when excessive workloads are present. Id. at A25-A28. The Comment to Guideline 6 counsels the provider to take corrective action in advance, "to avoid furnishing legal services in violation of professional conduct rules"; it also counsels that the circumstances may warrant that the provider or the individual lawyers seek redress in the courts. Id. at A25. Guideline 5, however, suggests that the provider consider other choices before redress is required. Id. at A22-A24.As stated in the Comment to Guideline 6, where the public defense provider has followed the Eight Guidelines, "it should be in an especially strong position to show that its workload is excessive, and its representations regarding workloads should be accepted by the court." Id. at A25. As also stated in the Comment to12Guideline 6, this showing should include "statistical data, anecdotal information, as well as other kinds of evidence."9 Id.Finally, as stated in the Comment to Guideline 7, "When Providers file motions requesting that assignments be stopped and that withdrawals be permitted, their prayer for relief should be accorded substantial deference because Providers are in the best position to assess the workloads of their lawyers." Id. at A26. When, as officers of the court, they "address the judge solemnly upon a matter before the court, their declarations are virtually made under oath" and their representations "should be given the weight commensurate with the grave penalties risked for misrepresentation." Id. (citing Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 486, 486 n. 9 (1978). This consideration also promotes the independence of the9 Although the ABA does not endorse specific numerical caseload standards, it hasadopted the principle that "[nJational caseload standards should in no event beexceeded."

See Comment to Guideline 2, Id. at A19 ("the ABA endorses complete independence of the defense function, in which the judiciary is neither involved in the selection of counsel nor in their supervision").While taking no position on the factual issues regarding the propriety of the particular Protocol at issue in this case, the ABA believes that, in this Court's evaluation of the issues before it, appropriate weight should be given to the Public Defender Office's knowledge of the workloads handled by the individual public defender lawyers. Similarly, appropriate weight should be given to the Public Defender Office's obligation to ensure that excessive caseloads do not prevent its lawyers from providing competent and diligent representation to each of their clients. Consistent with Formal Opinion 06-441 and the Eight Guidelines, the ABA urges the Court to consider the responsibilities of the Public Defender Office in ensuring that each of its clients is represented consistent with the ethical and professional obligations of the legal profession.14CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, and taking no position on any of the factual or the Missouri statutory or regulatory issues presented by this case, amicus curiae American Bar Association requests that the Missouri Supreme Court consider the ethical and professional obligations of the legal profession in reaching its decision in this case.Respectfully subqtitted,By: ~~tf.~ Stephen N.

THE FOUR ENJOINED PROVISIONS OF S.B.1070 SHOULDBEFOUNDTO_~ BEPREEMPTED BECAUSE IMPLEMENTATIONINEVITABLYWILLCONFLICTWITHFEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW AND POLICY.As this Court has long held, immigrationregulation is exclusively a federal concern. E.g., DeCanas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 354 (1976) ("Power toregulate immigration is unquestionably exclusively afederal power."). Petitioners assert in their QuestionPresented that the four enjoined provisions of S.B.1070 "authorize and direct state law-enforcementofficers to cooperate and communicate with federalofficials regarding the enforcement of federalimmigration law."Respectfully, the ABA'ssubstantialexperienceworkingin federalimmigration detention facilities® demonstrates thateach of these provisions, if implemented, inevitably6 These include federal facilities as well as state and county jails and privately operated juvenile facilities at which federal detainees are held pursuant to federal contracts.7will result in conflicts with federal immigration law and policy.The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.§ 1101 et seg. (INA") is a complex and detailedstatutory framework regulating immigration which,together with its implementing regulations,establishes a national scheme for uniformimmigration law enforcement to be administered byvarious federal agencies. In 2011, the Immigrationand Customs Enforcement arm ("ICE") of DHSannounced that its removal priorities would focus onaliens who pose dangers to national security or risksto public safety, recent illegal entrants, repeatviolators of immigration law, and aliens who arefugitives from justice or who otherwise obstructimmigration controls.? Also in 2011, ICE announcedcriteria to guide its exercise of prosecutorialdiscretion. These criteria included the agency's civilenforcement priorities, as well as _ case-specificfactors, such as the length of time the alien hadspent in the United States, especially in lawfulstatus, his or her manner of entry, education,military service, criminal history, family ties, andhealth-related issues.§Further, federal law7 Priorities and the Rule of Law: Oversight Hearing on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Before the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, Subcomm. on Immigration Policy and Enforcement, 112th Cong. (2011) (statement of John Morton, Dir., U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement), available at http://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/library/speeches/111012morton. pdf.8 Memorandum from John Morton, Dir., U.S. Immigration & (cont'd)8authorizes relief from removal when circumstancesinvolve asylum for refugees (8 U.S.C. § 1158),humanitarian parole (8 U.S.C. §1182(d)(5)(A)),waiver for purposes of family unity (8 U.S.C.§ 1227(a)(1)(E)(iii)), cancellation of removal, interalia, to prevent extraordinary hardship to closerelatives (8 U.S.C. § 1229b), and temporaryprotection from removal based on unsafe conditionsin a home country (8 U.S.C. § 1254a).Contrary to Petitioner's assertions, the four enjoined provisions of Arizona's §.B. 1070 do not contemplate an enforcement system under which state and local officers operate within the federal government's focused, targeted priorities. Rather, Section 2 of S.B. 1070 requires that local officers detain anyone for whom there is a _ reasonable suspicion that the person is unlawfully present in the United States unless doing so would hinder or obstruct an investigation and, if the person is arrested, to detain the person pending federal verification of the persons immigration status.

Under Section 6, Arizona officers are authorized to arrest without a warrant any person whom an officer has probable cause to believe has committed a "public offense" that would make the person removable from the United States, which includes conduct subject to imprisonment or fine under Arizona law or, if committed outside Arizona, under the law of the state in which it occurred.Rather than being an attempt to "authorize and direct state law-enforcement officers to cooperate and communicate with federal officials regarding the enforcement of federal immigration law," as Arizona asserts in its Question Presented, the four enjoined provisions of S.B. 1070 represent an _ entirely different system that is based on the detention of any individual for whom there is a reasonable suspicion of unlawful immigration status. In the ABA's experience, this fails to consider either the complexities of federal immigration law or the focused, targeted priorities of federal immigration policy. While the ABA asserts that each of the four enjoined provisions should be preempted, this2 Tt is unclear how this provision would affect persons who are lawfully present in the United States but not green card holders, since the federal statutes referenced in Section 3 of S.B. 1070 pertain to the alien registration card, i.e., the "green card."10amicus brief is focused on Sections 2 and 6, to which the ABA's experience is particularly relevant.A. ABA'ExperienceDemonstratesThatMandatory Detention Under Section 2 OfS.B. 1070 Until Immigration Status IsVerified Inevitably Will Result InWrongful Detentions Of Citizens AndLawfully Present Aliens.Under Section 2 of S.B. 1070, indefinite continueddetention by Arizona authorities is mandatory, even when there is no probable cause for detention based on alleged criminal activity, until the immigration status of an individual is verified by the federal government. By permitting its own version of state "non-criminal' detention, without any oversight from the federal immigration enforcement system, Section 2 raises significant due process concerns. As this Court has stated: "[O]nce an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to all `persons' within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent." Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001).Further, Section 2 necessarily places on any person whose status is questioned by an Arizona officer the burden of proof that he or she should not be detained, even though United States citizens and many lawfully present aliens are not required to carry identification. Although verification of a United States citizen's status intuitively appears to11present little problem, the ABA's | substantialexperience demonstrates that verification iscomplicated, even for federal officers who haveundergone significant training, and ABA member-volunteers and staff regularly encounter improperlydetained American citizens and lawfully presentaliens.For example, a volunteer attorneyrepresenting a detained client -- successfullyestablished that he was a United States citizen byfiling the appropriate forms with United StatesCitizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS"), theimmigration benefits unit within DHS. The clientwas released from immigration custody but was laterarrested by ICE, and removal proceedings wereinitiated. He remained in immigration detention formore than one month before ICE was convinced ofhis citizenship. This is a problem that is sufficientlyprevalent that ICE itself has established a hotlinestaffed 24 hours per day for its detainees who mayhave claims of United States citizenship.!°Consistent with this and other ABA experiences,a recent unpublished report by the Vera Institute ofJustice identified 125 people in federal detentioncenters who were believed by immigration lawyers tohave valid citizenship claims.!!In 2008, the10 The hotline also is open to those who think they may bevictims of a crime.See http://www.ice.gov/detention-reform/toll-free-hotline/ (last visited March 25, 2012).11 Marisa Taylor, U.S. Citizen's Near Deportation Not a Rarity,MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIB., Jan. 26, 2008, available at http://www.startribune.com/nation/14456137. html.12American Civil Liberties Union cited reports of "dozens of United States citizens who have been wrongfully arrested, detained, or deported."!?. And in 2005 -- prior to S.B. 1070's enactment -- wrongful detentions in Arizona by local police occurred even though the police were then working under federal authorization. !3Section 2 enforcement by state and local officials -- who lack the same level of experience and understanding of immigration and nationality law as federal officials -- can only exacerbate this type of improper detention. First, recognizing and proving American citizenship can be complicated because it is not limited to persons born in the United States. It can be obtained in many ways, including citizenship by acquisition when one or both parents naturalize under 8 U.S.C. § 1431, and citizenship by derivation when, for example, a child is born abroad to one or two United States citizen parents under 8 U.S.C. § 1401(c)-(e), (g)-(h). In fact, in 2010, ABA project staff met with an individual who was a United States citizen by derivation but possessed no documentation of his citizenship. He was detained by ICE and placed in removal proceedings until ABA12 Press Release, Am. Civil Liberties Union, ACLU DemandsICE End Illegal Deportation of U.S. Citizens (Feb. 13, 2008),availableathttp://www.aclu.org/im migrants-rights/aclu-demands-ice-end-illegal-deportation-us-citizens.13 Mary Romero & Marwah Serag, Violations of Latino Civil Rights Resulting from INS and Local Police's Use of Race, Culture and Class Profiling: The Case of the Chandler Roundup in Arizona, 52 CLEV. ST. L. REV. 75, 79-86 (2005).13project staff obtained and submitted copies of his father's naturalization certificate and his birth certificate.Second, the issues involved in determining lawful immigration status can be complex because this status is not limited to persons who are lawful permanent residents (that is, "green card holders"). Also included are persons with various forms of nonimmigrant status, including those admitted on a temporary basis for a limited purpose and duration, such as tourists, students, and those with certain employment-based visas. There are other forms of lawful immigration status for persons in humanitarian status categories, such as refugees, asylees, and immigrant victims of human trafficking and/or crime who may have pending petitions for immigration visas. Even those with final orders of removal may be granted withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, or may have their removals stayed by federal courts or by ICE for a variety of reasons. All of these persons are lawfully present.The incompatibility of Section 2's mandate of detention by a state official based on reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence with the complexity of determining lawful immigration status under federal law is illustrated by a case handled by an ABA member-volunteer of an asylum seeker from Africa. This man had been recommended for approval by an USCIS Asylum Officer, but his case was undergoing final review. His presence in the United States was therefore authorized and he had14valid employment authorization. However, he didnot and could not yet have a green card. Whileshopping at a convenience store in northern Arizonashortly after the passage of S.B. 1070 in 2010, theshopkeeper asked him for his green card and whenhe could not produce one, detained him and calledthe police.The police further detained andinterrogated the man until his status could beverified.The result of this frightening andhumiliating process was a "self-deportation," inwhich the man -- even though authorized to be in theUnited States under federal law -- abandoned hisasylum claim and left the United States.Moreover, because a variety, and at times a combination, of visas, I-94 cards, work permits, stamps and receipts can establish the lawful presence of aliens, a quick decision by a state or local official without an understanding of these materials may lead to wrongful detention of non-citizens in contravention of federal law. This is an issue, moreover, that cannot be resolved by checking afederal database to verify an individual's status because there is no single database available to law enforcement to check immigration status.!4 Further, it is widely acknowledged that the databases relied on by various federal immigration agencies are14 There are a multitude of databases that each provide limited information. These include the National Crime Information Center ("NCIC"), the Interagency Border Inspection System ("IBIS"), the National Immigration Lookout System ("NAILS"), the Deportable Alien Control System ("DACS"), and the Automated Biometric Identification System (`IDENT').15 outdated and often contain ambiguous or conflicting information.!515 Examples include:Tn an evaluation of the NCIC data, the Migration Policy Institute found that from 2002-2004 there was a 42 percent error rate in the immigration hits from state and local police forces in these data.

Priorities Enforcing Immigration Law: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Appropriations, Subcomm. on Homeland Sec., 111th Cong. (2009) (testimony of Michael Aytes,(cont'd)16Indeed, ABA member-volunteers and _ staff regularly confront errors in these databases. For example, through an ABA program that conducts weekly screenings of unrepresented individuals facing immigration court proceedings, ABA staff met with a woman in late 2011 who was married to a United States citizen. Based on that relationship, she had obtained conditional lawful permanent resident status and, after two years, as required by law, she had filed an application to remove the condition on her status. However, USCIS placed her in removal proceedings ~-- but did not detain her -- and sought to terminate her status on the grounds that she had attempted to procure a visa by fraud or willful misrepresentation. After one month, USCIS issued a motion to reopen her case stating that "a review of the record indicates that the previous decision was based on administrative error." If 8.B. 1070 had been applied in her case, she could have been detained until USCIS determined its error.Other clients of ABA member-volunteers have been erroneously detained by ICE due to database errors and inconsistencies. In one 2002 case, a man had a pending adjustment of status (green card) application in Immigration Court, was married to a(cont'd from previous page)Acting Deputy Dir., U.S. Citizenship & ImmigrationServs.),availableathttp://www.dhs.gov/ynews/testimony/testimony_1238765913599.shtm.

Based on a years-old in absentia removal order, ICE sought to arrest him. After the volunteer lawyer was able to provide documents establishing that the order had been vacated and his proceedings had been reopened based on his wife's petition on his behalf, the arrest warrant was cancelled. The ICE Chief Counsel forthat locale explained to the volunteer lawyer that oldremoval orders were not double checked against the active court docket before arrests were made. The man later obtained his green card.In a 2006 case, a man with a prior removal order had a pending motion to reopen based on an approved visa petition. Although he had been released from custody on an Order of Supervision, he was arrested and taken into ICE custody. Again, he was released after counsel demonstrated the existence of his pending application. He is now a lawful permanent resident with naturalization imminent.These examples illustrate that errors are made by federal authorities charged with the administration of federal immigration law and policy. They also make clear that enforcement of the enjoined Section 2 of S.B. 1070 by state and local authorities with far less training and experience, and who are working with flawed databases and operating under a mandate of detention whenever they have a reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence in the United States, can only result in the18wrongful detention of individuals who are lawfully present under federal law.B. ABA' ExperienceDemonstratesThatMandatory Determination Of RemovabilityUnder Section 6 Of S.B. 1070 Is EquallyProblematic.Equally problematic is the mandate under Section 6 of S.B. 1070 that local officers determine whether a subject has committed a crime in Arizona or in another state that makes that person removable from the United States. While the commission of certain crimes triggers clear grounds of removability, others can require multiple proceedings and the assistance of counsel and adjudicators trained in immigration issues before such a determination can be made.Removability, in short, can involve complex legal questions that are subject to a system of hearings and appeals that first fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Executive Office for Immigration Review ("EOIR"), which operates the Immigration Courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals, and then, potentially, the federal courts of appeals. In countless examples, Immigration Judges, Board of Immigration Appeals members and circuitcourt judges have considered and overruled chargesof removability.In one 2009 case, an ABA member-volunteer represented a lawful permanent resident who was placed in removal proceedings by ICE under 8 U.S.C.19§ 1227(a)(2)(A)Gi), which renders a person removable for two convictions for crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme. Theperson had a conviction for petty theft and anotherfor vandalism. The member-volunteer urged the Immigration Judge to consider Rodriguez-Herrera v.INS, 52 F.3d 238 (9th Cir. 1995), which held that a Washington state crime of second degree malicious mischief was not a crime involving moral turpitude.The volunteer argued that, likewise, the vandalism conviction did not contain the necessary depravity or fraud required to constitute a crime involving moralturpitude. The Immigration Judge agreed, foundICE's charge of removability not sustained, andterminated the removal case. ABA experience showsthat similar scenarios occur continuously around thecountry.The determination of whether an individual has committed a crime in Arizona or in another state that makes the individual removable from the United States is further complicated because the individual, even when deemed removable, still may be eligible for forms of relief that permit him or her to remain lawfully in the United States.Additionally, while Congress has established the Law Enforcement Support Center (""LESC"), this Center does not provide information as to whether a given crime would make an individual removable.!®16 See U.S. IMMIGRATION & CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, U.S. DEP'T OF HOMELAND SEC., LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT CTR. TRAINING MANUAL (rev. 2005), available at http:(cont'd)20Because this information often turns on complex legal determinations, it cannot be easily added to the LESC. Nevertheless, if Section 6 of S.B. 1070 is permitted to be implemented, it would require Arizona state and local law enforcement officers to make removability decisions under Arizona's "reason to believe" standard. Because there is no litmus test for removability on criminal grounds, enforcement of Section 6 of S.B. 1070 will necessarily result in improper detentions.C. ABA Experience Demonstrates That State Immigration Enforcement Should Not Be Permitted Without Direct Supervision By The Appropriate Federal Agencies.Experience with two federal enforcement initiatives involving cooperation with state and local law enforcement demonstrates that direct involvement by federal authorities is crucial.In the first initiative, begun in 1996 as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Congress authorized DHS to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law under § 287(g) of the INA, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 13857. Over the last fifteen years, ICE's Office of State and Local Coordination has negotiated § 287(g) agreements authorizing local law enforcement(cont'd from previous page) /Iwww.scribd.com/doc/21968082/ICE-Law-Enforcement-Support -Center-LESC-Training-Manual.21officers -- after specific training -- to participate in federal immigration enforcement with ongoing oversight by ICE. As of June 2011, there were 69 such agreements.!7However, many of these programs have been widely criticized. In practice -- and even when cooperating with the federal government -- state and local officials often are unable to properly implement federal law. As a result, one of the key criticisms of these programs has been insufficient federal oversight of state action.18 In addition, the 2010 ABA Study reported findings that state action under the § 287(g) agreements often involved racial profiling and increased fear in local communities.19Clearly, even attempts at direct "cooperation" by the states in federal immigration enforcement under § 287(g) agreements have resulted in state action that was problematic in light of federal immigration policy. In its Fiscal Year 2013 budget request, DHS announced it was suspending consideration of17 OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GEN., DEP'T OF HOMELAND SEC., THE PERFORMANCE OF 287(g) AGREEMENTS FY2011 UPDATE (2011), available at http:/;www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt /OIG_11119 Sep 11.pdf. 18 See U.S. GovwT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE, IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT: BETTER CONTROLS NEEDED OVER PROGRAM AUTHORIZING STATE AND LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAWS (2009), available at http://www.gao. gov/new.items/d09109.pdf. 19 See footnote 5, supra, and authorities cited therein.22requests for new § 287(g) agreements andeliminating the "least productive" ones.?° In fact, inArizona, Maricopa County's § 287(g) agreement was terminated in December 2011 by DHS due to performance problems under Sheriff Joe Arpaio that were identified in a Department of Justice reportand which specifically included concerns withdiscrimination and racial profiling.?!The second initiative, Secure Communities, started in 2008 and does not authorize local law enforcement of immigration laws.22.

If enforcement of state laws that are inconsistent with federal immigration law and policy is permitted, the result will be a patchwork of statutes and regulations under which decisions about arrest and detention may well depend on whether enforcement activity is being conducted directly by federal authorities, by a state under federal supervision, or by a state under its own, possibly unique, immigration laws.%5As this Court has stated: "If the purpose of [a federal] act cannot otherwise be accomplished -- if its operation within its chosen field else must be frustrated and its provisions be refused their natural effect -- the state law must yield to the regulation of Congress within the sphere of its delegated power." Crosby v. Nat'l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 373 (2000), quoting Savage v. Jones, 225 U.S. 501, 533 (1912). Clearly, determination of immigration(cont'd from previous page) (2012), available at hitp://immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default /files/docs/State_Guide_to_Immigration_Laws_Updated_021612 pdf. 25 As an example of this inconsistent patchwork, federal law establishes criminal penalties for employers who engage in a pattern or practice of hiring unauthorized workers (see 8 U.S.C. § 1324a) but does not criminalize the act of looking for work by individual aliens. In contrast, Arizona and Alabama do not require a pattern or practice, and criminalize the hiring of day laborers from a vehicle. Moreover, the statutes of Arizona, Alabama, and Indiana also create state criminal penalties for unauthorized immigrants who solicit or perform work, but those of Georgia, South Carolina, and Utah do not. Id.25law and policy is and must remain exclusively federal, and states should have no role except under specific federal authorization and oversight. The ABA urges, accordingly, that the enjoined provisions of S.B 1070 be ruled preempted by federal law.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons stated above, amicus curiae American Bar Association requests that this Court affirm the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: Douglas W.

 This case comes before this Court because LOPD determined that itsattorneys in Lea County had excessive caseloads and LOPD had no internal way of reallocating cases to correct the problem. Under these circumstances, LOPD was ethically required to seek to discontinue appointments and/or withdraw from cases6­ and to take this corrective action in advance of representation. See NM R.P.C.16-116(A)(1); ABA Model Rules 1.16(a)(1) ("A lawyer shall not represent a clientor, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representationof a client if the representation will result in a violation of the rules of professionalconduct or other law."); ABA Eight Guidelines, Comment to Guideline 6("Continued representation in the face of excessive workloads imposes amandatory duty to take corrective action in order to avoid furnishing legal servicesin violation of professional conduct rules."); ABA Formal Opinion 06-441. If reliefcannot be obtained from within the public defense provider by reassigning casesfrom one attorney to another, the provider should seek relief from the courts toprotect their clients against Constitutional harm and their lawyers from ethicalviolations. 9 See ABA Eight Guidelines, Guideline 6 ("Public Defense Providers or9 Excessive workloads are a longstanding problem for public defenders in New Mexico. In 2007, the Center for State Courts evaluated the workload of the trial courts, district attorneys and public defenders in New Mexico. See Daniel J. Hall, A Workload Assessment Study for the New Mexico Trial Court Judiciary, New Mexico District Attorneys' Offices, and the New Mexico Public Defender Department (NCSC 2007) ("NCSC NM Workload Study 2007"), available at https://nmsc.unm.edu/reports/2007/b.%20NMSC%20200607%20Workload%20Final%20Report.pdf (last visited May 26, 2017). The study concluded that the public defender department needed 40 additional full-time defenders and 45 additional support staff. See id. at 87-89. In Kerr v. Parsons, this Court observed that the Legislature has not funded public defense services at the amount deemed necessary by the independent public defense commission. 378 P.3d 1, 5-7 (N.M. 2016). These facts suggest that, while this case arises from Lea county, the caseload problem may impact many, if not all, LOPD offices.7lawyers file motions asking a court to stop the assignment of new cases and to withdraw from current cases, as may be appropriate, when workloads are excessive and other adequate alternatives are unavailable.").A. ATTORNEYS WITH EXCESSIVE WORKLOADS CANNOT PROVIDE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS REQUIRED UNDER THE SIXTH AMENDMENT All individuals charged with crimes have a constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel.10 McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771, n. 14 (1970); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). In a claim for prospective relief, the question is whether indigent defendants face a substantial or unreasonable risk of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012 (11th Cir. 1988), rev'd on other grounds Luckey v. Miller, 976 F.2d 673 (11th Cir. 1992); Kuren v. Luzerne Cty, 146 A.3d 715, 743 (Pa. 2016). When determining what constitutes effective assistance of counsel, courts must look to prevailing norms. See Frye v. Missouri, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1408 (2012) ("Though the standard for counsel's performance is not determined solely by reference to codified standards of professional practice, these standards can be important guides."); Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.10 As observed by the Missouri Supreme Court in State v. Waters, "while the ethical rules do not supplant `a trial judge's obligation to protect a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights,' they do `run parallel to' that duty." 370 S.W.3d 592, 608 (Mo. 2012).8ABA standards are guides in determining prevailing norms, and, in turn,what constitutes effective assistance of counsel. See Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S.356, 367 (2010) (recognizing ABA standards as "valuable measures of theprevailing professional norms of effective representation."); see also Strickland,466 U.S. at 688 ("Prevailing norms of practice as reflected in the American BarAssociation . . . are guides to determin[ing] what [performance of counsel] isreasonable."); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 387 (2005).The rules of professional conduct safeguard the right to effective assistanceof counsel by requiring all attorneys--including public defenders--to providecompetent and diligent representation to each client. NM. R.P.C. 16-101, 16-103; ABA Model Rules 1.1, 1.3.11 Competence requires not only legal knowledge andskill, but the "thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation."12 NM R.P.C. 16-101 (emphasis added); ABA Model Rules 1.1. An11 Although the New Mexico Rules of Professional Conduct control in the present case, the rules pertinent to the issues before this Court are identical to the ABA Model Rules. See, e.g., NM R.P.C. 16-101 & ABA Model Rule 1.1. ("A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation."); NM R.P.C. 16-103 & ABA Model Rule 1.3 ("A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.").12 LOPD Performance Standards similarly require counsel "to work with the Department to make sure that counsel has available sufficient time, resources, knowledge and experience to offer representation consistent with these standards in a particular matter." New Mexico Public Defender Commission and the Law9essential element of competence is "adequate preparation." Id. at Comment 5. There are "no exceptions" for lawyers who represent indigent defense clients. See ABA Formal Opinion 06-441 ("The obligations of competence, diligence, and communication . . . apply equally to every lawyer.").In addition to the ethical requirements applicable to all lawyers, the ABA's Defense Function Standards set forth the substantive standards by which all criminal defense lawyers should practice. See, e.g., ABA Defense Function Standard 4-1.1(a) ("These Standards are intended to address the performance of criminal defense counsel in all stages of their professional work."). The standards guide defense counsel to investigate the facts (Standard 4-4.1); research the law (Standard 4-4.6); communicate with clients (Standards 4-3.1, 4-3.3, 4-3.9, 4-5.1, 45.4); negotiate with prosecutors (Standards 4-6.1, 4-6.2, 4-6.3); file appropriate motions (Standards 4-3.2, 4-7.11, 4-8.1); and prepare for court (4-4.6). Defense attorneys should perform these tasks regardless of whether the case proceeds to trial or is resolved by guilty plea. See id. at 4-4.1, 4-6.1(b).As recognized by the court below, LOPD lawyers in Lea County likely are providing effective assistance to their clients when they focus on particular cases.Offices of the Public Defender, Performance Standards for Criminal Defense Representation, Standard 1.3 (2016), available at http://www.lopdnm.us/pdf/2016PerfStand.pdf (last visited June 1, 2017). Standard 1.3 further requires attorneys with excessive caseloads to report the problem to a supervisor and supervisors, in turn, to report problems they cannot resolve to the Chief Public Defender. See id.10However, a lawyer with too many clients and pending cases simply cannot comply with her ethical duties or perform all of the functions in the practice standards for all of her clients all of the time. See ABA Eight Guidelines, Guideline 1 ("[I]f workloads are excessive, neither competent nor quality representation is possible."). The public defenders are in a classic Catch-22: competent work for one client inevitably results in unreasonable delay or lack of work for other clients. "For example, the failure of lawyers to interview clients thoroughly soon after representation begins and in advance of court proceedings, as necessary, is often due to excessive workloads." See id. at Comment, Guidelines 1. Because an excessive workload creates a grave risk of injury for clients, the rules of professional conduct require lawyers to limit their workloads. See NM R.P.C. 16103, Comment 2; ABA Model Rule 1.3, Comment 2 ("A lawyer's workload must be controlled so that each matter can be handled competently."). See also ABA Defense Function Standard 4-1.8(a) (Lawyers "should not carry a workload that, by reason of its excessive size or complexity, interferes with providing quality representation, endangers a client's interest in independent, thorough or speedy representation, or has significant potential to lead to the breach of professional obligations."); ABA Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System (2002) ("ABA Ten Principles"), Principle 5 ("Defense counsel's workload is controlled to permit the rendering of quality representation.").11Additionally, when an excessive number of cases forces a lawyer to choose among the interests of clients, depriving some if not all of them of full competent and diligent defense services or imposing unconscionable delays on some clients, the situation constitutes a concurrent conflict of interest. See ABA Eight Guidelines, Comment to Guideline 1, citing In re Order on Prosecution of Criminal Appeals by the Tenth Judicial Circuit Public Defender, 51 So. 2d 1130, 1135 (Fla. 1990). While the lawyer may be able to provide effective assistance of counsel and meet her ethical obligations with regard to some clients, doing so forces the lawyer to sacrifice effective assistance owed to her other clients and compliance with her ethical duties. In this situation, "[t]he representation of one client [is] directly adverse to another client." ABA Model Rule 1.7(a)(2). Excessive caseloads create a substantial risk that clients will receive ineffective assistance of counsel. See Waters, 370 S.W.3d at 606-607.12B. COURTS SHOULD CRAFT RELIEF FROM EXCESSIVE PUBLIC DEFENDER WORKLOADS THAT ADEQUATELY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE PARTICULAR JURISDICTIONUltimately, the obligation rests with the courts to ensure that public defenseproviders and their lawyers are able to provide competent and diligentrepresentation in accordance with their professional obligations and that therepresentation complies with the strictures of the Sixth Amendment. See, e.g.,ABA Providing Defense Services Standards, 5-5.3(b) ("Courts should not requireindividuals or programs to accept caseloads that will lead to the furnishing ofrepresentation lacking in quality or to the breach of professional obligations");ABA Eight Guidelines, Comment to Guideline 7. When excessive workloadsprevent public defenders from complying with ethical and Constitutional standards, the workloads must be reduced.13The ABA Ten Principles provide that "[n]ational caseload standards shouldin no event be exceeded." ABA Ten Principles, Commentary to Principle 5. While13 A court has the discretion to determine how the workload is reduced, whether by dismissal of cases or by assignment of cases elsewhere. However, assignment to other lawyers within the public defense provider, without the additional remedy of increased positions or resources, may simply relocate rather than resolve the ethical issue. See ABA Eight Guidelines, Comment to Guideline 5 (noting that reassignment to other attorneys "may not be a feasible alternative . . . if funds are not available to compensate the lawyers"). It is the obligation of the court to craft a remedy that ensures that all clients represented by the public defense provider have access to an attorney capable of complying with ethical and Constitutional standards.13national standards are a useful point of reference, alone they are insufficient to determine the appropriate workload for a jurisdiction. See id (citing the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals ("NAC"), Standard 13.12, which set numeric caseload limits). Indeed, in ABA Formal Opinion 06-441, the Association concluded that "[a]lthough such standards may be considered, they are not the sole factor in determining if a workload is excessive. This determination depends not only on the number of cases, but also on such factors as case complexity, the availability of support services, the lawyer's experience and ability and the lawyer's nonrepresentational duties." ABA Formal Opinion 06-441. In other words, while a caseload above the applicable NAC standard is necessarily excessive,14 a caseload below the NAC standards can also be excessive.The NAC standards were not based on empirical study. See Norman Lefstein, Securing Reasonable Caseloads: Ethics and Law in Public Defense, 15 43-45 (ABA 2011) (citing National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals: Courts 276 (1973)). Indeed, the commentary to the standards14 The court's acknowledgment that LOPD is understaffed and its attorneys have caseloads that exceed the NAC standards alone should have been conclusive on the question of whether the caseloads are excessive. 15 Available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/books/ls_sclaid_def_sec uring_reasonable_caseloads.authcheckdam.pdf.14notes that the standards would need to be adjusted based on the definition of case, the classification system of a jurisdiction and other local conditions, among other factors. See id.Additionally, the NAC standards were established in 1973 and have never been updated. See id. at 43-44. The standards thus do not take into account many complicated aspects of today's criminal defense practice, including forensics and the heightened use of experts, sentencing practices like mandatory minimums and guidelines calculations, and the complicated collateral consequences facing each defendant. See id. at 44 n.95 (noting the impact of collateral consequences on public defense practice). For these reasons, simply ordering public defense attorneys to comply with the NAC standards is inadequate to resolve the ethical and Constitutional difficulties confronting the attorneys.At the same time, courts should resist improper interference with public defender providers and their relationships with their clients. See ABA Eight Guidelines, Guideline 7; see also Comment to Guideline 7 ("While it is appropriate for judges to review motions asking that assignments be stopped . . ., courts should not undertake to micro-manage the operations of the defense programs."). A court should not seek, for example, to regularly review the details of each public defender's cases to determine if a caseload is excessive and, if so, which cases should be transferred from that public defender. See id. Such an intrusive remedy15risks running afoul of the independence critical to defense function, as well as jeopardizing judicial independence. See ABA Ten Principles, Commentary to Principle 1.For this reason, the assessment of LOPD regarding the workload of its attorneys should receive substantial deference. See ABA Eight Guidelines, Comment to Guideline 6 (Public defender "representations regarding workload should be accepted by the court."). "Providers are in the best position to assess the workloads of their lawyers." Id. at Comment to Guideline 7. Moreover, the providers are officers of the court. When they "address the judge solemnly upon a matter before the court, their declarations are virtually made under oath" and their representations "should be given the weight commensurate with the grave penalties risked for misrepresentation." Id (citing Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475 (1978)). The court should thus defer to LOPD to assess when an office requires caseload relief.Alternatively, this Court may seek to establish jurisdiction-specific workload standards. The best way to ascertain the appropriate standards is through a jurisdiction-specific workload study, which set the appropriate workload limits for public defense attorneys under the particular conditions of their practice, providing clarity on when the public defense provider is entitled to caseload relief.16New Mexico previously undertook a workload study in 2007. See Daniel J. Hall, A Workload Assessment Study for the New Mexico Trial Court Judiciary, New Mexico District Attorneys' Offices, and the New Mexico Public Defender Department, 70-90 (NCSC 2007). Completed early in the development of methodologies for assessing workloads, the study was based on only a six-week period of timekeeping and used the NAC standards as guides. See id. at 78. Despite sanctioning workloads over the NAC standards for defenders representing accused juveniles and misdemeanants, the study concluded that the workloads of New Mexico public defenders were excessive. See id. at 87-89. The recommended workload standards were never adopted.In recent years, ABA SCLAID has worked with experts in econometrics to employ the Delphi method to develop reliable, jurisdiction-specific, annual caseload numbers that are empirically based. The Delphi methodology was developed by the RAND Corporation in the 1960's to allow researchers to gather expert opinion and generate reliable consensus. See The Louisiana Project at Appendix D. It is used to develop standards in situations not easily reducible to numeric calculations and has been employed in a wide variety of disciplines including health care, education, information systems, transportation and engineering. See id. at 14 (citation omitted).17ABA SCLAID has completed two public defender workload studies using the Delphi method: The Missouri Project and The Louisiana Project.16 The method begins with a careful analysis of the jurisdiction and its criminal defense practice to identify the case types that exist in the jurisdiction and the case tasks required of defense counsel in each of the case types. See id. at 16. The methodology employs an expert panel of distinguished and experienced criminal defense lawyers, both private practitioners and public defenders, from the jurisdiction, who take a standards driven online survey on the amount of time required by public defenders to complete the various defense tasks necessary (e.g., interviewing clients, conducting investigations, preparing for hearings, etc.) to represent their clients in different types of cases (e.g., minor felony, violent felony, drug-related felony, sexual assault felony). See id. The questions posed of the Delphi panel are aimed at determining how much time a public defender needs to meet their ethical obligations to their client and comply with Constitutional norms. After the first survey iteration, the results of the panels are compiled and distributed to the panel, along with a second survey, permitting the panelists to revise their responses after considering the input of the other experts. See id. Finally, the expert panel is brought together in-person for a day-long meeting to reach consensus about the amounts of time required for the various tasks. See id. The resulting data shows the 16 Both studies are available at www.indigentdefense.org.18number of hours necessary for a public defender to represent a client charged with each case type. See id. The data can be compiled to generate workload standards, as well as compared to historical caseload and staffing data to quantify current deficiencies. See id.The results of ABA SCLAID's Delphi studies substantiate concerns that the NAC standards can be too high for today's public defense practice. For example, the NAC standards set misdemeanor caseloads at 400 per year per attorney. In Louisiana, ABA SCLAID's Delphi study, taking into account the specific types of offense charged as a misdemeanor and what a lawyer is required to do in those types of case, concluded that the average low level misdemeanor case would require 7.94 hours of attorney time. See The Louisiana Project at 20. Based on a work year of 2080 hours (52 weeks, 40 hours per week), a full-time public defender in Louisiana can handle a maximum of 262 low level misdemeanors. See id. ABA SCLAID's Delphi studies thus confirm the assertion, established in ABA standards, that conditions in the jurisdiction must be taken into account when establishing appropriate workload limits. See, e.g., ABA Ten Principles, Commentary to Principle 5; ABA Ethics Opinion 06-441.19If this Court seeks to remedy the excessive caseload of LOPD lawyers in Lea County by means of a caseload limit, 17 the ABA strongly urges that this Court not rely solely on the NAC standards, nor to utilize the 2007 workload study, which was based on the NAC standards. Rather, the ABA encourages the Court to take note of recent innovations in workload standards and employ a methodology that takes into account the conditions and specific case types in the jurisdiction, as well as the ethical and practice standards that are designed to ensure compliance with Constitutional norms, and relies upon the expertise of defense lawyers in establishing the time needed to provide effective assistance of counsel.IV. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae the American Bar Associationrespectfully requests that the Supreme Court of New Mexico acknowledge the excessive workload of the public defenders in Lea County and carefully consider the ethical and professional obligations of the legal profession in crafting its remedy in this case. Under its power of superintending control, this Court should order lower courts to permit LOPD to decline appointments when LOPD deems necessary to provide effective assistance of counsel to its clients until such time as 17 As noted above, when an appropriate workload study cannot be undertaken, the courts should rely on the public defense provider to determine when workloads are manageable. See ABA Eight Guidelines, Comment to Guideline 7 (noting that "Providers are in the best position to assess the workloads of their lawyers").20a workload study can be completed to determine the appropriate workload standards in New Mexico.Respectfully submitted,By: /s/ Linda Klein Linda Klein, Pro Hac Vice President, American Bar Association 321 North Clark Street Chicago, IL 60654-7598 (312) 988-5000 and Mark H.

The Court Should Construe "Lawfully Made Under This Title" to Refer Only to Copies Made in the United States.Section 602(a)(1) of the Copyright Act announces a general prohibition against the "[iJmportation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the United States." 17 U.S.C. § 602(aX(1). Section 109(a) -- which embodies the so-called "first-sale doctrine" -- provides as an exception to that general rule that "the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord." Id. § 109(a). The question in this case is whether a copy made and sold overseas is "made under this title" and thus falls within the exception of Section 109(a). As the Second Circuit correctly held, "foreignmanufactured works" are not "made under" USS. copyright law. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Kirtsaeng, 654 F.3d 210, 222 (2d Cir. 2011).7I.The Second Circuit's Decision IsConsistent with This Court's Guidancein Quality King.The Second Circuit explained that the text of Section 109 neither "compel|(s]" nor "foreclose[s]" either party's interpretation -- rather, "[t]he relevant text is simply unclear." Kirtsaeng, 654 F.3d at 220. It then drew guidance from this Court's decision in Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. Lanza Research International, Inc., 523 U.S. 135 (1998), and adopted the interpretation that "best comports" with that decision. Kirtsaeng, 654 F.3d at 220.In Quality King, this Court addressed the status under Section 602(a) of copies lawfully made in the United States that returned in the stream of commerce to this country -- a so-called "round trip." 523 U.S. at 154 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). Although the question presented here was not directly at issue in Quality King, the Court illustrated why its holding did not render Section 602(a) a nullity by distinguishing between copies "lawfully made" under "the United States Copyright Act" from those made "under the law of some other country." Id. at 147 (majority opinion). The Court then discussed an "example" of this principle: the hypothetical case of a copyright owner's division of its distribution rights between U.S. and British publishers. The Court concluded that copies made by the British publisher would not be "lawfully made under this title" for purposes of Section 109(a). Id. at 148.Although the discussion in Quality King was dictum, it is well reasoned and amply supported by8 established canons of statutory construction, and this Court has issued no holding qualifying its reasoning or reaching the opposite conclusion. Moreover, the status of foreign-manufactured goods was discussed at length by both parties in the Quality King briefing. See Br. for Pet'r, Quality King, 523 U.S. 185 (1998) (No. 961470), 1997 WL 441678, at *7-*9 (discussing trade in foreign-manufactured "grey market" goods in the United States, as well as the copyright implications); Br. for Resp., Quality King, 523 U.S. 135 (1998) (No. 96-1470), 1997 WL 593882, at *11-*14 (same). In the intervening fourteen years, the Court's statements in that case have thus reasonably induced substantial reliance by attorneys advising clients and by parties that deal in copyrighted works.°®As this Court has recognized, "[clonsiderations in favor of stare decisis are at their acme in cases involving property and contract rights, where reliance interests are involved." Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 234 (2009) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 828 (1991)). Moreover, when, as here, the case involves a question of statutory interpretation, "stare decisis . . . has special force." John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 139 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, when Congress§ Of course, the lower courts, like attorneys, "pay due homage to the Supreme Court's well-considered dicta as pharoi that guide [their] rulings." IFC Interconsult, AG v. Safeguard Int'l Partners, LLC, 438 F.3d 298, 311 (8d Cir. 2006). The decision below - which relied overwhelmingly on Quality King establishes this point beyond doubt.9 amended Section 602 of the Copyright Act in 2008, it made no changes to that section that might have affected the viability of the Quality King discussion.If this Court were to reach a contrary result, that would upset the settled expectations of copyright holders. From the perspective of an organization like the ABA, a ruling at odds with the Court's guidance in Quality King would mean that ABA members could not rely on unequivocal, well-reasoned dicta to provide reliable attorney advice. Such uncertainty would impose significant additional costs on attorneys and their clients -- attorneys would feel compelled to recommend perhaps-unnecessary precautions to cope with the absence of a more definitive ruling, and some clients might be chilled from participating in the marketplace altogether until the law becomes more settled.In sum, this Court should adhere to the clear guidance it issued in Quality King and hold that copies of a work made abroad are not "made under" U.S. copyright law.Il, The Second Circuit's Construction of "Lawfully Made Under This Title" Best Reflects the Statutory Text and Structure.Independent of Quality King, this Court should hold that the Second Circuit correctly construed the Copyright Act. The statute does not separately define the phrase "lawfully made under this title." In interpreting a statute, this Court begins with the text. Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U.S. 118, 118 (2009).10Section 109(a) codifies the first-sale doctrine, which limits copyright owners' ability to control U.S. distribution of particular copies "lawfully made under this title." 17 U.S.C. § 109(a). "[T]his title" is Title 17 of the U.S. Code, in which the Copyright Act is codified. The statute is thus most naturally read to refer only to copies that are "made under" U.S. copyright law -- a body of law that does not have extraterritorial effect.This conclusion is consistent with the role ofSection 109(a) in the overall statutory scheme. SeeDavis v. Mich. Dep't of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809(1989) ("It is a fundamental canon of statutoryconstruction that the words of a statute must be readin their context and with a view to their place in theoverall statutory scheme.").Section 602(a)(1)addresses a copyright owner's right to controlimportation of copies "acquired outside the UnitedStates." 17 U.S.C. § 602(a)(1). But if the first saledoctrine applied to copies made and sold abroad, thenSection 109(a) would seemingly limit the copyrightowner's power under Section 602(a)(1) to control onlythe importation of such copies possessed by non-owners, such as bailees and licensees. It is unlikelythat Congress intended the statute to have such anarrow application. Cf. Freytag v. Comm'r of InternalRevenue, 501 U.S. 868, 877 (1991) ("Our casesconsistently have expressed a deep reluctance tointerpret a statutory provision so as to rendersuperfluous other provisions in the same enactment.")(internal quotation marks omitted).11Relatedly, Section 602(a) in certain circumstances exempts from the copyright owner's exclusive right to control importation those copies that (1) will be used by the government, (2) are for the personal use of the importing party, or (3) are imported for "scholarly, educational, or religious purposes." 17 U.S.C. § 602(a)(3)(A)-(C). But when applicable, these explicit exceptions to the copyright owner's exclusive right to control importation do not allow the importer to then further distribute the lawfully imported copies. Instead, in cases governed by these exceptions, the copyright owner continues to control the further downstream distribution of its works in the United States. See Quality King Distribs, Inc. v. L'anza Research Intl, Inc., 523 U.S. 185, 145 (1998). Petitioner's reading of Section 109(a), by contrast, would give the importer of a copy made and sold abroad the much greater power to distribute that copy in the United States over the copyright owner's objection. The statutory design -- with its narrower express exemptions -- suggests that Congress did not intend in Section 109(a) to enact such a sweeping exception to Section 602(a).That conclusion is reinforced by the long-standing presumption, which formed the backdrop for the adoption of the Copyright Act, that the country's proscriptive and prescriptive competence ends at its own borders. See Am. Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347, 356 (1909) ("[T]he character of an act as lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly by the law of the country where the act is done."), overruled on other grounds, Cont'l Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 704-05 (1962). Containing12no contrary statutory indication, the U.S. Copyright Act is presumed territorial. See generally 1 Paul Goldstein, Goldstein on Copyright § 1.12, at 1:26 (3d ed. 2005) ("Copyright protection is territorial. The rights granted by the United States Copyright Act extend no farther than the nation's borders.").In enacting the Copyright Act, Congressrecognized territorial limits on copyright.Forexample, the statute identifies the types of worksCongress chose to protect under copyright within U.S.borders and provides an importation right in Section602(a) distinct from the public distribution right ofSection 106(3). There is no evidence in the statutethat Congress determined that the copyright owner'sactivities abroad should enhance or extinguish rightsunder the U.S. Copyright Act that are solelyexercisable in the United States.The ABA accordingly urges this Court to affirm the Second Circuit's conclusion that a copyright owner's manufacture and sale of copies strictly outside the United States does not exhaust its rights under Section 602(a) to restrict importation of those copies into this country.13 CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Second Circuit should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel: Thomas C.

I. THE D.C. CIRCUIT'S NEWLY CREATED EXCEPTION IS AN UNWARRANTED DISTORTION OF THE LAW OF PRIVILEGE A. The Law of Privilege in Federal Courts Is Based on Common-Law Principles Developed in the Light of Reason and Experience Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides that "the privilege of a witness, person, government,State, or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience." The Rule, and the privileges whose development it authorizes, applies in both civil and criminal proceedings, including grand jury proceedings. See Fed. R. Evid. 1101(b)- (d). 2Rule 501 reflects congressional intent that questions of privilege arising in federal proceedings be decided on the basis of "a federally developed common law based on2 See also In re Grand Jury Investigation, 918 F.2d 374, 379 (3d Cir.1990) ("Under Federal Rule of Evidence 1101, Rule 501 is applicable to grand jury proceedings."); In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 599 F.2d 504, 509 (2d Cir.1979) ("It is now clear, however, that discovery by the Government in grand jury proceedings is subject to the attorney-client privilege as developed at common law.... ") (citing Fed. R. Evid. 1101(c) & (d)).6.modern reason and experience." Fed. R. Evid. 501, Advisory Comm. Notes. Consistent withCongress' intent, this Court has recognized that the role of the federal courts under Rule 501 is not toengage in unfettered judicial legislation, but to elaborate rules of privilege within the framework ofexisting legal principles that together define the prevailing norms of privilege applied by Americancourts:The Federal Rules of Evidence acknowledge the authority of the federal courts to continue the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges in federal criminal trials "governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted ... in the light of reason and experience."Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 47 (1980).In carrying out the evolutionary task set for them by Rule 501, federal courts look to all thesources of guidance traditionally used by courts in articulating common-law rules.Both the history and the language of Rule 501 ... provide us with a mandate to develop evidentiary privileges in accordance with common law principles. This mandate, in turn, requires us to examine federal and state case law and impels us to consult treatises and commentaries on the law of evidence that elucidate the development of the common law.In re Grand Jury Investigation, 918 F.2d 374, 379 (3d Cir.1990).Thus, in its decisions on issues of privilege under Rule 501, this Court has examined priorfederal and state case law, see, e.g., Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389-93 (1981), as wellas scholarly commentary, see, e.g., Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 50 & n. 11 (1980). TheCourt has also recognized that proposed Federal Rules of Evidence 501 through 513, submitted toCongress but not adopted7.when the Rules were approved in 1975, reflect "reason and experience" entitled to significant weight. Jaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 1930-31 (1996); see also United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 367-68 (1980). Similarly, because "the existence of a consensus among the States indicates that 'reason and experience' support recognition of [a] privilege," this Court has recognized that "the policy decisions of the States"--as reflected both in state-court decisions and state legislation--"bear on the question whether federal courts should recognize a new privilege or amend the coverage of an existing one." Jaffee, 116 S. Ct. at 1929-30. In addition, the Court has looked to "accepted norms of professional conduct" (including ABA ethical standards) bearing on confidentiality in determining the extent to which legal protection should be extended to confidential communications. Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157, 171 (1986). 3The use of an incremental, precedent-based approach to resolving issues of privilege has meant that this Court "has rarely expanded common-law testimonial privileges" into new areas, In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 103 F.3d 1140, 1149 (3d Cir.1997) (declining to adopt a parent-child privilege), although the Court has recognized "new" privileges when they have been based on a demonstrable consensus among the relevant sources of authority. See Jaffee v. Redmond, supra (accepting psychotherapist-patient privilege). By the same token, in recognition that "the long history of [a] privilege suggests that it ought not to be casually cast aside," Trammel v. United States, 443 U.S. at 48, the Court has generally protected privileges that are3 See also Jaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. at 1928 & n. 9, 1930 n. 12 (relying in part on view of professional organizations regarding the need for confidentiality, and on prevailing ethical standards, in recognizing psychotherapist-patient privilege).8. "indelibly ensconced in our common law," United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. at 368, and has enforced such privileges as required to carry out their underlying purposes. See, e.g., United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 562 (1989); Upjohn v. United States, 449 U.S. at 390-97.B. The Attorney-Client Privilege Is Fundamentally Important to Our System of Justice No privilege is more "indelibly ensconced" in the common law than the attorney-client privilege. This Court has long recognized the significant public policies the privilege serves and its importance to the administration of justice under law: The attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law. 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2290 (McNaughton rev. 1961). Its purpose is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice. The privilege recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer's being fully informed by the client. As we stated ... in Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 51 (1980): "The lawyer-client privilege rests on the need for the advocate and counselor to know all that relates to the client's reasons for seeking representation if the professional mission is to be carried out." And in Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403 (1976), we recognized the purpose of the privilege to be "to encourage clients to make full disclosure to their attorneys." This rationale for the privilege has long been recognized by the Court, see Hunt v. Blackburn, 128 U.S. 464, 470 (1888) (privilege "is founded upon9. the necessity, in the interest and administration of justice, of the aid of persons having knowledge of the law and skilled in its practice, which assistance can only be safely and readily availed of when free from the consequences or the apprehension of disclosure").Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. at 389; accord, CFTC v. Weintraub, 471 U.S. 343, 348 (1985). More succinctly, the Court has stated that the privilege is "rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust" between lawyer and client. Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. at 51; accord, Jaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. at 1928.The American Bar Association has similarly emphasized the critical importance of attorneyclient confidentiality and has promulgated model ethical standards that reinforce the obligation of confidentiality protected by the privilege. The official comments to Rule 1.6 of the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct describe the policies underlying the ethical requirement of attorney-client confidentiality in terms that parallel those used by this Court in Upjohn:[2] The observance of the ethical obligation of a lawyer to hold inviolate confidential information of the client not only facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper representation of the client but also encourages people to seek early legal assistance.[3] Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine what their rights are and what is, in the maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. The common law recognizes that the client's confidences must be protected from disclosure. Based upon experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.10.[4] A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that the lawyer maintainconfidentiality of information relating to the representation. The client is thereby encouraged tocommunicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as to embarrassing or legally damaging subjectmatter.C. The Common Law Recognizes that the Privilege Survives the Client's DeathThe attorney-client privilege and the parallel ethical obligation to preserve client confidencestraditionally have not been thought to be temporally limited. Comment 22 to the ABA's Model Rule1.6 expresses the general principle: "The duty of confidentiality continues after the client-lawyerrelationship has terminated." Judicial formulations of the privilege have long expressed a similar view.In an influential early opinion, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw of the Supreme Judicial Court ofMassachusetts wrote:The principle we take to be this; that so numerous and complex are the laws by which the rights and duties of citizens are governed, so important is it that they should be permitted to avail themselves of the superior skill and learning of those who are sanctioned by the law as its ministers and expounders, both in ascertaining their rights in the country, and maintaining them most safely in courts, without publishing those facts, which they have a right to keep secret, but which must be disclosed to a legal advisor and advocate, to enable him successfully to perform the duties of his office, that the law has considered it the wisest policy to encourage and sanction this confidence, by requiring that on such facts the mouth of the attorney shall be for ever sealed.Hatton v. Robinson, 31 Mass. (14 Pick.) 416, 422 (1834) (emphasis added).11.Justice David Brewer put the matter similarly in an opinion written shortly before his appointment to this Court:[I]t is the glory of our profession that its fidelity to its client can be depended on; that a man may safely go to a lawyer and converse with him upon his rights or supposed rights in any litigation with the absolute assurance that that lawyer's tongue is tied from ever disclosing it ....United States v. Costen, 38 F. 24 (C.C.D.Colo.1889) (emphasis added).The late Judge Irving Kaufman expressed the same principle in his much-cited opinion in United States v. Standard Oil Co., 136 F. Supp. 345, 355 (S.D.N.Y.1955):The confidences communicated by a client to his attorney must remain inviolate for all time if the public is to have reverence for the law and confidence in its guardians. It is traditional in the legal profession that the fidelity of a lawyer to his client can be depended upon. The client must be secure in his belief that the lawyer will be forever barred from disclosing confidences reposed in him. The view that the privilege does not lapse with time is reflected in a consistent body of federal and state caselaw holding that the privilege survives the death of the client. As one author has summarized the rule: [T]he privilege, once it attaches, persists unless the lawyer is released by the client. Upon the death of the client, no release is possible. Hence death should seal the lawyer's lips forever.44 EDNA S. EPSTEIN, THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND THE WORK PRODUCT DOCTRINE 234 (ABA Sec. of Litigation 3d ed. 1997); accord PAUL R. RICE, ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE IN THE UNITED STATES § 2:5, at 69 (Law.Coop.1997) ("In all circumstances, other than the will contest exception, the privilege survives the death of the individual client....").12. The same view has found expression in the proposed final draft of the American Law Institute's Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers, which states that "[t]he privilege survives the death of the client";5 in Dean Wigmore's treatise, which says that "the privilege continues even after the end of the litigation or other occasion for legal advice and even after the death of the client ";6 in Judge Weinstein's treatise on evidence, which expresses "the general rule that the lawyer-client privilege survives the death of the client";7 in Professors Hazard's and Hodes's treatise on The Law of Lawyering, which states that "since confidentiality (and the attorney-client privilege) are designed as inducements to speak at the time of the client-lawyer consultation, it is almost universally held that the lawyer's duty to maintain silence survives not only the relationship but also the death of the client"; 8 and in this Court's proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 503, which would have provided for the survival of the privilege after the client's death.9 The ABA's Ethics Committee summarized the rationale for the survival of the privilege in its Informal Opinion 1293:5 RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS § 127, cmt. c, at 431 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1 1996); see also id. § 112, cmt. e, at 280 ("The duty of confidentiality continues so long as the lawyer possesses confidential client information. It extends beyond the end of the representation and beyond the death of the client."). 6 J. WIGMORE, EVIDENCE § 2323, at 631 (McNaughton rev. 1961). 7 JACK B. WEINSTEIN & MARGARET A. BERGER, WEINSTEIN'S FEDERAL EVIDENCE § 503.32, at 503-96 (2d ed. 1997). 8 GEOFFREY C. HAZARD, JR. & W. WILLIAM HODES, THE LAW OF LAWYERING § 1.6:101, at 131 (1998). 9 See PROPOSED FED. R. EVID. 503(c) ("The privilege may be claimed by ... the personal representative of a deceased client....").13.[T]here is no rule or reason to say that any such confidences and secrets should not be preserved indefinitely. Any other rule would mean that promptly upon the death of a client the privilege would be annulled and the attorney would be at liberty to disclose information which had been confided in him by the client while alive. This, to say the least, could lead to numerous serious problems involving the client's representatives, surviving relatives and business associates. Such a concept would be in contravention of the very purpose of the privilege.10The general principle of survival of the privilege has long been viewed as having one exception: the so-called "will contest" exception, under which attorney-client communications relating to estate planning matters are not privileged if "sought to be disclosed in litigation between the testator's heirs, legatees, devisees, or other parties, all of whom claim under the deceased client." United States v. Osborn, 561 F.2d 1334, 1340 (9th Cir.1977); see also Glover v. Patten, 165 U.S. 394, 408 (1897). The exception has been narrowly confined to these circumstances, in which it is "necessary to a proper fulfillment of the testator's intent." Osborn, 561 F.2d at 1340, n. 11; see also Hitt v. Stephens, 675 N.E.2d 275 (Ill.App.1996) (declining to expand exception to situation where there was no pending litigation contesting a will), appeal denied, 679 N.E.2d 380 (Ill.1997). Outside of the will contest situation, traditionally there has been no exception to the privilege's survival. "The only context in which a client's death might affect the viability of the privilege is a will contest." Hitt, 675 N.E.2d at 278. Or, as one leading treatise puts it, "[a] will contest is the only10 ABA Comm. on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Informal Op. 1293 (1974) (Maintenance of Confidences and Secrets of a Deceased Client).14. exception to the general rule that the privilege survives the death of a client."11 [FN11]D. The Lower Court's Revision of Privilege Law Fails to Comport with Reason and Experience1. "Balancing Tests" Are Inimical to the Purposes of the Privilege Although the D.C. Circuit's opinion does not purport to abrogate the privilege altogether upon the client's death, it fundamentally transforms the privilege by subjecting it to a court's balancing of the need for the information against the interests served by confidentiality. The D.C. Circuit's ruling is a departure from the ordinary rule that the attorney-client privilege, unlike privileges or protections that are qualified, " 'cannot be overcome by a showing of need.' "12 It is black-letter law that "[a]bsent a waiver of the protection, ... the privilege precludes the disclosure of the communications regardless of the need that might be demonstrated for the11 RICE, supra, § 2:6, at 70 (emphasis added); see also RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS § 127, cmt. d, at 431 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1 1996) (except for the will contest exception, "[t]he law recognizes no exception to the rule" that the privilege survives); id. § 127, Reporter's note to cmt. c (outside the will contest exception, "other cases are encountered and they routinely hold that the privilege survives"). 12 Admiral Ins. Co. v. United States Dist Court, 881 F.2d 1486, 1494 (9th Cir.1989) (quoting Saltzburg, Corporate and Related Attorney-Client Privilege: A Suggested Approach, 12 HOFSTRA L. REV. 279, 299 (1984)); see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 599 F.2d 504, 510 (2d Cir.1979) (noting that attorneyclient privilege is not a qualified privilege subject to a balancing test); Mason C. Day Excavating, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 143 F.R.D. 601, 609 (M.D.N.C.1992) ("Unlike work product protection, under ... federal common law ..., the attorney-client privilege does not implicate a balancing test wherein the privilege may be disregarded solely because the opposing party can show a sufficient need for the information.").15. information in them."13 As the proposed final draft of the Restatement puts it, "the privilege ... is not subject to ad hoc exceptions" based on balancing.14Indeed, this Court has observed that making the protection of a confidential communication dependent upon such a balancing test "would eviscerate the effectiveness of the privilege." Jaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 1932 (1996). The predictable effect of a balancing analysis will be for a court to give preference to the needs of a party to the matter immediately at hand over the interests of an individual who is deceased and the more generalized policy interests of society in fostering attorneyclient confidences. In Jaffee, this Court rejected a balancing test for the newly recognized psychotherapist-patient privilege for just such reasons. Here, where what is at issue is a longestablished privilege that has never been subject to a balancing test, it is even clearer that considerations of "reason and experience" counsel against limiting the privilege by adopting an ad hoc balancing approach.2. The Attorney-Client Privilege Should Not Be Curtailed in Criminal Proceedings To be sure, the D.C. Circuit states that its balancing approach will apply only in criminal or grand jury proceedings. But the lower court's creation of different privilege rules to be applied in criminal and civil matters, far from justifying its weakening of the privilege, is itself profoundly troubling. The Rules of Evidence do not distinguish among civil, criminal, and grand jury matters for purposes of applying evidentiary privileges; rather, they expressly provide that privileges recognized under Rule 50113 RICE, supra, § 2:2, at 50 (footnotes omitted). 14 RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS § 118, cmt. c, at 341 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1 1996).16. apply fully in all proceedings. Fed. R. Evid. 1101. Indeed, the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 501, prepared by the House-Senate Conference Committee that devised the final version of the Rule, emphasizes that the intent of the Rule was "that privileges shall continue to be developed by the courts of the United States under a uniform standard applicable both in civil and criminal cases " (emphasis added).The D.C. Circuit's suggestion that the attorney-client privilege should be subject to a different standard in criminal and civil matters is a marked departure not only from congressional intent, but also from the traditional refusal of American courts to draw such a distinction. Although the decision below is on its face limited to the situation where the privilege is invoked after the death of the client, the notion that criminal and civil cases are different in kind with respect to the attorney-client privilege may not, once accepted, be easily cabined. The D.C. Circuit's decision thus stands as a troubling threat to the hitherto unquestioned rule that the attorney-client privilege is fully applicable to criminal and grand jury matters.3. The Existence of One Carefully Defined Exception to the Survival of the Privilege Does Not Justify Creating New Exceptions Contrary to the Policies Underlying the Privilege The existence of another, longstanding exception to the survival of the privilege--the will contest exception--cannot support the creation of a new one applicable to an entirely distinct set of circumstances. Unlike the D.C. Circuit's newly crafted rule, the existing exception is supported by over one hundred years of precedent reflecting the "reason and experience" of common law courts. Moreover, the will contest exception is based on considerations that make it extremely unlikely that it will undermine the purposes of the17. privilege. As courts and scholars unanimously acknowledge, the exception is designed to effectuate the intention of the testator, and is based on the view that "a decedent would (if one could ask him) waive the privilege in order that the distribution scheme he actually intended be put into effect." Hitt v. Stephens, 675 N.E.2d at 278. 15 Under such circumstances, as this Court long ago recognized, disclosure "can present no impediment to a full statement to the [attorney]." Blackburn v. Crawford's Lessee, 70 U.S. at 193. The existence of an exception for disclosures consistent with the wishes of a decedent can in no way support creation of an exception allowing disclosures contrary to the decedent's intentions, for the latter, unlike the former, would naturally tend to chill attorney-client communications and thus defeat the purpose of the privilege.15 See also Glover v. Patten, 165 U.S. at 408; Blackburn v. Crawford's Lessee, 70 U.S. 175, 194 (1866); United States v. Osborn, 561 F.2d at 1340, n. 11; RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF THE LAW GOVERNING LAWYERS § 131, cmt. b, at 458 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1 1996) (the will contest exception is "justified on the ground that the decedent would have wished full disclosure to facilitate carrying out the client's intentions.... It is therefore probable that the exception does little to lessen the inclination to communicate freely with lawyers."). As the Independent Counsel has noted, it is of course not always the case that a client would consent to the disclosure of privileged communications on all matters relating to estate planning, for estate planning "may be based on considerations one would prefer never to reveal." Hitt v. Stephens, 675 N.E.2d at 279. But this is precisely why the courts have not created a general estate planning exception, and have confined the will contest exception to those circumstances where it is most likely that disclosure will be consistent with the decedent's wishes. See id at 278-79.18. 4. The Lower Court's Reasoning Unduly Discounts the Chilling Effect Its Rule Will Have on Attorney-Client Communications The D.C. Circuit justifies its substantial weakening of the privilege by its conjecture that the prospect of revelation of attorney-client confidences in criminal matters after the client's death will have little effect on the willingness of clients to confide in attorneys. Common experience--and in particular the experience of members of the ABA and other practicing lawyers-- suggests that the D.C. Circuit's supposition is, at best, highly speculative. Every day, thousands of clients consult their attorneys with the object of ordering their affairs and providing for their families and loved ones in the event of their death--consultations that would not occur if clients were truly indifferent to what happened after they died. While acknowledging that clients regularly show great concern for the effect of events after their death on the pecuniary well-being of their heirs, the D.C. Circuit nonetheless held that criminal matters will rarely implicate interests that will survive a client's death. The court reasoned that, by definition, the client cannot be held criminally liable after death, and it apparently assumed that the client will have little concern about the possible criminal liability of others. Moreover, the court discounted the client's possible concern with the effect of a criminal matter on his or her own reputation after death, stating that only a client with a near-Pharaonic interest in immortality would be concerned with such matters. The court's reasoning is curious. We know that clients regularly show vital concern for their families' material well-being after their death. Why should we assume they would be less concerned about the possibility that their friends and19. loved ones might face criminal penalties?16 Moreover, even if the odd notion that people care more about their survivors' financial interests than about whether they may be prosecuted and imprisoned were true, criminal matters often have extraordinarily grave financial consequences for their subjects (and their subjects' families). A client aware that an attorney-client confidence could be disclosed to a prosecutor or grand jury after the client's death could have great reason to fear that the result would be substantial fines and forfeitures that could ruin members of the client's family--even, possibly, family members innocent of any crime. Cf. Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U.S. 442 (1996).As for the supposition that the concern of clients for their reputation after their death is so slight that the prospect of disclosure will not chill attorney-client communications, it, too, seems contrary to reason and experience. The maxim that "a good reputation is more valuable than money" has survived for centuries.17 The consciousness that reputation lives on after death is evident not only in the works of memoirists and philanthropists, but in the efforts of ordinary men and women down to their last days to maintain the good regard of their friends and neighbors. 18 The depth of this16 Cf. FED. R. EVID. 804(b)(3) (equating statements against pecuniary interest with statements against penal interest for purposes of applying hearsay rules). 17 PUBLIUS SYRUS, MAXIM 108 (42 B.C.). 18 To cite only one example, President Grant--hardly a man of Pharaonic immodesty--spent the last months of his life in a successful race to complete his memoirs before he died of cancer, not only in order to secure his reputation for posterity, but also to provide the wherewithal for his family to extricate itself from the financial and legal difficulties into which he had brought it.

GRANT, PERSONAL MEMOIRS OF U.S. GRANT, xx-xxii (1952) (Da Capo Press reprint 1982).20. concern is captured by Cassio's lament from Othello, act 2, scene 3:Reputation, reputation, reputation! O! I have lost my reputation. I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial.5. The Independent Counsel's Alternative "Exposure of Client Perjury" Rationale for the Result Below Is UnconvincingIn his Brief in Opposition to the Petition for Certiorari, the Independent Counsel presents analternative argument for abrogation of the privilege in this case, based on the assertion that permittingdisclosure would provide the Independent Counsel with no more information than he could haveobtained if the client were still alive. The Independent Counsel contends that the facts he seeks todiscover from the attorney could have been learned directly from the client if he were alive byimmunizing him and calling him as a grand jury witness. If the client had then testified inconsistentlywith what he had told the attorney, the Independent Counsel asserts, the attorney would have beenethically obligated to reveal the confidences anyway. Thus, the Independent Counsel asserts, requiringdisclosure cannot have any adverse effect on the policies underlying the privilege.The Independent Counsel's argument is wrong on multiple levels. Under the District ofColumbia's ethical rules (unlike the ABA's Model Rules), even perjury by the client in open court whilerepresented by the attorney would not permit the attorney to disclose confidences. Compare D.C. RuleProf. Conduct 3.3(b) & (d) (and Comments [6] & [7] ) with ABA Model Rule 3.3(a)(2) & (4) (and Comments [5]-[12] ).19 Moreover, even if Mr. Foster were alive, the19 In any event, neither the Model Rules nor the leading ABA Ethics Committee opinion on the subject of client perjury would require an attorney to disclose perjury given by his client before a grand jury if he learned of it after the fact, which would be the situation under the Independent Counsel's hypothetical if the client were alive and he, instead of his attorney, were subpoenaed and testified falsely about the subjects on which he had conferred with his attorney. See ABA Comm. on Ethics and Prof'l Responsibility, Formal Op. 87-353, at 2-3 & n. 3 (1987) (Lawyer's Responsibility with Relation to Client Perjury).21. Independent Counsel could not obtain from him directly what he now seeks from Mr. Foster's lawyer. The Independent Counsel could, of course, ask questions eliciting recollections of particular underlying facts, but he could not simply ask Mr. Foster to "tell the grand jury everything you told your lawyer"-which is what he is now, in effect, asking the lawyer. Thus, the Independent Counsel's premise that the information he now seeks from the attorney would have been available from the client during his lifetime (with the lawyer as a backup in case of perjury) is incorrect.20More fundamentally, the Independent Counsel's argument focuses on the wrong issue. The question is not whether the Independent Counsel will be able to learn more from the attorney if the D.C. Circuit's new rule is adopted than he could have learned from the client if he were still alive. Rather, the relevant question is whether protection of the confidences would deprive the Independent Counsel of any information that would have been available to him if the attorney-client communication had never taken place. Of course, if the communication had never occurred, the client's death would have prevented the Independent Counsel from seeking the information from its original source. Thus, as in Upjohn, the privilege should be sustained, because "[a]pplication of the attorney-client privilege to20 The Independent Counsel's position recalls a line from T.S. Eliot: "[W]hat the dead had no speech for, when living,/They can tell you, being dead." T.S. ELIOT, FOUR QUARTETS, Little Gidding, in THE COMPLETE POEMS AND PLAYS 1909-1950, 115, 139 (1952).22. communications such as those involved here, ... puts the adversary in no worse position than if the communications had never taken place." 449 U.S. at 395.Finally, the Independent Counsel's argument "proves too much, since it applies to all communications covered by the privilege." Id. at 393, n. 2. If, as the Independent Counsel suggests, an attorney's obligation (in some jurisdictions) to expose perjury by his client is a reason for eliminating the privilege after death, it would seem equally valid as a reason for eliminating the privilege altogether, and simply going to the attorney for information in the first instance, eliminating the unnecessary middle step of putting the client on the stand and using his attorney as a check on his testimony. The ABA has taken a strong position on a lawyer's ethical obligation not to be a party to client perjury, see ABA Comm. on Ethics & Prof'l Responsibility, Formal Op. 87-353 (1987); see also Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157 (1986), but that obligation cannot be bootstrapped into an argument for eliminating the privilege when there has been no perjury.This Court has recognized that "[a]s a practical matter, if the client knows that damaging information could more readily be obtained from the attorney following disclosure than from himself in the absence of disclosure, the client would be reluctant to confide in his lawyer and it would be difficult to obtain fully informed legal advice." Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403 (1976). Notwithstanding the Independent Counsel's protestations, denying the protection of the privilege to the communications at issue here would have precisely that effect. Absent disclosure to the attorney, the client would have been assured that his death would seal his secrets. Thus, denying the privilege after death would necessarily make the information "more readily obtained from the attorney following disclosure" than it would have been from the client absent the disclosure. The policies23. underlying the privilege thus require its application, and there is no basis for eliminating it simply to relieve the Independent Counsel from the ordinary consequence of the death of a witness--loss of the witness' testimony.E. The Lower Court's Opinion Is Likely to Have a Far-Reaching Negative Impact on Attorney-Client Communications The resolution of the privilege issue in this case, although it technically will apply only in federal proceedings, will have a far larger practical impact. Given the scope of federal criminal investigations, clients throughout the country will have reason to fear that their confidences might someday become relevant to federal criminal proceedings before grand juries or courts. Even though client confidences may be fully protected under the law of the state in which they are made, the D.C. Circuit's new federal rule would negate those protections in a federal criminal proceeding.21 For exactly this reason, this Court has recognized the undesirability of federal privilege rules that have the effect of frustrating the purpose of state-law rules that foster socially valuable confidential communications. Jaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. at 1930. If the D.C. Circuit's ruling is sustained, conscientious attorneys everywhere will advise their clients--regardless of whether their death may seem imminent--that they should assume their communications will not remain confidential after they die. A cautious client may well respond by withholding information that is necessary to effective representation by the lawyer. To be sure, the degree to which attorney-client confidences may be chilled by the creation of this or any other exception to the privilege cannot be21 See FED. R. EVID. 501 (providing that federal common law of privilege governs in federal courts except where state law provides the substantive rule of decision on a claim or defense in a civil action).24. measured; but this Court has never demanded proof that disclosure will have a quantifiable adverse effect. See, e.g., Upjohn, supra; Jaffee v. Redmond, supra. It suffices that the same "reason and experience" that led to the recognition of the privilege in the first instance indicate that it should remain applicable to the communications at issue here.There are undoubtedly many thousands of people who live in the expectation of death and who want, and would benefit from, legal advice about matters that are personally embarrassing at the least and that might have even more serious consequences for surviving loved ones and friends. As Judge Tatel correctly observed in his dissenting opinion, the assurance of confidentiality that can be given by lawyers to such clients under the rule adopted by the panel below is tenuous. Indeed, even clients who have no particular reason to believe that they will soon die must, under the D.C. Circuit's ruling, contemplate the possibility that their confidences may be revealed in the event of their death, which, even if not imminent, is certainly inevitable. Mindful that "[a]n uncertain privilege ... is little better than no privilege at all," Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 393, this Court should reject the D.C. Circuit's new exception.In sum, the D.C. Circuit's newly created exception to the attorney-client privilege is consistent neither with settled precedents nor with any discernible "current trends in the law," United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 570 (1989), and it would "place the policy of protecting open and legitimate disclosure between attorneys and clients at undue risk." Id. at 571. This Court should therefore "decline to adopt it as part of the developing federal common law of evidentiary privileges," because it "does not comport with 'reason and experience.' " Id. at 574.25. II. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DENYING OPINION WORK-PRODUCTSTATUS TO ATTORNEY NOTES OF STATEMENTS MADE IN AN INITIAL CLIENT CONSULTATION The D.C. Circuit's equally unprecedented denial of opinion work-product protection to an attorney's notes of an initial client interview fundamentally misconceives this Court's precedents concerning the work-product doctrine, by arbitrarily singling out a subset of the category of core, opinion work product and denying it the heightened protection to which it is entitled under longstanding decisions of this Court. The Court has repeatedly emphasized " '[t]he strong public policy' underlying the work-product doctrine." Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 398. The policy was fully articulated in the Court's opinion in Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 510- 11 (1947): In performing his various duties, ... it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel. Proper preparation of a client's case demands that he assemble information, sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts, prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference.... This work is reflected, of course, in interviews, statements, memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions, personal beliefs, and countless other tangible and intangible ways--aptly though roughly termed ... the "work product of the lawyer." Were such materials open to opposing counsel on mere demand, much of what is now put in writing would remain unwritten. An attorney's thoughts, heretofore inviolate, would not be his own.26. The work-product doctrine originated in the civil discovery dispute decided by the Court in Hickman, and it has been most fully codified in the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. But it is equally applicable--and perhaps more critically important--in federal criminal matters. As the Court explained in United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238 (1975): Although the work-product doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to discovery in civil litigation, its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice system is even more vital. The interests of society and the accused in obtaining a fair and accurate resolution of the question of guilt or innocence demand that adequate safeguards assure the thorough preparation and presentation of each side of the case. 22 Consistent with Hickman 's emphasis on maintaining the attorney's thoughts "inviolate," the work-product doctrine provides special protection for "opinion work product"--work product that reveals the attorney's own thoughts. "At its core, the work-product doctrine shelters the mental processes of the attorney, providing a privileged area within which he can analyze and prepare his client's case." Nobles, 422 U.S. at 238. Work product in this core area, unlike non-opinion work product, "cannot be disclosed simply on a showing of22 Nobles concerned the application of the work-product doctrine in a federal criminal trial. It is equally "clear that discovery by the government in grand jury proceedings is subject to the work-product protection." EPSTEIN, supra, at 295; see also, e.g., In re Sealed Case, 676 F.2d 793, 810-11 (D.C.Cir.1982) (holding work-product doctrine applicable in grand jury proceedings); In re Grand Jury Investigation, 599 F.2d 1224, 1228 (3d Cir.1979) (same); In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 599 F.2d 504, 509 (2d Cir.1979) (same); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 473 F.2d 840, 842-43 (8th Cir.1973) (same).27. substantial need and inability to obtain the equivalent without undue hardship." Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 401.Notes of an attorney's interviews with witnesses have long been at the heart of this Court's definition of opinion work product. As the Court explained in Upjohn, "[f]orcing an attorney to disclose notes and memoranda of witnesses' oral statements is particularly disfavored because it tends to reveal the attorney's mental processes.... " 449 U.S. at 399. In a much-cited passage in his concurring opinion in Hickman, Justice Jackson noted that compelling disclosure of such notes, reflecting the attorney's "language, permeated with his inferences," would be "demoralizing to the Bar" in the extreme. 329 U.S. at 516-17. Thus, the Court held in Upjohn, "[i]t is clear that this is the sort of material ... deserving special protection." 449 U.S. at 400.The D.C. Circuit majority sought to evade this principle by creating a special exception for notes of an initial client interview. But the court's view that such writings--unlike notes of other witness interviews--reflect few of the attorney's own thoughts and opinions does not accord with the experience of practicing lawyers. The court's conception of the lawyer as merely a passive recipient of information in an initial interview misses the mark. Experienced practitioners recognize the initial interview as a critical stage in the representation of the client, in the course of which a skillful lawyer plays an important role in eliciting pertinent information and beginning to give shape to the goals and strategies to be pursued in the matter. 23This Court emphasized in Upjohn that "[t]he first step in the resolution of any legal problem is ascertaining the factual background and sifting through the facts with an eye to the23 See FRED LANE, LANE GOLDSTEIN TRIAL TECHNIQUE § 1.03, at 3 (3d ed. 1997).28. legally relevant." 449 U.S. at 390-91 (emphasis added). Accordingly, lawyers in the initial interview begin to "assess[ ] the truth and accuracy of a client's story based upon her comments, manner, delivery and gestures,"24 guide the discussion toward facts and issues they perceive to be relevant, and discuss possible alternative courses of action to be pursued. A good lawyer's conduct of such an interview reflects recognition that "[t]he initial interview can set the tone for the entire case,"25 and that the objective is "to identify the client's hidden agenda" so that the lawyer may "address the most critical matters immediately and design [the lawyer's] overall approach around the client's particular needs."26 The lawyer's notes taken in this process necessarily reflect not only the way he or she has helped shape the interview, but also the lawyer's professional judgment about the relative importance of the various subjects discussed.The D.C. Circuit's denial of opinion work-product status to the notes in this case thus represents a significant breach in the protection afforded to lawyers' thoughts and mental impressions formed in anticipation of litigation. A predictable result of such a rule would be, as the Court observed in Hickman, that "much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten." 329 U.S. at 511. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a rule making such materials readily discoverable would stop at written notes. Indeed, if the Independent Counsel is successful in obtaining counsel's notes, can anyone doubt that the next step will be a subpoena directing the attorney to appear before the grand jury to24 LANE, supra, § 1.07, at 5. 25 NOELLE C. NELSON, CONNECTING WITH YOUR CLIENT 1 (ABA Sec. of Law Practice Management 1996). 26 STANLEY S. CLAWAR, YOU & YOUR CLIENTS: A GUIDE TO CLIENT MANAGEMENT SKILLS FOR A MORE SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE (ABA Gen. Practice Sec. 2d ed. 1996).29. identify them, explain and interpret them, vouch for their accuracy, and add his own recollections and mental impressions of what his client told him in the interview? It is difficult to perceive a logical stopping-point to the probing of the attorney's mental impressions once it has begun.Again, Justice Jackson's words aptly capture the potential impact of such an inquest into the lawyer's thoughts:The primary effect of the practice advocated here would be on the legal profession itself. But it too often is overlooked that the lawyer and the law office are indispensable parts of our administration of justice. Law-abiding people can go nowhere else to learn the ever changing and constantly multiplying rules by which they must behave and to obtain redress for their wrongs. The welfare and tone of the legal profession is therefore of prime consequence to society, which would feel the consequences of such a practice ... secondarily but certainly.Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. at 514-15 (Jackson, J., concurring). CONCLUSIONThe issues decided in the court below are of grave concern to the legal profession. As one observer has written:Lawyers fret that the protections of the attorney-client privilege and the work-product immunity are being eroded. The fear is hardly surprising. Of all the evidentiary and discovery rules, these two go to the heart of both the lawyer's relationship with a client and the lawyer's jealously guarded right to develop litigation strategies without fear of compelled disclosure to an adversary.2727 EPSTEIN, supra, at 450.30.Ultimately, however, the interests at issue are not those of lawyers, but of their clients, whose legitimate right to obtain legal services the privilege and the work-product doctrine are designed to protect. The decision of the D.C. Circuit in this case substantially erodes the scope of the attorneyclient privilege and work-product protections as applied in the federal courts, with significant practical consequences for attorneys and their clients nationwide. This Court should restore the proper balance by reversing the decision of the court of appeals.Respectfully submitted, Jerome J. Shestack , President* American Bar Association William H.

The ABA respectfully asserts that JLWOP cannot comport with this Court's conclusions in Roper concerning the lesser culpability of juvenile offenders, and therefore, should not be permissible under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.LBASED ON THE REAL TIME THEJUVENILE OFFENDER IS LIKELY TOSPEND IN PRISON, JLWOP SHOULDBE CONSIDERED "GROSSLYDISPROPORTIONATE" UNDER THISCOURT'S JURISPRUDENCE.Based on "the length of the prison term in real time, i.e., the time that the offender is likely to actually spend in prison," Ewing v. California, 538 U.S. 11, 37 (2003) (Breyer, J., dissenting), JLWOP should be found to be "grossly disproportionate" under this Court's jurisprudence.As this Court has stated, "The Eighth Amendment does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence. Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime." Hwing, 538 U.S. at 23 (quoting Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 1001 (1991) Gnternal quotation marks and citation omitted)). As the Ewing Court stated, "The Eighth Amendment... contains a `narrow proportionality principle' that `applies to noncapital sentences." Id. at 20 (quoting Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 997 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)). The proportionality standard, further, has been applied "to terms of years in a series ofcases beginning with Rummel v. Estelle, [445 U.S.268 (1980)]." Id. at 20."Real time" in the case of JLWOP is, by definition, the rest of the juvenile's life, barring executive commutation. In Ewing, an adult was sentenced to 25 years to life under California's "three strikes" law, under which there was apossibility of parole. In affirming the sentence, Justice O'Connor noted that "federal courts shouldbe reluctant to review legislatively mandated terms of imprisonment, and that successful challenges tothe proportionality of particular sentences shouldbe exceedingly rare." Ewing, 538 U.S. at 22 (quoting Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370, 374 (1982) (per curiam)). Justice O'Connor then compared Rummel, in which the defendant had received lifein prison with the possibility of parole, with Solemv. Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983), in which an adultwas sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole, but with the possibility of executivecommutation.Justice O'Connor stated that Solem had setout three factors that may be relevant indeterminingwhethera _ sentenceis sodisproportionate that it violates the EighthAmendment: "(i) the gravity of the offense and theharshness of the penalty; (ii) the sentences imposedon other criminals in the same jurisdiction; andGiii) the sentences imposed for commission of thesame crime in other jurisdictions." Id. at 22(quoting Solem, 463 U.S. at 292).However, as Justice Breyer noted in his dissent, "The one critical difference that explains the difference in outcome [in Rummel and Solem]-9.tUCpirdsh.eaoeeSarufl.torehltSneeod;talaitlhnemeateminn2d.'2g"staShnso(dplOseJeo'dcefm.CiRn,fotutinehmcannetaimoctlreell,3ydli9ik.deinlJsyn.o)enctonTletpth.ud(readsintetscadtoeSthnseiei)esn,.gttcheaeoilrnntsmhto,arpRtaomussEetmswtaimhibseenibulgler,i,tSetwoydel5ete3hnmi8oenfAlthough most juvenile offenders are notsentencedfor these JLWOPunder recidivist statutes, the rationalestatutes supports the conclusion that should be found to be "grosslydisproportionate."

Jd. at 567.6 Because of the8 As the Roper Court stated, there are three general differences between juveniles and adults that demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders: (1) a lack of maturity and underdeveloped sense of responsibility; (2) vulnerability or susceptibility to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure; and (3) the character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult. [footnote continued]-1l-diminished capacity of juveniles, the Court concluded that "it is evident that the penological justifications for the death penalty apply to them with lesser force than to adults." Jd. at 571.In the view of the ABA, the Court's analysis in Roper applies with equal force to JUWOP, which is now the most severe penalty that may be imposed on a juvenile.? Because the "signature qualities of youth are transient," Roper, 543 U.S. at 570, citing Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 368The resulting "diminished culpability of juveniles" is therefore based on the conclusions that (1) their irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult; (2) their vulnerability and lack of control over their immediate surroundings mean they have a greater claim than adults to be forgiven for failing to escape negative influences in their environment; and (3) their struggle to define their identity means it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved character. As the Roper Court concluded:From a moral standpoint it would be misguided to equate the failings of a minor with those of an adult, for the greater possibility exists that a minor's character deficiencies will be reformed. Indeed, "[tjhe relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are transient: as individuals mature, the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside." Roper, 543 U.S. at 569-70 (quoting Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 368 (1993)). 7 The ABA suggests that JLWOP also be reviewed as an evolving standard by considering (1) a review of objective indicia of consensus, and (2) the exercise of the Court's own independent judgment.

Here, however, the absence of evidence of deterrent effect is of special concern because the same characteristics that render juveniles less culpable than adults suggest as well that juveniles will be less susceptible to deterrence." Jd. at 571, citing Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 998-99 (1991) (Kennedy, J. concurring).?9 Although the Roper Court noted that, to the extent the juvenile death penalty might have a residual deterrent effect, JLWOP "is itself a severe sanction, in particular for a young person," id. at 572, studies indicate that there appears to be no significant difference in deterrence between a juvenile death penalty and JLWOP. See, e.g., MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice, IssuE BRIEF 8: "Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence," available at http://www.adjj.org/downloads/ 6093issue_brief_3.pdf (last visited July 19, 2009) (concluding that juveniles' "lack of foresight, along with their tendency to pay more attention to immediate gratification than to longterm consequences, are among the factors that may lead them to make bad decisions").-14-aotjstvbst.upruhuevarpprceen5opToa,ns7eoruuii3xrtsgleatuehmensTnot(a,hi",uyIet"tttmy"5hatei0bhpRyse9aeeofdonpdruoeijsUllbfrues.efto,vrrSiigheev.cgnioeeunicaodlv5alatda43tel3l5'utu0wshre,aharveUgtneeeo.idannaSo3tcl.n6oq8.ifnuionottaarttftolio(iin1seiStu59exniso7e9epeclod0d3dseca,e)irp,tRetaotaeccygprioii.eeftpmntthrisciai,nyatsnwgycpieiohoaHtd5uoncdJho4tlo,ioow3ehotuhetsgathnvittUasoesi.tonratoSaorsn,bn.nteeato differentiate between the juvenile offenderwhose crime reflects unfortunate yet transientimmaturity, and the rare juvenile offendercrime reflects irreparable corruption").whosehJRrpieeeLshntWaouOdblriioPnslg.siiFetcinanatatilsFli,uloiyrnng,tobhaHyleiasrJr,moLtfedoWelarfOsirienPenh,sitattubairito5lnien0si,d1tatnthbUoiey.tonSon.tJ.oufssafuttepipTnpcohd1oesee0rs2rti8Mb:eoaldbtreojsehcsbtaoyiulcvinleedtteyhir.oenfoodatrmpiBrhtaeueuemarrhttscptrooaewtarlecbreuehiiirti]saolsehgebuireonhiestcnsdslaetmopite[eutiasannvatoteitnnhismynaoahoatnntenwaddfcdiuootaef_nrnhvstca`soeotottcicnuhiirrridetooieeyennmttpr,ayiprual'tneirthsarbsepilpueooetntdrntihtepctsreoeitooannnsenttcsrodteoieormufrbs,cieie'stsnlrnwetioaethfrttfeoviyisonlelorlcimnisyefonoeafId.

JLWOP fails on both counts.I. NEITHER THE PUBLIC SAFETY NOR PENAL OBJECTIVES WOULD BE COMPROMISED BY PERMITTING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PAROLE.Because the parole process has safeguards to protect the public, as well as recognized law enforcement and rehabilitative functions, neitherthe safety of society nor the objectives of the penal system would be compromised by permitting juvenile offenders the opportunity to be consideredfor parole.As this Court and commentators have recognized, the parole system includes significantrehabilitative, law enforcement and cost controlfunctions.E.g.

Rather, states impose conditions and restrictions on parolees. States may require the offenders to complete in-prison rehabilitation programs before releasing them on parole.!6 Once(explaining that decisions for Michigan prisoners serving life sentences must be made by a majority of all ten members of the Parole Board, rather than a majority of the three member panel considering parole for other offenders). 13 See Office of Justice Programs, Dep't of Justice, Characteristics of State Parole Supervising Agencies (2006), http://www.ojp.usdo}j.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cspsa06.pdf (last visited July 20, 2009) (reporting 54% of adult parole inmates in 15 states were denied request for release on parole). 14 Massachusetts, for example, provides that if parole is not granted at the initial parole release hearing, a parole review hearing occurs for most inmates annually thereafter, except where parole board members act to cause a review at an earlier time. Offenders sentenced as habitual criminals, committed as sexually dangerous persons or serving life sentences require subsequent hearings 2, 3 and 5 years, respectively, after the initial parole release hearing. 120 CMR. 301.01 (2009). 13 See, e.g., http://w ww.cdcr.ca/gov/Parole/Life_Parole_ Process/Index.html (last visited, July 21, 2009). 16 See, e.g., 37 Tex.

Gagnon v. Scarpelli,411 US. 778, 789 (1973). Therefore, a state's ability to revoke parole based on even a procedural violation of parole conditions often is far easier, and requires a far lower burden of proof, than an adjudication on the underlying offense.In contrast, for JLWOP sentences, the juvenile offenders will spend their lives in prison without having the opportunity to even be considered for parole. The ABA is not asserting that all juveniles serving JLWOP sentences will establish, at some point in their sentence, that they are entitled to parole. The ABA is asserting, however, that they should not be denied that opportunity.It is undeniable that some juvenile offenders commit heinous crimes. However, as the Roper Court stated, "An unacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality or cold-blooded nature of any particular crime would overpower mitigating arguments based on youth as a matter of course, even where the juvenile offender's objective immaturity, vulnerability, and lack of true depravity should require a sentence less severe than death." 543 U.S. at 573.For the same reasons, the ABA submits that the courts and juries should not be permitted to impose JLWOP. Rather, the decision as to the appropriateness -- or inappropriateness -- of parole for juvenile offenders should be made at reasonable points in their sentences, based on the adults they have become.- 20-IV. REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITIES DEMONSTRATES OVERWHELMING OPPOSITION TO JLWOP. The Roper Court stated that its conclusionthat the juvenile death penalty was a disproportionate sentence found "confirmation in the stark reality that the United States is the only country in the world that continues to give official sanction to the juvenile death penalty." Jd. at 575. The Court noted that, while this was not controlling, the Court had referred to the laws of other countries and to international authorities as instructive for its interpretation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of "cruel and unusual punishments." Id. (citing Trop, 356 U.S. at 102-03 (plurality opinion)).Similarly, if the Court chooses to consider the laws of other countries and international authorities concerning JLWOP, the review will demonstrate an overwhelming opposition to JLWOP.For example, as of 2005, only thirteen countries outside the United States had laws that theoretically permitted such a sentence, and there were perhaps only a dozen individuals serving sentences of JUWOP in three countries outside of the United States. Human Rights Watch & Amnesty Int'l, The Rest of Their Lives: Life Without Parole for Child Offenders in the United States, at 5 (2005) (hereinafter, "Human Rights Watch Report"). The numbers have continued to decline, as some of those countries have changed their laws and practices in the past three years to either-21-abolish the sentence or permit some review of an imposed sentence. Connie De La Vega and Michelle Leighton, Sentencing Our Children to Die in Prison: Global Law and Practice, 42 Univ. S.F. L. Rev. 983, 1004-05 (Aug. 11, 2008) ("De La Vega and Leighton"); Illinois Coalition for the Fair Sentencing of Children, Categorically Less Culpable: Children Sentenced to Life Without Parole in Illinois (2008).Further, the Convention on the Rights of the Child ("CRC") prohibits both the juvenile death penalty and JUWOP. Human Rights Watch Report at 98 (2005) (citing CRC, art. 37(a)). The CRC also requires states to consider "the desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and the child's assuming a constructive role in society." Jd. (citing CRC, art. 40.1). As of 2005, 192 out of 194 countries were parties; the United States and Somalia are the two countries that have not ratified the CRC, although both have signed it. Id. at 99.Moreover, in 1996, the European Court of Human Rights declared JLWOP illegal under Article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which forbids "inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." Hussain v. United Kingdom, 22 EHRR 1, { 53 (1996) (citing The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms), The Hussain decision is binding on the forty-seven European nations that have signed and ratified the convention.20 Available at http://www.conventions.coe.int.- 29.In April 2004, the Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution which urged states to abolish JUWOP. See Human Rights Watch Reportat 107 (2005).In December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly, by a vote of 185 to one (the United States being the lone opposition vote) passed a resolution calling upon nations to abolish the juvenile death penalty and JLWOP. De LaVega and Leighton at 1012 (citing Rights of the Child, G.A., Res. 61/146, § 31(a), U.N. Doe. A/Res/61/146 (Dec. 19, 2006)).Finally, just last year, the United NationsCommittee on the Elimination of RacialDiscrimination, to which the United States is aparty,determinedthattheraciallydisproportionate impact of JUWOP in the UnitedStates warranted recommending abolishing thesentence.

I. Claim Construction Involves Numerous Underlying Findings of FactIn Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., this Court explained that claim construction is a mixed issue, "somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple historical fact." Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 388 (1996). Because claim construction is a "mongrel practice" with "evidentiary underpinnings," this Court has never viewed it as anything but a mixed question of fact and law. Id. at 378, 390; see also Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 443 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (characterizing Markman as an opinion about a mixed issue of law and fact).Notwithstanding this Court's teachings, the Federal Circuit in Cybor held that claim construction is "purely [a] legal question." Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1456. Nearly two decades later, the en banc Federal Circuit reconsidered and reaffirmed this holding. See Lighting Ballast, 744 F.3d at 1284 ("Claim construction is a legal statement of the scope of the patent right . . . ."). In these cases, the Federal Circuit reasoned that claim construction does not turn on an assessment of extrinsic evidence or witness credibility, but is instead determined by interpretation of "the patent documents" as a matter of law. Id. at 1284; see also Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1454. Even within the Federal Circuit, however, this basic premise has been a long-standing source of disagreement. See, e.g., Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1330-34 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (Mayer, J., dissenting) ("Now more than ever I am convinced of the futility, indeed the absurdity, of this court's persistence in adhering to7the falsehood that claim construction is a matter of law devoid of any factual component . . . . We should abandon this unsound course."); Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1475 (Rader, J., dissenting) (by claiming district courts do not rely upon extrinsic evidence in making claim construction determinations, the Federal Circuit "`knowingly enters a land of sophistry and fiction'" (citation omitted)); see also Amgen, Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., 469 F.3d 1039, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (Michel, C.J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) ("[I]n light of our eight years of experience with [the] application" of the Cybor rule of de novo review, "I have come to believe that reconsideration is appropriate and revision may be advisable.").Indeed, claim construction necessarily involves many subsidiary factual determinations, even without the consideration of extrinsic evidence. For instance, claim construction first requires a court to determine the date and field of the invention in light of the evidence presented. See, e.g., Seal-Flex, Inc. v. Athletic Track & Court Constr., 98 F.3d 1318, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("The trier of fact must determine whether the invention was completed . . . or whether the inventor was continuing to develop and evaluate the invention . . . . When these material facts are at issue, summary disposition is negated."); see also Lighting Ballast, 744 F.3d at 1306, 1316 (O'Malley, J., dissenting). It also requires the district court to weigh evidence and make a record of various other threshold assessments, including the state of the art, who qualifies as a person of ordinary skill in the art and how such a person would understand the claims in question. See ABA, IPL Section, A Section White Paper: Agenda for 21st Century Patent Reform at 43-44 (2010) (listing the facts8underlying claim construction).7 In addition, claim construction demands a number of factual determinations when parsing "the patent documents," such as analyzing the specification to determine whether it contains embodiments, definitions or references relevant to the claim term, and assessing whether the patent's disclosure affects the plain meaning of the claims. See United States v. Adams, 383 U.S. 39, 49 (1966) ("[I]t is fundamental that claims are to be construed in light of the specifications."); see also CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp., 288 F.3d 1359, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("[T]he claim term will not receive its ordinary meaning if the patentee acted as his own lexicographer."). Factual determinations are also required to assess whether the patent owner7 Available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ administrative/intellectual_property_law/advocacy/ white_paper_sept_2010_revision.authcheckdam.pdf. Although not presented to the ABA House of Delegates for adoption as ABA policy, this White Paper sets out the IPL Section's views on patent law reform issues. In it, the Section recommends that at least the following questions should be characterized as findings of fact related to claim construction: (i) who qualifies as a person of ordinary skill in the art; (ii) what was the state of the art at the time of the invention (the scope and content of the prior art); (iii) the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue; (iv) how a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand a claim term; (v) how a claim term is used in the written description portion of the specification of the patent; (vi) how a claim term is used in the prosecution history of the patent (how one of ordinary skill in the art would understand statements made by the applicant during prosecution); (vii) how a claim term is used in the prior art; (viii) what relevant texts, including dictionaries and treatises, say about the meaning of the claim term; and (ix) what experts in the art say about the meaning of a claim term. Id. at 34.9disclaimed any claim scope during prosecution and to determine the differences between the prior art and the claimed invention.8 See Omega Eng'g, Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("[P]rosecution disclaimer . . . narrows the ordinary meaning of the claim congruent with the scope of the surrender."). This Court has made clear that such preliminary determinations are "matter[s] of fact." See Great N. Ry. Co. v. Merchs' Elevator Co., 259 U.S. 285, 291-92 (1922) (noting that the construction of a contract is a matter of law with a number of underlying factual inquiries); Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383 U.S. 1, 17 (1966) ("While the ultimate question of . . . validity is one of law," obviousness "lends itself to several basic factual inquiries.").When extrinsic evidence is considered in claim construction determinations, trial courts are tasked with further fact-finding duties. First, courts must perform a gatekeeping role, assessing whether extrinsic evidence such as dictionaries, treatises or expert testimony would assist in the interpretation of the claim term.9 See, e.g.,8 In this case, the district court engaged in such factual inquiries when construing the term "molecular weight." See Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 723 F.3d 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2013), cert. granted, 134 S. Ct. 1761 (2014). Specifically, the district court determined the field of the invention and defined the level of ordinary skill in the art. Id. at 1367-70. The court also considered whether the specification provided evidence in favor of a particular construction of the claim phrase at issue and weighed allegations that the patent owner made inconsistent statements during prosecution. Id.9 The district court in this case relied upon the testimony of Petitioners' expert, Dr. Grant, in making its determination. Teva Pharms., 723 F.3d at 1369-71.10Neomagic Corp. v. Trident Microsystems, Inc., 287 F.3d 1062, 1074 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("[O]n the record before us . . . we think that this [claim construction] matter can only be resolved by further evidentiary hearings, including expert testimony."). If such extrinsic evidence is admitted, courts must assess its weight, determine witnesses' (including expert witnesses') credibility and balance controverting evidence. See Lighting Ballast, 744 F.3d at 1316 (O'Malley, J., dissenting).Moreover, claim construction hearings often involve the development of a detailed factual record, including the receipt of live testimony. Markman proceedings--roughly equivalent to a bench trial on a specific issue--are often held "live . . . with argument and testimony, sometimes covering several days." Retractable Techs., Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 659 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (O'Malley, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). By providing a forum for "weighing all the [intrinsic and extrinsic] evidence bearing on claim construction . . . and assess[ing it] accordingly," Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1319, Markman hearings provide the basis for the factual findings that necessarily underpin a district court's claim construction.II. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6), Findings of Fact Must Not Be Set Aside Unless Clearly ErroneousPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6), a district court's "[f]indings of fact" cannot be overturned on appeal unless they are deemed "clearly erroneous." Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6). Rule 52 applies to appellate review of any findings of fact made without a jury, regardless of the kind of11proceeding or the type of evidence involved. See, e.g., United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 394-95 (1948) (Rule 52(a) applies to "all actions tried upon the facts without a jury."); Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 287 (1982) (Rule 52(a) "does not make exceptions or purport to exclude certain categories of factual findings."); see also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 498 (1984) (reiterating that Rule 52(a) "means what it says"). In patent cases, the underlying factual determinations made during claim construction should therefore be reviewed under a "clearly erroneous" standard. See Lauren Maida, Patent Claim Construction: It's Not A Pure Matter of Law, So Why Isn't the Federal Circuit Giving District Courts the Deference They Deserve?, 30 Cardozo L. Rev. 1773, 1803 (2009) ("Rule 52(a) is an appropriate standard [for factual findings underlying claim construction] because it would ensure that the district court is the first and only trial court.").Notably, neither Cybor nor Lighting Ballast grapples with the impact of Rule 52(a). Instead, both opinions characterize claim construction as a purely legal question. As this Court noted in Markman, however, claim construction is a mixed issue of law and fact. Markman, 517 U.S. at 388. As a hybrid inquiry, claim construction therefore demands a hybrid standard of review: Rule 52(a)'s deferential "clear error" assessment for underlying findings of fact, and de novo review for the ultimate issue of claim construction. This tiered review comports with this Court's precedent, which routinely asks appellate courts to distinguish between findings of fact and conclusions of law, and apply a different standard of review to each, on appeal. See, e.g., Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Grp., Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 440 n.14 (2001)12(holding that application of the Gore test for punitive damages is reviewed de novo but noting that the "Court of Appeals should defer to the District Court's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous"); Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996) (holding that "determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed de novo on appeal," but "findings of historical fact [should] only [be reviewed] for clear error").This Court's obviousness precedent further supports "clear error" review for findings of fact made during claim construction. In Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, this Court noted that "[w]hile the ultimate question of . . . validity is one of law," obviousness "lends itself to several basic factual inquiries." 383 U.S. at 17. The factual questions this Court identified bear a striking resemblance to the factual questions underlying claim construction, and include: (i) the level of skill in the art, (ii) the scope and content of the prior art and (iii) differences between the prior art and the claims at issue. See id. In an obviousness inquiry, these underlying factual determinations are subject to Rule 52(a). See Dennison Mfg. Co. v. Panduit Corp., 475 U.S. 809, 811 (1986) (per curiam). Those same factual findings should likewise be subject to "clear error" review in the claim construction context.III. Public and Judicial Policy Considerations Demand Deference to a District Court's Findings of FactWhen the subsection "Setting Aside Factual Findings" was added to Rule 52(a), the drafters of the rule were careful to counsel against de novo review of findings of fact:13[T]he public interest in . . . stability and judicial economy . . . would be promoted by recognizing that the trial court, not the appellate tribunal, should be the finder of . . . facts. To permit courts of appeals to share more actively in the fact-finding function would tend to undermine the legitimacy of the district courts in the eyes of litigants, multiply appeals by encouraging appellate retrial of some factual issues, and needlessly reallocate judicial authority.Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) advisory committee's note (1985 amendment). By rejecting clear error review, the Federal Circuit's decisions in Cybor and Lighting Ballast have resulted in a reversal of the traditional allocation of labor between trial and appellate courts, a high reversal rate and resulting lack of predictability at the Federal Circuit and longer and more costly litigations. See J. Jonas Anderson & Peter S. Menell, Informal Deference: A Historical, Empirical, and Normative Analysis of Patent Claim Construction, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1, 70 (2014) ("The private and social costs of the de novo standard of review . . . manifest in various ways: lower quality decision-making at both the trial and appellate levels, higher costs of litigation . . . greater uncertainty . . . longer case pendency and . . . fewer and delayed settlements." (footnote omitted)); see also Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1473-78 (Rader, J., dissenting); Amgen, 469 F.3d at 1040 (Michel, C.J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Both decisions should be overruled.14A. District Courts Are Better Positioned to Make Findings of FactDistrict courts are better equipped to make findings of fact, and those findings should receive deference on appeal. See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 402 (1990) ("Familiar with the issues and the litigants, the district court is better situated than the court of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the fact-dependent legal standard."); Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 233 (1991) ("[D]eferential review of mixed questions of law and fact is warranted when it appears the district court is `better positioned' . . . to decide the issue." (citation omitted)). The factual findings underlying claim construction are no exception."In addition to compromising the care and logic that comes from building a factual record and preparing a reasoned opinion . . . . de novo review [requires] an independent review of an anemic record--typically limited to the intrinsic evidence." Anderson & Menell, Informal Deference, supra, at 69. Indeed, when examining the meaning of a claim, "[t]he district court has the opportunity to see and hear . . . testimony first hand, along with the accompanying gestures, exhibits, charts, and models. This gives the district court a better opportunity to grasp the nature of the invention." Maida, Patent Claim Construction, supra, at 1797 (footnote omitted); see also Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1477 (Rader, J., dissenting) (The "[t]rial judge[] can spend hundreds of hours reading and rereading all kinds of source material, receiving tutorials . . . formally questioning technical experts . . . and deliberating over the claim language."). "[T]he trial court is [therefore] better, that is, more accurate, by way of both position and practice, at finding facts15than appellate judges." Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1334 (Mayer, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original); see also Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1478 (Rader, J., dissenting) (Appellate judges must rely on the "sterile written record" that "can never convey all the nuances and intangibles of the decisional process."); Lighting Ballast, 744 F.3d at 1311 (O'Malley, J., dissenting) (De novo review "`deprives th[is] court, and the parties, of the accumulated progress and experience of the trial [judge] . . . and leaves us . . . with an expurgated record and generally inferior basis of decision.'" (citation omitted)).Moreover, abandoning de novo review of district court fact-finding poses little risk of disrupting national uniformity in claim construction, as the Federal Circuit has suggested. See Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1455 (arguing that de novo review will "provid[e] national uniformity to the construction of . . . patent claim[s]"). "[T]he claim construction issues presented in patent cases are mostly fact and case specific," and "will provide little guidance on the words used in different patents." Lighting Ballast, 744 F.3d at 1314 (O'Malley, J., dissenting); see also 6-18B Donald S. Chisum, Chisum on Patents § 18.07[1] at 18-1188 (2014) ("Court decisions interpreting and applying language in particular patent claims cannot create controlling precedent for the interpretation and application of other patents' claims to varying products and processes . . . ."). Moreover, even when the same patent is litigated in multiple jurisdictions, district courts have an array of tools, including consolidation, transfer, schedule coordination or even stays, to help avoid inconsistent rulings. Deferring on factual questions to district court determinations thus should not affect the goal of greater national uniformity.16B. De Novo Review Has Led to a Lack of Predictability on AppealDe novo review has also had another deleterious impact: a consistently high reversal rate for district court claim construction decisions at the Federal Circuit. By some estimates, this rate has ranged anywhere from 30-50%. See Jay P. Kesan & Gwendolyn G. Ball, Judicial Experience and the Efficiency and Accuracy of Patent Adjudication: An Empirical Analysis of the Case for a Specialized Patent Trial Court, 24 Harv. J.L. & Tech. 393, 434 (2011) (citing claim construction reversal rates between 40-50%); Maida, Patent Claim Construction, supra, at 1773 ("The rate of Federal Circuit reversals of district court claim constructions is as high as fifty percent."); David L. Schwartz, Practice Makes Perfect? An Empirical Study of Claim Construction Reversal Rates in Patent Cases, 107 Mich. L. Rev. 223, 240 (2008) (citing a 38.8% rate for "cases with at least 1 wrongly construed term").10 Indeed, even after the Federal Circuit's en banc decision in Phillips v. AWH Corp. in 2005, which provided a clearer framework for appellate review of claim construction and led to fewer reversals overall, the reversal rate has remained notably high, particularly when compared to other areas of federal practice. See, e.g., Anderson & Menell,10 See also Kimberly A. Moore, Markman Eight Years Later: Is Claim Construction More Predictable?, 9 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 231, 233, 236 (2005) (citing a 34.5% reversal rate); Christian A. Chu, Empirical Analysis of the Federal Circuit's Claim Construction Trends, 16 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1075, 1112 (2001) (citing a reversal rate as high as 51% for summary judgment decisions on claim construction).17Informal Deference, supra, at 6 (noting that "[t]he reversal rate on a per-case basis" after Phillips is 31.6%); Ted Sichelman, Myths of (Un)Certainty at the Federal Circuit, 43 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 1161, 1174 (2010) ("[O]n an issue-by-issue basis, the Federal Circuit reverses lower court claim construction rulings much more than most other issues.").This high rate of reversal has also created a perception among litigants that claim construction is often dependent on the particular panel a litigant receives. See Donald R. Dunner, A Retrospective of the Federal Circuit's First 25 Years, 17 Fed. Cir. B.J. 127, 130 (2008) (noting many believe "that Federal Circuit predictability is not what it should be and that its decisions are often panel-dependent and result-oriented"); R. Polk Wagner & Lee Petherbridge, Is the Federal Circuit Succeeding? An Empirical Assessment of Judicial Performance, 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1105, 1112 (2004) ("Our findings . . . indicate that claim construction at the Federal Circuit is panel dependent."); see also Retractable Techs., 659 F.3d at 1370 (Moore, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) ("Commentators have observed that claim construction appeals . . . lead[] to frustrating and unpredictable results."); Kesan & Ball, Judicial Experience, supra, at 413 (noting that "the composition of the panel hearing the case can have an impact on the decision"). Increasing the level of deference afforded to district courts' factual findings would alleviate these concerns by focusing Federal Circuit review on the legal aspects of claim construction, and allowing the Court of Appeals to provide "practical guidance [to patent drafters and litigants] regarding how [a] claim construction dispute might be resolved." Lighting Ballast, 744 F.3d at 1302 (O'Malley, J., dissenting).18C. De Novo Review Has Increased the Length and Cost of Patent LitigationUnder Cybor, "`the trial court's . . . claim interpretation provides no . . . certainty at all, but only opens [up] the bidding.'" Lighting Ballast, 744 F.3d at 1313 (O'Malley, J., dissenting) (citation omitted). In fact, under the current system of de novo review:To get a certain claim interpretation, parties must go past the district court's Markman . . . proceeding, past the entirety of discovery, past the entire trial on the merits, past post trial motions, past briefing and argument to the Federal Circuit-- indeed past every step in the entire course of federal litigation, except Supreme Court review.Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1476 (Rader, J., dissenting). Indeed, as noted above, by some estimates, in 3050% of cases, even Federal Circuit review has not ended the story. In those cases, the Court of Appeal's reinterpretation of the claims typically leads to a remand for new proceedings, which can involve further discovery, renewed motion practice and a new trial. See Maida, Patent Claim Construction, supra, at 1784 (a de novo standard can lead to duplicative proceedings, and often "requires a second trial on the issue of infringement"); see also, e.g., AFG Indus., Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co., 375 F.3d 1367, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (Newman, J., dissenting) (remanding "for the third time on . . . claim construction").19This tortuous system upsets the parties' ex ante expectations of predictability in the enforcement of patents, "and undo[es] a tremendous amount of . . . work in the process." Lighting Ballast, 744 F.3d at 1310 (O'Malley, J., dissenting); see also Maida, Patent Claim Construction, supra, at 1792-93 ("[S]ome suggest that perhaps [district] judges should not even bother to `waste their limited resources' on a thorough claim construction analysis." (citation omitted)). Moreover, by postponing certainty until the end of the litigation process, de novo review "creates greater incentives for losing parties to appeal, thus discouraging settlements." Lighting Ballast, 744 F.3d at 1313 (O'Malley, J., dissenting); See also Chu, Empirical Analysis of the Federal Circuit's Claim Construction Trends, supra, at 1120 (de novo review means parties have every incentive to appeal and no incentive to settle, regardless of the outcome at trial). These delays necessarily increase the length and cost of litigation, and require businesses to operate in uncertainty for longer periods of time. See Maida, Patent Claim Construction, supra, at 1798 (calling de novo review "an economically costly standard"); Schwartz, Practice Makes Perfect? supra, at 226 ("Unpredictability [in appellate review of claim construction] . . . raises legal costs.")With the Federal Circuit becoming "the real center stage," de novo review also alters the behavior of trial counsel. Cybor, 138 F.3d at 1477 (Rader, J., dissenting). In the current regime, "attorneys must devote much of their trial strategy to positioning themselves for the `endgame' ­ claim construction on appeal. As the focus shifts from litigating the correct claim construction to preserving ways to compel reversal on appeal, [e.g., making arguments in the alternative], the20uncertainty, cost and duration of patent litigation only increase." Id. at 1476; see also Kyle J. Fiet, Comment, Restoring the Promise of Markman: Interlocutory Patent Appeals Reevaluated PostPhillips v. AWH Corp., 84 N.C. L. Rev. 1291, 1311 (2006) ("Unfortunately, Judge Rader's prediction that the de novo review standard would `undermine, if not destroy the . . . certainty and predictability sought by Markman . . . ' largely has been realized." (first ellipsis in original) (citation omitted)).For these reasons, this Court should reject the de novo standard of review, and hold that findings of fact made during claim construction may be overturned only for "clear error" pursuant to Rule 52(a)(6).CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the ABA respectfully submits that this Court should overrule Cybor and Lighting Ballast and replace the existing de novo standard of review for the factual findings underpinning claim construction with a "clearly erroneous" standard of review.21Respectfully Submitted,Of Counsel:Edward V.

Textron, No. 09-750 (Dec. 24, 2009), but should also encompass those that are prepared to serve both a business and a litigation purpose, whether or not a claim is ever threatened or filed.Dual purpose work product documents have resulted from a number of legal and practical considerations that have not been considered by the Court in its previous work product rulings. These include the investigations and assessments required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and "FIN 48," a financial accounting standard adopted in 2006. Further, today's businesses, and even the IRS, rely increasingly on counsel to evaluate proposed activities or practices and assess legal ramifications, including litigation risks, before making business decisions. Clients also rely on their counsel to conduct investigations of occurrences, recognizing that litigation may arise but often having the goal of avoiding litigation while ensuring compliance with laws and corporate policies. Although clients' needs for attorney investigation and counsel is greater than ever, the current circuit split has created an uncertain environment for attorneys practicing in a variety of contexts.The scope of the attorney work product privilege now depends on the jurisdiction in which a dispute arises or discovery is sought. To protect confidential information, clients who conduct multi-jurisdictional activities are motivated to adopt procedures consistent with the narrowest interpretation of the privilege, with the result that an overly restrictive6approach to dual purpose documents may threaten the free flow of confidential information from client to attorney necessary for the attorney to provide effective counseling and advocacy. Moreover, the circuit split has placed attorneys in the untenable position of deciding whether to create work product when it may be privileged in one jurisdiction but not in another.Accordingly, the ABA supports the present petition for a writ of certiorari because the uncertainties resulting from the circuit split are undermining the goals of the work product privilege and, indeed, the ability of many attorneys to do their jobs effectively.REASON FOR GRANTING THE WRIT The different standards adopted by the circuit courts for determining whether materials are protected leave attorneys and their clients uncertain as to the scope of the work product privilege. As this Court has observed, however, "[aln uncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results in widely varying applications by the courts, is little better than no privilege at all." Upjohn v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 393 (1981). The ABA submits, therefore, that the Court should grant the petition to clarify that the scope of the attorney work product privilege is not limited to materials prepared solely "for use in litigation," Pet. App. at 21a, but also encompasses materials that are prepared to serve both a litigation and a business purpose, whether or not a claim is ever threatened or filed.7A. THE CIRCUIT CONFLICT HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY OVER THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT PRIVILEGE TO DUAL PURPOSE DOCUMENTS.1.Often there is nobetween documentsclear distinctionprepared inanticipation of litigation and in theordinary course of business.Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3) protects from discoverymaterials prepared "in anticipation the Hickman Court observed,of litigation." however,As thedainsdtinpcrtiivoinlegbeedtweaetntordniesycovweorrakbleprboudsuicntesscandobceumheanztys.329 U.S. at 513-14. Today, there is more uncertaintythan ever due to the increasing number of dualpurpose documents that are created both inanticipation of business.oflitigationandintheordinarycourseFor example, in often rely on theirtoday's business climate, clients attorneys to evaluate proposedactivities and assess litigation risks before theymake business decisions. Clients also rely on theircounsel to conduct confidential investigations ofoccurrences allegationsand incidents, including employee of discrimination or harassment,recognizing that litigation may arise but often withthe aim of avoiding litigation while ensuringcompliance with employment and other laws andcorporation policies.Today'srequirementsunder whichbusiness environment also includes theof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,audit committees of public companies8must establish procedures for receiving and handlingcomplaints "regarding accounting, internal controlsor auditing matters" and confidential submissions byemployees. 15 U.S.C. § 78j-1 (2009). These auditcommittees are frequently also charged withinvestigating whistleblower complaints.Inperforming these responsibilities, they typically relyon their attorneys to conduct internal investigations,and their attorneys create work product outliningthe scope of potential claims and possible legalstrategies before litigation is threatened or filed. SeeMemorandum from Corporate Counsel Consortium,The Auditor's Need For Its Client's DetailedInformation vs. The Clients' Need to Preserve. theAttorney-Client Privilege and Work ProductProtection: The Debate, The Problems, and ProposedSolutions5(2004),availableathttp://www.acc.com/vI/public/PolicyStatement/loader.cfm?cesModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=16222.In addition, the assessment of litigation prospects has become commonplace in the context of audits and, in particular, possible tax liability, as the present case has shown. Under FASB Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), as adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 2006, public companies must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by or litigation with the IRS. FASB, FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (June 2006) available at http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata& blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobkey=id&blobwhere=117 5818746949&blobheader=application%p2dFf. This determination entails an assessment of the strength9of the company's position in possible litigation. SeeAndrew Golodny, Lawyers Versus Auditors:Disclosure to Auditors and Potential Waiver of WorkProduct Privilege in United States v. Textron, 61Tax Law. 621, 631 (2008); Michelle M. Henkel,Textron: Its Impact on the Viability of the Work Product Privilege, 2009 Tax MGMT. MEMORANDUM 515, 516 n.18.The overlapping functions of these documents has created uncertainty as to whether they fall outside the scope of the plain language of Rule 23(b)(3) simply because they were prepared not only in anticipation of litigation but also to serve abusiness purpose.2. There is a circuit split on how Rule 26(b)(3) should be applied to dual purpose documents.In contrast to the outcome in the First Circuit's Textron decision, a study created by an attorney that assesses the likely results of an expected litigation is eligible for work product protection in the Second Circuit, even where the primary or ultimate purpose for making the study is to assess the desirability of abusiness transaction. U.S. v. Adlman, 134 F.3d1194, 1195 (2d Cir. 1998). As noted by the SecondCircuit, id. at 1200: If the company declines to make suchanalysis or scrimps on candor and completeness to avoid prejudicing its litigation prospects, it subjects itself and its co-venturers to ill-informed decisionmaking. On the other hand, a study © reflecting the company's litigation strategy and its assessment of its strengths and weaknesses10cannot be turned over to litigation adversaries without serious prejudice to the company's prospects in the litigation. Moreover, in Delaney, Migdail & Young, Chartered v. IRS, 826 F.2d 124, 126 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the IRS relied on its counsel to analyze the litigation potential of a proposed system of statistical sampling for its corporate audit program for large accounts. After the IRS attorneys analyzed possible legal challenges, defenses and likely outcomes, the IRS concluded that the legal risks were reasonable and instituted the program. When litigation ensued, the D.C. Circuit concluded, "[Plaintiff] is seeking the agency's attorneys' assessment of the program's legal vulnerabilities in order to make sure it does not miss anything in crafting its legal case against the program. This is exactly the type of discovery the Court refused to permit in Hickman{]." Id. at 127. In a footnote, the D.C. Circuit noted, "The hardship the Court was concerned about in Hickman was an attorney's inability to obtain otherwise unavailable factual information, and not the inability to obtain an adversary's legal assessment of what the case might turn on." Id. at 128 n.4. In the First Circuit, however, a lawyer's assessment of litigation is not protected by the work product privilege if it also satisfies a business objective. As a result, in the First Circuit and in other courts that follow its rule, a client that prudently relies upon counsel before making a business decision may be penalized by being forced to give its adversaries a roadmap of the strengths and weaknesses of its case if litigation does in fact occur. See Pet. App. at 21a. This circuit split has11exacerbated the uncertainty surrounding the application of the work product privilege to dualpurpose documents. And, as shown below, thisuncertainty also undermines the ability of lawyers to do their jobs effectively.B.THE UNCERTAINTY SCOPE OF THEREGARDING THE ATTORNEY WORKPRODUCT PRIVILEGETHE ABILITY OFCOUNSELTHEIRUNDERMINES ATTORNEYS TOCLIENTSEFFECTIVELY.With the advent of Sarbanes-Oxley andenhanced auditing standards, clients' needs forattorney counsel, investigation, and analysis isgreater than ever before.

Wk.2199 (Oct. 13, 2009).If clients are penalizedtheir attorneys' assessmentsby havingof litigationto discloserisks on theground that this work product was created for abusiness purpose as well as "in anticipation of12litigation," they will become guarded in deciding how they will rely upon their lawyers. This result inevitably would "threaten to limit the valuable efforts of corporate counsel to ensure their client's compliance with the law." Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 392 (concerning the attorney-client privilege). See also United States v. Chen, 99 F.3d 1495, 1500 (9th Cir. 1996) (the "valuable service of counseling clients and bringing them into compliance with the law cannot be performed effectively if clients are scared to tell their lawyers what they are doing, for fear that their lawyers will be turned into ... informants").6Clearly, the current circuit conflict has created an uncertain environment for attorneys practicing in a variety of business contexts. Further, because the scope of the attorney work product privilege depends on the jurisdiction in which a dispute arises or discovery is sought, attorneys with clients who conduct multi-jurisdictional activities may need to advise those clients to adopt the narrowest `interpretation of the privilege that has been established in any jurisdiction in which they may be8 See also ABA SECTION ON ANTITRUST LAW, COMMENTS OF THE ABA's SECTION OF ANTITRUST LAW ON THE PROPOSEDAMENDMENTS TO THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES FORORGANIZATIONS5-7(2005),availableathttp//www.abanet.org/antitrust/at-comments/2005/03-05/ussg-com-05.pdf (need to preserve work product privilege to allowlawyers to assist clients in complying with the law); Thomas Wilson, The Work Product Doctrine: Why Have an OrdinaryCourse of Business Exception?, 1988 COLUM.

Meanwhile, the attorneys themselves may be in the untenable position of deciding whether to create work product when it may be privileged in one jurisdiction but not in another.This and other consequences of the circuit `split significantly affect the ability of attorneys to provide their clients with full, effective legal counsel and the informed guidance that may be necessary to enable them to comply with their legal responsibilities in today's business environment.

I. Cy Pres Serves Important Purposes in Class Action Settlements.Cy pres serves important purposes in class action settlements, particularly in cases involving small claims. The cy pres doctrine takes its name from the Norman French term "cy pres comme possible," meaning "as near as possible." Nachshin v. AOL, LLC, 663 F.3d 1034, 1038 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Originally used as an equitable means of distributing trust fund assets when the trust's original purpose could not be achieved, the principles of cy pres have been applied to modern class action settlements. Id.; Martin H. Redish, et al., Cy Pres Relief and the Pathologies of the Modern Class Action: A Normative and Empirical Analysis, 62 FLA. L. REV. 617, 653-56 (2010) (hereinafter "Redish").Soon after the 1966 amendments to Rule 23 and the ensuing expansion of class actions, a student comment proposed that the equitable cy pres principle in trust law could be employed when class action settlements and awards could not be7distributed fully to the class members. Stewart R. Shepherd, Comment, Damage Distribution in Class Actions: The Cy Pres Remedy, 39 U. CHI. L. REV. 448, 448 (1972); In re Baby Prods. Antitrust Litig., 708 F.3d 163, 172 (3d Cir. 2013) (discussing development of cy pres awards in class actions). Significant growth of cy pres awards followed from approximately once per year between 1974 and 2000 to approximately eight per year between 2001 and 2008. Redish, 62 FLA. L. REV. at 653.The cy pres doctrine is particularly appropriate in class actions aggregating small claims. American Law Institute's Principles of Law of Aggregate Litigation (2010), § 3.07, cmt. b ("ALI Principles"). Because class members with only small amounts at stake seldom bother to claim their shares of a settlement fund, residual funds may remain after an initial effort to distribute it to the class. Courts then face a dilemma over the distribution of the residual funds. Distributing the residual to class members that have already received full compensation would provide a windfall to those members. Susan Beth Farmer, More Lessons from the Laboratories: Cy Pres Distributions in Parens Patriae Antitrust Actions Brought by State Attorneys General, 68 FORDHAM L. REV. 361, 393 (1999) (citing Van Gemert v. Boeing Co., 553 F.2d 812, 815 (2d Cir. 1977)). Returning unclaimed settlement funds would be equally inequitable. Id.; Mirfasihi v. Fleet Mortg. Corp., 356 F.3d 781, 784 (7th Cir. 2004) (by authorizing cy pres awards, courts prevent defendants "from walking away from the litigation scot-free because of the infeasibility of distributing the proceeds of the settlement [or] judgment").8Cy pres "serves deterrence better than returning funds to the defendant; it avoids windfalls to class members, and it directs left-over funds in a way that creates some benefit to the class." Robert G. Bone, Justifying Class Action Limits: Parsing the Debate over Ascertainability and Cy Pres, 65 U. KAN. L. REV. 913, 943-44 (2017).Cy pres awards in class action settlements were envisioned to "`put[] the unclaimed fund to its next best compensation use, e.g., for the aggregate, indirect, prospective benefit of the class.'" Masters v. Wilhelmina Model Agency, Inc., 473 F.3d 423, 436 (2d Cir. 2007) (alteration in original) (quoting 2 HERBERT B. NEWBERG & ALBA CONTE, NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 10:17 (4th ed. 2002)); accord Nachsin, 663 F.3d at 1038. Under rules proposed by the American Law Institute's Principles of Law of Aggregate Litigation(, when feasible, undistributed residual funds should be distributed to recipients "whose interests reasonably approximate those being pursued by the class. . . ." ALI Principles, § 3.07 cmt. a (emphasis added). This "reasonable approximation" test has been adopted by numerous courts in determining the fairness of class action cy pres awards. See, e.g., Oetting v. Green Jacobson, P.C. (In re BankAmerica Corp. Sec. Litig.), 775 F.3d 1060, 1067 (8th Cir. 2015); In re Lupron Mktg. & Sales Practice Litig., 677 F.3d 21, 33 (1st Cir. 2012); Klier v. Elf Atochem N. Am., Inc., 658 F.3d 468, 474 (5th Cir. 2011); Six (6) Mexican Workers v. Arizona Citrus Growers, 904 F.2d 1301, 1305 (9th Cir. 1990).9II. Legal Services Organizations That Serve Low-Income and Indigent Litigants Are Proper Recipients of Cy Pres Awards Because They Share the Same Purpose as Rule 23(b)(3) Class Actions.A fundamental purpose of class actions is to offer access to justice for people who, on their own, could not otherwise realistically obtain the protections of the justice system. Legal services organizations that represent poor and indigent litigants serve the same fundamental purpose ­ to provide access to the judicial system to people who otherwise might be unable to litigate. With these closely aligned purposes, legal services organizations should in most cases be appropriate recipients of cy pres awards.1. Class actions often provide access to courts for civil litigants that otherwise might forego judicial relief. In most class actions seeking monetary relief, certification requires a court to find that a "class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy." FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3).As part of this superiority analysis, courts have long recognized that claims that would result in small individual recoveries are particularly amenable to class action treatment. As this Court has explained, "the Advisory Committee had dominantly in mind vindication of `the rights of groups of people who individually would be without effective strength to bring their opponents into court at all.'" Amchem Prods. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 2246 (1997) (quoting Kaplan, Prefatory Note, 10 B.C.10IND. & COM. L. REV. 497, 497 (1969)). "`The policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.'" Id. (quoting Mace v. Van Ru Credit Corp., 109 F.3d 338, 344 (7th Cir. 1997)). "`A class action solves this problem by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone's (usually an attorney's) labor.'" Id.; see also Leyva v. Medline Indus. Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 515 (9th Cir. 2013) ("In light of the small size of the putative class members' potential individual monetary recovery, class certification may be the only feasible means for them to adjudicate their claims" and thus "is also the superior method of adjudication.").Thus, a fundamental role of the class action device is to provide a means of access for litigants who might otherwise be unable to bring claims. As Judge Posner explained, "[t]he realistic alternative to a class action is not 17 million individual suits, but zero individual suits, as only a lunatic or a fanatic sues for $30." Carnegie v. Household Int'l, Inc., 376 F.3d 656, 661 (7th Cir. 2004); see also Bob Glaves & Meredith McBurney, Cy Pres Awards, Legal Aid and Access to Justice: Key Issues in 2013 and Beyond, 27 MGMT. INFO. EXCH. J., 24, 25 (2013) ("[N]o matter what the underlying issue is in the case, every class action is always about access to justice for a group of litigants who on their own would not realistically be able to obtain the protections of the justice system."); Wilber H. Boies & Latonia Haney Keith, Class Action Settlement Residue and Cy Pres Awards: Emerging Problems and Practical Solutions, 21 VA. J. SOC.11POL'Y & L. 267, 291 (2014) (hereinafter "Boies") ("One interest of every class member in any class action in any area of the law is access to justice for a group of litigants who, on their own, would not realistically be able to seek court relief").2. Legal services organizations serve a similar purpose as Rule 23(b)(3): They provide representation to litigants that otherwise might be unable to protect their interests in civil actions.These organizations provide a vital service.More than 60 million Americans live below thepoverty level. Legal Services Corp., The Justice Gap:Measuring the Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-income Americans (2017), at 16 ("Justice Gap"),availableathttps://www.lsc.gov/sites/default/files/images/TheJusticeGap-FullReport.pdf. In the Legal ServicesCorporation's ("LSC") 2017 Justice Gap survey, 71%of survey respondents reported having at least onecivil legal problem in the prior year, 54% faced atleast two such problems, and nearly a quarter hadexperienced six or more civil legal problems. Id. at 21.These problems often related to basic issues ofhealth, finances, rental housing, children andcustody, education, income maintenance, anddisability. Id. at 21-23. Seventy percent of low-incomeAmericans who personally experienced a civil legalproblem in the past year, reported that at least one ofthe problems has affected them "very much" or"severely." Id. at 25. Respondents reported to theLSC survey that they sought the help of a legalprofessional for only 20% of all of the civil legalproblems they face, and for only 24% of the problemsthat affect them "very much" or "severely." Id. at 29.12LSC alone provides funding to organizations and programs that helped approximately 1.8 million people in 2016. LSC, By the Numbers: The Data Underlying Legal Aid Programs, at 63 (2016) (hereinafter "By the Numbers"). However, demand for legal aid far outstrips the resources available. In the most recent Justice Gap survey, LSC-funded organizations could not assist on approximately 41% of the eligible problems low-income Americans presented to these organizations. Justice Gap, at 43. Most of those problems were rejected due to limited resources. Id.The federal government also recognizes that civil legal services organizations provide vital support for federal efforts to serve the low-income and other vulnerable populations. For example, the White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable ("WHLAIR") cites the role that legal services organizations play in supporting veterans, including preventing avoidable evictions and foreclosures, negotiating fair child support orders, resolving credit report problems, and assisting veterans secure government benefits.

Because of this unity of interest between the purpose of the class action mechanism and legal services organizations, legal services organizations should always be appropriate recipients of residual class action settlement funds. Legal services organizations that provide access to the courts satisfy the reasonable approximation test for cy pres awards. Boies, 21 VA. J. SOC. POL'Y & L. at 290-91 ("The access to justice nexus falls squarely within ALI Principles' guidance that `there should be a presumed obligation to award any remaining funds to an entity that resembles, in either composition or purpose, the class members or their interests.'").Consistent with that reasoning, courts authorizing cy pres awards consistently find legal services organizations to be appropriate recipients of class action residual funds. Cecily C. Shiel, A New Generation of Class Action Cy Pres Remedies: Lessons from Washington State, 90 WASH. L. REV. 943, 955-56 (2015) (discussing cases providing for distribution of residual funds to legal services organizations); Daniel Blynn, Cy Pres Distributions: Ethics & Reform, 25 GEO. J. LEGAL ETHICS 435, 438 (2012) ("there are many cases in which judges grant cy pres distributions to legal aid foundations and bar associations"); Calvin C. Fayard, Jr. & Charles S. McCowan, Jr., The Cy Pres Doctrine: "A Settling Concept," 58 LA. B.J. 248, 251 (2011) (citing cy pres awards to local legal services organizations and the Louisiana Bar Foundation); Danny Van Horn & Daniel Clayton, It Adds Up: Class Action Residual Funds Support Pro Bono Efforts, 45 TENN. BAR. J. 12, 13-14 (2009) (identifying federal cases that have "awarded unclaimed class action settlement funds to14legal aid programs because, like class action lawsuits, the programs provide a means to legal representation").Indeed, recognizing this connection, many states have enacted statutes or rules expressly directing that residual funds from class action settlements be distributed to nonprofit and state Bar-affiliated organizations that provide civil legal services for lowincome residents. See, section III, infra.This Court should similarly recognize that legal services organizations are proper recipients of cy pres awards in class action settlements.4. To rule otherwise would risk depriving legal services organizations of an important source of funding. The ABA tracks cy pres awards nationally and has determined that, an average of $15.5 million in cy pres awards at the state and federal level are provided to legal services organizations each year. These funds are critical to their operations, as direct government funding for these organizations has decreased. See, e.g., LSC, By the Numbers, at 11-12 (reflecting decline in funding between 2010 and 2016 in inflation-adjusted dollars from $457 million to $385 million).33 In 2018, funding increased by $25 million to $410 million,which is still significantly less than the 2010 data.

States Laws and Rules Providing for Cy Pres Awards in Class Action Proceedings Could Be Imperiled by a Ruling Imposing Constitutional or Other Strict Limitations on Cy Pres Awards.Petitioners briefly mention due process and First Amendment concerns about cy pres awards, but do not directly raise constitutional challenges to the use of cy pres in class action settlements. However, amici at the petition stage and courts have argued that the use of cy pres awards may fail constitutional scrutiny. See, e.g., Brief of the Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioners, filed Feb. 7, 2018, at 11-19 (arguing the award in this action violates due process); id. at 20-24 (arguing that cy pres award compels class members to support speech with which they do not agree in violation of the First Amendment); Brief of Amicus Curiae Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence in Support of Petitioners, filed Feb. 7, 2018, at 7-10 (arguing that cy pres awards violate due process, free speech, and Article III); Keepseagle v. Perdue, 856 F.3d 1039, 1071 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (arguing that cy pres awards may raise Article III concerns) (Brown, J., dissenting). Should amici invite this Court to consider the constitutional implications of cy pres awards, the ABA urges this Court to decline the invitation.(Feb. 12, 2018), available at https://www.lsc.gov/mediacenter/press-releases/2018/legal-services-corporation-leadersconfident-bipartisan-support.16A decision implicating the constitutionality of cy pres awards would affect not just the distribution of class action settlement funds in federal courts, but would also undermine state laws directing cy pres funds to legal services organizations.Twenty-three states and Puerto Rico haveenacted laws or rules authorizing cy pres awardsfrom class action settlements to be distributed tolegal services organizations that provide services tolow-income residents.

For instance,by statute, California mandates that 25% of classaction residuals should be provided to the EqualAccess Fund of the Judicial Branch for distribution tolegal aid programs, 25% to the Trial CourtImprovement and Modernization Fund, and theremaining 50% to organizations that may include"nonprofit organizations providing civil legal servicesto the indigent." CAL. CODE CIV. P. § 384. See also 735ILCS 5/2-807 (providing that at least 50% of residualfunds must go to organizations eligible for fundingunder the Illinois Equal Justice Act); NEB. REV. STAT.25-319(2) (requiring distribution of residual funds tothe Nebraska Legal Aid and Services Fund); N.C.GEN. STAT. § 1-267.10(b) (requiring "the unpaidresidue, to be divided and credited equally, to theIndigent Person's Attorney Fund and to the NorthCarolina State Bar for the provision of civil legalservices for indigents"); P.R. LAWS ANN. tit. 32A.17§ 20.6(b) (authorizing distribution of residual funds to programs that provide legal representation to persons of limited means in civil, administrative, and family law proceedings); S.D. CODIFIED LAWS § 16-257; (requiring at least 50% of residual funds go to the South Dakota Commission on Equal Access to Our Courts); TENN. CODE ANN. § 16-3-821 (authorizing distribution of residual funds to the Tennessee Voluntary Fund for Indigent Civil Representation); WISC. STAT. 803.08(10) (requiring that "not less than 50 percent of the residual funds shall be disbursed to [Wisconsin Trust Account Foundation, Inc.] to support direct delivery of legal services to persons of limited means in non-criminal matters").Other states have similar requirements by rule. See COL. R. CIV. P. 23(g) ("not less than fifty percent (50%) of the residual funds shall be disbursed to the Colorado Lawyer Trust Account Foundation (COLTAF) to support activities and programs that promote access to the civil justice system for low income residents of Colorado"); CONN. SUP. CT. R. 99(g)(2) ("residual funds [from class judgment or settlement] shall be disbursed to the organization administering the program for the use of interest on lawyers' client funds . . . for the purpose of funding those organizations that provide legal services for the poor in Connecticut"); HAW. CIV. P. R. 23(f) (court has discretion to disburse residual funds to eligible nonprofit tax exempt organizations that provide legal services to the indigent); IND. R. TRIAL P. 23(F)(2) (at least 25% of residual funds must be disbursed to the Indiana Bar Foundation); KY. CIV. R. 23.05(6) (providing that at least 25% of residual funds be distributed to legal aid organizations through the18Kentucky IOLTA Fund Board of Trustees); LA S. C. RULE XLIII Part Q (authorizing residual funds to be distributed to the Louisiana Bar Foundation); ME. R. CIV. P. 23(f)(2) (mandating that residual funds be distributed to the Maine Bar Foundation); MASS. R. CIV. P. 23(e) (permitting distribution of residual funds "to support activities and programs that promote access to the civil justice system for low income residents"); N.M. DIST. CT. R. C.P. 1-023(G)(2) (authorizing distribution of residual funds to "nonprofit organizations that provide civil legal service to low income persons"); OR. R. CIV. P. 32(O)(1) (requiring at least 50% of residual funds to be paid to the Oregon State Bar to fund legal services to the poor); Pa. R. Civ. P. Ch. 1700 (requiring at least 50% of residual funds to be paid to the Pennsylvania IOLTA Board to promote the delivery of civil legal assistance); S.C. R. CIV. P. 23(e) (requiring at least 50% of residual funds to be paid to the South Carolina Bar Foundation "to support activities and programs that promote access to the civil justice system for low income residents"); WASH. CIV. R. 23(f) (requiring distribution of at least 50% of residual funds to the Legal Foundation of Washington); W. VA. R. CIV. P. 23(f) (directing that 50% of residual funds be disbursed to Legal Aid of West Virginia).That so many states expressly mandate a specific percentage of the residual funds be directed to providing legal services to low income residents only highlights the identity of interests between legal services organizations and class members, as well as the states' considered judgment that residual funds be used to promote access to justice. This Court19should consider that persuasive evidence of both the unity of interest between cy pres awards and access to justice, as well as the appropriateness of legal services organizations as cy pres recipients.Because the parties agree that the issue before this Court is simply the proper course a court should undertake in the event of residual funds exist after a class action settlement, the case provides a poor vehicle for the determination of the constitutionality of cy pres more generally. On that issue, this Court lacks the considered views of the lower courts. Moreover, if this Court reaches beyond the limited scope of the question presented and imposes constitutional restrictions on cy pres awards, it will imperil these state laws and potentially deprive legal services organizations of critical funding and lowincome residents of legal representation. The American Bar Association urges the Court to consider the impact of its holding on the availability of legal services for low-income persons.20 CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, amicus American Bar Association requests that this Court recognize the availability of cy pres awards in class action settlements and legal services organizations as appropriate recipients of residual funds.Respectfully submitted.Hilarie Bass Counsel of Record AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATIONRex S.

I. It Is a "Fundamental Right" in a Free Society that Justice Be Equal in Substance and Availability, Without Regard to Economic StatusEqual justice without regard to economic status is a cornerstone of the American justice system. See Justice Lewis F. Powell, Address at Legal Services Corporation: A Presidential Program of the Annual Meeting of the American Bar Association 2 (Aug. 10, 1976), http://bit.ly/2MAO5K3 ("Equal justice under law is not merely a caption on the facade of the Supreme Court building; it is perhaps the most inspiring ideal of our society. It is one of the ends for which our entire legal system exists. ... It is ... fundamental that justice should be the same, in substance and availability, without regard to economic status.").From its fledgling days to the current era, this Court has recognized the centrality of equal justice in the judicial system. John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States, wrote on behalf of this Court that, "Justice is indiscriminately due to all, without regard to numbers, wealth, or rank." Georgia v. Brailsford, 3 U.S. 1, 4 (1794). The judicial oath, set forth in the Judiciary Act of 1789 (and unchanged in relevant part today) required that judges swear to "administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich." 1 Stat. 76 § 8; Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 180 (1803); 28 U.S.C. § 453. Less than a century later, this Court held that "[n]o duty rests more imperatively upon the courts than the enforcement of those constitutional provisions intended to secure that equality of rights which is the foundation of free8government." Gulf, C. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. Ellis, 165 U.S. 150, 160 (1897).The commitment to equal justice has persisted over the 225 years since Chief Justice Jay's observation. Indeed, this Court has increasingly come to understand the many ways in which the principle affects defendants in the criminal justice system.Thus, this Court has held that an indigent defendant may not be denied the assistance of a lawyer at his trial, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 342-45 (1963), or on direct appeal from conviction, Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 35658 (1963). Nor may a state preclude a defendant from appealing a conviction or denial of collateral relief solely because of inability to pay a docket fee or similar charge. Smith v. Bennett, 365 U.S. 708, 71013 (1961); Burns v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 252, 253-58 (1959). The state also must provide an indigent defendant with a free transcript of trial proceedings to aid in preparing an appeal of a conviction. Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17-18 (1956); Eskridge v. Wash. State Bd. of Prison Terms & Paroles, 357 U.S. 214, 214-16 (1958) (per curiam): Draper v. Washington, 372 U.S. 487, 497-500 (1963). Moreover, this Court has held that States cannot satisfy this obligation of equal justice by securing nominal assistance of counsel. The assistance must be effective. See McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wis., Dist. 1, 486 U.S. 429, 435 (1988); Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 395-96 (1985); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 685-86 (1984); McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14 (1970).This Court has similarly held that prisoners, perhaps the most economically vulnerable of all9litigants, must have meaningful access to the courts. See Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828 (1977); Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 579 (1974); Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 419 (1974); Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15, 15 (1971) (per curiam); Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 483, 485 (1969); Cochran v. Kansas, 316 U.S. 255, 257-58 (1942); Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 549 (1941).In addition, this Court has implemented the principle of equal justice by barring courts from imposing differential punishments on the basis of economic status. Thus, a State violates the Equal Protection Clause when it imprisons an indigent individual solely because he cannot afford to pay a fine. In Williams v. Illinois, the defendant had served his prison sentence, but an Illinois statute required him to remain in jail because he could not pay the monetary penalty of his sentence. 399 U.S. 235, 236-37 (1970). This Court invalidated the statute, holding that "the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the statutory ceiling placed on imprisonment for any substantive offense be the same for all defendants irrespective of their economic status." Id. at 244. The Court reasoned that, "[s]ince only a convicted person with access to funds can avoid the increased imprisonment, the Illinois statute in operative effect exposes only indigents to the risk of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum," and that "[b]y making the maximum confinement contingent upon one's ability to pay, the State has visited different consequences on two categories of persons." Id. at 242. The very next term, in Tate v. Short, the Court extended Williams, holding that Texas violated the Equal Protection Clause when it imprisoned a defendant convicted under a fine-only statute solely10because the defendant was indigent and unable to immediately pay the fine in full. 401 U.S. 395, 39899 (1971).Again implementing the principle of equal justice, this Court has held that the State impermissibly discriminates on the basis of financial status when it automatically revokes an individual's probation for failure to pay a fine, without first inquiring into why. Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 672-73 (1983). "To do [so] would deprive the probationer of his conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he cannot pay the fine. Such a deprivation would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment." Id.Thus, no one today would contend that a State or the Federal Government could, consistent with the Constitution, systematically impose greater punishments on the poor than on the rich. Such an intentional disparity would make a mockery of the Constitution's promise of equal protection of the laws. In the imposition of punishments, the state can no more discriminate on account of poverty than on account of religion, race, or creed.This Court's longstanding and broad-based holdings ensuring effective representation to indigent defendants, providing them access to the courts, and rejecting differential punishments, support the determination that the right to equal justice without regard to economic status is fundamental.II. A Key Function of the Excessive Fines Clause Is to Ensure Equity in the Imposition of FinesFor nearly 1000 years, the English constitution, and for its shorter lifespan, the American Constitution, have recognized the nexus between11excessive fines and equal justice. From its historical origins, to its embodiment in modern jurisprudence, the protections of the Excessive Fines Clause and its antecedents have turned not only on proportionality of the fine to the offense, but also on its compatibility with the defendant's ability to pay.By the twelfth century, there existed a preMagna Carta English writ known as de moderata misericordia under which unjustly large fines could be reduced. Glanvill's treatise (dating to around 1188) states that "[fines] by the lord king ... means that he is to be [fined] by the oath of lawful men of the neighborhood, but so as not to lose any property necessary to maintain his position." Glanvill, The Treatise on the Laws and Customs of the Realm of England 114 (G.D.G. Hall ed., 1965).The Magna Carta (1215) provides: "For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only in proportion to the degree of his offence, and for a serious offence correspondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his livelihood." Frederic Maitland wrote that "[v]ery likely there was no clause in Magna Carta more grateful to the mass of the people than that about [excessive fines]." F.W. Maitland, Pleas of the Crown for the County of Gloucester xxxiv (1884). Provisions regarding the calculation of fines, mirroring Magna Carta's were also included in the First Statute of Westminster, 3 Edw. I, ch. 6 (1275), which required "that no City, Borough, nor Town, nor any Man be [fined], without reasonable Cause, and according to the Quantity of his Trespass; that is to say, [according to his ability to pay]."The Eighth Amendment has its roots in these English sources. It was taken verbatim from a provision of the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which12itself grew out of the language of the Magna Carta. Scholars have therefore recognized the historical link between the Excessive Fines Clause and equal justice. See, e.g., Nicholas M. Mclean, Livelihood, Ability to Pay, and the Original Meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause, 40 Hastings Const. L.Q. 833, 839-41 (2013). This Court likewise has recognized that link. See United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 335 (1998) (noting that, at the Founding, English constitutional law required that "amercements (the medieval predecessors of fines) should be proportioned to the offense and that they should not deprive a wrongdoer of his livelihood").The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has viewed the Eighth Amendment in the same light, holding that an individual's ability to pay directly bears on a fine's "excessiveness." See United States v. Jose, 499 F.3d 105, 113 (1st Cir. 2007). In United States v. Levesque, the court found that a forfeiture-- for current purposes the equivalent of a fine--could be so onerous as to deprive a defendant of his or her future ability to earn a living, thus implicating the historical concerns underlying the Excessive Fines Clause." 546 F.3d 78, 83-85 (1st Cir. 2008). Along similar lines, the Second Circuit has held that "when analyzing a forfeiture's proportionality under the Excessive Fines Clause, courts may consider--in addition to the four factors we have previously derived from Bajakajian--whether the forfeiture would deprive the defendant of his livelihood, i.e., his `future ability to earn a living.'" United States v. Viloski, 814 F.3d 104, 111 (2nd Cir. 2016) (quoting Levesque, 546 F.3d at 85).These sources establish that the Excessive Fines Clause requires courts, in imposing fines, to take into account the defendant's ability to pay.13III.Empirical Evidence Confirms that Excessive Fines Undermine Equal JusticeIn general, even when not excessive, fines imposed in judicial proceedings have disparate effects on the poor and communities of color. The greater the fines, the more acute and widespread the disparate impacts. Low income defendants are more likely to be unable to pay fines than are higher income defendants. And unpaid fines can result in incarceration, suspension of driver's and occupational licenses, and loss of employment, further impeding the ability to pay and prolonging the penalty imposed for the original offense. As the evidence shows, such financial penalties can render justice unequal.A. Excessive Fines Disproportionately Burden the Poor1. The ABA Has Recognized that Fines, Unless Calibrated to Ability to Pay, Unfairly Burden Defendants of Lesser MeansConcerned with the burgeoning evidence that fines not linked to ability to pay are denying equal justice to defendants who are poor, the ABA in August 2018 adopted Ten Guidelines on Court Fines and Fees. The report accompanying the Guidelines laid out some of that evidence. The report noted, for example, that an estimated 10 million Americans owe more than $50 billion in debts imposed by the criminal justice system. See ABA Guidelines, Report at 2, http://bit.ly/2NhGzDy. Further, the ABA cited studies showing that nearly two-thirds of current prisoners were assessed court fines and fees, and have little prospect of paying them when they leave prison, as 60 percent remain unemployed a year after release. Id.14The commentary to the guidelines debunks the popular misconception that the United States long ago abolished "debtors' prisons." ABA Guidelines, Comm. at 3-4. Many current prisoners are incarcerated because they could not pay court fees and fines. Such incarceration has been documented in at least thirteen States since 2010. Id. at 4. In several States, the municipal courts that typically administer fine-and-jail systems simply do not make the indigence inquiry necessary to safeguard the constitutional protection Bearden provides against incarceration-for-nonpayment. Note, State Bans on Debtors' Prisons and Criminal Justice Debt, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 1024, 1027-31 (2016). Thus, in some States, courts still revoke or withhold probation based on failure to pay. ABA Guidelines, Comm. at 9. Others force defendants to choose between incarceration and paying the fine. Id. at 4-5. And still others allow individuals to be arrested and held while they await an ability-to-pay hearing. Id. at 5.The remedies the Guidelines recommend testify to the inequities that the empirical data demonstrate. Thus, the Guidelines urge, among other things, that fines be calibrated to the financial circumstances of the person ordered to pay; that inability to pay (as opposed to willful nonpayment) never result in incarceration, deprivation of fundamental rights, or other disproportionate sanctions; that courts hold mandatory ability-to-pay hearings before imposing a fine; that courts consider alternative sanctions for those unable to pay fines; and that defendants have a right to counsel if incarceration could result from nonpayment of a fine. See ABA Guidelines, Comm.Thus, Guideline 2 advises that "[f]ines used as a form of punishment for criminal offenses or civil15infractions should not result in substantial and undue hardship to individuals or their families. ... [A] full waiver of fines should be readily accessible to people for whom payment would cause a substantial hardship." Id. at 3. Guideline 3 provides that "[a] person's inability to pay a fine, fee or restitution should never result in incarceration or other disproportionate sanctions." Id. at 3. Along the same lines, Guideline 4 states that before sanctioning an individual for nonpayment, "the court must first hold an `ability-to-pay' hearing, find willful failure to pay a fine or fee the individual can afford, and consider alternatives to incarceration." Id. at 7.ABA recommendations require broad-based consensus from a cross-section of the legal profession. That the ABA adopted these Guidelines signals the dimensions of the problem. And the Guidelines themselves illuminate the inherent inequalities in use of fines as criminal punishmentsdisparities that cement the link between equal justice and excessive fines.2. Scholars Have Also Extensively Documented the Disproportionate Burden that Excessive Fines Impose on the PoorScholars have also noted the disproportionate impact of excessive fines on the poor. For example, through studies and first-person observations, Alexes Harris and co-authors have documented the disproportionate effect of excessive fines on those of lesser economic means. See Alexes Harris, A Pound of Flesh: Monetary Sanctions as Punishment for the Poor 151-56 (2016); Alexes Harris et al., Drawing Blood from Stones: Legal Debt and Social Inequality in the Contemporary United States, 115 Am. J. Sociology 1753, 1778, 1785-86 (2010) (noting that1680% of those interviewed found their criminal debt obligations to be "unduly burdensome").Beth A. Colgan has similarly provided qualitative accounts of the impacts of excessive fines on poor individuals, see Beth A. Colgan, The Excessive Fines Clause: Challenging the Modern Debtors' Prison, 65 UCLA L. Rev. 2, 8-9 (2018), and has noted that "municipalities appeared to be targeting low-income and black communities with ... [fine, fee, and imprisonment] practices," Beth A. Colgan, Lessons from Ferguson on Individual Defense Representation as a Tool of Systemic Reform, 58 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1171, 1174-75 (2017). She has also explained how excessive fines and fees entrench poverty. See Beth A. Colgan, Fines, Fees, and Forfeitures, in 4 Reforming Criminal Justice: Punishment, Incarceration, and Release 205, 212-16 (Erik Luna ed. 2017), http://bit.ly/2od5ERW.A 2007 report commissioned by the Council of State Governments Justice Center and funded by the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance similarly corroborated the extraordinary impact of excessive fines on the economically vulnerable. The report found that "[m]any people released from prisons and jails have a substantial amount of debt to repay, including supervision fees, court costs, victim restitution, and child support," but that "[p]eople released from prisons and jails typically have insufficient resources to pay their debts." Rachel L. McLean & Michael D. Thompson, Repaying Debts 7-8 (2007), http://bit.ly/2wi2lNB. That is because, "[n]ationally, two-thirds of people detained in jails report annual incomes under $12,000," and "[m]ost people returning to the community have difficulty finding employment upon release from incarceration, and they often rely on their families for support." Id.17Thus, "[v]ictims, families, and criminal justice agencies often compete for a share of the small payments people released from prisons and jails are able to make." Id.A 2015 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisors reached many of the same conclusions. See Council of Economic Advisers Issue Brief, Fines, Fees, and Bail: Payments in the Criminal Justice System that Disproportionately Impact the Poor 3-4 (Dec. 2015), http://bit.ly/2oexSff. The report noted that fines and fees "serve as a regressive form of punishment as the same level of debt presents an increasingly larger burden as one moves lower on the income scale." Id. The report observed further that "[f]ines and fees create large financial and human costs, all of which are disproportionately borne by the poor." Id.B. Excessive Fines Disproportionately Burden Communities and Persons of Color1. The ABA Has Recognized the Disparate Impact Excessive Fines Have on Minority CommunitiesOne of the foundations for the ABA's Guidelines was the determination that fines and fees fixed without regard to whether a person reasonably can pay them "are regressive and have a disproportionate, adverse impact on low-income people and people of color." ABA Guidelines, Comm., at 5 & n. 18. The disproportionate racial and ethnic impact arises because of, among other things, the continuing disparity in income and wealth based on race and ethnicity, higher rates of poverty and unemployment among minorities, and persistent racial discrimination. Statistics show, for example, a disproportionate number of driver's license18suspensions in communities of color for nonpayment of fines. See id. Often, individuals need to drive in order to work. The disparate number of license suspensions contributes to higher unemployment among minorities, and to a higher incidence of convictions for driving with a suspended license, which carries even greater penalties. These disparities have resulted in waning trust in the justice system, particularly in communities of color, and hostile or even explosive relationships between lower income, minority communities and the police.2. Other Sources Have Also Documented Racial and Ethnic Disparity in the Imposition and Enforcement of FinesOther groups have also demonstrated the disproportionate racial impact of fines and fees on minority communities.A report by "Back on the Road California," a coalition of California civil-rights organizations, found, through analysis of public records from the California Department of Motor Vehicles and U.S. Census data, that, in California, "there are dramatic racial and socioeconomic disparities in driver's license suspensions and arrests related to unpaid traffic fines and fees." Back on the Road California, Stopped, Fined, Arrested: Racial Bias in Policing and Traffic Courts in California 1, 22-24 (2016), http://bit.ly/2PISx7M. As the report documented, "data collected from 15 police and sheriff's departments across California show that Black motorists are far more likely to be arrested for driving with a suspended license for failure to pay an infraction citation than White motorists." Id. at 1.The Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan public policy and law institute that focuses on19fundamental issues of democracy and justice, found that "African-Americans face a particularly severe burden" from the imposition of fines and fees. Brennan Center for Justice, Criminal Justice Debt: A Barrier to Reentry 4 (2010), http://bit.ly/2MS7TIm. In particular, because in at least seven States, individuals must pay off criminal justice debt before they can regain their eligibility to vote after a conviction, criminal justice debt disproportionately disenfranchises African-Americans.

The Department of Justice Has Similarly Identified Excessive Fines as a Significant Burden for Communities of ColorThe Department of Justice investigation in Ferguson, Missouri, also identified significant racial disparities in the imposition of fines and fees. Originally intended as an investigation into a police shooting of an African-American teenager, the DOJ20investigation produced a 105-page report on the City's allegedly exploitative, excessive system of fines. See United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department, 2, 3, 9, 10, 13 (Mar. 4, 2015), http://bit.ly/2ofK7bu; see also United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Dear Colleague Letter, 2 (Mar. 14, 2016), http://bit.ly/ 2O4LlkV (reminding state and local law enforcement agencies, in the wake of the Ferguson report, that practices related to the imposition of fines may "violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, when they unnecessarily impose disparate harm on the basis of race or national origin").4. Excessive Fines Have a Sordid History as Tools of Racial OppressionExcessive fines were used as tools in the postReconstruction and Jim Crow South to subordinate African-Americans. As one letter writer stated succinctly in a 1942 letter to the NAACP,the general practice of white land lords down here is to go into the county courts that meet in the spring of the year and `bail out' all available Negroes `convicted' of petty crimes, pay their fines, and have them placed into their custody and work them as long as they choose.Letter from Thomas Monroe Campbell, Tuskegee Institute, Alabama, to George C. Schuyler, NAACP (Mar. 3, 1942). George McCutcheon McBride wrote in the entry on "Peonage" in the 1934 Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, that[a]s a penalty for vagrancy or petty crimes, especially when committed by Negroes, it21became customary in many districts to impose a fine and to accept payment of this fine from some employer of labor, who in return secured the services of the culprit until the amount of the fine had been worked out. It was not difficult to bring about the accumulation of other debts by excessive charges for tools, food, lodgings and clothing advanced to the victim. Thus a system of long continued, if not permanent, involuntary servitude developed.Yosal Rogat, Mr. Justice Holmes: A Dissenting Opinion, 15 Stan. L. Rev. 254, 269-70 (1963) (quoting George McCutcheon McBride, Peonage, in 12 Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences 69, 71 (1934)).Those Jim Crow practices had roots in the period immediately following Reconstruction, where "minor breaches of sometimes vague laws made the [fine and fee] system a device for controlling blacks, whose omnipresence as free persons was found offensive by many whites." Aremona G. Bennett, Phantom Freedom: Official Acceptance of Violence to Personal Security and Subversion of Proprietary Rights and Ambitions Following Emancipation, 1865-1910, 70 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 439, 468 (1994). Scholars of the post-Reconstruction South have documented how excessive fines, among other excessive punishments, were enacted in that period for the purpose of racial oppression. See Douglas Blackmon, Slavery by Another Name 53-57, 63-69 (2008); Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877, at 198-205 (1988).22IV. The Excessive Fines Clause Protects the Fundamental Right to Equal JusticeThis Court has engaged in "selective incorporation" of the Bill of Rights into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The standard for incorporation is whether the right is "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," and "so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental." McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 760 (2010); see Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 148-49 (1968); Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325 (1937). The Excessive Fines Clause plays an essential role in protecting equal justice.This Court has recognized that protecting equal justice without regard to economic status is a key function of the Fourteenth Amendment. As shown in Part I, supra, in case after case this Court has recognized fundamental rights--such as access to courts and counsel, and protection from differential punishments on the basis of economic status--that are themselves merely instrumental to the preservation of equal justice. Those cases recognize that equal justice, without regard to economic status, is an indispensable component of ordered liberty. See Bearden, 461 U.S. at 666-69; Gideon, 372 U.S. at 343-45.The Excessive Fines Clause is an essential safeguard of equal justice. As shown in Part II, supra, for nearly a millennium an important aim of the Excessive Fines Clause has been to ensure equal justice by requiring that a fine be proportional to the offense and that it not exceed a defendant's ability to pay. Moreover, as shown in Part III, supra, there is23an overwhelming practical link between excessive fines and equal justice. Empirical evidence shows that fines not calibrated to ability to pay have had a disparate impact on both the poor and communities of color, in derogation of equal justice.Finally, the well-documented pervasive, nationwide racially disparate impact of excessive fines is further proof of its necessity in ensuring equal justice. "The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race." Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976). "Its aim was against discrimination because of race or color. As we have said more than once, its design was to protect an emancipated race, and to strike down all possible legal discriminations against those who belong to it." Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 310 (1879). To be sure, this Court has generally focused its constitutional inquiry on whether a law has a racially discriminatory purpose. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. at 239. But here, where the question is not whether to invalidate a law but whether to incorporate a constitutional right into the Due Process Clause, the calculus is different. Whether or not the disparate racial impact of excessive fines would be unconstitutional otherwise, the disparity adds another level--one of unique historical, legal, and sociological import--to the impairment of equal justice due to excessive fines. This evidence is another important building block in establishing the centrality of the Excessive Fines Clause in the concept of ordered liberty.24CONCLUSION Amicus curiae the American Bar Association respectfully urges that the Court reverse the decision below.Respectfully submitted,ROBERT N.

Though only 65 words long, Section 3 is sweeping in its breadth and devastating in its effect. Section 3 provides that, for purposes of every federal statute, regulation, and administrative ruling, the word "marriage" "means only a legal union between one man and one woman," and the word "spouse" means "only [ ] a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife." 1 U.S.C. § 7. For the first time, Section 3 creates a federal definition of "marriage" that applies to the entire United States Code, as well as every agency rule, and that excludes a specific group of persons legally married under state law.Section 3's purpose and effect are to bar legally married gay and lesbian couples from the federal protections and civic responsibilities that accrue to every other married couple. In so doing, the statute seriously undermines gay and lesbian couples' ability to protect and provide for each other and for their children, and it likewise undermines lawyers' ability to help their gay and lesbian clients achieve those objectives. Section 3's unprecedented discrimination against a discrete minority of couples legally married under the laws of their States is not justified by the rationales that have been advanced for it. The statute therefore cannot survive appropriate scrutiny under the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.75989710v.1I.SECTION 3 SINGLES OUT MARRIED GAYAND LESBIAN COUPLES BY EXCLUDINGTHEM FROM THE FEDERAL BENEFITSTHAT SUPPORT AND PROTECT ALLOTHER LEGALLY MARRIED COUPLESBy its terms, Section 3's restrictive definitions of "marriage" and "spouse" are incorporated into more than one thousand federal laws. See Massachusetts v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 682 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2012) ("DOMA affects a thousand or more generic cross-references to marriage in myriad federal laws."); Memorandum from Dayna K. Shah, Assoc. Gen. Counsel, Gen. Accounting Office, to Sen. Bill Frist (Jan. 23, 2004) (identifying, as of December 31, 2003, "a total of 1,138 federal statutory provisions classified to the United States Code in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving benefits, rights, and privileges").6 In virtually every instance, Section 3 works to the detriment of married gay and lesbian couples by withholding rights, benefits, and responsibilities that Congress has granted married heterosexual couples. The federal rights that accompany marriage are imparted to protect "the most important relation in life," Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 384 (1978), yet on account of Section 3 gay and lesbian married couples are excluded from them.When ABA members represent gay and lesbian clients in ordering their affairs and6 Available at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf.85989710v.1protecting the interests of their spouses and families, they observe firsthand Section 3's negative and sometimes dramatic effect on their clients' lives and marriages. They witness the ways in which Section 3 can prevent their married gay and lesbian clients from obtaining the security and stability for themselves and their children that federal law makes available automatically to heterosexual couples.These ABA members are also acutely aware that, because of Section 3, validly married gay and lesbian couples often must negotiate the legal complexities that result when state law regards them as married but federal law does not. Such "uncertainties [in marital status] are not merely technical, nor are they trivial; they affect fundamental rights and relations." Estin v. Estin, 334 U.S. 541, 553 (1948) (Jackson, J., dissenting). Gay and lesbian couples are thus doubly disadvantaged by Section 3.Moreover, attorneys often cannot adequately assist their married gay and lesbian clients in overcoming the obstacles erected by Section 3. While "creative" lawyering can sometimes be effective,7 many married gay and lesbian couples may not even be aware of all of the ways in which they are excluded from the legal protections that most married couples take for granted. Section 3, in7 See, e.g., In re Adoption of Patricia S., 976 A.2d 966, 967-68 (Me. 2009) (one partner adopts the other to form legally cognizable relationship for purposes of creating beneficiary status under a family trust where marriage is unavailable).95989710v.1short, requires married gay and lesbian couples to exercise a degree of legal sophistication that most people do not possess and is not expected of most couples.Even when aware of the need for legal counsel,married gay and lesbian couples may encounterdifficulty finding an attorney with the expertisenecessary to address problems that often do not haveclear-cut answers. Cf., e.g., U.S. Taxpayer AdvocateServ., 2012 Annual Report to Congress, Vol. 1, at 455(2012) ("In an evolving legal landscape, the IRS hasissued answers about domestic partners and same-sex spouses, but more questions have arisen.Despite requests, the IRS has yet to publishcomprehensive,authoritativeguidance.").8Moreover, the costs of legal services are oftensubstantial and are prohibitive for many couples,especially those couples with low incomes. SeeRandy Albelda et al., Poverty in the Lesbian, Gay,and Bisexual Community at iii (2009) (concludingthat after controlling for other factors, "gay andlesbian couples are significantly more likely to bepoor than their married heterosexualcounterparts");9 see generally Legal Servs. Corp.,Documenting the Justice Gap in America: TheCurrent Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low-Income8 Available at http://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/userfiles/ file/Full-Report/Status-Updates-Federal-Tax-Questions-Continueto-Trouble-Domestic-Partners-and-Same-Sex-Spouses.pdf.9 Available at http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wpcontent/uploads/Albelda-Badgett-Schneebaum-Gates-LGB-PovertyReport-March-2009.pdf.105989710v.1Americans 1 (2009) (finding that, among other things, fewer than one in five civil legal problems faced by low-income Americans is addressed with the assistance of a lawyer).10Section 3 therefore not only withholds a wide array of federal rights and protections from married gay and lesbian couples, but it usually leaves them and their lawyers with few or no sound legal options for approximating those rights. The difficulties presented by Section 3 arise in a range of settings, from procuring affordable health care to achieving financial security and, for binational couples, to navigating the immigration system.A. Health CareEnsuring that a spouse is physically cared for "in sickness and in health" is one of the bestrecognized responsibilities of marriage. Federal law offers an array of benefits that assist married couples in caring for one another's health and wellbeing. For example, under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"), qualified employees of covered companies are entitled to 12 weeks unpaid leave during a 12-month period, inter alia, to care for a seriously ill spouse. See 5 U.S.C. § 6382(a)(1)(C); 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C). At its core, the FMLA recognizes that no one should have to choose between a job and caring for a sick husband or wife. See 139 Cong. Rec. S1261 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 1993) (statement of Sen. Levin) ("[E]mployees should not be punished10 Available at http://www.lsc.gov/sites/default/files/LSC/pdfs/ documenting_the_justice_gap_in_america_2009.pdf.115989710v.1because they need time to take care of their families."); id. at S1260 (statement of Sen. Kerry) ("[T]he [FMLA] is an example of what we ought to mean when we talk about helping families help themselves.").Because of Section 3, however, married gay and lesbian employees are ineligible for FMLA leave to care for their sick spouses. See, e.g., Pedersen v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 881 F. Supp. 2d 294, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106713, at *20 (D. Conn. 2012) (describing how lesbian postal employee was denied request for FMLA leave to care for spouse during treatments for debilitating neck injury); cf. Lauren Eichmann, Carle Receives Guilty Verdict, Daily Illini (Dec. 1, 2004) (explaining that lesbian nurse was fired for taking time off to care for her dying partner of 18 years).11 Without the protection of the FMLA, unless they are eligible for state-mandated or employer-provided protections, these couples are left with little recourse.Married gays and lesbians who are among the country's more than 4.4 million federal employees face additional obstacles. Section 3 precludes them from adding their spouses to their federal health insurance and vision plans. See Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d 294, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106713, at *18 (explaining that Section 3 precluded a Naval employee from adding her wife to her federal health insurance plan); Golinski v. U.S. Office of Pers.11 Available at http://www.dailyillini.com/news/article_b1aae 23c-fce6-5290-ae66-d05641ec9645.html.125989710v.1Mgmt., 824 F. Supp. 2d 968, 974 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (describing how veteran staff attorney at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was denied health insurance coverage for her wife because of Section 3).As a result of Section 3, married gay and lesbian couples in which the sole breadwinner is a federal employee therefore have no options other than purchasing an individual policy for the nonworking spouse--typically more expensive than employer-provided insurance--or leaving the nonworking spouse uninsured. See, e.g., Mark W. Stanton, Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality, Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance: Trends in Cost and Access, Research in Action, at 2 (Sept. 2004) ("[E]mployment-based health insurance is likely to be less expensive than individually purchased coverage (for the same set of benefits) and typically provides a broader scope of benefits than is available in individually purchased coverage.").12Section 3 also adversely affects married gay and lesbian employees who work for private employers that extend health care coverage to samesex spouses. To encourage private employers to offer health insurance to the spouses of their employees, the tax code typically exempts employer and employee contributions to a spousal health plan. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. § 106(a); see also Treas. Reg. § 1.106-1 (excluding from gross income employer contributions to spousal health plan). Section 3,12 Available at www.ahrq.gov/research/empspria/empspria.pdf.135989710v.1however, ensures that the value of a gay or lesbian spouse's insurance coverage is treated as taxable compensation by the federal government. A gay or lesbian employee's contribution to a spouse's insurance premium also cannot be made on a pre-tax basis. These two extra taxes cost the average married or partnered gay or lesbian employee $1,069 per year. See M.V. Lee Badgett, Unequal Taxes on Equal Benefits: The Taxation of Domestic Partner Benefits 7 (2007).13Moreover, when a married gay or lesbian employee is laid off from a job, his or her spouse immediately will lose any employer-sponsored health insurance. Typically, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA") protects an employee's family by guaranteeing up to 18 months of continued health coverage after employment terminates, and up to 36 months of coverage after the employee dies. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1161-1163. Although COBRA protection extends to the employee's "spouse," id. § 1167(3)(A)(i), Section 3 disqualifies husbands and wives of gay and lesbian employees.B. Retirement PlanningSection 3 presents a tremendous obstacle to a married gay or lesbian couple's ability to plan for a financially secure future. Most married couples rely on Social Security, private savings plans, and, when13 Available at http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/ uploads/Badgett-UnequalTaxesOnEqualBenefits-Dec-2007.pdf.145989710v.1available, pensions to ensure that both spouses are provided for in retirement. Section 3, however, sharply limits the utility of all three retirement planning tools for married gay and lesbian couples, and there is little that lawyers can do to mitigate these harms.This is particularly true for married couples who intend to live on one spouse's pension during retirement. Because of Section 3's interplay with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), married gays and lesbians are denied automatic survivorship rights to their spouses' pensions. See 26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(11) (limiting statutory survivorship rights to federally recognized "spouse"); 29 U.S.C. § 1055(d)-(e) (same). Gay and lesbian retirees who rely on a pension are therefore helpless to protect their non-pensioned spouses. See, e.g., Pedersen, 881 F. Supp. 2d 294, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106713, at *19 (describing how surviving spouse was not permitted payments from deceased husband's pension due to Section 3).Similarly, gay and lesbian widows and widowers have no survivorship rights to their spouses' Social Security benefits. Typically, a decedent's qualified surviving spouse automatically receives a lump-sum payment and the amount of the decedent's monthly Social Security benefits (if it is greater than the surviving spouse's monthly benefits). See 42 U.S.C. § 402(e)-(f), (i). These policies are designed to avoid the impoverishment of elderly widows and widowers. But when a gay or lesbian person dies, the Social Security system provides no protection to his or her surviving spouse155989710v.1because of Section 3. See, e.g., Massachusetts, 682 F.3d at 12 ("[DOMA] . . . prevents the surviving spouse of a same-sex marriage from collecting Social Security survivor benefits.").14 The denial of Social Security survivorship benefits can cause serious hardship to gay and lesbian widows and widowers. In fact, 53% of married elderly couples receiving Social Security payments rely on those payments for more than half of their income, and for 23% of such couples, Social Security represents at least 90% of their income. See Soc. Sec. Admin., Fact Sheet (2012).15 In December 2012, 6.3 million widows and widowers received Social Security survivorship benefits. See id.16Section 3 also complicates a married gay or lesbian couple's ability to invest in Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRAs"). Typically, the annual maximum allowable contribution to an IRA is based on a person's income. But federal tax law permits a14 The Social Security Act contains gender-specific definitions of terms such as "husband" and "wife" that arguably could provide the Social Security Administration with an alternative basis to deny gay and lesbian widows and widowers Social Security survivorship benefits. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 402(b). Section 3 nevertheless stands as an absolute bar to such benefits.15 Available at http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/factsheets/basic fact-alt.pdf.16 Section 3 disfavors gay and lesbian married couples in the Social Security context even while both spouses are alive. While certain low-earning heterosexual spouses are entitled to special spousal benefits when their husbands or wives reach retirement age, the same benefits are not offered to low-earning gay or lesbian spouses. See 42 U.S.C. § 402(b)-(c).165989710v.1spouse filing a joint income tax return to determine his or her IRA contribution limit by reference to the total compensation earned by the couple. See 26 U.S.C. § 219(c). As a result, many married couples can significantly boost retirement savings by having a working spouse contribute to an IRA opened in the name of a nonworking spouse. Pursuant to Section 3, however, married gay and lesbian couples are not entitled to this benefit.C. ImmigrationThe United States has long recognized the importance of the marital bond in its immigration policy. For more than 50 years, the federal government has offered foreign spouses of U.S. citizens an expedited pathway to citizenship. See Immigration and Nationality Act, Pub. L. No. 82-414, ch. 2, § 319, 66 Stat. 163, 244-45 (1952) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1430(a)). An American citizen who marries a foreign national is also immediately eligible to petition for an immigrant visa on his or her spouse's behalf, and the foreign spouse can simultaneously apply for permanent resident status. See id., ch. 1, § 205(b), 66 Stat. at 180 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i)).17These provisions are central to our Nation's immigration policy. Yet Section 3 denies marital recognition to binational gay and lesbian couples. As17 As early as 1924, the United States began providing immigration visas to the wives (though not the husbands) of U.S. citizens. See Immigration Act of 1924, Pub. L. No. 68-139, ch. 190, §§ 4(a), 8, 43 Stat. 153, 155, 157.175989710v.1a result, binational gay and lesbian couples can be forcibly separated by the United States government notwithstanding their legally valid marriages.18 See, e.g., Michael Martinez, Gay Married Immigrant Fights Deportation in California, CNN.com (Mar. 23, 2012).19Because our immigration system is based on federal rules and regulations, Section 3 poses enormous obstacles to lawyers who wish to aid their gay and lesbian clients in this area. This is no small problem: According to a recent study, an estimated 40,000 gay and lesbian couples living in the United States include at least one partner who is not a citizen. See Craig J. Konnoth & Gary J. Gates,18 The Obama administration recently declared that it would consider the existence of a same-sex relationship when exercising prosecutorial discretion in commencing, closing, or staying removal proceedings. See Letter from Janet Napolitano, Sec'y of Dep't of Homeland Sec., to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Sept. 27, 2012), available at http://www.metro weekly.com/poliglot/12-3384%20Pelosi%20S1%20signed%20response %2009.27.12.pdf. The new policy, however, does not carry the force of law and therefore can be reversed by this or any future administration. Moreover, the policy does not provide the pathway to legal status that heterosexual foreign nationals who marry American citizens are granted. A gay or lesbian foreign national therefore must have an independent basis to live or work legally in the United States alongside a citizen spouse.19 Available at http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/22/us/californiagay-deportation/index.html.185989710v.1Same-sex Couples and Immigration in the United States 1 (2011).20Section 3 also undermines the marital bonds of gay and lesbian couples in which both spouses are foreign.21 For example, the heterosexual spouse of a foreign national granted asylum is automatically entitled to asylum so that the couple can live together in the United States (even if the spouse would not have been entitled to asylum independently). See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(A). For married gay and lesbian couples, however, each spouse must prove entitlement to asylum.D. Military BenefitsFrom our founding, American society has expressed its "high regard for the special place that military heroes hold in our tradition." United States v. Alvarez, 132 S. Ct. 2537, 2550 (2012) (plurality opinion). Our federal laws embody that commitment and offer an array of benefits to veterans and current members of the armed services. See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Federal Benefits for Veterans, Dependents and Survivors (2012).22 Many of these20 Available at http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-con tent/uploads/Gates-Konnoth-Binational-Report-Nov-2011.pdf.21 Same-sex civil marriages are validly performed in 11 countries as well as parts of Mexico. See BBC News, Gay Marriage: Party Leaders Hail Vote (Feb. 5, 2013), http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-21321731.22 Available at http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_ book/2012_Federal_benefits_ebook_final.pdf.195989710v.1benefits extend to military spouses and children. Among other things, military spouses are entitled to military health insurance, survivorship payments, and burial alongside a spouse at a VA national cemetery. Id. at 70, 98-109. These benefits recognize not only the sacrifices made by service members' families but also that service members perform their duties better if they know that their loved ones are being cared for. See S. Rep. No. 93235 (1973), reprinted in 1973 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1579, 1585.Section 3 denies many of these benefits from the husbands and wives of gay and lesbian service members.23 Although the Department of Defense recently extended a handful of benefits to gay and lesbian military spouses, more than 100 other benefits available to opposite-sex military spouses remain inaccessible because of Section 3. See Ernesto Londoño, Pentagon to Extend Certain Benefits to Same-Sex Spouses, Washington Post.com (Feb. 5, 2013).24One such benefit is health insurance. Lawyers cannot mitigate the harm Section 3 causes to gay and lesbian military spouses when they cannot afford or otherwise obtain health insurance. See, e.g., Complaint, McLaughlin v. Panetta, No. 11-cv-23 The eligibility of gay and lesbian military spouses for military benefits may also be limited by 38 U.S.C. § 101(3), (31) (limiting definition of "spouse" in context of veterans' benefits to married persons of opposite sex).24 Available at http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-0205/world/36758629_1_openly-gay-troops-couples-gay-servicemembers.205989710v.111905, at ¶¶ 42-45, 50-53 (D. Mass. Oct. 27, 2011) (describing how one uninsured military spouse travels to Mexico for affordable medical procedures and another has put off necessary surgery).Gay and lesbian spouses also may be ineligible for certain financial protections when a service member spouse dies. Typically, upon the death of a service member or veteran, the military provides a surviving spouse with a monthly survivorship stipend. See 38 U.S.C. § 1311. Low-income surviving spouses of war veterans additionally receive the Survivors' Pension.25 None of these financial protections are offered to the spouses of gay and lesbian service members or veterans, however.26E. TaxesAs demonstrated by this very case, when gay and lesbian couples' marriages are not recognized by the federal government, they may bear substantial tax burdens that married heterosexual couples do not face. For example, federal law typically exempts from estate taxes all property that passes to a surviving spouse who is an American citizen. See 26 U.S.C. § 2056(a). This exemption recognizes that a married couple is a unit, and taxation on marital25 See http://benefits.va.gov/pensionandfiduciary/pension/spouse pen.asp.26 Similarly, the spouses of gay and lesbian public safety officers who die in the line of duty are not eligible for the death benefits that are paid to the spouses of all other safety officers. See 42 U.S.C. § 3796(a)(1).215989710v.1property is therefore deferred until both spouses have died or the property is otherwise relinquished. See Estate of Turner, 138 T.C. 14, 20 (T.C. 2012). But because Section 3 prevents the I.R.S. from recognizing her marriage, Edith Windsor was forced to pay more than $300,000 in federal estate taxes on her own marital property.The gift tax is a related example. Federal law recognizes that spouses transfer money and items of value to each other all the time. See S. Rep. No. 97144, at 127 (1981). The tax code therefore provides heterosexual married couples with an unlimited exemption from the federal gift tax. See 26 U.S.C. § 2523. Almost any transfer of value27 from one gay or lesbian spouse to the other, however, is viewed as a "gift" by the federal government, and a spouse who transfers more than $14,000 in value in any given year must report that "gift" to the I.R.S. See Rev. Proc. 2012-41(3.19).28 Once a couple exceeds a lifetime exclusion amount, every transfer of wealth within the marital relationship in excess of the annual exemption--everything from Christmas presents to half the value of a jointly owned home to the value of a deceased spouse's estate--may be taxed by the federal government at a marginal rate as high as 40%. See American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112- 240, § 101(c)(1), (3)(A), 126 Stat. 2313 (2013).27 Certain medical and educational payments are exempt from the gift tax rules. See 26 U.S.C. § 2503(e).28 This threshold is easily surpassed. Indeed, it can happen if one spouse purchases a new car for the other or even pays the mortgage for the couple's home.225989710v.1Married gay and lesbian couples also face significant burdens related to their income taxes. In seven of the jurisdictions where same-sex marriage is recognized,29 married gay and lesbian couples must file their state and local income taxes as married but their federal income taxes as single. Filing with different statuses in different jurisdictions is complicated and often requires assistance from tax lawyers and accountants. Moreover, according to one recent analysis, the inability to file federal income taxes as "married" costs the average gay or lesbian couple several thousand dollars each year.30 See Blake Ellis, SameSex Spouses Lose Big on Taxes, CNN Money.com (Dec. 31, 2011);31 see also M.V. Lee Badgett, The Same-Sex Marriage Divide: The Economic Value of Marriage for Same-Sex Couples, 58 Drake L. Rev. 1081, 1089 (2010) (concluding that 66% of married gay couples in Massachusetts would save on average29 The seven jurisdictions are Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, and the District of Columbia. New Hampshire and Washington also issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples but have no state income tax. In Maryland, the tenth jurisdiction that recognizes same-sex marriage, married gay and lesbian couples presently must file as single.30 Although the average gay or lesbian couple pays higher income taxes, some married gay and lesbian couples may pay lower income taxes when they are required to file separately, as explained by amicus Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. (Br. at 12-20.)31 Available at http://money.cnn.com/2011/12/26/pf/taxes/gay_ marriage_taxes/index.htm?hpt=hp_t2.235989710v.1$2,325 on their federal income taxes if they could file as married).32F. Ethical ResponsibilitiesBeyond withholding critical rights from married gay and lesbian couples, Section 3 also exempts them from certain legal obligations. Federal anti-nepotism laws provide a case in point. Federal officials with hiring or supervisory authority are barred by statute from appointing, employing, promoting, or advancing their spouses to positions within governmental agencies. See 5 U.S.C. § 3110(a)(3). By virtue of Section 3, however, married gay or lesbian federal officials are not bound by this law as to their spouses. By the same token, federal decision-makers are typically precluded from participating in any decision in which they or their spouses have a financial stake. See 18 U.S.C. § 208(a). But because Section 3 bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages, gay and lesbian employees can decide an issue that directly affects their spouses. See also 2 U.S.C. § 31-2 (Senate restrictions on accepting gifts extends to recognized "spouse").Attorneys who advise on government ethics issues are left in a difficult position when counseling clients because Section 3 authorizes conduct that most observers would argue, but for Section 3, would32 As discussed above, see supra at 13-14, Section 3 also causes gay and lesbian couples to suffer negative tax ramifications if one spouse is added to the other's employerbased health insurance plan.245989710v.1be illegal. In enacting Section 3, however, Congress seems not to have considered this practical effect of the law. See Massachusetts, 682 F.3d at 13 (noting that "only one day of hearings was held on DOMA" and "none of the testimony concerned DOMA's effects on the numerous federal programs at issue"). Now that nearly one-fifth of the States have exercised their prerogative to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry, the sweeping, harsh, and, in this instance, unintended impact of Section 3 has become clear.II. SECTION3'SUNPRECEDENTEDEXCLUSION OF A DISCRETE GROUPOF LEGALLY MARRIED COUPLESFROM FEDERAL BENEFITS ANDRESPONSIBILITIESCONTRAVENESEQUAL-PROTECTION PRINCIPLESThe governmental interests advanced in support of Section 3 cannot justify the unprecedented exclusion of one group, legally married gay and lesbian couples, from all of the federal benefits and responsibilities of marriage. Whether Section 3 is subjected to the heightened scrutiny accorded suspect classifications, see, e.g., Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 259, 265 (1978) (plurality opinion) (illegitimacy); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 690-91 (1973) (plurality opinion) (gender), or the type of rationalbasis review this Court has employed for similar non-economic regulations targeting a particular minority group, see Romer, 517 U.S. at 631-35 (gays and lesbians); City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 446-47 (1985) (the mentally disabled); U.S. Dep't of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S.255989710v.1528, 534-38 (1973) (households with unrelated members), it fails to pass constitutional muster.The ABA will not repeat the parties' arguments on this issue but will focus on one specific point: Section 3 is without precedent in federal law. Never before has the federal government adopted a definition of marriage that applies across the board to every federal statute and regulation and that excludes a class of people who are legally married under the laws of their States. Indeed, the regulation of domestic relations in general, and marriage in particular, is "an area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States." Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 404 (1975).The novelty of Section 3's intrusion into an area traditionally reserved to the States strongly supports two conclusions. First, Section 3 warrants careful review. As this Court noted in Romer, "[t]he absence of precedent for [a law] is itself instructive; `discriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to [equal protection].'" 517 U.S. at 633 (quoting Louisville Gas & Elec. Co. v. Coleman, 277 U.S. 32, 37-38 (1928)). Second, the "unique federal interests" proffered by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group ("BLAG") (Br. at 21) in support of Section 3--which essentially amount to assertions that Section 3 preserves each sovereign's ability to define marriage and that there is a need for a uniform federal definition of marriage--cannot support Section 3's singular withdrawal of the benefits of marriage from gay and lesbian couples.265989710v.1Section 3 accordingly cannot survive appropriate scrutiny under equal-protection principles.A. Section 3's Unprecedented Intrusion into an Area Traditionally Reserved to the States Signals the Need for Careful ReviewThis Court stated long ago that "[t]he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws of the United States." Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.S. 1, 12 (2004) (quoting In re Burrus, 136 U.S. 586, 593 (1890)). Subject to constitutional constraints, the States have always had "the absolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the marriage relation between its own citizens shall be created." Sosna, 419 U.S. at 404 (quoting Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 734-35 (1878)); see also, e.g., Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 703 (1992) (recognizing traditional exception to statutory federal diversity jurisdiction for domestic relations matters); Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581, 587 (1989) ("[D]omestic relations are preeminently matters of state law."); Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 435 (1979) ("Family relations are a traditional area of state concern."); De Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U.S. 570, 580 (1956) ("[T]here is no federal law of domestic relations, which is primarily a matter of state concern."). Indeed, Congress acknowledged when it enacted Section 3 that "[t]he determination of who may275989710v.1marry in the United States is uniquely a function of state law." H.R. Rep. No. 104-664, at 3 (1996).Before Section 3, then, there was no general federal definition of "marriage." Almost without exception, federal law simply deferred to state law, treating as married any couple legally married under the laws of their State. See, e.g., Lembcke v. United States, 181 F.2d 703, 706 (2d Cir. 1950) (concluding that the validity of a marriage for purposes of qualifying for military spousal survivorship benefits depended on whether the marriage was recognized by state law); Brown v. United States, 164 F.2d 490, 490 (3d Cir. 1947) (deferring to state law to determine whether claimant on deceased soldier's federal life insurance policy was his wife).33By barring a specific class of couples legally married under state law from the federal rights and responsibilities that accompany marriage, Section 3 broke with two centuries of tradition reserving the realm of domestic relations to the States. "[S]ometimes the most telling indication of a severe constitutional problem is the lack of historical precedent for Congress's action." Nat'l Fed. of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2586 (2012) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Section 3's unprecedented incursion into the33 When Congress has defined terms relating to marriage in the past, it has done so in the context of specific statutes and in furtherance of a specific governmental interest other than the exclusion of an entire class of married persons from all of the federal benefits accompanying marriage. See Massachusetts, 682 F.3d at 12 (citing as example 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(b)(1)(A)(i), which guards against immigration fraud).285989710v.1traditional province of the States, at a minimum, calls for careful examination.Moreover, it is a commonplace that federal statutes are presumed not to alter the traditional federal-state balance. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 275 (2006); Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cnty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 531 U.S. 159, 173 (2001); BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp., 511 U.S. 531, 544 (1994); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991). A statute that does alter that balance--and does so as dramatically as Section 3-- should be examined carefully to ensure that its classifications, in light of the justifications advanced for them, satisfy the Constitution's demands. See, e.g., Massachusetts, 682 F.3d at 6 ("Given that DOMA intrudes broadly into an area of traditional state regulation, a closer examination of the justifications that would prevent DOMA from violating equal protection . . . is uniquely reinforced by federalism concerns.").B. Section 3 Cannot Survive Appropriate Scrutiny under Equal-Protection PrinciplesBy "deem[ing] a class of [married] persons a stranger to [federal] laws," Romer, 517 U.S. at 635, notwithstanding recognition by a couple's State of their marriage, Section 3 denies that class of persons--here, legally married gay and lesbian couples--equal protection. Even under the rationalbasis review applied in Romer, none of the governmental interests proffered in support of Section 3 can justify its sweeping exclusion of295989710v.1lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from the federal rights and responsibilities of marriage.BLAG offers four "unique federal interests" that purportedly justify Section 3: (1) it "preserves each sovereign's ability to define marriage for itself" (Br. at 30-33) (capitalization omitted); (2) it fills the need for a "uniform federal definition" of marriage (Br. at 33-37); (3) it permits States to "act as laboratories of democracy" while the federal government reserves judgment on same-sex marriage (Br. at 41-43); and (4) it protects the public fisc (Br. at 37-41). BLAG also contends that Section 3 promotes traditional marriage and child-rearing (Br. at 43-49). Section 3 rationally furthers none of these asserted interests.BLAG's first three justifications for Section 3 founder in light of the States' long-standing primacy in defining marriage. First, Section 3 does not "preserve each sovereign's ability to define marriage for itself." The federal government, as one of those sovereigns, has never defined marriage for itself, and even under Section 3's regime it still does not. As amici curiae Family Law Professors explained in detail in the court below, the regulation of marriage has always varied from State to State in numerous ways. See Family Law Prof. Br. at 7-9. For instance, the minimum age to marry, the permitted and proscribed degree of consanguinity, and recognition of common-law marriage differ in different States. See id. Section 3 does not change this and thus does not enable the federal government to define marriage for itself. Federal law continues, by and large, to treat as married anyone who is validly married305989710v.1under state law, notwithstanding differences among the States--except that it repudiates, across the board, one particular class of marriages that certain States have chosen to permit.Second, if the goal were to create a "uniform federal definition" of marriage or to ensure national uniformity in eligibility for federal benefits, Section 3 again fails. BLAG asserts (Br. at 36) that "when state definitions of marriage vary only in the details, it is understandable and commendable for federal law to borrow those definitions," but "when a state is on the verge of making a fundamental change to the definition, that creates a need for Congress to choose between uniformity and borrowing (a need that simply did not exist before)." But if the goal is uniformity, it should not matter what the differences are; a common-law marriage valid in some States but not others does not fit within a uniform definition of marriage or ensure national uniformity in eligibility for federal benefits. The need for Congress to choose between uniformity and borrowing has always existed, and Congress has historically chosen to borrow, and continues to borrow, except in the case of valid same-sex marriages.Third, the notion that Section 3 permits the States to "act as laboratories of democracy" simply ignores what Section 3 actually says and does. BLAG invokes Justice Brandeis's famous statement that "[i]t is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory" for "novel social and economic experiments." New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J.,315989710v.1dissenting). But far from promoting such efforts by the States, Section 3 hinders them. While Section 3 does not, by its terms, prevent a State from recognizing same-sex marriage or preempt its decision to do so, it nonetheless "burden[s] the choice of [S]tates . . . to regulate the rules and incidents of marriage." Massachusetts, 682 F.3d at 12. For example, a State that permits married gay and lesbian couples to combine their income for Medicaid purposes--as married heterosexual couples may do-- could have its federal funding rescinded for noncompliance with Section 3. Id. at 7.More fundamentally, Section 3 thwarts the democratic process by preventing States from allowing their gay and lesbian citizens a truly equal share in the benefits and responsibilities of civil marriage. If Congress wanted to encourage the States to choose freely which marriages they would permit, it would have continued to recognize all marriages valid under state law. As it is, Section 3 undermines States' ability to treat their gay and lesbian citizens equally by ensuring that no matter what a State does, married gay and lesbian couples will not enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as married heterosexual couples in that same State.Likewise, protecting the public fisc is not a sufficient reason for excluding a discrete minority group from benefits otherwise offered to all. See Romer, 517 U.S. at 635 (rejecting interest in "conserving resources" as a rational basis for law excluding gays and lesbians from civil-rights protections); Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 227 (1982) ("[A] concern for the preservation of resources325989710v.1standing alone can hardly justify the classification used in allocating those resources."); see also U.S. Br. at 46-47; Windsor Br. at 53-54.Finally, Section 3 does nothing to promote traditional marriage and child-rearing; it merely penalizes gay and lesbian married couples without affecting heterosexual couples. See U.S. Br. at 41-44; Windsor Br. at 39-47. As a purely logical matter, excluding gay and lesbian couples from federal benefits cannot create an incentive for heterosexual couples to marry or raise children responsibly. "This is not merely a matter of poor fit of remedy to perceived problem, but a lack of any demonstrated connection between DOMA's treatment of same-sex couples and its asserted goal of strengthening the bonds and benefits to society of heterosexual marriage." Massachusetts, 682 F.3d at 15 (citations omitted).Ultimately, none of these purported governmental interests can justify Section 3's disparate treatment of legally married persons similarly situated in all respects except for the gender of their spouses. Whatever Congress's reasons may have been in enacting it, Section 3 contravenes the equal protection of the laws.335989710v.1CONCLUSIONThe judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.Respectfully submitted,OF COUNSEL:TRAVIS J.

I. The American Bar Association Standards for Pretrial Release, Advocating Citation Rather Than Arrest for Most Minor Offenses, Represent a Realistic, Balanced, and Reasonable Policy.A. The ABA Criminal Justice Standards Are Developed and Adopted Through a Process That Ensures a Realistic and Balanced Policy Reflecting the Reasonable Consensus of the Law Enforcement Community.The ABA's Pretrial Release Standards are the tenth chapter in the ABA's overall Criminal Justice Standards project. See American Bar Association, Criminal Justice Section Standards Homepage, www.abanet.org/crimjust/standards/home.html (linking to all 20 of the ABA's Criminal Justice Standards sets). The Standards represent the consensus views of a wide diversity of legal interests. The final Standards, adopted after many months of study and review, present balanced and realistic guidance regarding reasonable law enforcement practices, toward the ultimate goal of providing an effective yet fair criminal justice system in American society. As explained in the Introduction to the Prosecution Function and Defense Function Standards, the Standards are:8the result of careful drafting and meticulous and extensive review by representatives of all segments of the criminal Justice system: judges, prosecutors, private defense counsel, public defenders, court personnel, and academics active in criminal justice teaching and research. Circulation of the standards to a number of individuals with a wide range of outside expertise in criminal justice has also assured the consideration of a rich array of comment and criticism that has greatly strengthened the quality of the final product.American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function (ABA 3d ed. 1993), at xii.In 2006, the Chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards Committee further described the careful and balanced process by which the Standards are developed. Irwin Schwarz, "Introduction to Criminal Justice Standards," in The State of Criminal Justice 2006 (ABA 2007), at 69­70:The Standards are a valued criminal justice asset largely because of the process through which they are created. Each set of Standards is developed through three levels of drafting and review before it reaches the House of Delegates for final approval as ABA policy. At each of the three levels--Task Force, Standards Committee, and Criminal Justice Section Council--the draft Standards are refined by ABA members who represent the views of the criminal justice community--prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges9and academicians. The Task Forces, the Standards Committee and the CJS Council are numerically balanced in their composition, by design, to assure that all sectors of the criminal justice community are represented in the process. In addition, each of those entities receives input from liaisons from professional associations such as the National Association of Attorneys General, the National Association of District Attorneys, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association. Development and approval of a set of Standards may require three to six years.Thus the Criminal Justice Standards, once they are finally adopted by the ABA, represent the careful study and considered thinking of a wide range of legal and law enforcement interests over a significant period of time. They are revised to address the concerns of law enforcement. They strike a reasonable balance between effective law enforcement and the rights of all Americans.The ABA Standards on Pretrial Release were first promulgated in 1968. See 1968 Pretrial Release Standards. A second edition was adopted by the ABA after full reconsideration in 1979, and a Supplemental Edition was adopted, again after careful review, in 1985. See American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice, Pretrial Release (ABA 2d ed. 1980), at Chapter 10; American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice, Pretrial Release (ABA 2d ed. Supp. 1986), at Chapter 10. The10current, third edition of the Pretrial Release Standards was adopted by the ABA, again after a complete review, in 2002, and was then published with Commentary in 2007. See 2007 Pretrial Release Standards.Thus the ABA has studied, reviewed, and adopted Standards on Pretrial Release on four different occasions over the past four decades. Throughout that period, Standard 2.2, recommending citation and release rather than arrest, absent additional factors indicating danger or likelihood of nonappearance, has remained the consistent policy of the ABA. Over time, many jurisdictions have adopted citation and release statutes and rules based on the ABA model. See Whitcomb, Citation Release, supra, at 3 ("As of 1981, all but nine states" had adopted statutes or rules for citation and release; "the procedure is now in use in 45 states"). These procedures have proven to be fair, effective, and costefficient over time. Id. at vii (reporting one study showing cost savings of almost 100% by the use of field citations rather than arrest). Thus the ABA's reasonable, consensus Standards here have had widespread influence and proven effective in the jurisdictions that have adopted them.B. The ABA Standards on Pretrial Release Reasonably Require Citation and Release for Most Minor Offenses, Absent Factors Indicating Danger or Likelihood of NonAppearance.Before presenting the rationale for the ABA's citation and release Standards (see infra, section I(C)),11amicus presents and summarizes the text of the relevant Standards and Commentary here. The full text of Standards 10-2.1 to 10-2.4 is reprinted in the Appendix to this Brief.First, the ABA Standards on Pretrial Release state a general policy favoring release over detention, pretrial, when consistent with public safety and ensuring that offenders will reappear for the judicial process. Needless detention is disfavored, because it is "harsh and oppressive" as well as expensive for law enforcement:Standard 10-1.1 Purposes of pretrial release decisionThe purposes of the pretrial release decision include providing due process to those accused of crime, maintaining the integrity of the judicial process by securing defendants for trial, and protecting victims, witnesses, and the community from threats, danger, or interference. . . . The law favors the release of defendants pending adjudication of charges. Deprivation of liberty pending trial is harsh and oppressive, subjects defendants to economic and psychological hardships, interferes with their ability to defend themselves, and, in many instances, deprives their families of support . . . .Part II of the Pretrial Release Standards then addresses "Release by Law Enforcement Officer Acting Without an Arrest Warrant." This Part begins by recommending generally that States adopt stat-12utes that favor citation over arrest for minor offenses:Standard 10-2.1 Policy favoring issuance of citationsIt should be the policy of every law enforcement agency to issue citations in lieu of arrest or continued custody to the maximum extent consistent with the effective enforcement of the law. This policy should be implemented by statutes of statewide applicability.In particular, when a person is stopped for a minor offense, the Standards recommend that release be required once a citation has been issued, unless facts that reasonably suggest danger or a likelihood of non-appearance are present. App. 5. Specific factors that would permit arrest even for minor offenses are laid out, including whenever "necessary to ensure the safety of any person or the community." Standard 10-2.2(c), App. 5­6. This is the Standard that Virginia adopted in the statute that the Virginia Supreme Court found was violated here:Standard 10-2.2 Mandatory issuance of citation for minor offenses(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c), a police officer who has grounds to arrest a person for a minor offense should be required to issue a citation in lieu of taking the accused to the police station or to court.13...(c) The defendant may be detained when an otherwise lawful arrest or detention is necessary to ensure the safety of any person or the community, or when the accused:(i) is subject to lawful arrest and fails to identify himself or herself satisfactorily;(ii) refuses to sign the citation after the officer explains to the accused that the citation does not constitute an admission of guilt and represents only the accused's promise to appear;(iii) has no ties to the jurisdiction reasonably sufficient to ensure the accused's appearance in court and there is a substantial likelihood that the accused will refuse to respond to a citation;(iv) previously has failed to appear in response to a citation, summons, or other legal process for an offense;(v) is not in compliance with release conditions in another case, is subject to a court order or is on probation or parole; or(vi) poses a substantial likelihood of continuing the criminal conduct if not arrested.Standard 10-2.3 then encourages law enforcement agencies to promulgate regulations "to increase the use of citations to the greatest degree consistent14with public safety." App. 11. As the U.S. Department of Justice reported in Whitcomb et al., Citation Release, supra, at 3, "the procedure is now in use in 45 states."Finally, Standard 10-2.4 addresses "Lawful Searches," to make clear that if an officer makes a "lawful arrest" of an offender, and then decides to cite and release the offender, the subsequent release on citation "should not affect the lawfulness" of any prior search conducted incident to that lawful arrest. App. 12. However, as the Commentary to Standard 10-2.4 notes, "once a citation is issued the police officer has no authority to search unless a basis other than incident to arrest is apparent." App. 13 n.31.Standard 10-2-4 Lawful SearchesWhen an officer makes a lawful arrest, the defendant's subsequent release on citation should not affect the lawfulness of any search incident to the arrest.CommentaryThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution permits the police to perform warrantless searches of defendants incident to lawful arrest. [n. 31]n.31: . . . once a citation is issued the police officer has no authority to search unless a basis other than incident to arrest is apparent (e.g., plain view). See Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U.S. 113 (1998) . . . .15C. The Rationale for the ABA's "Citation and Release" Standards, Pretrial Release Standards 10-2.1 to 102.4, Reflects a Realistic, Balanced, and Reasonable View.The overarching rationale for the ABA's citation and release Standards is clear: when there are no factors present that reasonably counsel arrest (danger or a likelihood of non-appearance), then it is costeffective for law enforcement agencies, as well as significantly more protective of individual privacy and liberty, to cite and release a minor offender rather than engage full-blown custodial arrangements. Arresting a minor offender, when no factors that reasonably counsel arrest are present, is simply unreasonable.As the ABA noted in 1968 when it first promulgated Standards on Pretrial Release, "[t]he public . . . suffers when defendants are unnecessarily detained." 1968 Pretrial Release Standards, at 3. Not only is needless expense incurred by government agencies when effectuating, processing, and maintaining custody, but individual liberty is unnecessarily sacrificed. Id.; accord 2007 Pretrial Release Standards, at 64, App. 3. Police agencies cannot realistically afford to take into custody all persons whom they have probable cause to believe have violated the law. Nor should persons who present no apparent danger nor risk of non-appearance be subjected to the disruptive and intrusive accoutrements that accompany a fullcustody arrest and processing. In general, criminal offenses that are adjudged to be minor, as defined by the legislative branch that a democracy entrusts to16write the criminal laws, do not normally present events that reasonably require full custodial detention and processing after the citation process is complete.Thus the diverse ABA membership, which includes many prosecutors as well as law enforcement personnel, has stated its balanced view: absent reasonable ground for further detention, probable cause to believe a defendant has violated a minor criminal law is not reasonably sufficient to justify further detention after the defendant has cooperated with the citation process.4As the drafters of the ABA Standards recognized, however, any "citation and release" policy must sensibly balance the rationale for release against the serious needs of criminal law enforcement and the judicial system. Thus Standard 10-2.2 provides a number of reasonable exceptions to the policy of citation and release. The Commentary recognizes that "a bright-line rule prohibiting arrests for minor offenses is not appropriate." 2007 Pretrial Release4 The most detailed explication of the citation and release Standards' rationale appears in the Commentary to the Second Edition of the Pretrial Release Standards, supra, at 10-22 to 1029. "[A]rrest ought not to be the automatic response to every criminal law violation. When arrest serves no legitimate purpose, police ought to be authorized--and in clear cases required--to utilize the less restrictive alternative of citation release." American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice, Pretrial Release (ABA 2d ed. 1980) at 10-22. This Commentary also details that the ABA's policy here "is consistent with most other national standards," including that of the National Association of District Attorneys, the NAC, and the American Law Institute. Id.17Standards at 67, App. 9. Thus Standard 10-2.2(c) provides that even minor offense defendants "may be detained when an otherwise lawful arrest or detention is necessary to ensure the safety of any person or the community . . . ." App. 5. In addition to this safety exception, the Standard permits arrest when the accused fails to identify him or herself or otherwise refuses to cooperate; has no ties to the jurisdiction; has previously failed to appear on a citation; is already subject to some other lawful restraint (court order, probation or parole); or is likely to continue the criminal conduct. 2007 Pretrial Release Standards, Standards 2.2(c)(i) to (vi), App. 5­6.As the Commentary to Standard 10-2.2(c) explains, these exceptions allow for "permissive" arrest discretion in the individual officer on the scene, while attempting to limit the "broad discretion" of officers that can sometimes result in harassment or discriminatory enforcement. 2007 Pretrial Release Standards at 67, App. 9­10; see, e.g., Chicago v.

Absent reasonable grounds to arrest, the ABA's Standards reasonably circumscribe an officer's arrest authority.D. Many Jurisdictions (Including Virginia) Have Adopted Citation and Release Policies, and Their Continued Use Reflects Their Reasonableness in Practical Operation.The balanced reasonableness of the ABA's Pretrial Release Standards is demonstrated by the many18jurisdictions that have adopted some form of "citation and release" policy for minor offenses since 1968. The ABA is not aware of any current published source that gathers all such authorities--which is perhaps unsurprising because such provisions are not uniformly worded (making electronic database searching difficult), and are often scattered among dozens if not hundreds of minor criminal violation statutes rather than in a general statutory section as Virginia has chosen. Nevertheless, over 20 years ago the U.S. Department of Justice's National Institute of Justice reported that "all but nine States" had adopted such policies, and that citation and release procedures were in use in at least 45 States. Whitcomb et al., Citation Release, supra, at 3. Similarly, in this case, the Amici Brief filed by Texas's prosecutors and other States, supporting the petitioner, notes that "many jurisdictions have chosen to limit warrantless misdemeanor arrests." Brief Amici Curiae of Texas et al., at 24­26 & n.6 (providing examples).5 The ABA's own recent research reveals the statutes cited in the following footnote from at least 26 jurisdictions (24 States plus the District of Columbia and Guam), that express "citation and release" statutory requirements for some minor of-5 It is significant that this Amici Brief in support of the Petitioner, as well as the Brief of Petitioner in this case, is filed by the chief prosecution authority in the listed jurisdictions, and not the legislative authorities of those jurisdictions. Presumably the legislatures of jurisdictions that have adopted and retained citation and release statutes and rules would defend those policies as reasonable.19fenses.6 Amicus has no doubt that there are many, many more such policies in place across the country.This Court has noted that the "ultimate touchstone" for Fourth Amendment analysis is "reasonableness."

The Standards balance the legitimate needs, and scarce resources, of law enforcement, together with the legitimate concerns of individuals stopped for minor offenses who present no danger to others or of nonappearance. The fact that many jurisdictions have adopted citation and release policies further supports the ABA's submission. Amicus respectfully urges this Court to consider these policies as it evaluates the constitutional issues in this case.II. As Applied to This Case, the ABA's Pretrial Release Standards Support the Conclusion of the Virginia Supreme Court That the Unlawful Arrest, and Subsequent Search, by Virginia Authorities Were Unreasonable.In this case, the Virginia Supreme Court unanimously ruled that an arrest for the misdemeanor of driving with a suspended license violated a Virginia statute that requires, in the absence of circumstances that reasonably require further detention, citation and release rather than arrest. Moore v. Virginia, 636 S.E.2d 395, 396 & n.3, 399­400 (2006) (citing Virginia Code § 19.2-74(A)(1) ("when a police officer detains a person for a Class I misdemeanor,sis added). Indeed, by the Amendment's terms, "probable cause" refers only to warrants.21the officer `shall . . . issue a summons . . . .'"). The Virginia Court affirmed the en banc Virginia Court of Appeals' determination that "the record is devoid of evidence" to support an exception to the statute. 636 S.E.2d at 396 n.3. Because Moore's full-custody arrest violated the Virginia statute, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that there could be no "lawful[ ] . . . search incident to an arrest." Id. at 399­400.This Virginia "citation and release" statute, adopted in 1974, was based directly on the ABA's Pretrial Release Standards as first promulgated in 1968. Those Standards expressly advocated that States and local jurisdictions adopt its recommended citation and release structure. See 1968 Pretrial Release Standards, Standard 2.2(a) ("Legislative or court rules should be adopted which enumerate the minor offenses for which citations should be issued."). The second and third editions of the Standards further emphasized this policy of state statutory adoption. See 2007 Pretrial Release Standards, Standard 10-2.1, App. 1 ("It should be the policy of every law enforcement agency to issue citations in lieu of arrest or continued custody to the maximum extent consistent with the effective enforcement of the law. This policy should be implemented by statutes of statewide applicability.")Virginia (like many other States after the initial publication of the ABA Standards) conducted a "comparative analysis" of its State laws and practice vis a vis the ABA Standards, and recommended that "Virginia should consider amending its Code to provide for the issuance of citations in conformity with the [ABA] standard." Walck et al., Comparative22Analysis, supra, at II-3 (regarding Pretrial Release Standards 2.1 and 2.2). The Virginia statute at issue in this case was the direct legislative product of that effort, and specifically of ABA Pretrial Release Standards 2.1 and 2.2.The ABA's Pretrial Release Standards, if applied to the facts of this case, support two conclusions.First, the arrest was unreasonable because, as the Virginia Supreme Court concluded, there were no facts reasonably suggesting that custody, beyond the detention needed to issue a citation, was necessary. The Virginia statute is consistent with the consensus view expressed in ABA Pretrial Release Standard 102.2(a), which requires a citation rather than arrest for minor offenses. The Virginia Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Court of Appeals' finding that no facts suggesting an exception were present (again, directly equivalent to ABA Standard 102.2(c)). Thus the arrest was inconsistent with the consensus view of diverse law enforcement interests, as adopted in many jurisdictions and as expressed in the Virginia statute as well as the ABA's Standard 10-2.2.Second, ABA Pretrial Release Standard 10-2.4 reflects a further broad consensus that a "lawful" arrest is required to conduct a search incident to arrest. Here, the arrest was unlawful under Virginia state law--a citation should have been issued, followed by release. The search incident to that arrest therefore violated the reasonable policy expressed in Pretrial Release Standard 10-2.4. The Commentary to Standard 10-2.4 makes clear that "once a citation is issued the police officer has no authority to search23unless a basis other than incident to arrest is apparent." 2007 Pretrial Release Standards at 70 n.31, App. 13 n.31.8 Absent such a standard, the risk of costly, inefficient, invasive and potentially pretextual searches is an unreasonable one. Officers could use unlawful arrests, or the citation process alone, to conduct otherwise improper searches. Such a practice would be inconsistent with the widespread, reasonable consensus policies expressed in the ABA Standards (as well as with this Court's recent decision in Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U.S. 113 (1998) (Fourth Amendment does not permit search "incident to citation")). There was no "lawful arrest" or "other basis" advanced by the Virginia officers in this case to support the search of respondent's person. On the facts of this case, application of the ABA Standards-- which reflect decades of analysis, broad input from many criminal justice sectors, and the actual experience of many U.S. jurisdictions--confirms that the arrest in violation of state law, and the subsequent search, were unreasonable.Consistently for almost four decades, the ABA has advocated a policy of "citation and release" for minor criminal offenses. Many jurisdictions have now adopted such policies. In light of the reasonable and balanced rationale, and widespread influence, of the ABA's Pretrial Release Standards, amicus requests that this Court take them into account when evaluating the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in this case. On the facts presented, the respondent's8 In Castle Rock, supra, this Court expressly relied on the Commentary to the Criminal Justice Standards in evaluating the arrest policies at issue. 545 U.S. at 760­761.24unlawful arrest, and any search incident to that arrest, were unreasonable under the balanced, consensus views of the ABA Standards.CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above, and consistent with its commitment to promoting improvements in the American system of justice, the ABA respectively submits that the Court should affirm the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court.Respectfully submitted,OF COUNSEL: PROF.

 I. The ABA Opposes Pretrial Bond Requirements In RemovalProceedings Except Where Less Restrictive Conditions Of Release Are Inadequate And The Bond Accounts For The Noncitizens Ability To Pay. The ABA has long opposed the pretrial detention of any noncitizenin removal proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances.4 Suchcircumstances occur where detention is necessary to prevent harm or toensure the noncitizens appearance; examples include cases where thenoncitizen (1) presents a threat to national security, (2) presents athreat to public safety, (3) presents a threat to another person or4 See ABA Report 107E, adopted Feb. 2006 (hereinafter Report 107E), http://tinyurl.com/jytos28. Only recommendations that are presented to and adopted by the ABAs House of Delegates (HOD) become ABA policy. The HOD comprises 589 delegates representing states and territories, state and local bar associations, affiliated organizations, sections and divisions, ABA members, and the Attorney General of the United States, among others. See ABA House of Delegates, http://tinyurl.com/85kz595 (last visited Mar. 2, 2017). Policies adopted before 1988 are available from the ABA, and those dated after 1988 are available on the ABA website.6Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» ïé ±º ìëpersons, or (4) presents a substantial flight risk.5 Absent such a compelling ground for detention, the ABA supports the useand, at minimum, the considerationof humane alternatives to detention that are the least restrictive necessary to ensure that non-citizens appear in immigration proceedings.6 Those alternatives should include supervised pre-hearing release and bond based on the individuals economic means and risk of flight.7In many cases, a bond requirement is unjustified because less restrictive conditions of releaseincluding release on recognizance and supervised releasedwill suffice to ensure the noncitizens appearance. In those cases, the ABA opposes any type of bond. And in the rare case where a bond is necessary to ensure a noncitizens appearance, it should be calibrated to account for the noncitizens financial resources as well as his or her risk of flight. Otherwise, the bond could inadvertently, and indefensibly, impose detention based solely on the noncitizens5 Report 107E, supra note 4. 6 Id. 7 Id.; see also ABA Civil Immigration Detention Standards, 12A102 (hereinafter Detention Standards), adopted Aug. 2012, as amended in Aug. 2014 by Res. 111, at II.C, http://tinyurl.com/p73wopo.7Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» ïè ±º ìëinability to pay. Risks of harm or flight may justify detention in certain circumstances, but indigence alone cannot.The ABAs policies regarding pretrial bonds in removal proceedings intentionally mirror its recommendations in the criminal context. The current Criminal Justice Standards, adopted by the ABA House of Delegates in 2007, were shaped by a comprehensive review of pretrial release practices, including the use of monetary conditions for release.8 Having found that courts often impose such conditions without justification, the ABA now recommends that [r]elease on financial conditions should be used only when no other conditions will ensure appearance.9 Further, [w]hen financial conditions are imposed, the court should first consider releasing the defendant on an unsecured bond before contemplating money bail.10 And in the rare case where bail may be appropriate, it should be set at the lowest level necessary to ensure the defendants appearance and with regard to a8 See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pretrial Release (3d ed. 2007). 9 Id. Standard 10-1.4(c). 10 Id.8Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» ïç ±º ìëdefendants financial ability to post bond.11 In no circumstance should a judicial officer  impose a financial condition of release that results in the pretrial detention of a defendant solely due to the defendants inability to pay.12 II. The ABAs Policies Ensure Fidelity To The ConstitutionalPrinciples That Govern Pretrial Detention In Both Removal And Criminal Proceedings. The ABAs policies are designed to ensure fidelity to the constitutional principles that govern pretrial detention, particularly the guarantees of due process and equal protection in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Under Supreme Court precedent, those principles apply to both removal and criminal proceedings, and they prohibit the pretrial deprivation of liberty based solely on the inability to pay in either context. Accordingly, the ABA recommends the same approach to pretrial bonds for both noncitizen respondents and criminal defendants. The Supreme Court has long held that depriving an individual of conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he11 Id. 12 Id. Standards 10-1.4(e); 10-5.3(a).9Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» îð ±º ìëcannot pay . . . would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Due Process Clause. Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 672-73 (1983). Consistent with that principle, the Court has rejected government policies and practices in a wide range of contexts that have the effect of punishing a person for his poverty. Id. at 671 (revocation of probation for inability to pay fine); see, e.g., Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 447-48 (2011) (civil contempt for inability to pay child support); Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971) (incarceration for inability to pay traffic fines); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 240-241 (1970) (incarceration beyond statutory maximum due to inability to pay fine); Smith v. Bennett, 365 U.S. 708, 711 (1961) (inability to pay fee to file petition for writ of habeas corpus); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 19 (1956) (inability to cover cost of transcript on appeal).In keeping with that guidance, lower courts have concluded that when the appearance of an indigent defendant can be reasonably assured by an alternate form of release, pretrial confinement for inability to post money bail would constitute imposition of an excessive restraint. Pugh v. Rainwater, 572 F.2d 1053, 1058 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc); see also Jones v. City of Clanton, No. 2:15cv34MHT, 2015 WL10Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» îï ±º ìë5387219, at *2-3 (M.D. Ala. Sept. 14, 2015). As these cases clarify, imposing pretrial bonds without considering alternative conditions or the defendants financial resourcessuch that the defendant may be detained solely because of his or her inability to payruns afoul of constitutional principles.The same constitutional concerns arise in the immigration context. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that the procedures by which Congress implements immigration law must comply with the Due Process Clause, which applies to all persons within the United States, including aliens. See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001). In particular, pretrial detention in connection with removal proceedingswhich deprives a noncitizen of the fundamental right to physical libertymust rest on constitutionally adequate grounds. See id. at 690-92. The ABA has thus concluded that detention is subject to close constitutional scrutiny even where, as here, it is a procedural aspect of the deportation process.13The ABA endorses a range of policies designed to ensure that immigration detention complies with the guarantees of due process and13 ABA Report 107C (hereinafter Report 107C), adopted Feb. 2006, http://tinyurl.com/zo3hmtu.11Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» îî ±º ìëequal protection for noncitizens. Many of those policies are designed to ensure that the conditions of detentionincluding access to legal resources and medical treatmentpreserve the constitutional rights of detainees.14 But the ABAs recommended procedures for pretrial release are equally critical, as they ensure that detention is imposed to begin with only through constitutionally sound procedures.15 As explained, detention based solely on the inability to pay fails to meet that standard. III. Detention Based Solely On Inability To Pay ImposesConsiderable Costs On Detainees And The Public Fisc With Negligible Benefits To Immigration Enforcement. Substantial research supports the conclusion that arbitrary pretrial bond determinations adversely affect indigent detainees while also undermining the fairness, effectiveness, and credibility of the legal system. These concerns are particularly acute in light of recent data demonstrating that bond amounts are steadily increasing, with the14 See Report 107C, supra note 13; ABA, Ensuring Fairness and Due Process in Immigration Proceedings (2008). 15 See Report 107E, supra note 4; Detention Standards, supra note 7, at II.C.12Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» îí ±º ìëmedian bond amount in 2015 reaching $6,500.16 Over the past twenty years, nearly one in five individuals who received a bond remained in detention at the conclusion of their removal case, presumably because they were unable to pay the bond.17Uninformed bond decisions that incarcerate indigent detainees solely because of their inability to pay for their release not only impact individuals and their due process rights, but harm the U.S. legal system by undermining notions of fundamental fairness and equal protection under the law. Allowing wealth to be the sole determining factor of release from immigration detention makes the system unfair, arbitrary, and unconstitutional.A. Uninformed Bond Determinations Inflict Substantial Harms On The Legal System And Detainees Due Process Rights.Immigration detainees face significant obstacles to asserting their legal rights, both in immigration court and in other legal proceedings. The biggest and most troubling hurdle is access to counsel. The ABA16 TRAC Immigration, What Happens When Individuals Are Released On Bond in Immigration Court Proceedings?

Indeed, almost 40% of ICE detention bed space is located more than 60 miles from an urban center, where the majority of legal resources are located.25 A report on immigration reform by the ABA Commission on Immigration observed that remote facilities . . . and the practice of transferring detainees from one facility to anotheroften more remotelocation without notice stand in the way of retaining counsel for many detainees.26In addition to making it difficult to obtain legal counsel, the circumstances of detention render effective litigation of removal proceedings difficult, if not impossible. As the Supreme Court has recognized, detention seriously impairs the exercise of a detainees legal rights, including hindrance of the ability to gather evidence, contact witnesses, or otherwise prepare his defense.

One major obstacle is the limited access to telephonesin most detention facilities.27 Phone calls are a crucial means ofcommunication necessary for any attempt by detainees to gatherevidence in support of their legal cases. For this reason, the ABAImmigration Commissions policy calls for detainees to have[r]easonable and equitable access to telephones . . . at commerciallycompetitive toll charges.28 In practice, telephone calls are extremelylimited and substantial per-minute fees render the calls prohibitivelyexpensive.29 One national survey of detention facilities found large27 See Natl Immigrant Justice Ctr., Isolated in Detention: Limited Access to Legal Counsel in Immigration Detention Facilities Jeopardizes a Fair Day in Court 4 (2010) [hereinafter Isolated in Detention] (reporting widespread problems with phone access); see also U.S. Govt Accountability Office, GAO-07-875, Alien Detention Standards: Telephone Access Problems Were Pervasive at Detention Facilities; Other Deficiencies Did Not Show a Pattern of Noncompliance 15-17 (2007) (discussing deficiencies with phone system).28 See Report 111B, supra note 18.29 See, e.g., Ruben Loyo et al., N.Y.U. Sch. of Law, Immigrant Rights Clinic, Locked Up But Not Forgotten: Opening Access to Family and Community in the Immigration Detention System 23 (2010). The FCC voted in October 2015 to impose caps on predatory phone rates in detention centers, but the phone companies challenged the order and it was withdrawn. See Federal Communications Commission, Consumer Guide: Inmate Telephone Service, Aug. 10, 2016.

In 2015, less than 12% of immigrationwhether the FCCs revised caps, passed in August 2016, will survive any similar challenge. 30 Isolated in Detention, supra note 27, at 4, app. 4-5. The Southern Poverty Law Center recently published a report on Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, where detainees reported they were refused the right to make calls to their attorneys from a confidential phone line, not permitted to accept scheduled calls from their attorneys, and indigent detainees were denied the right to call their attorneys for free.

For instance, in a study of asylum seekers, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that, of the asylum seekers who withdrew their asylum claims, a substantial number reported that the conditions of their detention influenced their decision to withdraw their application35 Eagly & Shafer, supra note 19, at 61, fig. 16; 34, fig. 8. 36 Id. at 70-71, fig. 19. 37 Id. This statistic runs counter to the Governments suggestion that detainees due process rights are satisfied where they could present any information they chose concerning their eligibility for release and the conditions on which they should be released. (Govt. Br. 46). The data suggests that, without representation, detainees are not able to provide an effective presentation in removal proceedings.20Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» íï ±º ìëfor admission.38 Over a five-year period, detained credible fear claimants withdrew their asylum claims 13% of the time, compared to only 5% of released claimants.39Collectively, these harms strike at the fair and evenhanded administration of justice. Rather than ensure that individuals are only deprived of their liberty because they pose a legitimate threat to the community or a flight risk, noncitizens are detained solely because of their inability to pay a bond. The harm then compounds itself where detained individuals are less likely to secure representation, and thereby far less likely to obtain a successful outcome in removal proceedings.B.

The time spent in jail is simply dead time . . . . Barker, 407 U.S. at 532-33. The dead time of detention means substantial economic hardship on detainees and their families. Detainees often lose their jobs, and as a result, some lose their homes.43 This hardship strikes a uniquely vulnerable populationin 2002, half of the U.S. foreign-born work force made less than double the minimum wage, and noncitizen women were substantially less likely to participate in the workforce, making men the sole breadwinner for the family.44 That harm is then compounded for43 See Ajay Chaudry et al., The Urban Inst., Facing Our Future: Children in the Aftermath of Immigration Enforcement 27 (2010) (noting families generally lose[] a breadwinner during immigration detention); Human Rights Watch, Jailing Refugees: Arbitrary Detention of Refugees in the US Who Fail to Adjust to Permanent Resident Status (2009) (noting that detained refugees are unable to work to support their families); Geoffrey Heeren, Pulling Teeth: The State of Mandatory Immigration Detention, 45 Harv.

In 2011, a national research study estimated that at least 5,100 children whose parents had been either detained or deported were living in foster care.48 In these cases, detained parents are often unable to meet court mandates set by the child welfare system, including visits and parenting classes.49 Nonetheless, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, passed by Congress in 1997, imposes stringent time requirements on states for either achieving family reunification or adoption after a child is placed in foster care.50 Detained parents may therefore lose their parental rights as a result of their detention.5147 Seth Freed Wessler, Applied Research Ctr., Shattered Families: The Perilous Intersection of Immigration Enforcement and the Child Welfare System 5 (2011); see also Loyo et al., supra note 29, at 1, 17. 48 Wessler, Applied Research Ctr., supra note 47, at 4. 49 Nina Rabin, Disappearing Parents: Immigration Enforcement and the Child Welfare System, 44 Conn.

In the past two decades, the average daily ICEdetention population swelled from 7,475 in 1995 to over 41,000 in 2016.53 In FY 2015 alone, a total of 367,774 individuals passed throughSeverance of the Parent-Child Relationship, 47 Family L.Q. 141, 141-72 (2013); Womens Refugee Commn, Torn Apart by Immigration Enft: Parental Rights and Immigration Detention 10 (2010); Wendy Cervantes & Yali Lincroft, The Impact of Immigration Enforcement on Child Welfare 6 (2010). 52 Cf.

In FY 2016, DHSrequested $2.407 billion to fund immigration detention, or more than$6.5 million per day.55 This amounts to a daily cost of $158 per detainee.56 Some data suggests that the numbers are even higher,estimating $164 per detainee per day, $298 per person per day for family detention, and totaling more than $2 billion a year.57These numbers are particularly staggering when compared withthe relatively modest costs of supervised release programs.

Noncitizens pay property taxes, sales taxes, and many pay income taxes.60 In 2010, households headed by unauthorized noncitizens contributed approximately $11.2 billion in taxes to state and local governments.61 Detention therefore compounds financial harms by imposing substantial burdens on public58 U.S. Dept of Homeland Sec., Congressional Budget Justification: FY 2012, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Salaries and Expenses: Alternatives to Detention 43-45 (2012); see also The Math of Immigration Detention, supra note 57, at 11. 59 GAO, Alternatives to Detention, supra note 56. 60 See Tanya Golash-Boza, Immigration Nation: Raids, Detentions, and Deportations in Post-9/11 America, 8 Socys Without Borders 313, 148 (2012); Immigration Poly Ctr., Unauthorized Immigrants Pay Taxes, Too 1 (2011) [hereinafter Immigrants Pay Taxes]. 61 Immigrants Pay Taxes, supra note 60, at 3 (considering personal income taxes, property taxes, and sales taxes).

Relative To Alternative Conditions Of Release, Uninformed Bond Determinations Offer Negligible Benefits To Immigration Enforcement.Ultimately, ABA policy regarding immigration detention seeks to balance the constitutional rights and practical needs of noncitizen respondents with deterrence of flight and criminal conduct. As empirical data demonstrates, individualized conditions of pretrial release strike that balance by ensuring high rates of appearance and low rates of criminal wrongdoing, without gratuitously imposing the burdens of detention.In FY 2015, 86% of individuals released from detention by an Immigration Judge attended their hearings.62 This statistic has remained fairly static, even as the number of bond hearings have increased. A recent analysis of EOIR court records over the past 20 years showed an increasing number of detainees receiving bond62 TRAC Immigration, What Happens When Individuals, supra note 16. 29Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» ìð ±º ìëhearings, and yet no corresponding increase in absconder rates.63 The natural conclusion is that individualized bond hearings are working.The effectiveness of individualized bond determination is heightened when paired with conditional supervision programs. The governments conditional supervision program, called ISAP II (Intensive Supervision Appearance Program), relies on the use of electronic ankle monitors, biometric voice recognition software, unannounced home visits, employer verification, and in-person reporting to supervise participants.64 A government-contracted evaluation of this program reported a 99% attendance rate at all EOIR hearings and a 95% attendance rate at final hearings.65Statistics also demonstrate that detainees released on bond are no more likely to recidivate than the general population. At least as of May 2014, ICE reported a recidivism rate of less than 3% for the 36,007 individuals with criminal records who were released from ICE custody63 Id. 64 GAO, Alternatives to Detention, supra note 56, at 10-11. 65 Id.30Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» ìï ±º ìëin FY2013.66 Further, as data from the governments supervision programs also demonstrates, alternatives to detention are effective in preventing criminal activity by noncitizens released on bond. For instance, in 2011, less than 1% of participants in ISAP were removed from the program due to arrest by another law enforcement agency.67Our nations bond system reflects a balance between the need to ensure that defendants appear for proceedings and the recognition that we cannot and should not detain people who do not pose a risk to the community and can be otherwise compelled to attend their hearings. Setting bonds without considering noncitizens ability to pay is an arbitrary procedure untethered from legitimate law enforcement rationales, particularly when alternatives to detention are proven effective at compelling attendance in immigration proceedings. The effect of non-individualized bond determinations is to detain the poor for their inability to pay. This unfairly imposes an additional burden on indigent noncitizens already saddled with substantial disadvantages,66 Office of the Exec. Assoc. Dir. of Enft & Removal Operations, U.S. Immigration & Customs Enft, Criminal Recidivist Report 3 (2013). 67 Intensive Supervision Appearance Program II: Contract Year 2011 Annual Report (BI Incorp. 2011).31Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» ìî ±º ìëand further imposes unnecessary and excessive costs on the United States.* * * * * In light of the foregoing constitutional and empirical considerations, the district courts preliminary injunction in this case imposes an essential procedural requirement on pretrial bond proceedings. Immigration judges must be granted considerable discretion in fashioning conditions of release. But that discretion cannot stretch to dismissing, out of hand, the legal relevance of a noncitizens ability to pay when imposing a pretrial bond. Such an approach guarantees that some noncitizens will be detained solely because of their indigence, an outcome that is indefensible as a matter of constitutional doctrine and public policy. The district courts injunction offers a narrowly tailored, purely procedural solution: It requires immigration judges to consider less restrictive conditions of release and a noncitizens ability to pay before imposing a pretrial bond. That requirement simply makes explicit what the Constitution already compels, while preserving immigration judges32Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» ìí ±º ìëbroad discretion to decide how best to protect communities and ensure that noncitizens appear for subsequent proceedings.CONCLUSION For the reasons set forth above, this Court should affirm the district courts injunction.Respectfully submitted,Linda Klein AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION 32 North Clark Street Chicago, IL 60654 (312) 988-5000 abapresident@americanbar.orgJohn L.

 I. THE ABA CRIMINAL JUSTICE STANDARDS REJECT INFLEXIBLE MONEY-BAIL SYSTEMS, WHICH ARE DEFICIENT AS A MATTER OF POLICY AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW A. The ABA Has Long Viewed Inflexible Money-Bail Systems AsInherently Discriminatory, Deleterious To The Rights Of The Accused, And Unnecessary To Ensure Justice The ABA has long been concerned about the deleterious effects of inflexible money-bail systems, under which an accused person's right to release depends on his ability to pay an amount that may bear no relation to his individual circumstances, the protection of public safety, or the needs of the administration of justice. The ABA's examination of money bail was stimulated by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's address to the ABA House of Delegates in August 1962, in which Attorney General Kennedy, surveying the problems of access to justice facing the indigent, identified "[t]he problem of bail" as having "received too little attention," and stressed that "the indigent defendant who cannot offer security for his appearance is denied [the] opportunity [to establish his innocence]. He cannot provide for his family and for his defense, and cannot take an active part to prove his innocence."44 Kennedy, Address, American Bar Association House of Delegates, San Francisco, California, Aug. 6, 1962, at 5, available at https://www.justice.gov/ sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2011/01/20/08-06-1962%20Pro.pdf.- 7 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 19 of 47The First Edition of the ABA's Criminal Justice Standards, adopted by the House of Delegates in 1968, reflected the ABA's fundamental judgment that an accused person's right to liberty--and right to mount an effective defense to criminal charges--should not be determined by that person's financial resources. Although the ABA did not advocate for the abolition of all monetary conditions on release, the First Edition of the Standards urged that "[r]eliance on money bail should be reduced to minimal proportions" and should be "required only in cases in which no other condition will reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance." American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Pretrial Release--Approved Draft, 1968, § 1.2 ("First Edition"); see also id. §5.3(a) ("Money bail should be set only when it is found that no other conditions on release will reasonably assure the defendant's appearance.").Commentary accompanying the First Edition of the Standards recognized the grave constitutional and policy concerns with overuse of money bail.5 The commentary explained that bail "inevitably discriminates against the poor," noting studies showing that a significant percentage of defendants could not make a bail5 Unlike the Standards themselves, which set forth black-letter principles adopted by the ABA House of Delegates, commentary accompanying the Standards is not adopted by the House of Delegates. The commentary accompanying the Standards therefore "does not necessarily represent the official position of the ABA," but it nonetheless "serves a useful explanation of the blackletter standards." See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Pretrial Release at ii (3d ed. 2007).- 8 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 20 of 47of $500. See First Edition at 1. The commentary also emphasized that pretrial detention can prevent a defendant "from contributing to the preparation of his defense," leading to worse outcomes for the very defendants least able to afford effective counsel. Id. at 3. More generally, the commentary recognized the human toll of unnecessary pretrial detention, which subjects a defendant "to the psychological and physical deprivations of jail life," risks him "los[ing] his job if he has one," and shoulders the "innocent members of his family" with the burdens of his detention. Id. at 2-3; see also id. at 23 ("[U]nnecessary pretrial detention involves unconscionable costs both to individual defendants and their families and to the public which must pay the financial price of detention.").The First Edition of the Standards also expressed the ABA's judgment that money bail should rarely be necessary to serve legitimate interests of the criminal justice system: protecting the public and ensuring the defendant's appearance in court. For defendants who have secure ties to the community, non-monetary conditions of release should usually be sufficient to ensure their court appearance; for those who are inclined to flee anyway, money bail is unlikely to deter them from doing so. Thus, jurisdictions should look to the defendant's community ties, rather than arbitrary monetary amounts, as the best security for the defendant's appearance in court: "[I]f a quick but careful inquiry is made into the facts concerning the defendant's roots in the community a vastly more rational bail- 9 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 21 of 47decision can be made," and "risk of financial loss is an insubstantial deterrent to flight for a large number of defendants whose ties to the community are sufficient to bring them to court." First Edition at 2.The Second Edition of the ABA's Pretrial Release Standards, adopted by the ABA House of Delegates in 1979 after a decade of further study, continued and sharpened the ABA's criticism of excessive use of money bail. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, ch. 10, Pretrial Release (2d ed. 1979) ("Second Edition"). The Second Edition again stressed that "[r]elease on monetary conditions should be reduced to minimal proportions" and that money bail "should be required only in cases in which no other conditions will reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance." Id. at Standard 10-1.3(c). The Second Edition also recommended that "[w]hen monetary conditions are imposed, bail should be set at the lowest level necessary to ensure the defendant's reappearance and with regard for the defendant's ability to post bond." Id. As the accompanying historical background explains, this additional emphasis against excessive use of money bail made explicit a point that was previously implicit--"that a monetary condition ought not to be imposed except in amounts necessary to achieve its legitimate purpose." Id. at 10.14.This continued insistence on a limited role for monetary conditions of release reflected the ABA's serious concerns about the constitutionality of- 10 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 22 of 47inflexible money-bail schemes, which result in incarceration of individuals for the sole reason that they cannot pay for their freedom. See Second Edition at 10.7810.79 (citing, inter alia, Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), and Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395 (1971)). As the commentary to the Second Edition stressed, although money-bail systems are common, "[i]n practice ... monetary conditions rarely serve their legitimate function," and "[a]lthough release on monetary condition is the oldest form of pretrial release, it is also the least desirable." Id. at 10.78.In addition, the Second Edition of the Standards articulated ABA policy on a point directly relevant here: If it is necessary to impose a monetary condition on a defendant's pretrial release, then that monetary condition should preferably be in the form of an unsecured bond, rather than a secured bond or an unsecured bond accompanied by a partial cash payment. See id. at Standard 10-5.4(d). In other words, only in very rare circumstances should a defendant be required to pay any sum of money to the court before he is released. Rather, it should ordinarily be sufficient to require the defendant to agree to pay a sum of money if he fails to appear as required.B. Given The Grave Concerns Raised By Overuse Of Money Bail, The ABA's Criminal Justice Standards Caution Against Its Use Without Consideration Of The Defendant's Individual CircumstancesThe ABA comprehensively reviewed pretrial release practices, including the use of monetary conditions for release, in the Third Edition of its Criminal Justice- 11 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 23 of 47Standards, adopted by the ABA House of Delegates in 2007 and currently in force. See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pretrial Release (3d ed. 2007). As those Standards explain, two decades' worth of additional study and experience have confirmed the ABA's conclusions that an inflexible money-bail system serves no legitimate public safety purpose, needlessly harms persons accused of crimes, and imposes unnecessary costs on the public. Monetary conditions of release should never be drawn from an inflexible schedule, should be imposed only after consideration of the defendant's individual circumstances, and should never prevent the defendant's release solely because the defendant is unable to pay.Standard 10-1.4 expresses the ABA's conclusion that money bail should rarely be used to secure a defendant's appearance in court, and that when monetary conditions of release are necessary, an unsecured bond should be preferred to a secured bond. As the Standards explain, jurisdictions should "adopt procedures designed to promote the release of defendants on their own recognizance or, when necessary, unsecured bond." Standard 10-1.4(a). Jurisdictions should impose financial conditions only "when no other conditions will ensure appearance," and should always "consider releasing the defendant on an unsecured bond." Standard 10-1.4(c). Furthermore, the Standards underscore that monetary conditions should be used only to ensure appearance--they "should not be employed to respond to concerns for public safety." Standard 10-1.4(d). The Standards also stress,- 12 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 24 of 47without qualification, that a bail system should not make it impossible for accused persons to gain release solely because of their indigence: "The judicial officer should not impose a financial condition of release that results in the pretrial detention of a defendant solely due to the defendant's inability to pay." Standard 10-1.4(e).In particular, the Standards recognize the problems with rigid bail schedules, in which the amount of bail is fixed in advance by the nature or name of the charge. The Standards provide that financial conditions "should never be set by reference to a predetermined schedule of amounts fixed according to the nature of the charge." Standard 10-5.3(e) (emphasis added). Instead, consistent with the demands of due process, the Standards urge that "[f]inancial conditions should be the result of an individualized decision taking into account the special circumstances of each defendant, the defendant's ability to meet the financial conditions and the defendant's flight risk." Id. (emphasis added). Furthermore, because of the burden financial conditions may impose on the indigent, the Standards call on jurisdictions to consider conditions of release other than a secured bond in conducting these individualized determinations. Standard 105.3(a) ("Financial conditions other than unsecured bond should be imposed only when no other less restrictive condition of release will reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance in court."); see also Standard 10-5.3(d) (providing that a- 13 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 25 of 47judicial officer imposing financial conditions should first consider an unsecured bond).The commentary accompanying the Third Edition of the Standards emphasizes a range of serious concerns about excessive use of financial conditions and lack of individualized determinations, not only for the defendant accused of a crime but also for the public. Unwarranted pretrial detention infringes on defendants' constitutional rights, "making it difficult for the defendant to consult with counsel, locate witnesses, and gather evidence" and placing a particularly heavy burden "on poor defendants and on racial and cultural minorities." Standards at 32-33. "Pretrial detention also strains the defendant's family relations and is likely to result in loss of employment." Id. at 33. And jurisdictions must bear the costs of the detention, expending "scarce public resources for construction and operation of new jail facilities." Id.For these reasons, jurisdictions should follow the "least restrictive conditions principle" in ordering pretrial release and should never set bail so high that a person cannot meet it because he lacks the means to do so: "If the court finds that unsecured bond is not sufficient, it may require the defendant to post bail; however, the bail amount must be within the reach of the defendant and should not be at an amount greater than necessary to assure the defendant's appearance in court." Id. at 43-44 (emphasis added).- 14 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 26 of 47Commentary to the Standards elaborates on reasons why jurisdictions should never follow a preset bail schedule. Most fundamentally, the nature or name of the charge against the defendant may have little to do with the need for particular conditions on release. To the contrary, to ensure the defendant's appearance in court and to protect public safety, it is far more sensible to consider the particular circumstances of the case, including the defendant's risk of flight and (if monetary conditions are necessary) the defendant's financial situation. See Standards at 5051 (commentary to Standard 10-1.7); id. at 111 (commentary to Standard 105.3(a)). Moreover, inflexible money-bail standards inevitably discriminate against indigent defendants who cannot make bail in even small amounts. As the commentary explains, a money-bail system that does not consider the defendant's individual circumstances, including his ability to pay, "undermin[es] basic concepts of equal justice": "`In a system which grants pretrial liberty for money, those who can afford a bondsman go free; those who cannot stay in jail.'" Id. at 111-112 (quoting Freed & Wald, Bail in the United States 21 (1964)). II. AN INFLEXIBLE MONEY-BAIL SYSTEM HARMS INDIGENT CRIMINALDEFENDANTS AND DOES NOT SERVE THE FAIR AND PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE A. Money Bail Burdens Indigent Criminal Defendants Extensive research has shown that overuse of money bail adversely affects indigent defendants in serious ways, undermining the fairness, effectiveness, and- 15 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 27 of 47credibility of our criminal justice system. In addition to depriving persons of their liberty because of their financial situation, money bail often impairs their ability to mount a defense to the charges against them and wreaks havoc with their lives.First, even a few days in jail can disrupt a defendant's life, leading to longterm negative consequences. Indigent defendants cannot work or earn income while detained and may lose their jobs while waiting for a hearing, making it even more difficult to make bail. See Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 532-333 (1972). Children may be left unsupervised, and elderly or sick relatives may have no one else to take care of them. Defendants living in shelters may lose housing for missing curfews or for prolonged absence. See Pinto, The Bail Trap, N.Y. Times Magazine (Aug. 13, 2015). Given indigent defendants' already diminished level of economic security and often shaky social safety nets, a prolonged pretrial detention may trigger a downward spiral, even if they are ultimately acquitted.Yet for many indigent defendants, there is no option other than to wait in jail. Defendants and their families are frequently unable to afford a fixed monetary bond or a nonrefundable 10 or 20% commercial surety fee. Indeed, in many cases a commercial surety is not even an option; many bail bondsmen will not even offer small bonds--meaning that, ironically, indigent defendants who are charged with the least serious offenses may be more likely to stay in jail. See Montopoli, Is the U.S. Bail System Unfair?, CBS News, Feb. 8, 2013. Data show that many- 16 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 28 of 47defendants are unable to meet even relatively small bond amounts; in New York City, for example, only 26% of criminal defendants made bail set at less than $500 at arraignment, and only 7% made bail set at $5,000 (the median amount for a felony). Phillips, A Decade of Bail Research in New York City 51 tbl. 7 (New York Criminal Justice Agency, Inc., Aug. 2012). Even for those defendants who are ultimately able to secure the necessary resources, the process of doing so may take days, leading to many of the same adverse consequences.6Second, pretrial detention frustrates the legal rights of indigent defendants. While detained, defendants find it difficult to communicate with or engage counsel--especially in jurisdictions that do not appoint counsel immediately after a defendant is taken into custody. See Leipold, How the Pretrial Process Contributes to Wrongful Convictions, 42 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1123, 1130 (2005). Detention also impairs defendants' ability to prepare a defense; by the time of release, evidence may have already been lost and witnesses' memories faded.6 In rural areas, long distances and limited staff further increase the likelihood of prolonged detention before a defendant's first appearance before a judicial officer. It is therefore particularly important to find alternatives to inflexible money-bail systems in those jurisdictions. See Vetter & Clark, The Delivery of Pretrial Justice in Rural Areas: A Guide for Rural County Officials (National Association of Counties, 2012). The ABA's Criminal Justice Standards state that "the defendant should in no instance be held by police longer than 24 hours without appearing before a judicial officer," Standard 10-4.1, but in many areas of the country, suspects are held for much longer times.- 17 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 29 of 47For more than fifty years, researchers have found that pretrial detention leads to worse case outcomes for indigent defendants. See Rankin, The Effect of Pretrial Detention, 39 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 641 (1964). Even when controlling for factors such as current charge, prior criminal history, and community ties, research has shown that defendants detained in jail are more likely to be convicted, more likely to be sentenced to a prison term, more likely to receive a longer sentence, and more likely to commit a future crime than defendants released during the pretrial period. See Gupta et al., The Heavy Costs of High Bail: Evidence from Judge Randomization 2-3, Columbia Law and Economics Working Paper No. 531 (2016); Rational and Transparent Bail Decision Making: Moving From a CashBased to a Risk-Based Process 2 (Pretrial Justice Inst., MacArthur Found. 2012); Phillips, Pretrial Detention and Case Outcomes, Part 1: Nonfelony Cases 55-56 (New York City Criminal Justice Agency, Inc., 2007). These consequences are particularly perverse because they may weigh heaviest on the lowest-risk defendants; one study found that low-risk defendants detained for the entire pretrial period are more than five times more likely to be sentenced to jail compared to low-risk defendants released at some point before trial, and nearly four times more likely to be sentenced to prison--with sentences that, on average, are nearly three times longer. See Lowenkamp et al., Investigation the Impact of Pretrial Detention on Sentencing Outcomes 11 (Arnold Found., Nov. 2013).- 18 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 30 of 47Third, the prospect of prolonged pretrial detention may encourage premature guilty pleas from defendants who are innocent or have potential defenses to the charges. In many cases, the anticipated time of pretrial detention may exceed the length of an actual sentence; for some minor crimes, defendants may not face incarceration at all. See Bibas, Plea Bargaining Outside the Shadow of Trial, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 2464, 2492 (2004) (noting that defendants charged with misdemeanors or lesser felonies are more likely to be incarcerated before than after conviction). When given the choice between immediate release and trial after prolonged detention, many defendants reasonably decide to plead guilty. See Boruchowitz et al., Minor Crimes, Massive Waste 32-33 (National Ass'n of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Apr. 2009). That prospect is directly contrary to the purpose of financial conditions on release, which is solely to ensure the defendant's appearance. See Standards at 44 (commentary to Standard 10-1.4(d)) ("Money bail should not be used for any reason other than to respond to a risk of flight."); cf. id. at 112 (commentary to Standard 10-5.3(c)) ("Threats of unaffordable bail in order to compel defendants to cooperate with the government are ... inappropriate.").B. An Inflexible Money-Bail System Does Not Advance The Interests Of Pretrial JusticeFor all of its costs to indigent defendants, money bail--particularly when imposed without regard to a defendant's individual circumstances--often fails to- 19 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 31 of 47advance the primary interests of a pretrial release system: ensuring that released defendants appear for their court dates, and keeping high-risk defendants in detention. See Standard 10.1-1. Instead of basing pretrial detention status on individualized risk factors, money-bail systems often end up linking pretrial detention status primarily to the defendant's ability to pay, which benefits neither indigent defendants nor public safety. See Cohen & Reaves, Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants in State Court 3 fig. 3 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, Nov. 2007) (showing direct relationship between the bail amount and likelihood of detention).The available evidence indicates that money bail is rarely necessary to ensure court appearances. The District of Columbia does not use money bail, and yet it maintains appearance rates for released defendants of 90%--as compared to a national average of less than 80%.7 Indeed, one recent study found that defendants whose releases were conditioned on unsecured bonds appeared for their court dates at slightly higher rates than those posting secured bonds, with the exception of the highest-risk category of defendants. See Jones, Unsecured Bonds: The As Effective and Most Efficient Pretrial Release Option 11 (Pretrial Justice7 Compare Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Columbia, Performance Measures, http://www.psa.gov/?q=data/performance_measures (data as of June 30, 2015) with Cohen & Reaves, Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants in State Court 8 fig. 5 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, Nov. 2007).- 20 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 32 of 47Institute 2013).8 By contrast, research has shown significant increases in appearance rates from alternative approaches, such as supervised release or simply giving notice before a court date. See Lowenkamp & VanNostrand, Exploring the Impact of Supervision on Pretrial Outcomes 17 (Arnold Found., 2013); Herian & Bornstein, Reducing Failure to Appear in Nebraska: A Field Study, Nebraska Lawyer 11, 12-13 (Sept. 2010).At the same time, excessive use of money bail imposes heavy costs on the criminal justice system. Approximately 61% of inmates in local jails--more than 400,000 individuals--are awaiting trial at any given time. See Minton & Golinelli, Jail Inmates at Midyear 2012 - Statistical Tables 5-6 tbls. 2-3 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, May 2013). At an average daily cost per inmate from $50 to as high as $500, the total annual cost of pretrial detention is estimated to be $9 billion, or 11% of total spending on corrections. See Council of Economic Advisers, Issue Brief, Fines, Fees, and Bail 8 (Dec. 2015). This immense cost to States and local jurisdictions yields little in the way of public safety, and yet it also represents a grave deprivation of liberty for thousands of indigent defendants.8 See also Abell Foundation, The Pretrial Release Project: A Study of Maryland's Pretrial Release and Bail System 48 (2011) (citing studies finding higher or similar appearance rates for defendants released on non-financial bail compared to financial bail), available at http://www.abell.org/sites/default/files/ publications/hhs_pretrial_9.01(1).pdf.- 21 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 33 of 47C. A Consensus Has Developed That Inflexible Money-Bail Systems Are Unfair And Do Not WorkThe ABA is not alone in its opposition to inflexible money-bail systems.Numerous organizations across the spectrum of the criminal justice system havealso emphasized the importance of conducting individualized assessments insetting conditions for pretrial release and minimizing the use of money bail.9 In9 Nat'l Ass'n of Counties, The American County Platform and Resolutions 20165-2017, at 104 ("NACo also recommends that states and localities make greater use of such non-financial pretrial release options, such as citation release and release on recognizance, where there is a reasonable expectation that public safety will not be threatened.."); Conference of Chief Justices, Resolution 3, at 2 (adopted Jan. 30, 2013) ("[T]he Conference of Chief Justices commends and endorses the Policy Paper on Evidence-Based Pretrial Release and joins with Conference of State Court Administrators to urge that court leaders promote, collaborate, and accomplish the adoption of evidence-based assessment of risk in setting pretrial release conditions and advocate for the presumptive use of nonfinancial release conditions[.]"); Ass'n of Prosecuting Attys, Policy Statement on Pretrial Justice ("Pretrial services employing validated risk assessments provide useful data and offer practical information essential to making informed decisions during court proceedings and determining conditions of supervision and sentencing, when appropriate."); Am.

National Symposium on Pretrial Justice, Summary Report of Proceedings 39(2011). As recently as March 14, 2016, the Department of Justice reminded courtsthat they "must not employ bail or bond practices that cause indigent defendants toremain incarcerated solely because they cannot afford to pay for their release."Dear Colleague Letter from Gupta, Principal Dep. Ass't Att'y Gen., Civil RightsDivision and Foster, Director, Office for Access to Justice 2 (Mar. 14, 2016); seealso Brown, ABA President, Letter to Editor, The Justice Department Makes theRight Call, Wash. Post, Mar. 18, 2016. There is no serious dispute among criminaljustice stakeholders that inflexible money-bail schemes have no place in theAmerican justice system.("Consistent with the current ABA Standards on Pretrial Release, these guidelines permit the denial of bail only when the judicial officer finds clear and convincing evidence the accused represents a significant risk of flight or imminent physical harm to others."); Nat'l Sheriffs Ass'n, Resolution 2012-6, National Sheriffs' Association Supports & Recognizes The Contribution Of Pretrial Services Agencies To Enhance Public Safety (2012) ("[A] justice system relying heavily on financial conditions of release at the pretrial stage is inconsistent with a fair and efficient justice system."); Am. Probation and Parole Ass'n, Resolution ­ Pretrial Supervision (enacted June 2010) ("[P]retrial supervision has proven a safe and cost effective alternative to jail for many individuals awaiting trial[.]"); see also Nat'l Ass'n of Pretrial Services Agencies, Standards on Pretrial Release (3d ed. 2004).- 23 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 35 of 47States and local jurisdictions have followed suit. Currently, 21 States expressly provide for a presumption in favor of releasing defendants on personal recognizance or an unsecured bond, and 16 require courts to impose the least restrictive condition on pretrial release. See Widgery, National Conference of State Legislators, Guidance for Setting Release Conditions (May 13, 2015); cf. Standard 10.1-6 (recognizing "policy favoring release"); cf. Standard 10.1-2 ("In deciding pretrial release, the judicial officer should assign the least restrictive condition(s) of release."). State court systems are also increasingly using fact-sensitive riskassessment tools, rather than inflexible bail schedules, to evaluate appropriate conditions on a defendant's pretrial release. See Arnold Found., Press Release, More Than 20 Cities and States Adopt Risk Assessment Tool To Help Judges Decide Which Defendants To Detain Prior to Trial (June 26, 2015); cf. Standard 10-1.10 ("Every jurisdiction should establish a pretrial services agency or program to collect and present the necessary information, [and] present risk assessments[.]"). Local jurisdictions have explored the use of these tools for years, and 15 States have now authorized their use by statute, with six States--Delaware, Colorado, Kentucky, New Jersey, South Carolina, and West Virginia--requiring such assessments for all defendants. Evaluations of these policies have further strengthened the conclusions that pretrial release determinations should take the defendant's individual circumstances into account, and that monetary conditions of release should play a- 24 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 36 of 47limited role. See Schnacke et al., The Jefferson County Bail Project: Lessons Learned from a Process of Pretrial Change at the Local Level 12 (Pretrial Justice Institute, June 2014); Klute & Heyerly, Report on Impact of House Bill 463: Outcomes, Challenges, and Recommendations 5-6 (KY Pretrial Servs., June 2012).In sum, evidence and experience show that an inflexible money-bail system has no place in a modern system of criminal justice. In the few circumstances where a financial condition of release is necessary to ensure a defendant's appearance at trial, a court can impose one, provided that it is tailored so that a defendant is not held in jail merely because he cannot afford to pay the bond. But in the great majority of cases, money bail--and certainly a money-bail system in which the amount of the bail is mechanically set by reference to a schedule of charges, with no consideration of the defendant's ties to the community or financial circumstances--should be unnecessary, and will only hobble the accused person's ability to muster a defense to the charges against him while imposing a grave human toll. III. THE COUNTY'S INFLEXIBLE BAIL SCHEME ILLUSTRATES THECONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS WITH MONEY BAIL The ABA's Criminal Justice Standards are founded on the basic constitutional premise that an individual should not be incarcerated solely based on his inability to pay. Faithful application of the Standards--including individualized risk assessments, the imposition of only the least restrictive- 25 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 37 of 47conditions, and a general presumption in favor of pretrial release--should ensure that defendants' constitutional rights will be protected. Here, however, the County's pretrial release system falls far short of ABA guidelines, and has resulted in violations of both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses.In Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), the Supreme Court made clear that depriving an individual of "conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he cannot pay ... would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment." Id. at 672-673. Consistent with that principle, the Court has rejected government policies and practices in a wide range of contexts that have the effect of "punishing a person for his poverty." Id. at 671 (revocation of probation for inability to pay fine); see, e.g., Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971) (incarceration for inability to pay traffic fines); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 240-241 (1970) (incarceration beyond statutory maximum due to inability to pay fine); Smith v. Bennett, 365 U.S. 708, 711 (1961) (inability to pay fee to file petition for writ of habeas corpus); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 19 (1956) (inability to cover cost of transcript on appeal).A defendant's constitutional interests are particularly strong in the pretrial detention context. While awaiting trial, a criminal defendant has not been found guilty of any crime and must be afforded a presumption of innocence. Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 4 (1951) ("Unless this right to bail before trial is preserved, the- 26 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 38 of 47presumption of innocence, secured only after centuries of struggle, would lose its meaning."). Accordingly, before overriding a defendant's "strong interest in liberty," jurisdictions must recognize the "importance and fundamental nature" of the right to pretrial release and must carefully consider whether the government has advanced "sufficiently weighty" interests to the contrary. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 750-751 (1987). Inflexible money-bail systems that rely on preset bail schedules, like the one the City of Calhoun uses, do not meet that standard. As the Fifth Circuit explained in Pugh v. Rainwater, 572 F.2d 1053 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), when the appearance of an indigent defendant can be assured by an alternate form of release, "pretrial confinement for inability to post money bail would constitute imposition of an excessive restraint." Id. at 1058. Following the Fifth Circuit's reasoning, even if money bail might be constitutionally acceptable in certain circumstances, it can never be the only option available to indigent defendants.In addition to treating defendants differently and arbitrarily depending on their financial status, inflexible money-bail systems violate the fundamental constitutional requirement that individuals must generally be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before being deprived of their liberty or property. Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80 (1972). When ability to pay is at issue, the defendant must be given notice that ability to pay may be a "critical question" in the proceedings, and given an- 27 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 39 of 47opportunity to provide information about his financial status. Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 446-448 (2011). Then, the court must actually take that information into account and make an "express finding ... that the defendant has the ability to pay." Id. at 447-448. In the context of pretrial release, therefore, if a jurisdiction considers imposing a monetary condition of release, it must take account of the defendant's individual ability to pay, the availability of less restrictive alternatives, and the need for pretrial detention in the first place. Inflexible money-bail systems do not satisfy this due process requirement; the preset bail schedule is outcome-determinative. As indigent defendants are given no opportunity to challenge these schedules, they are unconstitutional.CONCLUSION The order of the district court entering a preliminary injunction should be affirmed.Of Counsel: Paul R.Q.

The judge or judicial officer decides whether to release a defendant on personal recognizance or unsecured appearance bond, release a defendant on a condition or combination of conditions, temporarily detain a defendant, or detain a defendant according to procedures outlined in these Standards. The law favors the release of defendants pending adjudication of charges. Deprivation of liberty pending trial is harsh and oppressive, subjects defendants to economic and psychological hardship, interferes with their ability to defend themselves, and, in many instances, deprives their families of support. These Standards limit the circumstances under which pretrial detention may be authorized and provide procedural safeguards to govern pretrial detention proceedings.Standard 10-1.2. Release under least restrictive conditions; diversion and other alternative release optionsIn deciding pretrial release, the judicial officer should assign the least restrictive condition(s) of release that will reasonably ensure a defendant's attendance at court proceedings and protect the community, victims, witnesses or any other person. Such conditions may include participation in drug treatment, diversion programs or other pre-adjudication alternatives. The court should have a wide array of programs or options available to promote pretrial release on conditions that ensure appearance and protect the safety of the community, victims and witnesses pending trial and should have the capacity to develop release options appropriate to the risks and special needs posed by defendants, if released to the community. When no conditions of release are sufficient to accomplish the aims of pretrial release, defendants may be detained through specific procedures.Standard 10-1.4. Conditions of release(a) Consistent with these Standards, each jurisdiction should adopt procedures designed to promote the release of defendants on their ownA1Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 44 of 47recognizance or, when necessary, unsecured bond. Additional conditions should be imposed on release only when the need is demonstrated by the facts of the individual case reasonably to ensure appearance at court proceedings, to protect the community, victims, witnesses or any other person and to maintain the integrity of the judicial process. Whenever possible, methods for providing the appropriate judicial officer with reliable information relevant to the release decision should be developed, preferably through a pretrial services agency or function, as described in Standard 10-1.9.(b) When release on personal recognizance is not appropriate reasonably to ensure the defendant's appearance at court and to prevent the commission of criminal offenses that threaten the safety of the community or any person, constitutionally permissible non-financial conditions of release should be employed consistent with Standard 10-5.2.(c) Release on financial conditions should be used only when no other conditions will ensure appearance. When financial conditions are imposed, the court should first consider releasing the defendant on an unsecured bond. If unsecured bond is not deemed a sufficient condition of release, and the court still seeks to impose monetary conditions, bail should be set at the lowest level necessary to ensure the defendant's appearance and with regard to a defendant's financial ability to post bond.(d) Financial conditions should not be employed to respond to concerns for public safety.(e) The judicial officer should not impose a financial condition of release that results in the pretrial detention of a defendant solely due to the defendant's inability to pay.(f) Consistent with the processes provided in these Standards, compensated sureties should be abolished. When financial bail is imposed, the defendant should be released on the deposit of cash or securities with the court of not more than ten percent of the amount of the bail, to be returned at the conclusion of the case.Standard 10-1.7. Consideration of the nature of the charge in determining release optionsAlthough the charge itself may be a predicate to pretrial detention proceedings, the judicial officer should exercise care not to give inordinate weightA2Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 45 of 47to the nature of the present charge in evaluating factors for the pretrial release decision except when, coupled with other specified factors, the charge itself may cause the initiation of a pretrial detention hearing pursuant to the provisions of Standard 10-5.9.Standard 10-5.3. Release on financial conditions(a) Financial conditions other than unsecured bond should be imposed only when no other less restrictive condition of release will reasonably ensure the defendant's appearance in court. The judicial officer should not impose a financial condition that results in the pretrial detention of the defendant solely due to an inability to pay.(b) Financial conditions of release should not be set to prevent future criminal conduct during the pretrial period or to protect the safety of the community or any person.(c) Financial conditions should not be set to punish or frighten the defendant or to placate public opinion.(d) On finding that a financial condition of release should be set, the judicial officer should require the first of the following alternatives thought sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the defendant's reappearance:(i) the execution of an unsecured bond in an amount specified by the judicial officer, either signed by other persons or not;(ii) the execution of an unsecured bond in an amount specified by the judicial officer, accompanied by the deposit of cash or securities equal to ten percent of the face amount of the bond. The full deposit should be returned at the conclusion of the proceedings, provided the defendant has not defaulted in the performance of the conditions of the bond; or(iii) the execution of a bond secured by the deposit of the full amount in cash or other property or by the obligation of qualified, uncompensated sureties.(e) Financial conditions should be the result of an individualized decision taking into account the special circumstances of each defendant, the defendant's ability to meet the financial conditions and the defendant's flight risk, and shouldA3Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 46 of 47never be set by reference to a predetermined schedule of amounts fixed according to the nature of the charge.(f) Financial conditions should be distinguished from the practice of allowing a defendant charged with a traffic or other minor offense to post a sum of money to be forfeited in lieu of any court appearance. This is in the nature of a stipulated fine and, where permitted, may be employed according to a predetermined schedule.(g) In appropriate circumstances when the judicial officer is satisfied that such an arrangement will ensure the appearance of the defendant, third parties should be permitted to fulfill these financial conditions[.]A4Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 47 of 47
I. THE ABA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE STAN-DARD5-6.1REPRESENTSABROAD-BASEDCONSENSUSANDIS GROUNDEDINIMPORTANT POLICY CONSIDER-ATIONS.While, as petitioner argues, this Court's precedents guide the proper resolution to the question presented in this case, the ABA's Criminal Justice Standard 56.1 provides additional reliable guidance regarding the question of when the right to counsel should be deemed to attach. Forged over the course of several decades by the most prominent authorities in the field and sharpened by the views of diverse interest groups, Standard 5-6.1 retains at its core the principle that the accused should have access to counsel from the very initial stages of criminal5proceedings. This longstanding position reflects policy considerations critical to the functioning of the criminal justice system.A. Criminal Justice Standard 5-6.1For the last forty years, the ABA has maintained a consistent view on the issue at the heart of this case -- that indigent criminal defendants should be provided with competent counsel at the earliest possible stage of criminal proceedings, and certainly no later than the accused's initial appearance before a judicial officer. This policy is currently set forth in Standard 5-6.1 of the ABA's Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services 5-6.1 (8d ed. 1992) (hereinafter "Standard 5-6.1"). Entitled "Initial provision of counsel," it states in relevant part:Upon request, counsel should be provided topersons who have not been charged or taken intocustody but who are in need of legalrepresentationarisingfromcriminalproceedings. Counsel should be provided to theaccused as soon as feasible and, in any event,after custody begins, at appearance before acommitting magistrate, or when formal chargesare filed, whichever occurs earliest.Standard 5-6.1 (emphasis added). Although the Criminal Justice Standards have been revised twice, the ABA has never wavered from the core principle expressed in Standard 5-6.1 or from the basic rationale underlying it -- that "representation by counsel is desirable in criminal cases both from the viewpoint of the defendant and of society." ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Providing Defense Services 3 (Approved Draft 1968).6The initial version of Standard 5-6.1 was a productof the ABA's commitment almost a half-century agoto "the single most comprehensive and probably themost monumental undertaking in the field ofcriminal justice ever attempted by the American legalprofession in our national history" -- the developmentof nonmandatory standards that could be used to"improv[e] the fairness, efficiency and effectiveness ofcriminal justice in the state and federal courts."Warren E. Burger, Introduction: The ABA Standardsfor Criminal Justice, 12 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 251, 251-52 (1974); ABA, Annual Report 422 (1964).5Hundreds of professionals from all over the countryand representing every aspect of the criminal justicesystem participated in a rigorous process ofconsultation and review that ultimately yielded "abalanced, practical work intended to walk the fineline between the protection of society and theprotection of the constitutional rights of the accusedindividual."Burger, Introduction: The ABAStandards for Criminal Justice, supra, at 251-52.The predecessor to Standard 5-6.1, which was born of this elaborate effort, expressed the ABA's view that counsel should be provided to the accused "as soon as is feasible after he is taken into custody, when he appears before a committing magistrate, or when he is formally charged, whichever occurs earliest." ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Providing Defense Services § 5.1. (Approved Draft 1968). This position was not novel even in 1968, but rather reflected an already5 See also Tom C. Clark, The American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice: Prescription for an Ailing System, 47 Notre Dame L. Rev. 429, 431 (1972) (noting the "enormity of the undertaking" and the "scholarly and high professional quality of the Standards themselves").7existing "consensus among judges, prosecutors and defense counsel that appointment of counsel at the earliest possible stage is a critical aspect of providing representation that is truly valuable and effective." Id. § 5.1 cmt. (internal citation omitted). Indeed, other standards adopted by the ABA in the early 1960s had similarly "emphasized the importance of early appointment." Id.At no point did Standard 5.1's drafters indicate --nor has the ABA since suggested -- that "theimportance of early appointment" depended onwhether a prosecutor was at that moment involved inthe case. Jd. Early representation was insteaddeemed advisable for two reasons independent of theparticular prosecutor's role.First, the earlyassistance of counsel would protect "the immediateliberty of the accused and his opportunity to assist inthe preparation of his defense," both of which "are atstake" throughout the initial stages of criminalproceedings. Id. Second, involving defense attorneysfrom the start would advance the efficientadministration of justice by reducing the risk ofwasteful prosecutions."Representation at theearliest opportunity," the Commentary explained, "isessential to forestall the institution of unfounded proceedings through effective use of the preliminaryexamination and other screening devices." Id.The ABA's policy, which reflects this dual rationale, remains the same today as it was four decades ago: all defendants should be provided with the assistance of counsel at the earliest possible stage of criminal proceedings, and certainly no later than the initial appearance before a magistrate where their liberty is8 at stake.6 This position is grounded in compelling policy considerations and accords with the rationale underlying this Court's right-to-counsel precedents.B. The Standard's Rationales Standard 5-6.1 reflects the ABA's longstanding recognition that the early assistance of counsel is beneficial both to the individual defendant and to society at large. One of the principal aims of Standard 5-6.1 has always been to safeguard the rights of the accused. The ABA recognized from the outset, and researchers have since confirmed, that the presence of counsel at the very earliest stages of a criminal proceeding protects "both the immediate liberty of the accused and his opportunity to assist in the preparation of his defense." Standards Relating to the Provision of Defense Services § 5.1 cmt. (Approved Draft 1968). Counsel can immediately interview crucial witnesses while key events are still fresh in their minds and before they become difficult to locate. ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services § 5-5.1 cmt. (2d ed. 1980). If the accused remains incarcerated, moreover, counsel will be able "to marshal facts in support" of pretrial release. Id. Counsel's intervention "can also6In 1998, the ABA House of Delegates reaffirmed that counsel should be provided as early as possible when it approved a resolution recommending: (1) that all jurisdictions ensure that defendants are represented by counsel at their initial judicial appearance where bail is set; and (2) that adequate resources be provided to ensure the recommended level of representation. An accompanying report emphasized that the resolution was designed to remedy the "specific issues" of "fair representation of the poor and unnecessary prison overcrowding." ABA Criminal Justice Section, Report to the House of Delegates 3 (Aug. 1998). The resolution thus constituted "an important and necessary complement" to Standard 5-6.1. Id.9 sometimes serve to convince the prosecutor to dismiss unfounded charges, to charge the accused with less serious offenses, or to divert the case entirely from the criminal courts." Id.; see also Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services 5-6.1 emt. (3d ed. 1992).Subsequent studies, including those conducted in the bail-hearing context, demonstrate the real-world foundations of Standard 5-6.1. These studies confirm what the ABA has long known from collective experience -- that defense counsel's prompt entrance into the case protects both the immediate liberty interest and subsequent trial rights of the accused. For instance, one study funded by the National Institute of Justice found that early representation by appointed counsel improved the accuracy of bail setting and the early release of defendants without danger to the public or to the attorney-client relationship. U.S. Dep't of Justice, Nat'l Inst. of Justice, Early Representation by Defense Counsel Field Test: Final Evaluation Report 361-65 (The URSA Institute, Aug. 1984) ("Field Test"); see also Douglas L. Colbert, Thirty-Five Years After Gideon: The Illusory Right to Counsel at Bail Proceedings, 1998 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1 (1998) (arguing that the absence of counsel at the bail hearing negatively affects the trust relationship between client and attorney, the crucial initial investigation of the case, and the preparation for trial); Douglas L. Colbert et al., Do Attorneys Really Matter? The Empirical and Legal Case for the Right of Counsel at Bail, 23 Cardozo L. Rev. 1719 (2002).77The latter study was conducted by the Baltimore City Lawyers at Bail Project, which provided legal representation to "nearly 4,000 lower-income defendants accused of nonviolent offenses" at the initial bail hearing. Colbert, supra, at 1720. It10 Early participation by defense counsel addresses another concern underlying Standard 5-6.1: promoting the efficient administration of justice. Appointed counsel can play a significant role in reducing the burden on congested court dockets and overcrowded jails. Burgeoning prison populations, it is widely recognized, constitute a serious and persistent problem across the nation. What is more, well over half of the inmates of local jails are those who have not been convicted of the crime with which they are charged, but are instead incarcerated awaiting arraignment, revocation, or trial. U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2006, at 6, http://www.ojp. usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/pjim06.pdf (last visited Jan. 22,found that indigent defendants represented by counsel at their bail hearing were over two-and-a-half times as likely as unrepresented defendants with similar characteristics to be released on their own recognizance, and two-and-a-half times as likely to obtain a reduction of bail initially set following arrest. Id. at 1752-56.8 For example, a recent study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics indicated that "local jails nationwide operated at an average of 94% of rated capacity," meaning that some "exceeded their capacity." U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2006, at 7, http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/pjim06.pdf (last visited Jan. 22, 2008). At least one state, Michigan, has a "County Jail Overcrowding Emergency Act," which allows sheriffs to defer the admission of certain offenders, among other emergency measures. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 801.51 et seq., as amended. In other states, jails have operated -- and in some cases continue to operate -- under consent decrees entered as a result of overcrowding complaints. See, e.g., Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 354 n.1 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); Castillo v. Cameron County, 238 F.3d 339 (5th Cir. 2001); Michael Higgins, Cook Inmates Bunking in Shifts; Move Eliminates Cots on Floor, but Some Say Crowding Remains, Chi. Trib., Dec. 2, 2007, at C4.11 2008); see also U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Profile of Jail Inmates, 2002, at 2, http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/pji02.pdf (last visited Jan. 22, 2008). Early representation by counsel makes it possible to "quickly identify individuals who are eligible for pretrial release, thereby freeing limited jail space for those who require pretrial detention." ABA Criminal Justice Section, Report to the House of Delegates 1 (Aug. 1998). It alsoallow[s] immediate identification of charges that are inappropriate for criminal prosecution, permitting the criminal justice system to devote its limited resources to more serious cases. With lawyers involved at the initial court proceeding, many cases also would be resolved much sooner -- in days, rather than weeks or months. Id. (footnote omitted). Other reliable studies confirm the ABA's conclusion. See Field Test at 361-65 (finding that early representation will benefit the public fisc by, among other things, significantly reducing case-processing time and the overall number of cases in the system at one time). As this Court has previously noted, efficiency-based factors of this sort are germane to the analysis of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. See Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U.S. 77, 93 (2004) (rejecting rule requiring provision of detailed warning concerning waiver of Sixth Amendment right to counsel in part because the rule could impede "the prompt disposition of the case" and waste the resources of the state or the defendant).That Standard 5-6.1 helps to advance both efficiency and liberty interests is further demonstrated by the choice of many jurisdictions to adopt a similar, if not identical, policy in their criminal codes, procedural rules, or rules of court.12 See, e.g., Wash Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.1(b)(1) (court rule reciting Standard 5-6.1 verbatim); Ariz. R. Crim. P. 6.1(a) (timing requirement analogous to Standard 5-6.1). The federal government, the District of Columbia, and at least eight other states -- California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin -- guarantee the assistance of counsel at bail hearings. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 44(a); D.C. Code § 23-1322; Cal. Penal Code § 859; Conn. Gen. Stat. §54-1b; Del. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 44; Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.130(c)(1); Mass. R. Crim. P. 8; N.D. Ct. R. Crim. P. 44; W. Va. R. Crim. P. 44; Wis. Stat. Ann. § 970.02. Amicus's research also indicates that, with some variations by locality, many other states require that defendants be provided access to counsel beginning at or shortly after their initial appearance. See, e.g., Me. R. Crim. P. 5C; N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law §§ 170.10, 180.10; Pa. R. Crim. P. 122 & cmt. These rules reveal that legislatures and courts nationwide understand "the importance of providing counsel . . . at the earliest possible time after arrest." See Fed. R. Crim. P. 44, advisory comm. note.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Standard 56.1 helps to reduce discrimination on the basis of economic status. See Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services 5-6.1 cmt. So long as indigent defendants are not "provided counsel at the earliest possible time, discrimination occurs between the poor defendant and the defendant of financial means." Id. Only those of means are "able to afford counsel," and will accordingly have access to "legal representation well before formal commencement of adversary proceedings." Jd. Standard 5-6.1 seeks to eliminate this disparity by "provid[ing] for the indigent accused similar representation opportuni-13ties." Jd. For this reason, Standard 5-6.1 remains central to the mission of the ABA and advances a principal tenet of the judicial system: equal justice under the law.Il. THE ABA'S STANDARD 5-6.1 IS CONSIS-TENT WITH THE PRAGMATIC ASSESS-MENT THIS COURT CONDUCTS IN DE-FINING THE SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO COUNSEL.Standard 5-6.1 represents the profession's considered judgment that defense counsel should participate from the earliest possible stages of the proceedings -- even those stages as to which this Court has not yet recognized a Sixth Amendment right to counsel. See Standard 5-6.1 cmt. Standard 5-6.1 is relevant to the Court's current Sixth Amendment analysis for at least three reasons.First, this Court has undertaken a "pragmaticassessment" in determining the scope of the SixthAmendment right to counsel.See Patterson v.Illinois, 487 U.S. 285, 298 (1988).The Courtevaluates "the usefulness of counsel to the accused atthe particular proceeding, and the dangers to theaccused of proceeding without counsel." Jd.; see alsoMaine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 170 (1985) (notingthe Court's "[rJecogni[tion] that the right to theassistance of counsel is shaped by the need for theassistance of counsel"). Standard 5-6.1 speaksdirectly to this inquiry, representing the consideredassessment of the bench and bar that the assistanceof counsel during the early stages of a criminal caseis, as a practical matter, vital. This unwavering"policy prescription{] of the legal profession" shouldbe considered in defining the scope and nature of theright to counsel, which "has historically been anevolving concept" responsive to the contributions andviews of the profession. See Argersinger v. Hamlin,14 407 U.S. 25, 44 (1972) (Burger, C.J., concurring in the result).9 rpaftrarrcitoeSkaimeclno"ceonodaw"neltldnewh,etiedlsilrguenSddatbeiraenr_rnltadhyiaa"irgttpnhdongeimnfeton.rt5thm-io6sms.a1tunnCtyoiTulihcsrirtisd'ttehsciefcoaenlnsSCb"diioexsaugttnrihetitnnnsntiAnmttghhehwaeenistodhfpmeenetrlthnioiteontrhideger proceedings. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 57 (1932); see also Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 688-89 n.6 (1972) (plurality opinion) (quoting this aspect of Powell with approval). And because "depriv[ing] a person of counsel during the period prior to trial may be more damaging than denial of counsel during the trial itself," the Court has likewise "recognized that the assistance of counsel cannot be limited to participation in a trial." Moulton, 474 U.S. at 170. This principle applies with even greater force in the present era, when the overwhelming majority of criminal cases are resolved by way of guilty pleas and thus never reach the trial stage.1!°Third, this Court has repeatedly expressed the very concerns that animated the drafters of the initial9This Court has repeatedly noted its regard for the ABA's Criminal Justice Standards by citing and relying on them in the Sixth Amendment context. See, e.g., Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 387; Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524; McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wis., Dist. 1, 486 U.S. 429, 436 n.8 (1988). The ABA submits that Standard 5-6.1 should be given similar consideration.10 See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, 2003, at 2, http:// www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cfjs0302.pdf (96% of convicted federal defendants pleaded guilty in 2003) (last visited Jan. 22, 2008); U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 2002, at 1, http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ bjs/pub/pdf/fssc02.pdf (95% of state felony convictions are obtained through guilty pleas) (last visited Jan. 22, 2008).15 version of Standard 5-6.1. The Court has reasoned, for instance, that "the guiding hand of counsel . . . is essential" from the earliest stages of criminal proceedings "to protect the indigent accused against an erroneous or improper prosecution." Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 9 (1970). Counsel may well "expose fatal weaknesses in the State's case that lead the magistrate to refuse to bind the accused over." Id. But even if she does not achieve this favorable result, counsel can at the very least "be influential .. . in making effective arguments for the accused on such matters as... bail." Jd. The bail decision, in turn, determines the accused's immediate liberty, "any deprivation of [which] is a serious matter." See Argersinger, 407 U.S. at 41 (Burger, C.J., concurring in result); see also Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 114 (1975) ("Pretrial confinement may imperil the suspect's job, interrupt his source of income, and impair his family relationships. Even pretrial release may be accompanied by burdensome conditions that effect a significant restraint on liberty") (citations omitted). These considerations buttress the Court's conclusion that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, "[w]hatever else it may mean," entitles an accused "to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him -- whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment." Brewer v. Williams, 4380 U.S. 387, 398 (1977) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).Standard 5-6.1 responds to the concerns that underlie this Court's decisions and reflects the "pragmatic" view that counsel is indeed "useful[]" at early stages where defendants face "dangers" that competent counsel could easily avert. See Patterson,16 487 U.S. at 298. That was indisputably true for petitioner here. III. PETITIONER'S CASE ILLUSTRATES THEADVANTAGES OF THE ABA'S APPROACH AND THE DANGERS OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS' PROSECU-TORIAL INVOLVEMENT TEST. Petitioner's odyssey highlights the very concerns that animated the ABA's adoption of Standard 5-6.1 and that underlie this Court's right-to-counsel precedents. Petitioner was arrested and jailed because of a police officer's erroneous understanding that petitioner had previously been convicted of a felony and was therefore unlawfully in possession of a firearm -- a simple mistake, but precisely of the type that counsel is best suited to spot and to correct. Pet. Br. at 4. Had a competent attorney assisted petitioner at or immediately following his initial appearance, petitioner may have rapidly ceased to interest the prosecutors, the courts, and the jails, and would likely have suffered minimal loss of freedom. But petitioner was unable to afford an attorney, and the county failed to appoint one for him. Id. at 47. As a result, he was indicted by a grand jury, rearrested, brought before a magistrate for a second time, incarcerated, transferred to a different jail because of overcrowding, and was finally cleared of the charges a full nine months after his initial appearance before a magistrate. Id. at 4-8. Thus, depriving petitioner of an attorney's early attention did more than cause petitioner to suffer an unnecessary and inequitable loss of liberty. It caused judges, prosecutors, law enforcement officials, jail administrators, and citizen grand jurors needlessly to expend time and resources on petitioner's processing, prosecution, and incarceration.17 In no way was petitioner's need for counsel diminished by the lack of prosecutorial involvement at his initial appearance. On the contrary, the absence of a prosecutor's professional attention to the case may have made it even less likely that the initial error would be rapidly corrected. This alone counsels against adoption of the Fifth Circuit's approach in cases such as petitioner's. The ABA's long-standing position, consistent with this Court's precedents and with the principle of equal justice under the law, suggests that petitioner should have been provided counsel, at the latest, as soon as his limited waiver of assistance had expired -- that is, following his initial appearance before the magistrate. This is true regardless of whether the power of the State was exercised through a prosecutor or with a prosecutor's knowledge. Promptly honoring petitioner's request for assistance would have prevented the needless loss of individual liberty and promoted the efficient administration of justice.18CONCLUSION The ABA respectfully submits that this Court should reverse the decision of the court of appeals.Respectfully submitted,OF COUNSEL: JEFFREY T.

A. The Plaintiffs Have Suffered No Compensable Taking as a Result of the LPO IOLTA Program.To establish a claim under the Fifth Amendment, a plaintiff must show that"private property" has been "taken for public use, without just compensation."U.S. Const., amend. V. Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment takings claims in this casetherefore require proof of three elements: (1) the existence of private property inwhich they had an interest; (2) governmental taking of that property; and (3) anentitlement to just compensation. Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986,1000-01 (1984); Pennsylvania Central Transp. Co, v. City of New York, 438 U.S.104, 124-25 (1978).Plaintiffs erroneously treat each of these issues as settled in the wake of theUnited States Supreme Court's decision in Phillips v. Washington LegalFoundation, _U.S._, 118 S. Ct. 1925, 141 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1998). In fact,2 . S16however, Phillips precludes the Fifth Amendment claims of plaintiffs Daugs andMaxwell, in which they assert a right to compensation based on their "legal" titleto funds deposited with them. The Supreme Court in Phillips was asked to decidewhether attorneys or clients had property interests in interest earned on funds heldby the attorneys for the clients. Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1928. In holding that onlythe clients had a property interest, the Court rejected the very claim asserted by theLPOs in this case, Daugs and Maxwell. Further, while Phillips did decide thatclients had a property interest in IOLTA-generated interest on a retainer deposit,based on the lower court's characterization of Texas law, it did not consider thevery different question raised by Hayes and Brown here, i.e., whether IOLTA-generated interest on a real estate escrow account is the "property" of the buyerunder Washington law. Finally, Phillips did not even address (much less decide)the second and third elements of the takings claim in that case.The questions left open in Phillips now should be resolved in defendants'22 >favor. Plaintiffs Brown and Hayes cannot claim that the IOLTA interest generated in connection with their real estate transactions is their property under Washington> > 2law. Given that they made no agreement concerning interest before they opened their escrows and put their funds beyond their control, Washington law gave>neither Brown nor Hayes a property right in interest generated by those funds,>22172wvweeeeeweeeeeeteeewe eee eeeither before or after IOLTA. Further, Brown and Hayes also cannot show that there was an unconstitutional taking or any entitlement to compensation. The "property" they claim has no value to them, and the State therefore is not required to pay for it.1.Neither Daugs Nor Maxwell Had a Property InterestImplicated by the IOLTA Program.Plaintiff Dennis Daugs is an LPO and part owner of SeaTac Escrow, Inc.The record shows that Daugs has never deposited any money into an IOLTAaccount. Daugs Dec. § 6 (ER 65). Plaintiff L. Dian Maxwell, on the other hand,resigned her LPO certificate so that her employer could avoid IOLTA compliance.Maxwell Dec. 4 4 (ER 68). Neither Daugs nor Maxwell can establish a property|interest protected by the Fifth Amendment.In deciding what constitutes a protected property interest, federal courts lookto "existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such asstate law." Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972),9quoted in Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1930. Far from granting Daugs or Maxwell a>property interest, Washington law unambiguously forbids either Maxwell or Daugs2from receiving any "benefit" from any "funds received from any principal or any2party to an escrow transaction .. ." WAC 208-680E-011 (1996); see former WAC18s308-128E-011 (1989). Thus, in Fifth Amendment terms, Washington law acknowledges no "property" right inuring to an escrow agent as a result of holding client funds.To avoid this hurdle, plaintiffs characterize Daugs, through his company, as holding "legal title" to the funds deposited in his company's escrow account. E.g., Washington Legal Foundation ("WLF") Br. at 45. The very concept of "legal title" necessarily implies nominal title with no valuable beneficial interest. See, e.g., Lee v. Wrixon, 37 Wash. 47, 51, 79 P. 489 (1905) (although all property is subject to execution in Washington, "bare legal title 7 uncoupled with a beneficial interest is not subject to execution"). Thus, even assuming Daugs (or SeaTac Escrow) held bare "legal title" to escrow deposits, he would not thereby have a constitutionally protected property interest in the deposits under Washington law.Maxwell, on the other hand, theorizes that her Fifth Amendment rights have been violated because, at the behest of her employer, she voluntarily surrendered her LPO license. WLF Br. at 18-19. Maxwell attributes this action to the" The regulation by its terms applies only to licensed escrow agencies, such as SeaTac Escrow, Daugs' company. Under common law, however, even nonlicensed escrow agents, such as the title company that employs Maxwell, act as fiduciaries when handling an escrow. National Bank of Washington v. Equity Investors, 81 Wn.2d 886, 910, 506 P.2d 20 (1973). As such, they must account to their principals for any profits earned through use of their principals' property.

But Maxwell had no property right to be freefrom the Washington Supreme Court's regulation of her limited license to practicelaw as an LPO. At most she had a right not to be excluded from her profession"for reasons that contravene the Due Process or Equal Protection Clause of the.Fourteenth Amendment." Schware v. Board of Bar Exam'rs, 353 U.S. 232, 238-39>(1957). Here, Maxwell lost her LPO certificate solely because her employer>unilaterally decided that it would no longer use LPOs rather than risk losing the> ."earnings credits" that banks commonly pay to attract interest-free deposits.'°. .Maxwell has no "property" right to be free of such a business decision.> >'? Tn this respect, Maxwell's argument is at odds with plaintiffs' claim that earnings credits and the impact of losing earnings credits are passed on to customers. See WLF Br. at 32. If the value of earnings credits were passed on tocustomers, and if the burden of their loss were borne by customers, then allcompanies using LPOs would pass through increased costs resulting from IOLTA,and Maxwell's employer would have no competitive motivation to avoid the cost.The employer's conduct thus demonstrates that the marketplace does not in factpass earnings credits through to the escrow agency's clients. In any event, byeliminating LPOs, Maxwell's employer limited the services it offered, apparentlyelecting to compete in a different market niche, i.e., with those escrow companiesthat do not offer the document services performed by LPOs. The evident goal ofMaxwell's employer was to retain earnings credits, even though the law forbidsfiduciaries from reaping those benefits and even though its clients thereafter wererequired to go elsewhere for the document services performed by LPOs. MaxwellDec. {5 (ER 68). Nothing in the Constitution gave Maxwell a right to avoid theconsequences of her employer's decision to reposition itself in the market.20Like the lawyer in Phillips, Daugs and Maxwell have no protectableproperty interest in any interest generated on escrow accounts. As a result, theyhave no Fifth Amendment claim.2.Neither Hayes Nor Brown Has Suffered a Taking ThatWould Entitle Either to Compensation.> .a. Hayes and Brown Have No Property Interest Implicated by the IOLTA Program..The remaining individual plaintiffs are two real estate purchasers, Gregory> .Hayes and Allen Brown, who assert a Fifth Amendment claim based on the fact.that "they have placed their funds in the custody of their escrow companies, and>»those companies deposited the funds into IOLTA accounts." WLF Br. at 16. From>this assertion, plaintiffs reason that "the interest-follows-principal rule mandates a>finding that appellants Brown and Hayes ... are the equitable owners of interestgenerated by their funds." WLF Br. at 30 (emphasis in original). Under Phillips,they claim, this means that they have a property interest protected underWashington law.> 2But Phillips does not govern this case. In Phillips, all parties agreed that the>client, Summers, owned the funds that he had deposited on retainer with his2lawyer. The funds were "freely available to the client upon demand," Phillips, 118> 2S. Ct. at 1930, and the client thus presumably had the ability to possess, control222212and dispose of the funds when and as he saw fit. Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1933 (alluding to "possession, control, and disposition" as "valuable rights that inhere tothe property"). Based on these facts, and on the Fifth Circuit's reading of statelaw, the Supreme Court held that interest must follow principal under Texas lawand ruled that Summers had a property interest in the revenues that his IOLTAdeposit generated during the time that the deposit was "freely available" to him.The escrowed funds at issue in this case, however, have a character entirelydifferent from Summers' retainer deposit in Phillips. Under Washington law,parties create an escrow by agreeing upon the terms of a deposit andcommunicating their agreement to the depositary or escrow holder. Lechner v.Halling, 35 Wn.2d 903, 913, 216 P.2d 179 (1950). Once the parties have reachedthat agreement, the funds or documents delivered to the depositary pass beyond the"control or dominion of the parties," Bruener v. Hillman, 186 Wash. 663, 669-70,259 P.2d 731, 734 (1936), and the escrow agent's obligations are defined by escrow instructions, with which the agent "must comply strictly." Styrk vy. Cornerstone- Invs., Inc., 61 Wn. App. 463, 472, 810 P.2d 1366 (1991). See In re Presidential»Corp., 180 B.R. 233, 238 (9" Cir. BAP 1995) (once funds are placed in escrow,»depositor can "no longer change his mind as to their disposition"). Thus, incontrast to the retainer in Phillips, the funds escrowed by Hayes and Brown were2 222not "freely available" to them and were not subject to their "possession, control, and di. spositwoe ion."! 4 Rather, the funds they deposited were available only in the circumstances and to the extent described in the written escrow instructions, subject to the competing claims of the seller, the other party to the transaction.Indeed, given that both parties to an escrow necessarily have some beneficial interest in the principal, the slogan "interest follows principal" cannot sensibly apply, at least in the absence of written directions in the escrow agreement. The adage might mean that interest follows principal into the pocket of the seller, who receives the principal when escrow closes. It might mean that interest follows principal back into the pocket of the buyer, who placed the funds into escrow.. (This appears to be the view of Brown and Hayes, both of whom were buyers. Brown Dec. 43 (ER 60); Hayes Dec. § 3 (ER 62).) Or it might mean that interest follows principal according to when the escrow agent stops holding deposited funds as agent for the buyer and begins holding them as agent for seller. See'' This case also differs from Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155 (1980), which the Court discussed at length in Phillips. In Webb's, state law required the plaintiff to deposit its funds with the court and required that the funds be placed in an interest bearing account. Id. at 156-57 & nn. 1,2. Thus, as Justice Breyer pointed out in Phillips, the funds would have been available to earn interest but for state intervention. Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1938 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Here, in contrast, Brown and Hayes chose as a matter of private contract law to place their funds beyond their dominion and control, in an escrow account from which they could earn no interest.23Lechner, 35 Wn.2d at 918-19; In re United Home Loans, Inc., 71 B.R. 885, 891(W.D. Wash. 1987). Under this latter approach, the "property right" to interest would belong to the buyer until the instant the seller has met the conditions to the escrow, with interest going to the seller thereafter. See In re Presidential Corp., 180 B.R. at 238 (escrow agent holds funds as agent for buyer until conditions for escrow met).Washington, however, has never prescribed a rule giving any party a right to interest generated by funds once they have been deposited into an escrow account, beyond the depositor's dominion and control. Before the advent of IOLTA, Washington regulations and industry practice forced the parties to claim and define their rights to interest in the escrow instructions, in advance of the deposit, or forfeit those rights. Thus, the principals to an escrow could agree in advance that the funds in which they had a mutual interest would be placed in an interest bearing account and could agree as to the disposition of any resulting interest. See WAC 308-128E-011 (1989). If they did not do so, neither the buyer nor the seller had a contractual basis to lay claim to earnings on the funds. Further, as long as the escrow agent fulfilled its fiduciary duties, the parties to the escrow would have24@8 eee&no common law claim to interest that they did not contract to receive.'> In other words, before IOLTA, Washington never recognized anything resembling a property right in interest generated by escrowed funds.Washington has recognized no different or greater property right in the wake of IOLTA. In the post-IOLTA era, just as before IOLTA, Washington escrow regulations governing non-LPO transactions give parties a right to interest only if they request the deposit of their escrowed funds into an interest-bearing account and agree in advance to the allocation of earned interest. WAC 208-680E-011(1) (1996). The IOLTA program differs only in requiring an LPO to deposit funds into interest-bearing accounts whenever it appears that doing so would yield a net return to the parties to the escrow. APR 12.1(0)3). As a practical matter, in accordance with industry custom and practice, such a determination almost invariably will yield an advance agreement among the parties as to disposition of the interest upon the closing of the escrow. By thus enhancing the availability of interest to parties whose deposits will yield a net return, IOLTA hardly can be said'S Neither could the escrow agent lay claim to any earnings on the funds,either under common law or Washington regulation. See WAC 308-128E-011(1989); Restatement (Second) of Agency § 388 (1958). The net effect ofWashington law was to forbid interest to either the escrow agent or the principalsto the transaction, absent a contrary agreement, leaving the depository bank to earnany profits..25to have created a new property right inuring to the benefit of those whose escrows are so modest in amount, or of such short duration, that they cannot yield an individual net benefit. Given that parties to an escrow by definition have willingly parted with dominion and control over their deposits under Washington law, they cannot complain if others (excluding their fiduciaries) make use of their funds to produce benefits.For example, the parties to the escrow would have no basis to complain about the use to which the bank holding their escrowed accounts might put the deposited funds. Once the funds are deposited with the escrow agent's bank, they become the bank's property, subject only to its contractual obligation to repay the funds to the depositor on the terms and conditions agreed upon between the bank and the escrow agent.!® Citizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf, 516 US. 16, 21 (1995) (deposit in bank is not the.depositor's "property," but "consists of nothing more than a promise to pay, from the bank to the depositor"); Allied Sheet Metal'© Brown and Hayes make an "alternative argument" to the effect that their property was "taken" when their escrow deposits were used without their consent. WLF Br. at 21,n. 5. They premise this argument on the notion that they have a "right to exclude others from making use of their property." Id. This argument need not detain the Court. Brown and Hayes already gave the bank the right to use their property in any way it saw fit when they transferred their funds into escrow, knowing that they would be deposited in a bank. Having done so, they cannot now claim a constitutionally protected right to direct precisely the disposition of "their" money.26Fabricators, Inc. v. Peoples Nat'| Bank of Wash., 10 Wn. App. 530, 539, 518 P.2d 734 (1974) (funds "became the bank's property upon deposit"). The bank would be free to invest the deposits in any way it saw fit or let them lie dormant, and it even would be free to donate profits from the deposits to groups providing legal services to the poor, all without accounting to the principals to the escrow. The fact that the escrow agent may have entered into an agreement with the bank to remit some of its profits to the LFW, see APR 12.1(c)(4), does not create a new property interest or duty to account where none previously existed.Hayes and Brown have never claimed that they agreed in advance with their sellers to place their escrowed funds in an interest-bearing account; that they. agreed with their sellers as to the allocation of any interest; or that their deposits could have generated net interest even if they had agreed to an allocation with their sellers. As a result, under Washington law, they have no property right to the IOLTA interest (or other earnings) that may have been generated after they placed the escrowed funds beyond their control.b. Even Assuming that Hayes and Brown Have a Property Interest, the Washington IOLTA Program Does Not Take that Interest.Plaintiffs treat the question of whether their property has been "taken" as having been resolved by Phillips. WLF Br. at 42-43. In fact, however, the .27majority in Phillips expressly declined to reach the takings question, Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1934, and the minority explained forcefully why no taking should be found. Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1936 (Souter, J., dissenting). Thus, the question of whether a taking has occurred remains and must be decided under the established test set forth in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978).""For the sake of brevity, the ABA will not separately brief this issue. It is clear, however, as Justice Souter explained in his dissent in Phillips, that plaintiffs had no investment-backed expectations of receiving interest on their escrowed principal and that IOLTA did not deny them money they otherwise would have received. See Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1936 (Souter, J., dissenting). For the reasons explained by Justice Souter, there has been no taking.c. Even Assuming that Hayes and Brown Have a Property Interest that Has Been Taken, They Are Not Entitled to Compensation.Even if the Court agrees with plaintiffs that the IOLTA interest was the "property" of Hayes and Brown, their claim must fail because they are not entitled to compensation. The Supreme Court in Phillips recognized that this might be the result. In the last paragraph of its opinion, the majority noted that it did not'' The Court should reject plaintiffs' effort to transform this matter into a case of a per se taking, a concept that has been applied only to cases involving28"express an opinion as to the amount of `just compensation,' ifany, due respondents." Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1934 (emphasis added). At the same time, the four Phillips dissenters signaled that even if IOLTA interest were the client's property, no compensation would be due. Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1936 (Souter, J., dissenting) (compensation to plaintiffs based upon the value of their lost rights "would not obviously produce much benefit" to them). The four dissenters foresaw the correct result.Principles of just compensation focus on restoring to a property owner only the value of the property interest taken by the government. As a general rule, that value is determined based upon the "market value" of the property. See Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 US. 1, 6 (1949). In assessing market value, courts look not to the value attributed to the property as a result of an owner's "unique need for property or idiosyncratic attachment to it." Id. at 5. Rather, the . compensation required under the Fifth Amendment embraces "only that value which is capable of transfer from owner to owner and thus of exchange for some equivalent. Its measure is the amount of that equivalent." Id.physical invasions of property. See WLF Br. at 47-48. Here, the alleged property right is at best elusive and the supposed invasion is invisible to plaintiffs.29Under this test, the value of property plainly can be zero in some circumstances, since not all property rights are worth the transaction costs of obtaining them. The Supreme Court's opinion in United States v. Virginia Elec. & Power Co. (""VEPCO"), 365 U.S. 624 (1961), illustrates the point. In that case, the Court considered the value of a "flowage easement," which gave a power company the right to flood riparian lands for hydropower. The Court recognized that market forces might make "it certain that the flowage easements would never be exercised by the . .. Power Company or its assigns . . "" VEPCO, 365 U.S. at 634, quoting Augusta Power Co. v. United States, 278 F.2d 1 (5th Cir. 1960). The Court in VEPCO observed that, in such a circumstance, nothing would be payable to the owner of the flowage easement, notwithstanding the destruction of that property right by virtue of the government's condemnation. Id.VEPCO aiso implicates the settled rule that compensation under the Fifth Amendment requires consideration not of the amount gained by the government as a result of the taking (which was a great deal in VEPCQ), but of the value of the property lost. See Boston Chamber of Commerce v. City of Boston, 217 U.S. 189, 195 (1910). Ifa taking itself generates value, that value is not properly considered in arriving at just compensation. See United States ex rel. TVA v. Powelson, 319 U.S. 266, 276 (1943) (government need not pay for value that the power of30eee ebeuueueee 6 &eminent domain itself creates); United States v. Twin City Power Co., 350 U.S. 222, 228 (1956) (special value of property to condemnor not to be considered in assessing compensation). Thus, in New York v. Sage, 239 U.S. 57, 61 (1915), Justice Holmes wrote that a city would not be "made to pay for any part [of value]it has added to the land by thus uniting it with other lots, if that union would nothave been practicable or have been attempted except by the intervention ofeminent domain."That principle should be dispositive in this instance. Hayes and Brownnever reached an agreement with their sellers to have their escrowed funds earninterest, let alone an agreement as to the allocation of that interest, nor could their`funds have generated net interest after they voluntarily gave up dominion andcontrol by depositing the funds into escrow. Thus, without the intervention of theIOLTA program, their funds could have generated nothing at all for them, a pointthat they do not contest. Once Brown and Hayes gave up dominion and controlJover their funds in circumstances in which they could not have earned net interest,= 2the theoretical "right" to interest had the same value to them as the barren flowage2easement would have had in VEPCO, i.e., no value at all. The government owes2»them nothing for the ephemeral "property" they claim to have lost.331>ee ee ee & |A comparison between purchasers who use LPOs, as Hayes and Brown did, and other real estate purchasers further illustrates the absence of any compensable loss. See Phillips, 118 S. Ct. at 1936 (Souter, J., dissenting) (in assessing just compensation, court should look to "claimant's putative property interest as it was or would have been enjoyed absent IJOLTA"). Parties to a transaction not using an LPO have the right to agree in advance to deposit escrowed funds in an interest bearing account and to allocate the contracted-for earnings on that deposit. If the amount of the fund is large enough, and if they maintain the deposit long enough, the buyer and seller will receive net interest according to the escrow agent's contract with the bank, divided according to their agreement. On the other hand, they will receive nothing if,like Brown and Hayes, they do not agree in advance to an allocation of interest, since their funds will be deposited in a "noninterest bearing demand deposit account." WAC 208-680E-01 1(1) (1996). Nor would they receive anything if their deposit could not generate a net return under their agreement with the escrow agent and the escrow agent's agreement with the bank.The situation with respect to interest is the same for those purchasers who use LPOs in closing their transactions. They receive interest if their funds can generate net interest and if they have settled on some arrangement for division of interest between buyer and seller; otherwise, they receive nothing. Thus, Brown32COeeueeueeueueeese UYand Hayes were no worse off than purchasers of property who complete their transactions free of the IOLTA program and who, according to Brown and Hayes, have had no "property" taken.'® Indeed, they were better off since, unlike other closing personnel, the LPOs who handled their transactions had an ethical obligation to place their funds in an interest-bearing account if those funds could produce net income. See APR 12.1(c)(3). In these circumstances, Brown and Hayes cannot plausibly claim that the IOLTA rules deprived them of value that they might have received absent those rules.Because they have suffered no "loss" from the supposed taking of their property, plaintiffs urge the Court toconsider that they may have lost some indirect benefit from "earnings credits" that Washington escrow companies had received in violation of governing regulations. WLF Br. at 31-32. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that parties to real estate transactions generally, though not Hayes or Brown'8 Brown or Hayes might argue that they differ from the non-IOLTA purchasers in that their "property" has been used to generate earnings without their consent. But this argument is specious, in that all of a bank's depositors give the bank the right to use their "property" solely in the bank's discretion, without their consent. Indeed, a bank would be free to direct a percentage of its non-IOLTA escrow deposits to the LFW to demonstrate its commitment to legal services for the indigent. The bank's capacity to make such a disposition without the depositor's consent emphasizes why it would be irrational to compensate participants in LPO-related transactions while leaving identically-situated purchasers in non-LPO transactions with nothing.33| edspecifically, may incur increased costs because (a) banks now must pay interest on escrowed funds in connection with transactions on which LPOs work; (b) some, but not all, banks may pass on some of the cost of the interest to escrow companies; and (c) some, but not all, escrow companies may pass that cost on to participants in real estate transactions. The doubly contingent nature of this supposed loss demonstrates that it cannot implicate a constitutionally protected property right and, indeed, plaintiffs appear to concede that they cannot claim a property interest in the earnings credits themselves. WLF Br. at 21, n. 5 (averring that plaintiffs "made no . . . assertion" of a property interest in the benefit created by earnings credits). Given that plaintiffs had no property right in the benefits associated with the credits, settled law makes clear that they also cannot claim a right to compensation because of the theoretical loss of those benefits.If plaintiffs, or any other party to an escrow, have lost the benefit of earnings - eredits, that loss does not result directly from the alleged taking. A loss wouldoccur only if a bank accepting IOLTA deposits decided to end a preexisting practice of offering earning credits; if the cessation of those credits materially affected an escrow company's finances; and if the escrow company decided to pass any resulting costs on to customers. Such an indirect or consequential damage34from an alleged taking is not compensable. Rather, when the government takesproperty,it must pay [the owner] for what is taken, not more; and [the owner] must stand whatever indirect or remote injuries are properly comprehended within the meaning of "consequential damage" as that conception has been defined in such cases. Even so, the consequences often are harsh. United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 382 (1945). The Court has thus denied compensation for the destruction of a business as "an unintended incident of the taking of land," Mitchell v. United States, 267 U.S. 341, 345 (1924), and it has denied compensation to a condemnee who was required to purchase a "replacement facility ... more costly than the condemned facility." United States v. Fifty Acres of Land, 469 U.S. 24, 34 (1984). See also United States v. Bodcaw Co., 440 U.S. 202, 203 (1979) (reaffirming that "indirect costs to the property owner caused by the taking of his land are generally not part of the just compensation to which he is constitutionally entitled"). So, too, even if Brown and Hayes had offered proof of an economic impact from the supposed loss of earnings credits, they would not be entitled to compensation for their loss. In short, because Brown's and Hayes' supposed property was valueless absent the government's alleged taking, no compensation is due. Further, even if35plaintiffs could show that they had suffered some indirect increased costs as a result of the IOLTA program, those costs are not of constitutional significance. Accordingly, even if the Court finds that Hayes and Brown can claim that the IOLTA interest was their "property," the state need not pay compensation.B. IOLTA Programs Do Not Violate the First Amendment Because They Neither Compel Any Speech Nor Express Any Message That Can Be Identified With Plaintiffs.The IOLTA program does not implicate, let alone violate, plaintiffs' freedom of speech. Plaintiffs attempt to shoehorn their displeasure with the funding of legal service programs into a theory that the state is compelling them to support speech with which they disagree. This argument seeks to extend the compelled-speech doctrine beyond all recognized bounds. First, plaintiffs identify no allegedly compelled expression to which they are opposed. Rather, their objection is to the fact of IOLTA funding itself, and that objection does notamount to a cognizable First Amendment complaint. Second, even if there is a "message" supported by IOLTA funding, the plaintiffs are in no way associated with it. Their complaint thus falls outside the compelled-speech doctrine and its well-established purpose of protecting individuals from involuntary identification with expression or causes not of their choosing.362>>1.The First Amendment Is Not Implicated Where, as Here, aParty Fails to Allege Any Compelled Message or Expres-sion, but Merely Objects to Compulsory Funding ofPrograms of Which They Disapprove.Plaintiffs assert, WLF Br. at 35 n.10, that they "are under no obligation toidentify the compelled speech to which they object or to explain the basis for theirobjections." Even if plaintiffs are correct that they need not state why they findsome allegedly compelled message objectionable, they cannot establish theircompelled-speech claim -- and this Court cannot begin to evaluate it -- unless theyidentify the existence of an expression or viewpoint they are being compelled toadopt. Plaintiffs' failure to do so is readily explainable: as the recorddemonstrates, they object not to. being compelled to support any particularideological message; rather, they object that "their" money is being used byIOLTA, and its recipient programs, at all. The testimony of plaintiffBrown isrepresentative. Asked whether he opposed any of the uses to which his money hadbeen put, Brown responded, "I think I probably would if I knew for sure what itwas being used for." Brown Dep. 40 (ER 183). See also Hayes Dep. 24 (ER 175)(testifying the objectionable "speech" is "whatever money that's gone into theIOLTA" and the "taking of his property"); Brown Decl. 7 4 (ER 61); Hayes Decl. J5 (ER 63) (both stating, "I object to anyone other than me taking the interest37earned on my funds."); WLF Br. at 23 (complaining plaintiffs are required to "provide financial support to private organizations they do not wish to support").Plaintiffs are entitled to object that "their" money is being used to support IOLTA grants, just as they can object as taxpayers to the use of general government funds to support other programs that benefit the poor. But "[t]he mere fact that objectors believe their money is not being well spent `does not mean [that] they have a First Amendment complaint.'" Glickman v. Wileman Bros. & Elliott Inc, US.___, 117 S. Ct. 2130, 2140 (1997), citing Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435, 456 (1984). In Glickman, fruit growers challenged Department of Agriculture regulations requiring them to contribute to a fund used to pay for generic advertising promoting their type of product. The growers claimed they objected to the content of some of the media advertising paid for with their money. Id. at 2137. Nevertheless, the Court held that where the primary complaint is how the money is spent, the First Amendment is not implicated. The Court found no constitutional violation because the growers were concerned over what they were being forced to pay, not what they were being forced to say. The same is true in this case: plaintiffs have pointed to no expression that can be attributed to them, much less any expression that conflicts with their."freedom of belief." Id.at 2139.38They complain only that they are being forced to contribute money to a program that they do not like. That is not compelled speech."Finally, IOLTA-funded organizations in fact are not_propagating a "message." It has never been established that providing legal services for the poor -- the primary purpose of the IOLTA program -- is an expressive activity. That being the case, plaintiffs have no First Amendment basis for complaint.2. Plaintiffs' First Amendment Rights Have Not Been Violated Because They Are Not Sufficiently Associated or Identified with the "Speech," if Any, Engaged in by IOLTA Programs.That this is not a compelled speech case is made plain by a brief review of the history and purpose of the compelled-speech doctrine. As first articulated in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 3 19 U.S. 624, 642 (1943), the doctrine recognizes that the First Amendment guarantees that "no official, high or? Plaintiffs ignore Glickman, relying on Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), for the proposition that the "First Amendment is implicated by any compelled contribution to a private organization," but may be justified only by a compelling state interest. WLF Br. at 36 n.11. This assertion is untenable after Glickman, where the growers made precisely the same argument. When the case was before this Court, a panel struck down the generic advertising assessments, finding the "First Amendment right of freedom of speech includes a right not to be compelled to render financial support for others' speech." Wileman Bros. & Elliott, Inc. v. Espy, 58 F.3d 1367, 1377 (9th Cir. 1995). The Supreme Court reversed, rejecting such an expansive reading of the compelled-speech doctrine. Neither Abood, nor any other compelled speech case, "announce[s] a broad First Amendment right not to be compelled to provide financial support for39petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by words or act their faith therein." Under the compelled-speech doctrine, the Supreme Court has struck down as unconstitutional compulsory flag salutes, id.; the mandatory display of a slogan offensive to one's religious beliefs, Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977); laws compelling a newspaper to publish editorials not of its choosing, Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974); laws preventing organizers of an expressive parade from excluding messages they disapproved of, Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group, 515 U.S. 557 (1995); and regulations forcing a utility to publish in its newsletter messages not of its choosing, Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n, 475 U.S. 1 (1986). At the heart of the compelled-speech doctrine is the notion that the First. Amendment protects against being forced "to associate with speech with which [a . party] may disagree." Id. at 15 (plurality opinion). Further, in all of these cases, the link between the state-mandated message and the party who did not wish to be associated with it was both public and visible.any organization that conducts expressive activities." Glickman, 117 S. Ct. at 2139."40VVBVUEe UEC OSIn contrast, the Supreme Court recently held that the compelled-speech doctrine does not apply where there is no discernable association between the plaintiffs and the allegedly coerced speech. Glickman, 117 S. Ct. 2130. In upholding mandatory participation in a generic advertising campaign for "California fruits" against individual growers' compelled speech claims, the Court pointedly observed that the assessment program at issuedoes not require [the growers] to repeat an objectionable message out of their own mouths, require them to use their own property to convey an antagonistic ideological message, force them to respond to a hostile message when they "would prefer to remain silent," or require them to be publicly identified or associated with another's message. Id. at 2139 (citations omitted). Further, the Court noted, the growers who contributed to the advertising program at issue "are not required themselves to speak," and the advertising about which they complained was "attributed not to them but to the California Tree Fruit Agreement or "California Summer Fruits.'"" Id. The same is true in this case. Nothing about the IOLTA programs requires plaintifftso state or respond to an objectionable message or publicly identifies them with the speech of another.. Organizations receiving funds do-not publicly41thank their "contributors" or engage in any expressive conduct in their name. The IOLTA program does nothing for plaintiffs or on their behalf as individuals.The plaintiffs argue that the IOLTA program nevertheless implicates the _ First Amendment protection against compelled support of organizations. Asjustification, they cite cases holding it unconstitutional to use compulsory union fees, bar association dues or student fees to support political or ideological causes unrelated to the central purpose of such collective organizations. WLF Br. at 3435, citing, inter alia, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209 (1977) (union dues), Keller v. State Bar, 496 U.S. 1 (1990) (bar fees). These cases are unavailing, for two reasons:First, plaintiffs cannot establish that they have actually made a contribution. No money that they possessed or in which they had any vested interest was provided to the IOLTA program."Second, these cases do not, as plaintiffs urge, indicate that "the First Amendment is implicated by any compelled contribution to a private?° Tt has never been held that IOLTA interest amounts to any kind of "contribution" on the order of the union or bar dues at issue in Abood and Keller, respectively. Unlike organizational dues, IOLTA interest does not deprive any individual of value to which they would otherwise be entitled; there is no payroll deduction or annual dunning, but merely a legal redirection of funds that never were available to buyers and sellers of property in the first instance.42organization." WLF Br. at 36n.11. To the contrary, it is constitutionally permissible to compel actual cash contributions to an organization with which one . disagrees. See Abood, 431 U.S. at 222 (compulsory union dues permissible even if individual objects to "unionism itself"). The plaintiff's interpretation of "compelled association" was considered and rejected by the Supreme Court last year: "Abood, and the cases that follow it, did not announce a broad First Amendment right not to be compelled to provide financial support for any organization that conducts expressive activities. Rather, Abood merely recognized a First Amendment interest in not being compelled to contribute to an organization whose expressive activities conflict with one's `freedom of belief.'"" Glickman, 1178. Ct. at 2139. Thus, even to implicate the First Amendment, "there must be a connection between dissenters and the organization so that the dissenters reasonably understand that they are supporting the message propagated by the recipient organizations." Washington Legal Foundation v. Massachusetts Bar Foundation, 993 F.2d 962 (1st Cir. 1993) (holding IOLTA program was not compelled speech). The requisite link between the plaintiffs and any objectionable message is absent here.In addition to lacking any "membership" link to IOLTA, the plaintiffs are not otherwise connected with any "message" that might be viewed as propagated43eee eB CCE CE ©by organizations receiving IOLTA funds. Even assuming arguendo that litigation can be protected speech, it is speech only on behalf of the litigants -- not of the IOLTA program, and certainly not of the plaintiffs or any other individual whose pooled funds contributed in generating funds for the IOLTA program."! The plaintiffs are not associated with any specific viewpoint. Because they lack any connection with the allegedly objectionable "speech," their First Amendment rights are not implicated.In sum, this is not a case in which the state has compelled citizens to say something they do not believe, to proclaim a message not of their choosing, or to associate in a constitutionally cognizable fashion with any expressive activity. Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims are supported by neither precedent nor the purposes of the compelled-speech doctrine, and should be rejected by this Court.2! For this reason, Lehnert-v. Ferris Faculty Association, 500 U.S. 507 (1991), relied on by plaintiffs, WLF Br. at 38, is readily distinguishable. There, members of a college faculty objected to certain litigation engaged in by their own union. Id, at 528. The case does not support the proposition that one's First Amendment rights can in any way be implicated by private litigation undertaken in someone else's name. Plaintiffs identify no IOLTA-funded lawsuit that purports to have been brought on their behalf and no litigation argument made for them against their will.Vv. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the ABA requests that this Court affirm thedecision below.RESPECTFULLYSUBMITTED this 11th day of September, 1998. AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION Amicus CuriaeBy--SH,--Philip S. Anderson 
I. THE IOLTA PROGRAM DOES NOT IMPOSE A COMPENSABLE BURDEN ON ANY PERSONThe Court of Appeals correctly held that there are two independent reasons why the Washington IOLTA program does not violate the Takings Clause: the IOLTA rules do not effect a taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and even if they did, no compensation would be due.8A. The IOLTA Program Does Not "Take" Any Property From Clients.The Court of Appeals correctly decided that the Washington IOLTA program does not "take" any property from clients. Thus, the ABA supports the arguments in Respondents' brief that regulatory rather than per se takings analysis applies here and that, under regulatory takings analysis, there is no taking. Because this brief focuses on the just compensation issue, however, its treatment of the takings issues will be confined to a few observations.First, money is categorically different from physical property because it is fungible and because payment of money to government is a widely shared burden. As this Court wrote in United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U.S. 52, 59-64 (1989), "It is artificial to view" withdrawals of money "as physical appropriations of property. Unlike real or personal property, money is fungible." 493 U.S. at 62 n.9. The Sperry Court therefore rejected the argument Petitioners advance here ­ that "physical appropriation" of money is a per se taking. Id. Indeed, the Court consistently has analyzed appropriations of money under the multi- factor test applicable to regulatory takings.8 See Eastern Enters. v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498, 523-24 (1998) (plurality opinion) (compulsory payment of health care benefits to retirees);9 Concrete Pipe & Prods. of Cal. v. Constr. Laborers Pension Trust for S. Cal., 508 U.S. 602, 643-44 (1993) (employer's8 In Sperry itself, as in other fees for services cases, the Court truncated the traditional regulatory analysis, recognizing that the concerns underlying the Takings Clause are not implicated by such fees. 493 U.S. at 60-62.9 The other five Justices in Eastern Enterprises concluded that takings analysis was entirely inapplicable to the monetary liability at issue there. See Eastern Enters., 542 U.S. at 540-41 (Kennedy, J., concurring); id. at 555 (Breyer, J., dissenting).9withdrawal liability to multiemployer pension plans); Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 606 (1987) (mandatory assignment of child support payments to the state); Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 475 U.S. 211, 224 (1986) (withdrawal liability to multiemployer pension plans); Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155 (1980) (interest earned on interpleader fund).10Second, treating every use of money as a per se taking cannot be squared with the regulatory takings case law generally. That case law recognizes that many property regulations diminish the monetary value of property, thereby effectively taking money out of the pockets of property10 Despite Petitioners' reliance on Webb's (cited in Pet. Br. at 30 & 33 n.12), the Court in that case explicitly discussed two of the three variables traditionally applied in regulatory taking analysis. The Court first considered whether the government had interfered with the claimants' investment-backed expectations, holding that they had "more than a unilateral expectation" with respect to the interest generated by the interpleader fund. 449 U.S. at 161. The Court skipped discussion of the second factor, severity of the economic impact, as no analysis of the economic harm imposed was needed because it was undisputed that the fund had generated net interest allocable to each claimant. Id. at 162. The Court then considered the third factor, the nature of the government interest, and found that the government had not asserted any regulatory interest whatsoever. Therefore, it concluded, the measure was little more than a forced contribution to general revenues rather than a measure to "adjust[] the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good." Id. at 163 (quoting Penn Central v. City of New York , 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978)). In reaching this conclusion, the Court reserved the possibility that it might uphold a statute that allowed a county to retain interest earned "where the interest would be the only return to the county for the services it renders," id. at 165, thus leaving no doubt that a regulatory takings analysis (rather than a per se approach) applied.10owners, or actually require owners to spend money to comply with the regulations. See, e.g., Penn Central v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 124-27 (1978). But despite their monetary impacts, such regulations are not considered per se takings.Third, treating every demand for money as a per se taking cannot be squared with the principle that taxes are virtually always permissible under the Fifth Amendment. This principle applies not just to federal taxes, where Congress' power to tax is established by the Constitution, Brushaber v. Union Pac. R. Co., 240 U.S. 1, 24-25 (1916), but also to state and local taxes, where the Constitution contains no similar grant of authority. See, e.g., City of Pittsburgh v. Alco Parking Corp., 417 U.S. 369 at 375-76 (1974). Even if the IOLTA rule does not assess a tax, as Petitioners argue, Pet. Br. at 27, the fact that taxes do not constitute takings undercuts the logic of Petitioners' argument that all appropriations of property, including appropriatio ns of money, are necessarily per se takings. Cf. Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124 (contrasting "physical invasions" of property with programs "adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life" and indicating that taxes fall in the latter category).1111 Petitioner urges that taxes are somehow different because they are of legislative origin, while state judiciaries have promulgated most (but not all) IOLTA programs. Pet. Br. at 27 & n.9. But takings analysis does not generally depend on whether the legislature is the source of the alleged taking. And passage by a legislature does not guarantee that taxes will fall on a broader group of citizens than other appropriations. See, e.g., Alco Parking Corp., 417 U.S. 369 (tax on parking lot owners). Moreover, even if the label "tax" has some talismanic significance, the limited differences between taxes and other appropriations of money could not justify treating taxes as exempt from takings analysis but other monetary appropriations as takings per se. Instead, as this Court11Here, the Washington IOLTA program imposes less of a burden than most taxes or regulations, and is as broadly targeted as many. The State simply has regulated the use of certain funds, requiring that they be deposited in IOLTA accounts instead of noninterest bearing accounts. It then uses the resulting interest, which has no economic value to the owners, to fund a concededly laudable social goal. The absence of any tangible ­ or even material ­ burden on any person provides an ample "rational justification" for this approach to funding IOLTA programs. Pet. Br. at 19.B. Even Assuming the IOLTA Program "Takes" Some Property Right From Clients, No Compensation Is Due Because That Property Has No Economic Value.This Court has recently reaffirmed that a state's mere taking of "property" does not necessarily violate the Takings Clause. "[O]nly takings without `just compensation' infringe [the Fifth] Amendment." Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725, 734 (1997). In Phillips v. Washington Legal Found., 524 U.S. 156 (1998), this Court recognized that IOLTA accounts might present a situation in which no compensation would be due even if a taking occurred. See id. at 172. The record here makes clear that is the case, for despite Petitioners' repeated references to the "burden" that IOLTA imposes on them, the simple truth is that they have not suffered any loss ­ economic or otherwise ­ that is compensable under this Court's takings jurisprudence. Thus, no constitutional violation has occurred.has held, monetary appropriations must be subject to regulatory takings analysis.121. Petitioners Are Not Entitled to Compensation Unless They Have Suffered an Economic Loss.At its core, the requirement of just compensation assures that a property owner will be indemnified for the economic value of any property interest taken by the government. Tha t value is generally determined with reference to the "market value" of the property. See, e.g., Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1, 6 (1949). In assessing market value, courts look not to the value attributed to the property as a result of an owner's "unique need for property or idiosyncratic attachment to it." Id. at 5. Rather, the compensation required under the Fifth Amendment embraces "only that value which is capable of transfer from owner to owner and thus of exchange for some equivalent. Its measure is the amount of that equivalent." Id.It is equally well settled that compensation under the Fifth Amendment is calculated exclusively from the property owner's point of view and excludes any special value that the government may have for the land or that it may add to the land by virtue of using its condemnation power. When there is a difference between the private property owner's "loss" and the government's gain, "[i]t is the owner's loss, not the taker's gain, which is the measure of the value of the property taken." First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 319 (1987); see also Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 5. If the taking itself generates value, therefore, that value is not properly considered in arriving at just compensation. See United States v. Twin City Power Co., 350 U.S. 222, 228 (1956) (excluding special value to condemnor in assessing compensation); United States ex rel. Tenn. Valley Auth. v. Powelson, 319 U.S. 266, 276 (1943). As Justice Holmes wrote for the Court in New York v. Sage, 239 U.S. 57, 61 (1915), a city cannot be "made to pay for any part [of value] it has added to the land by thus13uniting it with other lots, if that union would not have been practicable or have been attempted except by intervention of eminent domain."Under these principles, it is plain that just compensation for a taking is zero when the market value of the taken property is zero. When the transaction costs attendant to the individual owner exercising control over or making use of the property would exceed the economic benefits of doing so, the owner is not entitled to any compensation if the property is taken. The Court made this point in United States v. Virginia Elec. & Power Co. ("VEPCO"), 365 U.S. 624 (1961), where it considered how to value a taken "flowage easement," which had given a private power company the right to flood riparian lands for hydropower. The Court observed that if market forces "such as difficulty of assemblage of all necessary lands" made "it certain that the flowage easements would never be exercised by the . . . Power Company or its assigns," then "nothing" would be payable to the owner of the easements ­ even though the government would realize value by destroying the property right to build a reservoir. Id. at 634 (quoting Augusta Power Co. v. United States, 278 F.2d 1 (5th Cir. 1960)) (ellipses in original). Likewise, in Powelson, this Court denied any compensation to a landowner for the claimed "water power value" deriving from the possibility of constructing a hydroelectric dam on the owner's land because it would not have been "profitable" to construct and operate such a dam. 319 U.S. at 274.This Court reached a similar conclusion in Marion & Rye Valley Ry. Co. v. United States, 270 U.S. 280 (1926), which involved an award for the seizure of a railroad during World War I. Although the Court assumed the railroad had been taken, it nonetheless denied the owner any compensation, reasoning that "[n]othing was recoverable as just compensation, because nothing of value was taken from14the company; and it was not subjected by the Government to pecuniary loss." Id. at 281; see also Alamo Land & Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 424 U.S. 295, 304 (1976) ("A number of factors, of course, could operate to eliminate the existence of compensable value in the leasehold interest."); Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 241-42, 257-58 (1897). Other courts also have found that governments owe zero compensation even for per se takings when those takings impose no net financial loss on the private owners.12Petitioners are therefore plainly incorrect that every taking "violate[s]" the Takings Clause and must result in a remedy. Pet. Br. at 17. A taking requires only just compensation, nothing more. And where there is no economic value lost, just compensation is zero.2. Petitioners Have Not Suffered an Economic Loss.The Washington IOLTA program does not result in any economic loss. While this Court held in Phillips that the interest earned by Petitioners' funds is their private property, 524 U.S. at 172, the Court also recognized that "[t]he Federal Government, through the structuring of its banking and taxation regulations, imposes costs on" the interest "if private citizens attempt to exercise control over it." Id. at 171. For funds placed in IOLTA accounts, these transaction costs along with other transaction costs, by definition, exceed the12 See Unisys Finance Corp. v. Resolution Trust Corp., 979 F.2d 609, 612 (7th Cir. 1992) (Posner, J.); California v. United States, 169 F.2d 914 (9th Cir. 1948); Fulmer v. Nebraska Dep't of Roads, 134 N.W.2d 798, 800 (Neb. 1965). Denial of compensation is common where the federal government takes roads from states because the taking frequently imposes no financial burden on the states. See, e.g., California v. United States, 395 F.2d 261, 264-65 & n.8 (9th Cir. 1968) (collecting cases).15economic value of their property (i.e., the gross interest) itself. In other words, regardless of Washington State's treatment of interest earned on IOLTA accounts, Petitioners could not have obtained those earnings themselves. Thus, the value of the interest to Petitioners is absolutely zero.That the State has the ability to benefit from the interest earned on Petitioners' principal when deposited in an IOLTA account and combined with other similar interest earnings does not change the fact that clients cannot realize economic value from their funds on deposit. As in Sage, this means only that there is a divergence here between Petitioners' "loss" and the government's gain. But it is Petitioners' loss alone that matters, for the just compensation requirement demands only that the owner of taken property be put "in as good a position pecuniarily as if his property had not been taken." United States v. 564.54 Acres of Land, 441 U.S. 506, 510 (1979) (quoting Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246, 255 (1934)); accord Marion & Rye Valley, 270 U.S. at 281 (test is whether the owner was "subjected by the Government to pecuniary loss"). Petitioners' suggestion that just compensation is equal to the value of the interest to the State, Pet. Br. at 17, 33, ignores this firmly established principle.Because clients suffer no direct financial "loss" from the supposed taking of their interest earnings, Petitioners suggest they may have lost some indirect benefit from "earnings credits" that some Washington escrow companies received prior to IOLTA's implementation. See Pet. Br. at 36 n. 14. Even assuming Petitioners had lost the benefit of earnings credits, which Petitioners have not shown, and that such credits could be characterized as Petitioners' "property" (a proposition that goes far beyond the holding and rationale of Phillips), that loss would be related only indirectly to the alleged taking. The Takings Clause does not require states to compensate property owners for such indirect losses. Parties16to escrows would be worse off financially by reason of an IOLTA rule only if: (i) a bank accepting IOLTA deposits has decided to end a preexisting practice of offering earning credits; (ii) the cessation of those credits materially affects an escrow company's finances; and (iii) the escrow company decides to pass any resulting costs on to customers. That effect is too indirect and contingent to merit compensation under the Fifth Amendment. When the government takes propertyit must pay [the owner] for what is taken, not more; and [the owner] must stand whatever indirect or remote injuries are properly comprehended within the meaning of "consequential damage" as that conception has been defined in such cases. Even so, the consequences often are harsh.United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 382 (1945). This Court thus has denied compensation for the destruction of a business as "an unintended incident of the taking of land," Mitchell v. United States, 267 U.S. 341, 345 (1924), and it has denied compensation to a condemnee who was required to purchase a "replacement facility . . . more costly than the condemned facility." United States v. Fifty Acres of Land, 469 U.S. 24, 34 (1984); see also United States v. Bodcaw Co., 440 U.S. 202, 203 (1979) (per curiam) (reaffirming that "indirect costs to the property owner caused by the taking of his land are generally not part of the just compensation to which he is constitutionally entitled"). So, too, even if Petitioners had shown an economic impact from the supposed loss of earnings credits, they would not be entitled to compensation under the Fifth Amendment for their loss.173. The Interaction of Background Laws With IOLTA Does Not Alter the Economic Analysis.Petitioners attempt to resurrect their claim by contending that Respondents' argument rests on the proposition that the government is seizing only what it has created. Pet. Br. at 32. But that is not Respondents' claim at all. Rather, Respondents argue (and the court below agreed) that the economic value of the interest to Petitioners is zero. And it does not matter that this is so in part because "[t]he Federal Government . . . imposes costs" on Petitioners' interest earnings if they attempt to extract them from their bank. 524 U.S. at 171. To begin with, the costs associated with the federal government's requirement of completing a 1099 income tax form and sending it out is only one reason that Petitioners' funds cannot generate net interest. Bank fees, accounting costs and other nongovernmental administrative expenses also make it infeasible to earn net interest on small or short duration deposits. See generally Amicus Brief of National Association of IOLTA Programs in Support of Respondents (describing expenses attendant to trust account administration).In any event, the mere fact that Washington's IOLTA program operates within the framework of federal banking and taxation laws in no way obligates Washington State to compensate Petitioners for their inability to gain any economic benefit from their property under federal law. The State is a "separate sovereign" from the federal government. The State's actions, therefore, cannot be combined with federal action to create a constitutional violation. Cf. Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 88-89 (1985) (state and federal action cannot be combined to violate Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause). Any assertions that Petitioners might have received interest payments under some nonexistent but hypothesized future banking system are18simply irrelevant under this Court's rule that such speculative losses are noncompensable. See Powelson, 319 U.S. at 27476, 285 (disallowing valuation based upon hypothetical use of property where possibility of use was remote and speculative); McGovern v. City of New York, 229 U.S. 363, 372 (1912) (same).Most fundamentally, this Court's takings jurisprudence does not allow Petitioners to value their property as if it existed in a vacuum free of all legal obligations. Petitioners pretend they can value the interest in IOLTA accounts as if that interest ­ unlike all other interest in bank accounts ­ could be reaped without tax reporting, transaction costs or other costs associated with banking regulations. Pet Br. at 17, 32-34 & n.13. But Petitioners cannot rest their case on a hypothetical world in which their principal could be placed in bank accounts free from the general rules and regulations governing our economy. Instead, the Court's basic rule that one must assess the value of private property according to its "market value," Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 6, means that valid, preexisting governmental regulations must figure into the amount of just compensation due. See 26 Am. Jur. 2d Eminent Domain § 319 & nn.36-39 (2002) (citing numerous cases for proposition that "existing zoning classifications and restrictions should be taken into consideration, since the availability or nonavailability of such land for particular uses affects its market value"). This is why this Court denied compensation in United States v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R.R., 312 U.S. 592 (1941), for destruction of property along a navigable stream. Because the common law had long given the federal government the right to flood such land to improve navigation, the government's common law right had destroyed the land's market value before it was ever condemned.19By the same token, if the State took a parcel of real property that had long been subject to certain federal land use regulations, the owner would be entitled only to the amount for which he could have sold that land to another private party with those federal regulations in place. See Kirby Forest Indus. v. United States, 467 U.S. 1, 10 (1984) (just compensation is measured by "what a willing buyer would pay in cash to a willing seller at the time of the taking") (quoting 564.54 Acres, 441 U.S. at 511); United States v. Commodities Trading Corp., 339 U.S. 121, 124 (1950) (measuring market value of taken property in light of governmental price ceiling in place at time of seizure, even though property would have been worth more absent that ceiling); United States v. 174.12 Acres of Land, 671 F.2d 313, 314-16 & n.3 (9th Cir. 1982) (land must be valued in light of environmental laws that limit development).13 To calculate the value of the owner's land unmoored from such background legal obligations would lead to the impermissible result that property would be worth more when condemned than when the owner still has possession of it.This is not to say, of course, that the government may enact regulations imposing prohibitive transaction costs on the use of property and then later take the property without affording the owner any compensation. Property owners may challenge such regulations themselves under the Takings Clause, and courts will invalidate them if they impose a substantial economic impact without sufficient governmental justification. See, e.g., Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124. In addition, if governmental regulations unfairly impose transaction costs on some entities but not others, the13 This Court in Powelson recognized that even land use regulations that are not yet in place may affect the measure of just compensation if they would be "an appropriate exercise of police power" and are likely enough to be enacted to "affect[] present values." 319 U.S. at 284.20disfavored class may invoke equal protection principles in opposition to the regulations. But here, Petitioners do not contest the validity of the federal government's banking or taxation regulations, and Respondents have no control over those regulations. That being the case, the Court must assess the value of Petitioners' interest against the backdrop of the federal government's exercise of its traditional regulatory powers.4. Any Abstract Right to Control or Exclude Others From Obtaining the Interest in Funds Placed in IOLTA Accounts Lacks Compensable Value.Unable to point to any financial loss inflicted by IOLTA, Petitioners insist that IOLTA imposes nonpecuniary losses on clients. They assert that they have lost important ­ even if "not easily quantif[iable]" ­ rights to control their property and to exclude others from it. See Pet. Br. at 37, 35. Although this Court noted in Phillips that these intangible rights are "valuable rights that inhere in the property," 524 U.S. at 170, the Court acknowledged that "the interest income at issue here may have no economically realizable value to its owner," id., and did not discuss whether the Fifth Amendment requires compensation for loss of the intangible rights to control and exclude. A review of this Court's takings jurisprudence shows that a loss of these rights is not compensable and reveals that, even if it generally were, Petitioners surrendered those rights independent of any State action under the IOLTA program.21a. The rights to control and exclude others from property generally lack any compensable economic value.The loss of the right to exercise dominion over one's money is not a compensable loss under the Fifth Amendment. It bears repeating that the constitutional mandate of just compensation requires a monetary payment sufficient to compensate only for the owner's financial loss. An owner is to be put "in as good a position pecuniarily as if his property had not been taken." 564.54 Acres of Land, 441 U.S. at 510 (emphasis added) (quoting Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246, 255 (1934)); see also United States v. Reynolds, 397 U.S. 14, 16 (1970) ("`[J]ust compensation' means the full monetary equivalent of the property taken.") (emphasis added). No decision from this Court has ever awarded monetary compensation for the loss of a purely noneconomic right.This prerequisite of a pecuniary loss forecloses Petitioners' loss-of-dominion claim. This Court repeatedly has held that although the rights to retain possession of one's property and to exclude others from it are important sticks in the bundle of property rights, neither has any automatic economic value. In Commodities Trading Corp., for example, the owner argued that it should be compensated for the fact that the government's seizure of its property deprived it of its "`right to hold' [its property] until [it] wanted to sell." 339 U.S. at 125-26. This Court, however, refused to award compensation for this "retention value" on the ground that it was too speculative and would lead to "haphazard" calculations untethered to any market value. Id. at 126-28. In Pruneyard Shopping Ctr. v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980), this Court held that a state's literal taking of the right to exclude individuals from a private shopping mall was not compensable because that right was not "essential to the use22or economic value of their property." Id. at 84. Finally, the owner's flowage easement discussed in VEPCO undoubtedly included the right to exercise some dominion and control over the riparian lands, but the Court made clear that the loss of this right was not compensable if the easement itself lacked any positive economic value. See 365 U.S. at 634. There is no reason to break new ground here.At the very most, Petitioners, by virtue of the IOLTA rule, have lost their right "to let their principal lie fallow," that is, "the right to place the principal in a noninterestbearing checking account" and thus ensure that it earns nothing. Washington Legal Found., 271 F.3d at 863. But that right has no market value. See Washington Legal Found. v. Texas Equal Access to Justice Found., 293 F.3d 242, 248, 254-55 (5th Cir. 2002) (Wiener, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Even in Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982), in which the state physically appropriated a landlord's property and, by doing so, confiscated "the landlord's interest in . . . insisting that some negligible unoccupied space remain unoccupied," this Court declined to hold that any compensation necessarily was due for the loss. Id. at 437 n.15, 441 (internal quotation omitted). That compensation issue turned on whether loss of the right to exclude diminished the worth of the property compared with identical property with the cable lines installed. See id. Here, loss of the right to let interest lie fallow does not change its market value, as that value was zero to begin with. 14 Put another14 As we have shown above, this Court has repeatedly held that just compensation is zero when no economic value is lost even when real property is taken, and many lower courts have followed this principle. At least one lower court has suggested, however, that a plaintiff may recover nominal damages when it proves the State has taken economically valueless real property rights from it. See St. Genevieve Gas Co. v. TVA, 747 F.2d 1411, 1414 (11th Cir.23way, the market would not place positive economic value on the right to prevent others from accessing interest that the owner could not himself access.Indeed, ordering monetary compensation solely for Petitioners' alleged loss of the right to let interest earnings lie fallow would contravene the fundamental rule that just compensation is calculated with reference only to objective losses of property value and would open the floodgates to takings claims based on purely abstract losses. Due to "the need for a clear, easily administrable rule governing the measure of `just compensation,'" Kirby Forest, 467 U.S. at 10 n.15, this Court consistently has emphasized that "just compensation must be measured by an objective standard that disregards subjective values which are only of significance to an individual owner." Fifty Acres of Land, 469 U.S. at 35; accord Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 5. Even assuming Petitioners have a special, subjective value for keeping the State from creating and using the otherwise inaccessible interest from their escrowed funds, that value is not subject to objective quantification and, hence, is not compensable.Nothing in the Just Compensation Clause's insistence on objective measurements, of course, undermines the concept that "property is more than economic value." Phillips, 524 U.S. at 170. On the contrary, this Court's decisions acknowledge that subjective, individualized factors often cause individuals to value their property more highly than its objective worth. See, e.g., Kirby Forest, 467 U.S. at1984). Even if this decision is correct, it is distinguishable. The loss of dominion and control over a unique and tangible object, such as real property, is different from a loss of control over something fungible, such as money. See Unisys Finance Corp., 979 F.2d at 612 (loss of worthless security interest does not entitle owner to any compensation).2410 n.15. Yet these cases simultaneously hold that such considerations ­ important as they are ­ are too imprecise to warrant remuneration for their loss:The value of property springs from subjective needs and attitudes; its value to the owner may therefore differ widely from its value to the taker. Most things, however, have a general demand which gives them a value transferable from one owner to another. As opposed to such personal and variant standards as value to the particular owner whose property has been taken, this transferable value has an external validity which makes it a fair measure of public obligation to compensate the loss incurred by an owner as a result of the taking of his property for public use.Kimball Laundry, 338 U.S. at 5 (emphasis added). Thus, while there is no doubt that positive economic value is not essential to property ownership, or even to a person's valuing their property highly, positive economic value is the sine qua non of entitlement to compensation under the Fifth Amendment.Petitioners' analogy to a letter or family heirloom does not change this fact. Pet. Br. at 37. While government would be precluded altogether from taking a letter or family heirloom if doing so served no "public purpose," as the Takings Clause requires, or its action was so arbitrary as to violate the Due Process Clause, a government taking that survived such scrutiny would be subject to the same method of valuation as is used in every other case. Indeed, Petitioners do not even suggest an alternative method of valuation. Nor do they explain why noneconomic value should be considered in valuing a letter or heirloom when it is routinely excluded in valuing an individual's home or land25for just compensation purposes. Simply put, the mere loss of dominion over property with no pecuniary value is not compensable.b. Petitioners surrendered their rights to control and exclude others from their interest earnings independent of any State action under the IOLTA program.Finally, even if the right to exercise dominion over property were itself compensable under some circumstances, it would not matter here, for Petitioners would not have been able to invoke that right even in the absence of IOLTA. Petitioners voluntarily placed their funds into escrow, knowing they would be deposited in banks. In the absence of IOLTA, the funds would have been deposited in noninterest bearing accounts because they were too small to earn net interest.15 The depository banks therefore would have had the right to pool Petitioners' funds with the funds of other depositors, invest those funds, and dispose of the resulting earnings as the banks saw fit. The banks even could have donated a portion of their profits from investing Petitioners' principal to the Legal Foundation of Washington ­ without asking Petitioners for permission. Thus, irrespective of the IOLTA program, Petitioners gave up their right to dominion15 When Petitioners argue that certain individuals have been "singled out" to bear the burden of the IOLTA program, Pet. Br. at 16, 22-23, they are referring to the fact that, under program rules, client funds may be deposited in IOLTA accounts only if they cannot generate net interest for the clients themselves. In other words, the clients who are "singled out" are those for whom IOLTA programs will have no adverse economic impact and impose no burden at all. The ethical responsibilities of lawyers to their clients require this limitation, which is one of the virtues of IOLTA programs.26or control over the profit that might accrue on deposits too small to return net interest to them.Moreover, even if clients generally could prevent a private nonprofit organization from obtaining the interest on their principal, individuals have no such "`right to hold' [their property] as against a Government taking." Commodities Trading Corp., 339 U.S. at 126. And once the State takes funds, it may use them for any legitimate public purpose it chooses. As Justice Kennedy recently explained for a unanimous Court:It is inevitable that government will adopt and pursue programs and policies within its constitutional powers but which nevertheless are contrary to the profound beliefs and sincere convictions of some of its citizens. The government, as a general rule, may support valid programs and policies by taxes or other extractions binding on protesting parties.Board of Regents of the Univ. of Wisconsin Sys. v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 229 (2000). If Petitioners believe otherwise, they may pursue their First Amendment claim. But the Fifth Amendment exists only to ensure compensation for objective losses, not to protect against any symbolic harm from allegedly compelled association.In the end, it must be remembered that "[t]he constitutional requirement of just compensation derives as much content from the basic equitable principles of fairness as its does from technical concepts of property law." United States v. Fuller, 409 U.S. 488, 490 (1973) (citation omitted). As the Court observed in another takings case, "there wo uld be no justice in paying for a loss suffered by no one in fact." United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., 229 U.S. 53, 76 (1913). That is the case here.27II. NO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS AVAILABLE HERE BECAUSE THE STATE HAS NOT DENIED ANYONE JUST COMPENSATIONPetitioners' inability to establish any compensable loss is fatal to their request for an injunction against Washington's IOLTA program. Any discussion of remedies under the Takings Clause must begin with the fundamental principle that the Constitution permits the government to take private property for public use so long as it pays just compensation. "As its language indicates, and as the Court has frequently noted, [the Fifth Amendment] does not prohibit the taking of private property, but instead places a condition on the exercise of that power." First English, 482 U.S. at 314. Consequently, "no constitutional violation occurs until just compensation has been denied." Williamson County Reg'l Planning Com. v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 194 n.13 (1985). Because Washington owed no just compensation here, no constitutional violation has occurred. As Judge Wiener explained in his Fifth Circuit dissent:[t]he very fact of their inability to prove compensatory monetary loss should end the case, not trigger a search for alternative equitable remedies. The absence of value means, quite straightforwardly, that the appropriation of the plaintiffs' property in this case is not proscribed by the Fifth Amendment.Washington Legal Found., 293 F.3d at 254 (Wiener, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Thus, the fact that Petitioners' property had no value means that Petitioners are not entitled to any form of relief, injunctive or otherwise.Moreover, even if this Court were to conclude that Petitioners' property had been taken and that just28compensation was not zero, Petitioners would not be entitled to an injunction. Rather, they would have to seek compensation. As a general rule, injunctive relief is not available "when a suit for compensation can be brought against the sovereign subsequent to the taking." Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1016 (1984).16 Such is the case here. This Court's decision in First English leaves no doubt that, so long as a state waives its sovereign immunity, as Washington has done, the Fifth Amendment itself directly affords the ability to bring a suit in federal court for the Takings Clause's textually dictated remedy ­ compensation. 482 U.S. at 315-17.17There is only one potential exception to this rule, but it offers no help to Petitioners. In a case involving a federal (not state) taking, a plurality of this Court has stated that when "every dollar" taken by the government would be refunded in a suit for just compensation, making it "utterly pointless" for the government to take the money, the presumption is that a Tucker Act remedy is unavailable and that an injunction is therefore the proper remedy. Eastern Enters. v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498, 521 (1998) (plurality opinion)16 Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and dissenting in part, did not question the relevant portion of the Court's analysis. Id. at 1021. Every Justice participating in the case agreed that injunctive relief was impermissible.17 Petitioners claim that a federal remedy is inadequate as it leaves states "free to continue practices found to violate the Takings Clause simply because they are willing to pay damages." Pet Br. at 47. But the Takings Clause simply is not "violated" so long as just compensation is available. Moreover, if this Court were to conclude that the IOLTA program constituted a taking and nonzero compensation was owed, a remedy would be available in the Washington courts. If such a remedy was unavailable previously, it was because the Washington Supreme Court Justices believed no compensation was owed.29(internal quotation omitted). But this is not the position in which Petitioners find themselves. Even if this Court were to agree with Petitioners that they are entitled to some compensation, there is no plausible argument that Petitioners' loss could be measured by the exact amount of interest gained by the IOLTA program. 18 Thus, it would not be "utterly pointless" for the state government to take the interest and require Petitioners to seek compensation, for the government would gain more than it paid in compensation ­ as it has the right to do.But the greater obstacle to Petitioners' claim is that no compensation is owed, so no injunction can issue. Petitioners object that every taking must have a remedy and thus an injunction must be available where compensation is not warranted. That would lead to the absurd result that individuals may block takings of economically valueless property but may not prevent takings of extremely valuable property. An individual could stop the government from using interest in an IOLTA account but could not stop the government from taking his home. An individual could stop the government from taking an heirloom worth nothing but could not stop the government from taking an heirloom worth $1 or $1 million, and which had great sentimental value. Such a perverse rule is not the law.18 Indeed, even the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit recognized that Petitioners' loss could not be measured simply by the amount of interest gained by the IOLTA program. See 271 F.3d at 881-82. Those judges suggested, as do Petitioners in certain places, that compensation could be calculated according to lost "earnings credits" and/or the right to exclude others from their property. But neither these items nor nominal damages would be equivalent financially to the amount of Petitioners' interest earnings.30Petitioners' discussion of remedies, in sum, seeks legal relief in a situation in which there is no constitutional violation. But just as there can be no right without a remedy, see, e.g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 162-63 (1803), there can be no remedy without a right.CONCLUSIONFor these reasons, the ABA respectfully requests that the Court affirm the decision below.Respectfully submitted.Alfred P.

I. Allowing Bankruptcy Courts, With Litigant Consent, To Hear, Determine, And Enter Final Orders And Judgments In Non-Core and Stern Claims Does Not Violate Article III Of The Constitution.In Executive Benefits Ins. Agency v. Arkison, 134 S. Ct. 2165 (2014), this Court reserved the second question on which certiorari has now been granted, stating, "[T]his case does not require us to address whether Article III permits a bankruptcy court, with the consent of the parties, to enter final judgment on a Stern claim." 134 S. Ct. at 2170, n.4. The ABA respectfully asserts that allowing the bankruptcy courts to finally adjudicate a non-core claim or a Stern claim ­ "a claim designated for final adjudication in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter,7but prohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional matter," id. at 2170, where the parties have consented to final adjudication by the bankruptcy court, does not violate Article III. Rather, it is consistent with this Court's precedents and discussion in Executive Benefits of the historical roots of consent in bankruptcy proceedings.In Executive Benefits, the Court began with an overview of modern bankruptcy legislation, and stated that prior to 1978, federal district courts could refer matters within the traditional "summary jurisdiction" of the bankruptcy courts to specialized bankruptcy referees. However, proceedings to augment the bankruptcy estate "implicated the district court's plenary jurisdiction and were not referred to the bankruptcy courts absent both parties' consent." 134 S. Ct. at 2170, citing MacDonald v. Plymouth County Trust Co., 286 U.S. 263 (1932), and Ralph Brubaker, A "Summary" Statutory and Constitutional Theory of Bankruptcy Judges' Core Jurisdiction After Stern v. Marshall, 86 Am. Bankr. L.J. 121, 128 (2012) (hereinafter, "Summary Statutory and Constitutional Theory").In fact, referral by an Article III court to a non-Article III referee for final determination, upon consent of the litigants was a practice "well known at common law." Ralph Brubaker, The Constitutionality of Litigant Consent to Non-Article III Bankruptcy Adjudications, 32 Bankr. L. Letter No. 12, 1, 7 (Dec. 2012) (hereinafter "Constitutionality of Litigant8Consent"), quoting Heckers v. Fowler, 2 Wall 123, 131 (1864). As Professor Brubaker stated,During the early years of the Republic, federal courts, with the consent of the litigants, regularly referred adjudication of entire disputes to non-Article III referees, masters, or arbitrators, for entry of final judgment in accordance with the referee's report. The Supreme Court, in reviewing challenges to such judgments, implicitly approved those nonArticle III adjudications, consulting prior practices of English courts and the contemporaneous practice in the state courts.Id. at 7. And determinations were "not subject to be set aside and disregarded at the mere discretion of the court" when parties consented to reference of a case to a master or other officer, and the reference was entered as a rule of the court. Id. at 7, quoting Kimberly v. Arms, 129 U.S. 512, 524 (1889).As Professor Brubaker opined, the Court approved such non-Article III adjudication with litigant consent without any express congressional authorization as "an inherent feature of Article III courts' judicial powers," and "was equally approving of the practice when Congress expressly authorized federal courts' use of non-Article III referees in the Bankruptcy Act of 1898." Id. at 8. Indeed, "the Supreme Court has treated that 1898 Act jurisprudence as Article III precedent and thus has essentially constitutionalized the jurisdictional powers (and limits thereon) of 1898 Act bankruptcy referees." Id.9The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 authorized bankruptcy referees to hear and decide summary matters incident to the administration of the bankrupt's estate and to adjudicate creditors' claims against the estate, but did not authorize those referees to hear and decide plenary suits to recover money for the estate. See A "Summary" Statutory and Constitutional Theory, 86 Am. Bankr. L.J. at 128-29. However, in MacDonald, a 1932 case decided under the 1898 Act (and cited by the Executive Benefits Court, 134 S. Ct. at 2170), the Court held that litigants could waive the right to have a plenary suit heard by an Article III court. MacDonald, 286 U.S. at 268. In Cline v. Kaplan, 323 U.S. 97, 99 (1944), also decided under the 1898 Act, the Court held that "[c]onsent to proceed summarily may be formally expressed" or "may be waived by failure to make timely objection."In 1978, Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Reform Act ("1978 Act") and, as the Executive Benefits Court explained, created the bankruptcy courts of today, eliminating the historical distinction between "summary" and "plenary" jurisdiction, and instead, vesting bankruptcy judges "with all of the `powers of a court of equity, law, and admiralty,' with only a few limited exceptions." 134 S. Ct. at 2171, quoting Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 55 (1982) (plurality opinion).In Northern Pipeline, the Court held that the 1978 Act's assignment to a bankruptcy judge, for entry of a final order, of a state-law contract claim against a creditor that would not necessarily be resolved in the10equitable claims allowance process violated Article III. However, both the concurring and dissenting opinions emphasized that the defendant Marathon had not consented to having an Article I court decide the debtor's breach of contract action against it. Id. at 89-90, 92. See also, Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 849 (1986) ("Indeed, the relevance of concepts of waiver to Article III challenges is demonstrated by our decision in Northern Pipeline, in which the absence of consent to an initial adjudication before a non-Article III tribunal was relied on as a significant factor in determining that Article III forbade such adjudication.") (citing cases, including Heckers v. Fowler, 2 Wall 123 (1864), and Kimberly v. Arms, 129 U.S. 512 (1889)).Further, in Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., 473 U.S. 568, 584 (1985), the Court described Northern Pipeline as "establish[ing] only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review." (emphasis added).In response to Northern Pipeline, Congress enacted the 1984 Act, which "largely restored the bifurcated jurisdictional scheme that existed prior to the 1978 Act," by dividing all matters that may be referred to the bankruptcy court into "core" and11"non-core" proceedings. Executive Benefits, 134 S. Ct. at 2171-72.8Consent, however, remained in the 1984 Act. As stated by the Executive Benefits Court, "There is one statutory exception to the rule [for non-core proceedings]: If all parties `consent,' the statute permits the bankruptcy judge `to hear and determine and to enter appropriate orders and judgments' as if the proceeding were core." Id. at 2172 (quoting § 157(c)(2)).In Stern v. Marshall, 131 S. Ct. 2594 (2011), this Court did not change this constitutional analysis. As explained in Executive Benefits, 134 S. Ct. at 2172, the Stern Court agreed with the respondent that, without8 "Core" proceedings, as described by the Executive Benefits Court, id. at 2171, include those "proceedings to determine, avoid, or recover fraudulent conveyances," § 157(b)(2)(H), for which the bankruptcy courts are authorized to "hear and determine" such claims and "enter appropriate orders and judgments" on them. § 157(b)(1). A final judgment entered in a core proceeding is appealable to the district court, § 157(a)(1), which reviews the judgment under the traditional appellate standards. Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8013."Non-core" proceedings, also as described by the Executive Benefits Court, are proceedings that are not core, but are "otherwise related to a case under title 11." The statute authorizes bankruptcy courts to hear the proceeding, and then "submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court." § 157(c)(1). These are reviewed de novo by the district court, which then enters any final orders or judgments. Ibid."Stern claims" are statutory "core" claims that constitutionally must be treated like "non-core" claims. See Executive Benefits, 134 S. Ct. at 2173.12his consent, Congress could not confer on the bankruptcy court the authority to finally decide the tortious interference counterclaim against him: Congress had therefore violated Article III by vesting the power to adjudicate the counterclaim in the bankruptcy court without his consent.9In Executive Benefits, the Court did not reach the constitutional "consent" issue. Instead, the Court resolved a statutory issue by finding that there was no statutory "gap" and declaring that, in the context of Stern claims, a "bankruptcy court should hear the proceeding and submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court for de novo review and entry of judgment." Id. at 2173.In Wellness, the Court granted certiorari to address the constitutional "consent" issue that the Court reserved in Executive Benefits. The ABA respectfully asserts that permitting the bankruptcy courts to hear9 Stern held only that when a creditor files a proof of claim he does not consent to being sued on a state law counterclaim in the bankruptcy court unless resolution of the proof of claim necessarily will resolve the counterclaim. 131 S. Ct. at 2620. A creditor's filing of a proof of claim does not evidence its consent because the creditor may have to file a proof of claim to share in a distribution from the debtor's estate. See Stern, 131 S. Ct. at 2614-15 ("Pierce did not truly consent to resolution of Vickie's claim in the bankruptcy court proceedings. He had nowhere else to go if he wished to recover from Vickie's estate."); see Granfinanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 59 n.14 (1989) ("creditors lack an alternative forum to the bankruptcy court in which to pursue their claims").13and enter final judgments in non-core and Stern claims with litigant consent does not (i) implicate institutional concerns for the separation of powers or (ii) violate a litigant's right to an Article III judge. See also, Schor, 478 U.S. at 855 ("separation of powers concerns are diminished" and litigants may waive the right to an Article III court, when "the decision to invoke [a non-Article III] forum is left entirely to the parties and the power of the federal judiciary to take jurisdiction" is unaffected).The ABA asserts that such a clarification would be consistent with the Executive Benefits Court's discussion of modern bankruptcy legislation, id. at 217071, and with the historical foundation on which that legislation stands.10II. The Ability Of Litigants To Consent To Final Adjudications By Non-Article III Courts Serves An Important Role In The Federal Court System.In determining that Stern claims do not create a statutory "gap," the Executive Benefits Court stated,10 In the analogous context of magistrate judges, this Court held that a magistrate judge, with express or implied consent of the litigants, may enter a final judgment without any district court review. Roell v. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580, 585, 589-91 (2003). The Roell Court held that, by allowing magistrate judges to hear and determine matters where consent is inferred, "[ j]udicial efficiency is served; the Article III right is substantially honored." Id. at 590.14[W]e noted in Stern that removal of claims from core bankruptcy jurisdiction does not "meaningfully chang[e] the division of labor in the current statute." Accepting EBIA's contention that district courts are required to hear all Stern claims in the first instance would dramatically alter the division of responsibility set by Congress.Id. at 2173 n.8 (internal citations omitted) (second alteration original).The ABA respectfully asserts that a significant part of this "division of labor" includes the ability of the bankruptcy courts to hear and enter final judgments in non-core and Stern claims with the consent of the litigants under § 157(c)(2). If bankruptcy courts are not permitted to adjudicate these claims, the district courts' workloads will be impacted in at least three significant ways.First, all Stern claims would have to be reviewed de novo by the district court. Second, the reach of Stern's "narrow" holding would also extend to de novo review of all non-core claimsThird, because of the similarity of the statutory schemes of bankruptcy judges and magistrate judges, a determination that litigants may not consent to proceed before non-Article III courts also may extend to matters now heard by magistrate judges.11 These11 For example, see 1 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY ¶ 3.03[4] (16th ed. 2011) ("The inspiration for 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(2) is 28(Continued on following page)15similarities include the following: Magistrate and bankruptcy judges are appointed and subject to removal by Article III judges. Compare 28 U.S.C. § 631 with 28 U.S.C. § 152(a)(1). The "ultimate decision" whether to invoke a magistrate or bankruptcy judge's assistance is made by the district court, subject to veto by the parties. See Peretz v. United States, 501 U.S. 923, 937 (1991); 28 U.S.C. § 157(a), (c)(1)-(2). A magistrate and a bankruptcy judge can only preside over a jury trial if specifically designated by an Article III court and with the parties' consent. Compare 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(1) with 28 U.S.C. § 157(e). The district court may vacate the reference to a magistrate or withdraw the reference to a bankruptcy judge. Compare 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(4) with 28 U.S.C. § 157(d). The entire magistrate and bankruptcy processes take place under the district court's control and jurisdiction. See Peretz, 501 U.S. at 937-38; 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334, 151, 152, and 157. Although magistrate judges appear to have more protection from reduction in salary (compare 28 U.S.C. § 634(b) with 28 U.S.C. § 153(a)), there are provisions designed to limit the outside interests of magistrate and bankruptcy judges to maintain their impartiality. See Peretz, 501 U.S. at 937; compare 28 U.S.C. § 632(a) with 28 U.S.C. § 153(b).12U.S.C. § 636(c)(1), which deals with the powers of United States magistrate judges in like situations.").12 This Court has upheld "the use of adjunct factfinders even in the adjudication of constitutional rights ­ so long as(Continued on following page)16Magistrate judges "account for a staggering volume of judicial work" and are "indispensable." Peretz, 501 U.S. at 928 & n.5 (citing Gov't of the Virgin Islands v. Williams, 892 F.2d 305, 308 (3d Cir. 1989)). In 2013, for example, magistrate judges disposed of 1,179,358 matters (up 2% from 2012), including 15,804 civil cases (up 6% from 2012) concluded with finality by motion, jury trial, or bench trial with litigant consent.13 As of 2013, the United States had 574 magistrate judges and 58 recalled retired magistrate judges, who provide substantial assistance to the 1020 active and senior status district court judges.14Justice Breyer noted in Stern that "the volume of bankruptcy cases is staggering." Stern, 131 S. Ct. at 2630 (dissent). In 2013, a total of 44,555 adversary proceedings were filed (a 17% reduction from 2012 and 20% percent below the 2009 total) and 56,843those adjuncts were subject to sufficient control by an Art. III district court." N. Pipeline, 458 U.S. at 78-79 (plurality). Although a bankruptcy judge cannot be considered an "adjunct" of the district court with respect to its powers over "core" proceedings for which the bankruptcy judge may enter final orders, Stern, 131 S. Ct. at 2618-19, the use of bankruptcy judges is similar to the use of magistrate judges with respect to non-core claims and Stern claims.13 http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/2013/ us-magistrate-judges.aspx.14 http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/2013/ appointments-magistrate-judges.aspx#table13.17were pending (down 13% from 2012).15 If all non-core and Stern claims asserted in those adversary proceedings must be heard de novo in the district court, Article III judges' workload would increase dramatically, resulting in increased delay as cases compete for the district courts' time and attention. Accordingly, the ABA submits that, where, as here, considerations of judicial economy and practicality are not in conflict with constitutional principles, the impact on the courts and both bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy litigants should be considered.The ABA therefore urges this Court to clarify that Article III of the United States Constitution permits the bankruptcy courts, upon consent of the parties, to hear, determine and enter final orders and judgments in non-core and Stern claims, under 28 U.S.C. § 157(c)(2).---------------------------------  ---------------------------------15 http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/2013/ us-bankruptcy-courts.aspx.18CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae American Bar Association requests that the judgment of the court of appeals be reversed.Dated: September 16, 2014Of Counsel: DONALD L.

I. Engrafting A Procedural Default Rule Onto The PLRA Would Improperly Interfere With a Prisoner's Right To Pursue Valid Constitutional Claims1. "[P]risoners have a constitutional right of access to the courts." Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 821 (1977). One of the principal means for a prisoner to pursue this constitutional right is to file a complaint under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1983). See Muhammad v. Close, 540 U.S. 749, 750 (2004).Before the passage of the PLRA, a prisoner's right to initiate a civil rights lawsuit in federal court was subject to the provisions of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 ("CRIPA"). In interpreting the provisions of the CRIPA against the backdrop of a prisoner's constitutional right of access to the courts, this Court in 1992 explained: "[t]he first of the principles that necessarily frame our analysis of prisoner's constitutional claims is that federal courts must take cognizance of the valid constitutional claims6of prison inmates." McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 153 (1992).2. In 1996, Congress passed the PLRA, which included a revised administrative exhaustion provision stating that no action shall be brought by a prisoner under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or other federal law with respect to prison conditions "until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted." 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The PLRA did not change the principle that federal courts must take cognizance of the valid constitutional claims of prison inmates. See United States v. Wells, 519 U.S. 482, 495 (1997) (stating that the Court "presume[s] that Congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with th[e] Court's precedents"). Rather, as the legislative history reveals, the purpose of the PLRA was to "prevent[] inmates from abusing the judicial system," 141 Cong. Rec. S14611 (1995) (statement of Sen. Hatch), while still "allow[ing] meritorious claims to be filed." 141 Cong. Rec. S14611 (1995) (statement of Sen. Thurmond).3. Importing a procedural default rule into the PLRA's exhaustion requirement imposes barriers not intended by Congress to prisoners' exercise of the constitutional right of access to courts, particularly given the short time frames allowed for the filing of an administrative grievance. The California Department of Corrections ("CDOC"), which has custody of the Respondent, Viet Mike Ngo, limits this period to fifteen days following "the event or decision being appealed." See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 15, § 3084.6(c). In some states, this deadline is as short as 48 hours. See Florida Corrections Commission 1999 Report, Appendix 4.3, www.fcc.state.fl.us/fcc/reports/final99/ap43.html (last visited December 26, 2005).As this Court has recognized, many victims of civil rights violations will not recognize their right to legal redress7within even 120 days after a violation. Consequently, in Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131 (1988), the Court held that a state's notice-of-claim statute, which required that state and local governmental officials be notified of a claim within 120 days of the event giving rise to it, was unenforceable in a § 1983 suit. Prisoners are even less equipped to recognize, in far shorter periods of time, that their civil rights have been violated, that they have a legal right to redress, and that they must file a grievance as a precondition to obtaining such redress.While the supposed procedural default at issue in this case is Ngo's alleged failure to file a grievance within fifteen working days of "the event or decision being appealed," the procedures that prisoners are required to navigate are not restricted to compliance with short filing deadlines, but they may encompass a variety of pleading and other formal requirements. See Strong v. David, 297 F.3d 646, 649 (7th Cir. 2002) (holding that exhaustion has not occurred unless the prisoner files a grievance in the place, at the time, and with the level of detail required by the prison administrative rules). Importing a procedural default rule into the PLRA's exhaustion requirement would contravene the very purpose of § 1983 ­ to enable federal courts to redress civil rights violations by state actors. See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 180 (1961). A procedural default rule would enable prison, jail, and other correctional officials, typically the defendants in § 1983 suits brought by inmates, to craft their grievance rules in ways that make it difficult or impossible for prisoners to obtain access to the courts and vindicate their constitutional and other civil rights.8II. A Procedural Default Rule Goes Beyond The Text And Purpose Of The PLRA's Exhaustion Requirement1. The procedural default rule that Petitioners ask this Court to impose would require dismissal of a prisoner's civil rights claim where the prisoner sought to invoke the prison grievance system, but the grievance was rejected as "procedurally defective." This rule goes beyond the express language of 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The PLRA mandates exhaustion of available administrative remedies, but says nothing about procedural default. The statute reads: "No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [42 U.S.C. § 1983] or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted." 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). A procedural default rule goes far beyond the plain language of the PLRA.2. Judicial engrafting of a procedural default rule onto the exhaustion provision would also usurp Congress's authority in amending the exhaustion provision found in the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act. As this Court explained in Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002), the purpose of the PLRA's administrative exhaustion requirement was to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits by "afford[ing] corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal case." Id. at 524-25. As long as a prisoner pursues a grievance through all levels of the grievance process, thereby giving prison officials a chance to address the claim and "exhausting" whatever administrative remedies may exist, the statutory exhaustion requirement is satisfied even though the prisoner does not meet the time constraints imposed by prison officials. Prison officials thus are afforded the opportunity to resolve a dispute internally, if they so desire, before a court adjudicates the9legal merits of the claim. Encouraging prison administrators instead to rely on procedural "defects" to decline to address prison grievances would be antithetical to the primary purpose underlying the PLRA's exhaustion requirement--to afford corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally.3. The judicial implanting of a procedural default rule in the PLRA's exhaustion requirement, as a practical matter, operates to shorten the statute of limitations significantly for a prisoner plaintiff pursuing a § 1983 claim. "The statute of limitations for a § 1983 claim is generally the applicable state-law period for personal-injury torts." City of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. v. Abrams, 125 S. Ct. 1453, 1540 n.5 (2005). For example, Ngo's § 1983 claim arising in California would have a two-year statute of limitations. See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 335.1 (providing a two-year statute of limitations for personal-injury torts). But if a procedural default rule were imposed by this Court, a prisoner's claim would be barred if he or she failed to meet the fifteen-day requirement imposed by CDOC.Neither the text of the PLRA nor its legislative history reflects any intent by Congress to alter the statute of limitations otherwise applicable to § 1983 claims. Absent express statutory authority, adopting a rule that would subordinate the statute of limitations for a § 1983 claim to the varying time limitations adopted by grievance processes in a wide gamut of correctional facilities, including jails, juvenile detention centers, and juvenile training schools, is inconsistent with prior decisions of this Court.In Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U.S. 750 (1979), an involuntarily retired employee brought suit against his former employer under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"). Id. at 754. After recognizing that the ADEA required claimants to utilize state10administrative procedures prior to filing a federal claim, the plaintiff sought to file an administrative claim with the Iowa State Civil Rights Commission. The defendant employer sought dismissal of the federal lawsuit on the ground that Iowa's 120-day statute of limitations already had run. Id. at 758-59. This Court rejected the employer's argument. Id. at 761-62. The Court noted that the ADEA's exhaustion requirement does not expressly alter the statute of limitations for claims brought under the ADEA. Id. at 759 ("In particular, there is no requirement that, in order to commence state proceedings and thereby preserve federal rights, the grievant must file with the State within whatever time limits are specified by state law."). Absent statutory authority, the Court refused to impose a rule that would alter the statute of limitations, explaining:Congress could not have intended to consign federal lawsuits to the "vagaries of diverse state limitations statutes," particularly since, in many States, including Iowa, the limitations periods are considerably shorter than the 180-day period allowed grievants in nondeferral States.Id. at 763 (citation omitted). More recently, the Court reached the same conclusion in the Title VII context. EEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U.S. 107, 122-23 (1988) ("[S]tate time limits for filing discrimination claims do not determine the applicable federal time limit."). See also Burnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42, 52-53 (1984) (quoting Occidental Life Insurance Co. v. EEOC, 432 U.S. 355, 367 (1977)). ("`State legislatures do not devise their limitations periods with national interests in mind, and it is the duty of the federal courts to assure that the importation of state law will not frustrate or interfere with the implementation of national policies.'")11Like the exhaustion provisions of the ADEA and Title VII, the exhaustion provision of the PLRA says nothing about the applicable statute of limitations. In fact, no provision of the PLRA mentions the statute of limitations.3 As with the ADEA and Title VII, there is no basis to infer that Congress intended to subject prisoners' § 1983 lawsuits to the shorter time limitations imposed by the various prison grievance procedures. Cf. Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 596-97 (1998) ("If there is a compelling need to frame new rules of law [for prisoner lawsuits], presumably Congress either would have dealt with the problem in the [Prison Litigation] Reform Act, or will respond to it in future legislation.").The reasoning underlying this Court's refusal to subordinate the ADEA and Title VII statutes of limitations to the state-imposed deadlines applies with even greater force in prisoner civil rights litigation. In the ADEA context, this Court reiterated that additional judicially-created procedural technicalities "are particularly inappropriate in a statutory scheme in which laymen, unassisted by trained lawyers, initiate the process." Oscar Mayer, 441 U.S. at 765 n.13 (quoting Love v. Pullman Co., 404 U.S. 522, 526-27 (1972)). The short deadlines at issue here would be a substantial problem in any administrative remedy system. They are especially problematic for the prison population, which is generally unknowledgeable about legal rights and procedures, poorly educated, and often functionally illiterate.3 Also, like the statute at issue in Oscar Mayer, the PLRA contemplates the possibility that a state may not have an administrative procedure for a prisoner to exhaust before filing a § 1983 claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(b) ("The failure of a State to adopt or adhere to an administrative grievance procedure shall not constitute the basis for an action under section 3 or 5 of this Act.").12See U.S. Department of Education, Literacy Behind Prison Walls (1994), http://nces.ed.gov/pubs94/94102.pdf (last visited December 26, 2005) (reporting that seven out of ten prisoners perform at the lowest literacy levels). In addition, prisoners often must decide, under very tight timelines and in an environment that is fraught with explicit or implicit threats of retaliation and recriminations, whether to submit a grievance about the conduct of prison officials to those officials' cohorts on the grievance committee. These impediments only enhance the difficulty of navigating the short filing deadlines, which this Court recognized to be "a likely trap for the inexperienced and unwary inmate, ordinarily indigent and unrepresented by counsel, with a substantial claim." McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 153.The PLRA applies to juveniles. See Christina A. v. Bloomberg, 315 F.3d 990, 994 (8th Cir. 2003) (holding that PLRA applies to juveniles detained in a state training school); Lewis v. Gagne, 281 F. Supp. 2d 429, 433 (N.D.N.Y. 2003) (holding that PLRA applies to juveniles adjudicated delinquent and confined to residential facility). Therefore, the short deadlines apply not only to adult prisoners, but also to juveniles. The impediments that adult prisoners face in navigating short filing deadlines--illiteracy, inexperience, lack of legal training and knowledge, and fear--would be magnified in the case of juvenile prisoners.4. A procedural default rule significantly interferes with a prisoner's constitutional right of access to the courts, and places a particularly heavy burden on inmates who are underage, unsophisticated, illiterate, and/or inexperienced in filing prison grievances and lawsuits. Congress has not suggested that it intended such a result. In fact, such a result contradicts the stated intent of the PLRA. The legislative history of the PLRA vividly illustrates that the PLRA was intended to "prevent[] inmates from abusing the judicial system," but was not intended "to prevent inmates from13raising legitimate claims." 141 Cong. Rec. S14611 (1995) (statements of Sen. Hatch). While a procedural default rule may reduce the total number of prisoner lawsuits adjudicated in federal court, it is no more likely to eliminate frivolous suits than to eliminate meritorious constitutional claims.III. The Court Should Not Import A Procedural Default Rule From Habeas Corpus Jurisprudence1. The procedural default rule in the PLRA context is based on the inappropriate importation of habeas corpus principles into civil rights litigation. See, e.g., Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 228-29 (3d Cir. 2004) (analogizing the habeas corpus exhaustion requirement to the PLRA exhaustion requirement). The importation of habeas corpus principles into the PLRA based on "the analogy" between habeas petitions and § 1983 actions, see id. at 228-29, belies the fact that the distinctions between the two areas of law are important and complex enough to have merited this Court's attention in no fewer than four opinions over the preceding seven years. See Wilkinson v. Dotson, 125 S. Ct. 1242 (2005); Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004); Muhammad v. Close, 540 U.S. 749 (2004); Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641 (1997). While the Court has not specifically addressed the exhaustion requirements in these cases, the Court has suggested that the exhaustion requirements for habeas petitions are more stringent than the exhaustion requirements for PLRA actions. See Muhammad, 540 U.S. at 751 ("Federal petitions for habeas corpus may be granted only after other avenues of relief have been exhausted. Prisoners suing under § 1983, in contrast, generally face a substantially lower gate, even with the requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that administrative opportunities be exhausted first.") (citations omitted).14The rationale underlying this Court's adoption of the procedural default rule for habeas corpus petitions is inapplicable to § 1983 actions. In Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991), the Court recognized that procedural default is a distinct concept from administrative exhaustion. Id. at 732. In that case, the Court noted the purposes of the requirement in the habeas corpus context that state judicial remedies be exhausted: "`to protect the state courts' role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state judicial proceedings.'" Id. at 731-32 (quoting Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518 (1982)). The Court then explained that a procedural default rule also furthers those purposes in the habeas context.As this Court has explained, § 1983 challenges to the conditions of confinement do not raise the same concerns about the autonomy of state courts as habeas corpus challenges to the confinement itself. See Wilkinson v. Dotson, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 1249 (2005) (rejecting argument that permitting prisoner's § 1983 lawsuit without prior exhaustion of state-court remedies would compromise principles of federal-state comity). Thus, the fact that this Court held that a procedural default rule is necessary to protect state court powers in the habeas context does not spell the need for or justify such a rule in the PLRA context. Unlike state courts, the individuals processing prison grievances do not have "concurrent powers" with federal courts to enforce constitutional rights or the legal expertise to do so. Id. at 731 (quoting Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. at 518). In addition, the correctional officials processing inmates' grievances are not, in contrast to judges, independent adjudicators. Cf. Cleavinger v. Saxner, 474 U.S. 193, 20304 (1985) (holding that members of prison disciplinary committee were not entitled to absolute immunity because "they were not truly independent" and "had no identification15with the judicial process of the kind and depth that has occasioned absolute immunity").Prison grievance officials, unlike state courts, also lack a full arsenal of remedies, including injunctive relief and damages, with which to vindicate and enforce constitutional and other civil rights. See Lynn S. Branham, The Prison Litigation Reform Act's Enigmatic Exhaustion Requirement: What It Means and What Congress, Courts, and Correctional Officials Can Learn from It, 86 CORNELL L. REV. 483, 518 (2001) (reporting survey results revealing that prisoners cannot obtain monetary relief through grievance procedures for most types of legal claims). See also Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 n.5 (2001) (holding that prison grievance procedures do not have to satisfy even "minimum acceptable standards of fairness and effectiveness").2. In contrast to the exhaustion requirement applicable in habeas corpus actions, the PLRA's administrative exhaustion requirement was neither designed nor intended to preserve the power of state courts, which have parallel authority and expertise to render decisions regarding the scope of constitutional and other legal rights. Rather, the purpose of the PLRA's exhaustion requirement is to improve the quality of prisoner lawsuits or avert the need for such lawsuits by affording prison officials an opportunity to address complaints internally prior to a federal lawsuit. The Court explained this in Porter:Beyond doubt, Congress enacted § 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits; to this purpose, Congress afforded corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal case. In some instances, corrective action taken in response to an inmate's grievance might improve prison administration16and satisfy the inmate, thereby obviating the need for litigation.Porter, 534 U.S. at 524-25.The Court's articulation of the rationale for the PLRA's exhaustion requirement echoes the Court's articulation of the rationale for the ADEA's exhaustion requirement. In Oscar Mayer, the Court explained:The [exhaustion requirement] is intended only to give state agencies a limited opportunity to settle the grievances of ADEA claimants in a voluntary and localized matter so that the grievants thereafter have no need or desire for independent federal relief.Oscar Mayer, 441 U.S. at 761. The rationale for the PLRA's exhaustion requirement, like the rationale for the ADEA's requirement, is to provide state agencies the opportunity to address and perhaps resolve claims in order to eliminate the need for federal litigation. For example, the CDOC may reverse or lift its ban on the Respondent's participation in Bible study, perhaps prompting him to forgo a federal lawsuit. But, as this Court stated in Oscar Mayer, "[i]ndividuals should not be penalized if States decline, for whatever reason, to take advantage of these opportunities." Oscar Mayer, 441 U.S. at 761.Because the procedural default rule proposed by Petitioners is not mandated by the language of the PLRA, does not advance the policies underlying the PLRA, is not warranted by an analogy to habeas corpus law, and would interfere significantly with a prisoner's constitutional right of access to the courts, this Court should decline Petitioners' invitation to impose such a rule. Congress, rather than the Court, should consider in the first instance the advisability and constitutionality of importing a procedural default rule17into the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act's exhaustion provision.CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court should affirm the decision of the court below. Respectfully submitted.MICHAEL S. GRECO* President American Bar Association *
I. This Court's Longstanding Precedent Should Not Be Upset.Patent law has been consistent and predictable in resolving the manner in which patent rights may be enforced against infringers. This consistency and predictability has been relied upon by patent practitioners in advising their clients on the acquisition and enforcement of patent rights for the last century.Contrary to the argument of Petitioners that the Federal Circuit altered this law or adopted a new "nearautomatic" rule,4 in fact, the Federal Circuit's decision is consistent with the precedent that has been relied upon by patent practitioners for more than a century that has favored but not absolutely mandated injunctions against adjudicated infringers in patent cases. See, e.g., Albert H. Walker, Textbook of the Patent Laws of the United States of America § 697 (1883) ("A permanent injunction follows a decision in favor of the complainant on the interlocutory hearing of a patent case, unless some special reason exists for its being refused."). See also John Norton Pomeroy, 4 A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence § 1352 (Spencer W. Symons ed., 5th ed. 1941); William C. Robinson, 3 The Law of Patents for Useful Inventions § 1220 (1890).This Court's decision in Continental Paper Bag Co., supra, rejected a minority view5 that a non-practicing patentee should not be permitted to obtain an injunction4 Petitioners' Merits Brief at 16. 5 Prior to 1908 a decision not to enter a permanent injunction against an adjudged infringer was limited to "peculiar" cases. Thomas Carl Spelling, 1 Treatise on Injunctions & Other Extraordinary Remedies § 831 (2d ed. 1901).6against an infringer. After observing that many foreign countries had compulsory licensing requirements for nonworked patents and that Congress had chosen not to adopt such a system in this country, the Court rejected the contention that a patentee's "unreasonable nonuse" deprived it of the right to a permanent injunction. Indeed, the Court held that:[i]t hardly needs to be pointed out that the right [of the patentee] can only retain its attribute of exclusiveness by a prevention of its violation. Anything but prevention takes away the privilege which the law confers upon the patentee. 210 U.S. at 430 (Emphasis added).In 1952, the patent statute was recodified and the injunction statute was reenacted at 35 U.S.C. § 283. As this Court noted in Graham v. John Deere & Co., 383 U.S. 1, 16 (1966), such re-enactment has the effect of continuing this Court's precedent under prior statutes. Further, Congress has declined to include working requirements or compulsory licensing provisions in the patent statute in 1952 or at any subsequent time.6 This case does not justify judicial policymaking where Congress has consistently declined to act.6 The only major exception to this is the public interest. Because of the acknowledged public interest when a patent is used without authorization by or for the U.S. Government, there is never an injunction, but only reasonable compensation for such unauthorized use. 28 U.S.C. § 1498(a).7II. Absent Exceptional Circumstances, Equity Favors The Entry Of A Permanent Injunction Against An Adjudicated Infringer Of A Valid Patent.Irreparable injury has always been assumed where a patent has been found valid and infringed. This is an outgrowth of the doctrine that the owner of a statutory privilege or franchise is presumptively entitled to an injunction against its invasion.7 Further, a patent is a wasting asset. Because the exclusive right granted by a patent exists for a limited time only and cannot be replaced, the unauthorized denial of that limited exclusive right has been deemed to be an irreparable harm not compensable by monetary damages. Smith Intern., Inc. v. Hughes Tool Co., 718 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1983)("Where "validity and continuing infringement have been clearly established, as in this case, immediate irreparable harm is presumed.").The availability of money damages is not an adequate remedy. If the willful infringement continues beyond the judgment of validity and infringement, such damages could only be recovered in successive lawsuits and accountings or through prospective compulsory licensing ­ a remedy that is not authorized by 35 U.S.C. § 284.The argument that a patentee's required recourse should be to file successive infringement actions also has historically been rejected for over a century, and no new reason exists to impose such a burden now. See William Robinson, 3 The Law of Patents § 1168 (1890) ("[A preventive injunction] removes from [the patentee] the danger of an irremediable injury, precludes the necessity of successive suits for his successive wrongs and interposes in7 Livingston v. Van Ingen, 9 Johns. 507 (N.Y. 1812) (Kent, J.)(discussing American and English precedent regarding the availability of injunctions against violations of statutory privileges).8the path of the infringer an obstacle which he cannot overcome. It is the proper compliment of that legislative action which confers upon the inventor his exclusive privilege . . . ."); Allington & Curtis Mfg. Co. v. Booth, 78 F. 878, 879-80 (2d Cir. 1897) ("A decree for damages and profits in an equity cause would fall short of adequate redress to the patentee. He is entitled to an injunction as well as to an accounting of damages and profits.").8When courts have denied permanent injunctive relief after an adjudication of patent validity and infringement, they have almost always done so in cases in which the patent owner's inability to supply the patented product or service would have had a substantial adverse impact on the public. See, e.g., Rite Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co., 56 F.3d 1538, 1547 (Fed. Cir. 1995)(en banc). Indeed, Continental Paper Bag expressly left open the "public interest" as a basis for denying an injunction against a non-practicing patentee. The private interests of the adjudicated infringer should not operate to deny the patentee the benefit of its innovation.III. The Other Factors Suggested By Petitioners And Amici That Support Their Position Are Not Valid Equitable Considerations.This Court should not set aside a long standing rule of equity and substitute an ad hoc policy-based rule in its stead. To do so would be contrary to the principled application of8 Id. And as Justice Story pointed out in his treatise on equity:It is quite plain that, if no other remedy could be given in cases of patents and copyrights than an action at law for damages, the inventor or author might be ruined by the necessity of perpetual litigation without ever being able to have a final establishment of his rights.William Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence § 931 (1836).9standards that this Court explained in Ford Motor Co. v. E.E.O.C., 458 U.S. 219 (1982):[W]hen Congress invokes the Chancellor's conscience to further transcendent legislative purposes, what is required is the principled application of standards consistent with those purposes and not "equity [which] varies like the Chancellor's foot." Important national goals would be frustrated by a regime of discretion that "produce[d] different results for breaches of duty in situations that cannot be differentiated in policy.458 U.S. at 227.Petitioners assert that this Court should reject the traditional rules of equity and adopt three classes of considerations: (1) independent subsequent discovery of the invention; (2) discrimination against certain types of nonpracticing users and (3) defenses based upon perceived failings of the U. S. Patent & Trademark Office ("USPTO"). The Court should decline this invitation.A. Congress Has Exclusive Authority To Establish New Equitable Defenses That Did Not Exist At Common Law.In Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, 451 U.S. 77 (1981), this Court held that equitable considerations are properly addressed to Congress, not to the federal courts, because Congress is better able to evaluate policy considerations regarding recognition of new equitable defenses:[T]he equitable considerations advanced by Petitioners are properly addressed to10Congress, not to the federal courts. Congress is best able to evaluate these policy considerations:[T]he claim now asserted, though the product of a law Congress passed, is a matter on which Congress has not taken a position. It presents questions of policy on which Congress has not spoken. The selection of that policy which is most advantageous to the whole involves a host of considerations that must be weighed and appraised. That function is more appropriately for those who write the laws, rather than for those who interpret them."451 U.S. at 88, n.41; See also Grupo Mexicano De Desarrollo, S.A., v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 333 (1999) ("The debate concerning this formidable [equitable] power [a Mareva injunction] over debtors should be conducted and resolved where such issues belong in our democracy: in the Congress.").B. Independent Discovery Without Notice Of The Patent And A "Close Case Of Infringement" Are Not Viable Equitable Defenses.The Court should reject the suggestion that no injunction should issue if the defendant begins its infringement without knowledge of the patent or if there is a "close" case of infringement. Patent infringement is a strict liability offense and a person can be found liable as an infringer even without knowledge of the patent. See 35 U.S.C. § 271. Further, neither of these considerations is a valid legal defense under current law. This Court should not recognize new defenses in equity where none exists at law.11C. General Issues Relating To Patent Quality Are Not Valid Reasons To Refuse An Injunction Upon A Patent That Has Been Found Valid And Infringed.The ABA, like some other amici in this case, has been actively working with Congress and the USPTO to improve patent quality. The ABA shares the concerns of the other amici regarding patent quality. However such general considerations are irrelevant when applied to an issued patent, which is entitled to a presumption of validity under the patent laws. 35 U.S.C. § 282. Moreover, by the time a court considers granting a permanent injunction, it will already have determined that the patent is valid and infringed after rigorous inter partes proceedings.A belief that the USPTO is not properly performing its duties is not a valid basis for denying injunctive relief. Such issues go far beyond the case and controversy before the district courts, which are not charged with overseeing the operations of agencies of the executive branch of government, such as the USPTO.D. Whether To Limit The Availability Of Injunctive Relief To Certain Classes Of Patentees Is A Decision Reserved To Congress.Whether injunctions should be limited to certain patentees is an issue for Congress ­ not the courts. In essence, Petitioners and the amici who support them request that this Court set forth a basis for discriminating between two classes of patentees.Some amici suggest that non-practicing patentees do not promote the progress of the useful arts and are therefore not entitled to the benefit of an injunction. Implicit in this suggestion is a contention that any non-practicing entity that12seeks to enforce its patent rights is abusing the patent system. This is not true.Individuals, businesses, and academic institutions throughout this country make inventions, patent those inventions, and seek the patent system's financial incentives by licensing or attempting to license their patented inventions rather than making and selling their inventions on their own.9The denial (or unavailability) of a permanent injunction against future infringement to such persons adversely affects both the royalty that prospective licensees will be willing to pay for a negotiated license and the "reasonable royalty" that a court will be willing to award pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 284. Without the threat of an injunction, a would-be infringer has little incentive to avoid infringement or to settle a patent infringement case after infringement has begun. Indeed, the would-be-infringer may even be encouraged to attempt any potential defense knowing that if he loses, he only risks being required to pay a reasonable royalty.9 Many colleges and universities earn considerable royalties from their intellectual property. For example, Harvard University reported earning $23.7 million in royalty fees from its intellectual property in fiscal year 2004, see Harvard University, Office of Technology Development (OTD), Annual Report to the Committee on Patents and Copyrights Fiscal Year 2004 5 (2005), while the University of Michigan reported royalty earnings of $16.7 million. See University of Michigan Tech Transfer, 2005 Annual Report 1 (2005).Smaller universities also benefit greatly from the royalty income generated from their intellectual property. For example, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, reported royalty earnings of $8.4 million between July 1, 2004 and June 30, 2005. See Case Western Reserve University, Technology Transfer Office 2005 Annual Report at 5 (2005). These universities engage in significant basic scientific and technical research. If their ability to license their technologies is diminished, their incentive to conduct research may also be diminished, and the public will suffer as a result.13Attacks by defendants upon allegedly unscrupulous patent enforcers have been a part of the patent system since its inception. The 1836 Patent Act, which created the Patent Office, explained that it was enacted to remedy "evils which necessarily result[ed] from the [1793 statute]" including "worthless and void [patents]" and "a great number of lawsuits . . . which are onerous to the courts, ruinous to the parties and injurious to society."10In 1883, Justice Bradley's opinion in Atlantic Works v. Brady, 107 U.S. 192 (1883) attacked "speculative schemers [patentees that obtain patents] which enable them to lay a heavy tax upon the industry of the country, without contributing anything to the real advancement of the art." Id. at 231. Congress has been well aware of these issues for a very long time, but has not acted. Congress' long silence on the subject of non-practicing patentees speaks loudly to this issue.For the last year, Congress has been debating legislation to alter the patent system. Indeed, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing directed to the specific issue now before this Court.11 An early draft of pending legislation contained a provision that would have substantially amended § 283. However, this provision was eliminated from the pending legislation based on input from industry groups, bar associations, and other interested parties.Many of the amici in this case have participated in the debate over the pending patent reform effort. These parties10 Senate Report Accompanying Senate Bill 239, 24th Congress, 1 Session (Chisum on Patents Appendix 12 at 4). 11 Hearing of Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Patent Law Reform: Injunctions and Damages (June 14, 2005).14now seek to obtain from this Court the relief that they apparently were unable to obtain from Congress.In Northwest Airlines, the petitioners requested that this Court recognize a new equitable defense. This Court, declined the invitation in that case, and it should decline the invitation in this case as well and defer to Congress on this issue.IV. There Would Be Significant Consequences If This Court Changes The Current Standard For Granting Injunctions.All patent licenses (since at least as early as this Court's 1908 ruling in the Continental Paper Bag case) have relied upon the general rule that a patentee ­ even one who is merely licensing, or is trying to merely license, his patented invention ­ is entitled to a permanent injunction against an adjudicated infringer. A change in that venerable general rule would have profound, immeasurable economic consequences on existing and future patent licenses. The judiciary is ill-equipped to decide whether the public interest would be better served by preserving or changing that general rule which has provided the economic foundation for patent licenses for a century or more.A. There Would Be Significant Adverse Consequences To Existing Exclusive Licenses.With respect to existing exclusive licenses, the inability of a patentee to get a permanent injunction ­ after his patent has been held valid, enforceable, and infringed ­ would eliminate the exclusivity that was the very foundation of the exclusive license. Because exclusive license royalties (lump sum, running royalty, or combination) are higher than nonexclusive license royalties, the effect on existing exclusive licenses would be pronounced if the exclusivity15were eliminated by the inability of the patentee to permanently enjoin an infringer. For example, the exclusive licensee might then seek to rescind the license and/or obtain a partial or total refund, issues that are currently unaddressed. An abrupt change in the law would be chaotic for existing exclusive licenses negotiated under the long standing general rule that a non-practicing patentee is entitled to a permanent injunction against an adjudicated infringer.B. There Would Be Significant Adverse Consequences To Existing Nonexclusive Licenses.An abrupt change in the law would be equally chaotic for existing nonexclusive licenses negotiated under the long standing general rule that a non-practicing patentee is entitled to a permanent injunction against an adjudicated infringer. If a non-practicing patentee cannot get a permanent injunction against an adjudicated infringer, would the patentee lose his royalty streams from existing nonexclusive licensees? What would be the effect on the agreed royalty rate (lump sum, running royalty, or combination) if the patentee could not obtain a permanent injunction against an adjudicated infringer?Existing nonexclusive licenses typically have a mostfavored-licensee clause that prevents a licensor from granting subsequent licenses on more favorable terms than those of the original licensee. Such licenses also often require a licensor to notify the original licensee of subsequent licenses and allow the licensee to substitute the more favorable terms for the terms in its original license.12 Some, if not many or most, nonexclusive licenses include a provision allowing the licensee to notify the patentee of substantial infringing competition and to pay royalties into escrow if the patentee12 See David Epstein, 1 Eckstrom's Licensing in For. & Dom. Ops. § 3.40 (2005).16does not abate the infringing competition ­ so that the nonexclusive licensee is not indefinitely subjected to unfair competition from an infringer who is paying no royalty.13If implemented, the changes advocated by Petitioners and the amici who support them would produce uncertainty and result in the devaluation of existing and future patent license rights. Patent practitioners must have certainty to be able to advise their clients in advance of deciding whether to pursue litigation or to grant or accept a patent license. Without the certainty that an adjudicated infringer will be enjoined, the ability to advise clients regarding such matters will be severely compromised. The essence of a patent right is the right to exclude others. Deprived of that right, a patent retains little value.C. A Change In The General Rule Will Lead To Additional Litigation And Promote ForumShopping.In addition to devaluing patent rights, changing the standard for injunctive relief would also lead to more litigation and a greater likelihood of forum-shopping. The real threat of a permanent injunction is a major factor that currently must be considered in evaluating the risks of continued litigation of any suit for patent infringement. The risk of a permanent injunction might cease to be a consideration ­ especially if this Court were to declare "close infringement" or "independent creation" viable defenses to an injunction. As a result, defendants would be more inclined to "roll the dice" and litigate such cases to judgment, rather than entertain possible settlement, if they believed that the worst case scenario would merely require a royalty payment.13 Harold Einhorn & Thomas J. Parker, 1 Patent Licensing Transactions § 2.16 (2005 ed.).17Permitting district courts to consider a wide variety of new factors in deciding whether to impose an injunction would also create an incentive for patentees to "forum-shop" and file lawsuits in those jurisdictions where the bench is thought to favor permanent injunctions against infringers. This would have the effect of undoing one of the goals for which the Federal Circuit was created, the elimination of forum-shopping in patent cases.14CONCLUSIONFor the reasons set forth above, the ABA respectfully submits that the Court should affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.Respectfully submitted,Of Counsel:ROBERT F.
