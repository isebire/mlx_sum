Petitioner Al-Nashiri, arrested in 2002, has long argued that he is not properly classified as an enemy combatant and therefore is not subject to the jurisdiction of a military commission that is authorized solely to try belligerents. Today, some 15 years later, that threshold determination has yet to be made. That is because the military commission before which AlNashiri is set to be tried will not confirm its own competency to hear the case until trial, which by current estimates will be no less than seventeen years after Petitioner was first arrested. Accordingly, AlNashiri has petitioned federal courts seeking habeas review of his position. Despite the pronouncements of this Court in Boumediene v. Bush and Hamdan v. Rumsfeld--that Guantanamo detainees were entitled to present habeas petitions, particularly in light of the exceptional length of their detention--the District Court declined to hear the case, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.As amicus curiae, the ABA respectfully submits that this Court's review is warranted in this important case for at least three reasons. First, abstention under these circumstances disregards controlling precedent and threatens to render unreviewable threshold jurisdictional challenges by all Guantanamo detainees, not just Al-Nashiri. Second, the Court of Appeals' decision rewrites abstention doctrine by narrowing the extraordinary circumstances exception that traditionally would permit habeas review. Finally, failing to put an6end to the protracted delay that the Court of Appeals' decision would countenance in this case is incompatible with constitutional guarantees vital to the American system of justice.This issue is too important to evade the Court's review. By permitting Guantanamo detainees' petitions to be consolidated within the D.C. Circuit, this Court has afforded the government a single forum for those cases. But this also inhibits the emergence of a split in authority that customarily prompts the Supreme Court's review. Thus, until this Court grants certiorari to review and correct the Court of Appeals' decision, that court's departure from precedent will become binding law for every Guantanamo detainee. This is all the more troubling given that, in deviating from this Court's rulings, the D.C. Circuit has set down a rule that condones the decades-long pretrial detention of prisoners who seek to challenge the basis for their incarceration--all the while being held in the most extreme of conditions
This case requires the Court to consider whether its decisions, including Grutter, permit the University of Texas at Austin to use race-conscious procedures in making undergraduate admissions decisions. The University's admissions program takes race into account as one of many factors in a holistic consideration of an applicant, and was designed to reap the benefits of diversity that the Court held in Grutter to be a compelling state interest. The ABA supports the University and believes that its merits brief persuasively shows that the admissions policies in question comport with the Court's precedent.The ABA submits this brief as amicus curiae to urge the Court to continue to endorse the use of such race-conscious admissions policies at institutions of higher learning. The ABA is convinced that such policies, which have been used in reliance on the Court's precedent by both public and private colleges and universities for many decades, remain important tools for the achievement of diversity in higher education, which in turn is necessary for diversity in law schools and the legal profession, and essential to our democracy. The ABA accordingly addresses two points that the ABA believes should be included in the Court's consideration of the use of race in admissions decisions.First, full representation of racial and ethnic minorities in the legal profession is essential to the legitimacy of our legal and political systems, and9therefore constitutes a compelling state interest. As the Court has recognized, the legal profession plays a critical role in American society. Lawyers formulate and implement our laws, resolve disputes and protect the rights of citizens. Drawing on their training and talents, they serve as judges and as leaders in national, state and local government affairs. Diversity in the profession shows that the path to leadership is open to all citizens and demonstrates that the justice system serves the public in a fair and inclusive manner. Moreover, such diversity improves the quality of legal services and judicial decisions, and is necessary for successful competition in the global marketplace.Second, to date race-conscious admissions policies have helped to make law schools and, consequently, the legal profession more inclusive of racial and ethnic minorities. The constitutionality of such policies was endorsed by the Court more than 30 years ago in Bakke and sanctioned again in Grutter only nine years ago, and such policies are used on a widespread basis today, reflecting the experience and expertise of educators across the nation. Nevertheless, African American and Latino representation in the legal profession remains inadequate and is not keeping pace with the nation's demographic trends. The ABA submits that now is not the time to restrict institutions of higher education from considering race in admissions decisions as they pursue the benefits of diversity, and that doing so would also present a serious risk that the progress made so far would be lost. Indeed, in the nine years since Grutter was decided, nothing10has happened in our nation's colleges anduniversities, in the legal profession or in Americansociety at large, that would support a conclusionthat race-conscious admissions procedures no longerremainvaluable--andconstitutionallypermissible--tools for achieving diversity.For these reasons, the ABA urges the Court to reaffirm that admissions policies that take race into account as merely one factor out of many, consistent with the principles espoused in Grutter, further the compelling interest of diversity in higher education, and therefore satisfy the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause
The ABA submits this amicus brief to emphasize the vital role that admissions policies like the one at issue here play in breaking down implicit racial bias and stereotypes that too often result in racially disparate outcomes in our justice system and in areas of public policy where lawyers play a pivotal role.Admissions policies that take race into account as only one factor among others play an important role in increasing the number of qualified minority lawyers in the legal profession, thereby creating the diversity essential to the legitimacy of our legal system. Equally important, these policies help to produce lawyers who, in their roles as judges, prosecutors, public officials, legislators, and advocates, are less likely to be influenced by racial bias and stereotypes when making critical decisions that affect the lives of numerous individuals, families, communities, and society at large.There is considerable evidence that, in fact, many decisions and actions by lawyers today are influenced by implicit or unconscious racial bias and stereotypes that contribute to the denial of equal justice under law. Admissions policies that consider race as one of many factors are an important tool to help eliminate racial biases and stereotypes. As this Court has long recognized, diverse educational environments expose all students to people with varied backgrounds and experiences, and thus better promote a robust exchange of ideas and perspectives. In doing so, they help to produce8lawyers who are more open to different perspectives and less likely to be influenced by racial bias and stereotypes. Diverse educational environments, therefore, improve the capacity of all lawyers to fulfill their critical role in the fair implementation of justice and public policy.Admissions policies that consider race as only one factor among many also help to increase the number of qualified, racially diverse students in the educational pipeline to the legal profession. By helping to break down racial stereotypes and biases, these admissions policies may also help to address factors that inhibit the retention and advancement of minority lawyers in the legal profession. Such admissions policies therefore help increase diversity in the legal profession, which is crucial for sustaining public faith and trust in our legal and political institutions.Improving minority representation in the legal profession also helps to ensure that lawyers in the United States are capable of serving an increasingly diverse domestic population and remaining competitive in an increasingly global economy.Over the past half-century, admissions programs like the one at issue here have enabled meaningful progress in diversifying the legal profession and creating educational environments that help to dismantle racial bias and stereotypes. However, much progress remains to be made. Thus, the ABA urges the Court to reaffirm that admissions policies that take race into account as one factor out of many are consistent with the principles espoused for many9 years in the Court's jurisprudence and further the compelling interest of diversity in higher education

This review must include meaningful access to, and effective as-sistance of, counsel. Also, any resulting detention can be permissible only if pursuant to an Act of Congress that establishes constitutionally permissible standards and procedures. The ABA believes that this commitment to due process is essential to the preservation of our core principles of liberty at home and to our leadership role in promoting the rule of law globally, even in exigent circumstances
Nearly 14 million Americans are arrested each year. Many of these arrests are for misdemeanor offenses or civil infractions that -- like the offense of which Petitioner was accused -- do not involve violence or drugs and do not suggest a motive or opportunity to smuggle contraband into a prison. Neither Petitioner nor this majority of arrestees should be subject to the grave intrusion of a strip search on admission to a detention facility unless there is individualized, reasonable suspicion of possession of contraband.ABA Standard 23-7.9(d) encapsulates this approach to strip searches in prisons. In doing so, the Standard reflects this Court's traditional Fourth Amendment approach of taking into account all the surrounding facts and circumstances of the search, including the reason for an arrestee's initial apprehension, in order to determine whether a search is reasonable. More specifically, the Standard is consistent with this Court's precedents requiring that. an appropriate balance be struck between thecontent/dam/aba/publishing/criminal_justice_section_newslette r/treatment_of_prisoners_commentary_website.authcheckdam. pdf (last visited June 24, 2011).4invasion of personal rights and the government's interest in maintaining secure prison facilities
 Treating a client's pending hourly-rate matters as the property of a law firm would severely undermine client control of matters and the ethical rules governing the practice of law. I. Clients own and control their legal matters. That essential principle is supported by the ethical rules that govern the practice of law in the District. Those rules aim to promote client choice, lawyer autonomy, and transparency in the attorney-client relationship. The rule advocated by the trustee is fundamentally inconsistent with these basic values. First, the D.C. and ABA Rules protect a client's right to discharge her lawyer at any time and to hire new counsel. The trustee's proposed rule is significantly at odds with that right. By permitting discharged counsel to continue to lay claim to a client's hourly-rate matter, it would limit the ability of the client's current counsel to earn fees for working on the matter. The trustee's rule would thereby inhibit the client's ability to use the counsel of her choice. Second, the D.C. and ABA Rules disfavor the use of restrictive covenants that limit lawyer mobility. That is because such restrictions ultimately limit client choice. But the sweeping rule advocated by the trustee--giving a discharged firm a property interest in a client's hourly-rate matter, whether before or after the discharged firm dissolves, and even if it does not--functions just like a restrictive4covenant. It means, most simply, that an attorney's new firm cannot earn the same fees that the same attorney's prior firm would have earned for doing the very same work. The new firm also will earn less than it would earn for doing other, comparable work--because when doing that other work, there will be no discharged or defunct firm taking a portion of its profits. The predictable effect of this rule will be to impermissibly restrict a lawyer's ability to move to another firm, and a client's ability to seek that lawyer's counsel.Third, the D.C. and ABA Rules restrict the use of fee-splitting arrangements; they generally prohibit a lawyer from receiving a fee that does not reflect the work she actually performed. Such restrictions are necessary because fee-splitting arrangements can undermine the trust that is necessary to the attorney-client relationship, and they encumber a client's ability to make informed decisions about her choice of counsel. The trustee's proposed rule is inconsistent with these precepts. If adopted, it would require the payment of fees to a discharged firm that is performing no work on a matter--and, indeed, it would accomplish this impermissible result without disclosure to, or written consent from, the client.II. The trustee's rule also should be rejected because it would, as numerous courts have recognized, generate perverse effects. In the modern legal marketplace, clients exercise their right to select among lawyers and firms to represent them, and lawyers often move between firms to provide clients the best5possible representation. A rule that gives a law firm a property interest in a matter it has been discharged from handling is flatly at odds with this reality. Such a rule is bound to create bizarre results, like forcing a client's attorney of choice at a new firm to turn away the client who is seeking her counsel--for the simple reason that the new firm would not be fully compensated for the work that would be done. Equally strange, it would provide the discharged firm a windfall--a reward, in effect, for having been fired or having gone bankrupt. It would generate extraordinary uncertainty as firms predictably seek to maximize the property interest created by the trustee's rule. It would discourage firms from representing clients pro bono or "low bono." And it would be entirely unworkable, because it would put firms and courts in the business of trying to assess how much profit the new firm would have the right to keep, and how much of the firm's fee is "excess" profit that must be returned to the old firm--the one that was fired or dissolved. This uncertainty would undermine the legal profession's service of clients.The better rule is one that honors the longstanding principle that clients--not lawyers or law firms--own their matters, and that lawyers are paid for the work that they do.6
The first question before the Court raises issues that affect the daily lives of petitioners, their families, and other same-sex couples and their families across the country. Its answer will have an impact just as wide, and in a very practical way, on the practice of many attorneys.6ABA members have long struggled to help clients avoid the discriminatory effects of state laws that single out same-sex couples for exclusion from marriage and its civil incidents. These include the inability to adopt children jointly, resulting in a class of children denied the legal protections afforded to the children of married couples; the lack of an automatic right to determine how to dispose of a deceased partner's remains or to receive property under the law of intestacy; limits on a same-sex partner's ability to direct medical decisions in the event of a partner's incapacity; the denial of tax benefits such as the ability to file joint income tax returns or to transfer real property without transfer taxes; and lack of the protection against legal compulsion to reveal a spouse's confidences. Table 1 in the Appendix highlights some of the ways in which different-sex married couples are granted automatic spousal rights and, conversely, the broad discrimination that occurs when those rights are denied to same-sex couples through exclusion from marriage.ABA lawyers often advise their clients who are in same-sex relationships on ways to mitigate and ­ to the extent feasible ­ work around some of these consequences. As described in this brief, however, the array of legal work-arounds is imperfect, costly, and complex ­ and as a result the rights of marriage remain unavailable to many. Ultimately, these mitigating measures cannot eliminate the concrete legal and economic harms that flow from the laws under review, which denigrate the dignity of same-sex7couples and their families and impose on them an inferior status that violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.---------------------------------  --------------------------------
The ABA submits that this Court should hold that Isolated DNA Compounds, corresponding to genes from humans or any other organisms that do not occur in nature in their isolated form, are eligible for patenting under 35 U.S.C. § 101. To hold otherwise would be a material change in this Court's approach to determining the patent-eligibility of new technologies and upset decades of reliance on this Court's precedent, the Patent and Trademark Office's longstanding practice to allow claims to such subject matter, and Congress's evident approval of that practice.This Court's recent decision in Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2012) ("Mayo") does not change the analysis of the question presented here. Mayo dealt with distinguishing between method claims directed to a law of nature or the application of a law of nature. Here, the sole question before the Court is whether Myriad's compositions are a human-made invention or a product of nature. Under this Court's applicable precedent, because Myriad's Isolated DNA Compounds are not found in nature, they are eligible for patenting.Finally, the ABA also urges that the Court set aside considerations relating to whether the subject matter claimed by Myriad is novel, nonobvious or sufficiently described and enabled in determining the patent-eligibility of Myriad's claims. Subject matter eligibility is a separate and distinct inquiry from, and resolved independently of, the other statutory requirements and conditions for patentability.
 The Second Circuit articulated a standard that permits an allegation of the element of conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act to survive a motion to dismiss that undermines the requirement of Rule 12(b)(6) to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and conflicts with basic antitrust principles. The ABA urges this Court to reject the Second Circuit's rule that a pleading of facts indicating parallel conduct by the defendants suffices to state a claim of conspiracy4 The ABA House of Delegates has adopted a policy position "Te|jncourag[ing] all courts, court supervisory bodies, and state and local bar associations to take an active role in reducing delay and excessive costs in litigation." ABA Judicial Division, Report and Recommendation to the House of Delegates, Report No. 100A (Aug. 1981). The action of the House of Delegates adopting the report is at 106 ABA Reports 884 (1981). More specifically, the ABA House of Delegates has adopted a policy position "[u]rging that Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) be interpreted to require that a complaint alleging a conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act must allege facts constituting more than mere parallel conduct and ordinary business behavior." ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Report and Recommendation to the House of Delegates, Report No. 307 (Aug. 2006). The action of the House of Delegates adopting the report is at Daily Journal of the ABA House of Delegates (Aug. 8, 2006), p. 28 (available at http://;www.abanet.org/leadership/2006/annual/home.html).unless "there is no set of facts that would permit a plaintiff to demonstrate that the particular parallelism asserted was the product of collusion rather than coincidence."> Instead, the experience of the courts and lawyers resolving antitrust dis' putes counsels that to survive a motion to dismiss, a Section 1 Sherman Act complaint must allege facts that provide a reasonable basis to believe that there is an agreement. Mere parallel conduct and invocation of the words "agreement" or "conspiracy" do not suffice as parallel conduct alone does not provide a reasonable basis to believe there is an agreement. Indeed, parallel but independent conduct is expected in a perfectly competitive market.The standard articulated by the Second Circuit would impose sizeable costs on defendants and courts in situations in which there is no apparent reason to conclude that unlawful activity occurred. In addition, the risk of actions based solely on parallel conduct would impede businesses from operating in the most efficient manner by raising the cost and risk of unilateral conduct, and ironically would undermine procompetitive decisions that parallel those of competitors. Moreover, as lawyers we see the need for rules of law that can be understood and applied by persons running a business. Without clear rules that differentiate between legal and illegal conduct, lawyers face difficulty adequately responding to clients seeking advice on how to operate in the marketplace. Nor is the permissive standard stated by the Second Circuit5 The Second Circuit stated: "The pleaded factual predicate must include conspiracy in the realm of `plausible' possibilities in order to survive a motion to dismiss. Nagler suggests that a pleading of facts indicating parallel conduct by the defendants can suffice to. state a plausible claim of conspiracy .... Thus, to rule that allegations of parallel anticompetitive conduct fail to support a plausible conspiracy claim, a court would have to conclude that there is no set of facts that would permit a plaintiff to demonstrate that the particular parallelism asserted was the product of . collusion rather than coincidence." See Pet. App. at 25a (citation omitted).4necessary to ensure that meritorious claims proceed beyond the pleading stage. To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the antitrust laws and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a Section 1 Sherman Act complaint to allege something more than parallel conduct
Indefinite executive detention poses one of the gravest dangers to a society that has historically valued the principles of due process and the rule of law. This Court must now decide whether the petitioner may be subjected to indefinite administrative detention, regardless of how long he has lived in the United States, or how deep his ties are to this country, based on the determination that he is "inadmissible" under the immigration statutes.The government's contention that petitioner's potentially lifelong confinement poses "no due process problem," Brief for the Respondent on Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 16, rests on its interpretation of a single decision of | this Court over a half-century ago, in a case that posed distinct national security concerns. In Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206 (1953), the Court upheld a noncitizen's indefinite detention at Ellis Island when no country would accept him following his exclusion without a hearing upon returning from an unauthorized nineteen-month trip behind the Iron Curtain. Under the government's interpretation of Mezei, however, any noncitizen denied admission under the immigration laws necessarily lacks "any [constitutional] right against continued immigration custody, even if such detention is indefinite and prolonged." Brief for Appellee to the Eleventh Circuit at 1920 (emphasis added); id. at 22 (under Mezei, an inadmissible noncitizen has "no liberty interest" in remaining free of potentially lifelong confinement).In claiming that Mezei is dispositive here, the government fails to apply the reasoning and force of this Court's recent4decision in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001). In Zadvydas, the Court certainly noted that the long-standing distinction between noncitizens who have entered the UnitedStatesMezei.and those533 U.S.who have not "made all theat 693. Zadvydas, however,difference" inqualified andlimited Mezei by analytically separating a noncitizen's dueprocess right to be free from indefinite administrativedetention from his right to live in the United States under theimmigration statutes. Jd. at 695-96; see also id. at 703(Scalia, J., dissenting) (Zadvydas petitioners claimed their right to be free from indefinite detention though theyconceded that they "had no legal right to be here''); id. at 716(Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("The majority's rule is not limitedto aliens once lawfully admitted."). None of the cornerstonedue process protections against indefinite detention relied onby the Zadvydas Court turn on a person's noncitizen status,let .alene on statutory distinctions between the formerimmigration law categories of "deportation" and "exclusion"(now, together, known as "removal'"). Jd. at 690-92. Thus,although the petitioners in Zadvydas had lost the right toremain in the United States, their indefinite administrativedetention pending removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6) raised -such "a serious constitutional problem," id. at 690, that theCourt imposed a reasonable time limit on-this detention. Id.at 701. The petitioner in this matter is detained under thesame overly broad statute which suffers from substantially thesame procedural shortcomings. Under the framework setforth in Zadvydas, petitioner's "inadmissibility" for immigra-tion purposes does not, then, place his continued detentionentirely beyond the reach of the Due Process Clause.As the government essentially acknowledges, this Court has never explicitly interpreted Mezei to sanction the indefinite detention of an inadmissible noncitizen pending removal from the United States. Brief for Appellee to the5Eleventh Circuit at 40.* To consistently cited Mezei for undisputed--propositions that powers to establish the criteriathe contrary, the Court has the more limited--and hereCongress possesses broad for admissiotno the country,see, .g., Fiallo v. noncitizens facingBell, 430 deportationU.S. have787, 792 (1977), traditionally beenand that entitledto greater exclusion.constitutional protections than those facing See, e.g., Sale v. Haitian Ctrs. Council, Inc., 509U.S. 155, 175 (1993); Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185,187 (1958).For the following reasons, Mezei should not now be extended beyond its specific factual and historical context to sanction the petitioner's indefinite administrative detention.in1. Mezei failed to consider a stating that for noncitizenshalf-century of jurisprudence deemed inadmissible by theUnited States, due process is limited to whatever Congressdeems it to be. Mezei, 345 U.S. at 212. After this Court'sdecision in Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86 (1903), firstestablished that noncitizens facing removal were entitled todue process, courts required some due process protectionseven in exclusion cases. Indeed, the distinction betweendeportation and exclusion had never been the absolute,bright-line rule described in Mezei or in United States ex rel.Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537 (1950), another nationalsecurity exclusion case decided three years earlier. Mezei,moreover, failed-te consider the right of noncitizens to be freefrom wellpunishment as the needwithout to imposethe protections of due process, as limits on administrative detentionpending removal from the country. As Justice Jacksonpointed out in his powerful dissent, joined by Justice"When a constitutional challenge to the detention of unadmitted noncitizens was last before this Court, the case was instead decided on nonconstitutional grounds. Jean v. Nelson, 472 U.S. 846 (1985) (equal protection challenge to policy of detention without parole for noncitizens seeking admission that discriminated on basis of race and national origin).6Frankfurter, Mezei's overly broad sweep contravened hundreds of years of Anglo-American jurisprudence protecting against indefinite executive detention. 345 U.S. at 218-19 (Jackson, J., dissenting).2. Although the Court did not need to address this issue in Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 694, its analysis there makes clear that Mezei has been eroded by the Court's subsequent substantive and procedural due process jurisprudence. With respect to substantive due process, this Court has increasingly recognized the punitive consequences of indefinite regulatory detention. It has accordingly authorized such detention only in limited circumstances pursuant to a carefully defined scheme. As to procedural due process, this Court has abandoned the notion that any infringement on an individ- | ual's constitutional interests requires all the protections of a . criminal trial, in favor of a flexible balancing test which evaluates the procedures provided by the government in light of the particular circumstances. The test considers the strengths of both the individual's liberty interest and the government's interest in efficient procedures. In the immigration context, this jurisprudence has prompted the Court to reject the notion that the so-called "entry fiction" is of constitutional significance. E.g., Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21 (1982). The flexibility of procedural due process now permits a conclusion that, while individuals standing at the border may possess a protected liberty interest in avoiding indefinite imprisonment, their status as inadmissible noncitizens, along with the government's interest in national security in a given case, are relevant to determining precisely what process is due.3. Mezei, however, need not be overruled in order for petitioner to prevail, but only limited to its historical and factual context. Mezei, properly understood, demonstrates that the political branches possess broad powers in regulating immigration to the country, particularly in the specific instance of a national security case (a situation not presented7 here), and not that a noncitizen's potentially lifelong administrative detention remains outside the Due Process Clause because he has been formally deemed inadmissible, even if he has lived here for many years
The ABA submits that this Court, consistent withits prior precedents, should decide this caseincrementally by holding that petitioners' patentclaim does not define a "process" under 35 U.S.C. §101 because Section 101 does not authorize theissuance of patents on "abstract ideas."E.g.,Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 309 (1980).The Court should apply its approach of exclusion andconclude that petitioners' claim is a type of claim thatis noi encompassed by the statute. Petitioners' claimis not patent-eligible because it recites nothing morethan an abstract idea: a mental process that iscentral, not ancillary, to the claim.This case does not require this Court to make broad pronouncements of new legal principles regarding the scope of permissible "business method patents." Moreover, this Court's ruling has thepolicymaking body. See ABA General Information, available at http://www. abanet.org/leadership/delegathetsml.. Recommendations that are adopted by the HOD become ABA policy, while reports that accompany recommendations are only instructive as to considerations that were before the HOD when a recommendation was presented for adoption as policy.4potential to significantly narrow the scope of patentable inventions, including with respect to fields that are now only barely known or that are in fact entirely undiscovered. These factors, in the ABA's view, counsel in favor of incremental decision-making that does not inadvertently pre-empt the patentability of later fields of invention.The Federal Circuit did not follow this Court's precedents, which seek to identify what is excluded from patentability under Section 101. Rather, the court of appeals announced a fixed and specific definition, applicable across all categories of inventions, which risks excluding those yet-to-be discovered technologies that are deserving of patent protection. Accordingly, the Federal Circuit's rigid "machine-or-transformation test" should be rejected
This Court has recognized that American Bar Association standards are valuable measures of prevailing professional norms of effective representation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. A lawyer's duties under the ABA ethical standards include providing competent representation to a client and communicating with the client concerning matters of significance to the client. These duties are particularly important when a criminal defendant is considering entering into an agreement to plead guilty. As elaborated in the ABA criminal justice standards, the lawyer's duties at the plea stage include promptly informing the client of all significant plea proposals made by the prosecutor, and fully explaining the choices available to the client after conducting an investigation and analysis of all pertinent issues of fact and law. When defense counsel fails to convey a plea offer to the client, or gives the client considering a guilty plea materially inaccurate advice about the charges and the burden of proof, defense counsel's performance falls below the established standard of reasonableness.Where the accused has assistance of counselbeen denied the effective because of deficientrepresentation in thetrial does not remedyplea process, a subsequent fairthe initial constitutional error.In those rare cases where a defendant loses the benefitof an advantageous plea because of constitutionallyineffective counsel, the court should have discretion tofashion a remedy that will place the defendant insofar5 as possible in the position he or she would have been in had the right to effective assistance not been violated. The fact that nearly 95% of criminal convictions now result from guilty pleas makes it all the more important that defendants considering aguilty plea should have competent counsel. In some cases, the circumstances will dictate that the appropriate remedy for a constitutional violation is to vacate the conviction and allow the government to reprosecute the case. In this event, the government may choose to reopen plea negotiations. In other cases, including where re-prosecution is not feasible, the appropriate remedy may be to afford the defendant the benefit of the offer lost through constitutionally deficient counsel
 The ADA is a proper exercise of Congress' enforcement power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to take remedial and prophylactic action to combat discrimination on the basis of disability. Unlike the age classification analyzed in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, ___ U.S. __, 120 S. Ct. 631 (2000), the ADA is based on a record documenting that states have made many distinctions on the basis of disability that have been both invidious and irrational. While the states have played a complex role in providing care for individuals with disabilities, giving rise to the level of deference accorded by this Court in City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), this history should not be mistaken for an absence of state discrimination.

This is now the second time the CCA has upheld Moore's death sentence in contravention of this4 The ABA has established a Rule of Law Initiative that works, particularly in developing countries, to "promote justice, economic opportunity and human dignity through the rule of law." ABA, Rule of Law Initiative Program Book 4 (2016). No practice is more vital to preserving the rule of law ­ and ensuring that the ABA's promotion of that rule is legitimized in the eyes of developing countries ­ than the following by lower courts of binding precedent of this Court.6Court's decision in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), which held that the Eighth Amendment categorically prohibits the execution of intellectually disabled persons. The CCA previously rejected the state trial court's recommended finding that Moore is intellectually disabled by relying on an outdated, nonclinical standard first articulated in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (Briseno) to uphold Moore's death sentence. See Ex parte Moore, 470 S.W.3d 481 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015). This Court vacated and remanded that decision as incompatible with Eighth Amendment standards for determining intellectual disability. Moore v. Texas, 137 S. Ct. 1039, 1044, 1053 (2017) (Moore I).This Court has recognized three prongs of the intellectual disability inquiry: (i) "significantly subaverage intellectual functioning"; (ii) "deficits in adaptive functioning"; and (iii) "onset of these deficits during the developmental period." Hall v. Florida, 572 U.S. 701, 710 (2014); see also Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1045. In Briseno, the CCA established a framework for assessing intellectual disability. But rather than relying on clinical criteria to make this determination, the CCA instead created its own approach ­ thereafter known as the "Briseno factors" ­ for assessing whether an individual shows deficits in adaptive behavior. Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 6; see Moore I, 137 S. Ct. at 1044, 1046­1047.In 2017, after granting certiorari to review the CCA's 2015 decision, this Court unanimously recognized that the Briseno factors lack any clinical foundation or support and serve only to perpetuate lay stereotypes about intellectual disabilities. See Moore7I, 137 S. Ct. at 1046, 1051­1052; id. at 1053, 1060 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). As the Court explained, the Briseno factors, both "[b]y design and in operation," "`creat[e] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed.'" Id. at 1051 (second set of brackets in original) (quoting Hall, 572 U.S. at 704). The Court thus held that the CCA's use of the Briseno framework to determine if Moore is intellectually disabled violates the Eighth Amendment's protection against cruel and unusual punishment. See id. at 1044, 1053. The dissent in Moore I similarly agreed that the Briseno factors are "incompatible with the Eighth Amendment." Id. at 1060 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). This Court then remanded the case for proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. Id. at 1053.The CCA did not follow this Court's mandate. Notwithstanding this Court's rejection of the Briseno framework, and in the face of the Texas state prosecutor's concession on remand that Moore is intellectually disabled, the CCA resurrected Briseno under the guise of a new standard for intellectual disability. See Ex parte Moore, 548 S.W.3d 552 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018). Although the CCA purported to adopt a new standard for assessing intellectual disability, its most recent decision, in substance, "repeats the same errors as in its original opinion in this case" and "continues to apply a standard that fails to adequately incorporate current medical standards in conflict with the Supreme Court's holding in Moore [I]." Id. at 585, 590 (Alcala, J., dissenting). Like its opinion struck down by this Court in Moore I, the CCA's decision on remand relies on lay stereotypes, overemphasizes adaptive strengths, looks to behavior8while incarcerated, and imposes the same onerous requirement that a defendant prove that his intellectual and adaptive deficits are related. In many instances, the CCA's most recent opinion restates the precise language of the Briseno factors, while omitting only the Briseno case name. Such a result cannot stand in light of this Court's prior disposition of these same issues in Moore I.Not only does the CCA's decision fail to comport with the Eighth Amendment's guarantees, it raises broader constitutional concerns. The CCA's failure to heed this Court's mandate undermines the rule of law and the supremacy of this Court, both of which are at the core of this country's founding principles.The ABA urges this Court to remedy the CCA's constitutional errors and safeguard the rule of law by granting the petition for a writ of certiorari and summarily reversing the CCA's decision
The Petitioner has asked the Court to consider two questions, and the ABA urges the Court to hear them both. Each error is worthy of review and the workproduct doctrine will be seriously undermined if either is left unaddressed. While circuit splits are often permitted to percolate in an effort to allow the law to develop, granting certiorari is appropriate now because the consequences of these splits are particularly grave and will be immediately and broadly felt if not addressed as soon as possible.In representing a client, a lawyer has an obligation to render fully-informed advice -- advice that incorporates more than purely legal analysis. As Rule 2.1 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct (adopted by 49 of the 50 states) instructs, such advice will often lead a lawyer to consider moral, economic, social, and political factors. The consideration of those factors° See http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/directories /policy/2005_am_111.authcheckdam.pdf (last visited Dec. 1, 2015).D does not automatically render such advice "fact" work product, as the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's decision held. In so holding, the Court created a direct conflict with the approach taken by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, particularly when a lawyer orders analysis incorporating one or more of these factors in order to provide legal advice. Guidance such as is at issue here has been understood by courts -- as the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had explained in United States v. Adiman, 134 F.3d 1194 (2d Cir. 1988) -- to be opinion work product, and thus highly insulated from discovery. By denigrating the analysis provided at the direction of counsel as merely "factual," the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit eroded the protection of attorney work product.The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit then escalated the problem by writing out one of the criteria in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that would otherwise protect those materials from disclosure, holding that discovery of that analysis could be had without even a showing of heightened relevance to satisfy the test of substantial need. In this regard, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit created a conflict with the approach taken by the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, sixth, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits. Taken together, the decision eviscerates any protection the analysis should otherwise be afforded.The decision is also likely to have widespread impact on attorney-client relationships and work product beyond the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Clients of all kinds -- plaintiffs and defendants, individuals and organizations -- receive advice in anticipation of, or as part of, litigation. At6 the time the advice is rendered, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to predict where a lawsuit will be brought. As a consequence, in many instances rational lawyers must advise their clients in light of the least-protective jurisdiction, which now is the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The need for lawyers to protect their clients by undertaking only what will satisfy the requirements of the least-protective jurisdiction creates an indelible pressure that threatens to undermine the policies of those jurisdictions that have consistently encouraged lawyers to develop both legal and non-legal information to use in providing counsel to a client that anticipates or is embroiled in litigation. As a result, this decision will not just conflict with but supplant the current law that permits lawyers to develop or solicit information to use in counseling clients.The ABA approaches this petition for certiorari from some fundamental principles. First, the ABA's primary mission is to ensure that American lawyers deliver clients the most effective services possible within the parameters set by the profession's ethical requirements. The narrow view of the scope of opinion work product that was taken by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a view that directly conflicts with the approach taken by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Adlman, undermines a lawyer's ability to provide competent representation and threatens the foundations of the attorney-client relationship: candor, confidentiality, and zealous representation. Left to stand, the decision will chill lawyers from investigation and acquisition of the information needed to provide wise counsel under ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1 and 2.1. This outcome is particularly problematic in today's7 increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment, where purely "legal" analysis and advice is often not sufficient to enable a client to make informed and strategic decisions.Second, the ABA has promulgated -- and the courts of America have adopted -- strict standards for lawyer confidentiality, standards that impose upon lawyers a solemn obligation to maintain as confidential all that is learned from clients within the framework of candor to the tribunal and the other obligations lawyers have as officers of the court. It is critical that the contours of the attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine safeguard the attorney-client relationship, whether or not one of the parties is a government entity.And yet the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is in conflict with the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits, would enable "government" -- to whatever entities courts ultimately determine that characterization to apply -- to claim a right to work product merely by self-identifying an inconvenience in replicating relevant information, a standard that essentially writes out of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3) the requirement that a party demonstrate "substantial need."Ultimately, the cost of these two changes in the law of work product protection will be borne not by the legal profession but by the clients. As the highest court in the land, with authority over all other federal courts and those who practice before them, it is important for this Court to take this case now.8
In 1963, at the height of the Cold War, the United States signed the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77 ("Vienna Convention" or "Convention"). Article 36 of the Convention guarantees to all United States citizens abroad and to foreign nationals in this country that if they are arrested outside their home country: (1) law enforcement officials will tell them without delay that they may have their nation's consul informed of their arrest, and (2) if they consent to notification, the law enforcement entity will promptly advise the consul of their arrest. The United States played a leading role in negotiating the wording of Article 36. See Report of the United States Delegation to the Vienna Conference on Consular Relations, reprinted in Sen. Exec. E, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., May 8, 1969, at 41, 59-61. To ensure the faithful and consistent application of these important protections, the United States also proposed and advocated for the dispute settlement provision that became the companion Optional Protocol. Id. at 72-73. The Optional Protocol provides for compulsory jurisdiction by the International Court of Justice ("ICJ") over all signatory nations to resolve any disputes concerning the interpretation of the Convention's provisions. See Optional Protocol, 21 U.S.T. 325, art. I.5Once the Vienna Convention and Optional Protocol were ratified by the Senate, they became binding on the United States as a whole and, under the Supremacy Clause, preemptive of any conflicting state laws. Nevertheless, when Virginia law enforcement officers arrested Mr. Bustillo, a Honduran national, they did not inform him of his right to consular notification. Pet. for Cert. at 3. Mr. Bustillo was therefore unable to take advantage of the valuable assistance that consular officers can provide to defendants charged with serious crimes. For example, consular officers will often visit the foreign national soon after he is detained, provide a list of qualified local attorneys, and relay requests for material aid to family members in the home country. See id. (noting a declaration submitted by the Honduran consulate detailing the assistance it would have rendered); see also United States Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Assistance to U.S. Citizens Arrested Abroad, available at http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/emergencies/emergencies_ 1199.html. In addition, consular officers may help navigate local bureaucracies, explain the local legal system and its requirements, and provide support during trial proceedings by attending court sessions. See Assistance to U.S. Citizens Arrested Abroad.Virginia's failure to alert Mr. Bustillo of his right to consular assistance or to notify the Honduran consulate directly of Mr. Bustillo's arrest had particularly dire consequences for Mr. Bustillo's case. Mr. Bustillo was charged with the first-degree murder of James Merry. Mr. Bustillo's defense was that the murder was perpetrated by a man nicknamed "Sirena"--now known to be Julio Osorto. See Pet. for Cert. at 2. Sirena, who like Mr. Bustillo is a Honduran national, fled the United States for Honduras the day after Mr. Merry died. Id. Mr. Bustillo's counsel could obtain only limited information about Sirena and his whereabouts by the time of trial, which allowed the prosecution to attack the credibility of Mr. Bustillo's defense. Id.6If Virginia had carried out the consular notification requirements of Article 36, the Honduran Consulate could have provided the critical information about Sirena that Mr. Bustillo's defense counsel was unable to obtain. See id. at 3 (describing the information the Honduran Consulate could have provided had it been notified of Mr. Bustillo's detention). Without access to this information Mr. Bustillo could provide only a silhouette of Sirena to the jury, which allowed the prosecution to impeach Mr. Bustillo's account of the crime in a manner that would not have been possible had Virginia law enforcement officials carried out their federal obligation to inform the Honduran Consulate of Mr. Bustillo's detention.The United States admits that Mr. Bustillo's Article 36 rights were violated and it has apologized to Honduras for the violation. Id. Nevertheless, Virginia's courts provided no remedy for the violation and declined even to consider the substantive issue of whether Mr. Bustillo's trial was actually prejudiced by the federal violation. Instead, the courts disposed of Mr. Bustillo's state habeas petition on the grounds that Mr. Bustillo had procedurally defaulted his Vienna Convention claim by failing to raise it in the first instance. Id. This approach defies the ICJ's express interpretation of Article 36, which forbids procedural default rules from being employed to bar substantive consideration and enforcement of the Vienna Convention. That interpretation is the definitive interpretation of the treaty under the Optional Protocol. On two occasions the ICJ has held that invoking procedural default doctrines to dispose of Article 36 claims is itself a violation of the Vienna Convention. See Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U.S.), 2004 I.C.J. 12 (March 31) ("Avena") ¶¶ 112-13; LaGrand Case (F.R.G. v. U.S.), 2001 I.C.J. 466 (June 27) ("LaGrand"). In Avena, the ICJ also held that, despite typical procedural default rules, United States courts must provide review and reconsideration of the7convictions and sentences tainted by the violations it had found.4Although the Executive Branch has since unilaterally announced that the United States was withdrawing from the Optional Protocol, the ICJ entered judgment in the Avena and LaGrand decisions while the United States was still a party to the Optional Protocol. The United States' willing submission to the jurisdiction of the ICJ to interpret the Vienna Convention means that the principles identified in Avena and LaGrand are entitled to deference in defining the mutual obligations of the United States as a continuing party to the Vienna Convention. While a withdrawal from the Optional Protocol might allow the United States to implement its own interpretation of the Vienna Convention when future issues arise, it would severely undermine our domestic and international commitment to the rule of law and endanger Americans arrested abroad to decline to submit to an ICJ interpretation after pledging to do so.Moreover, adhering to the ICJ's interpretation of Article 36 in state habeas cases like Mr. Bustillo's would avoid undue delay and expense in assuring enforcement of rights under4. The Avena Judgment built on and strengthened the ICJ's earlier judgment in the LaGrand Case, a case brought by Germany against the United States also alleging violations of the Vienna Convention. (F.R.G. v. U.S.), 2001 I.C.J. 466 (June 27) ("LaGrand"). Unlike in Avena, by the time the ICJ ruled in LaGrand, both of the German nationals in question had been executed. The ICJ held in LaGrand that: (1) Article 36 of the Vienna Convention provides "individual rights" to foreign nationals; (2) applying procedural default rules to prevent detained individuals from challenging their convictions and sentences on the ground that their rights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention had been violated itself violated the Vienna Convention; and (3) if the United States failed to comply with Article 36 in future cases involving German nationals subjected to severe penalties, it must "allow the review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence by taking account of the violation of the rights set forth in the Convention." LaGrand, ¶¶ 77, 90-91, 125.8the Vienna Convention. This approach would also spare the federal courts from having to wade into murky questions of reconciling the ICJ's admonishment not to utilize procedural default doctrines with the deferential standards that federal courts traditionally apply to state procedural rules in habeas proceedings. See Medellin v. Dretke, 125 S. Ct. 2088 (2005) (per curiam opinion accompanying order dismissing writ as improvidently granted). Unlike the limits on federal habeas jurisdiction imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ("AEDPA"), which as an act of Congress is "on a full parity" with a treaty, Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 18 (1957) (plurality opinion), state procedural default rules are not the "supreme Law of the Land." U.S. Const. art. VI. State courts have a constitutional obligation to enforce federal law rather than state law to the extent the two conflict--and state procedural rules are no exception. Given the concerns expressed by this Court in Medellin about squaring the decisions in LaGrand and Avena with the demands of AEDPA, limiting the use of procedural bars in state collateral proceedings may be the only viable means of ensuring that the consular notification provisions of Article 36 will be given their full effect.This Court has acknowledged that claims that are analogous to the failure to notify a consulate, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, can so infect direct proceedings that they are better suited to collateral review. See Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 504 (2003). Thus, implementing the LaGrand and Avena decisions by precluding the use of judicially created procedural bars in state collateral proceedings will channel consular notification claims to the most appropriate forum for resolution.Enforcing federal obligations under the Vienna Convention in state post-conviction proceedings will not unduly encroach on state courts. As an initial matter, adopting a rule forbidding the use of procedural bars for consular notification claims will lead to increased compliance with the Vienna Convention. This compliance by local law enforcement will keep Article 36 claims9out of court in the first instance. It is also likely that criminal defendants will have to show prejudice from the consular notification defect to obtain some form of collateral relief. Because not all defendants will be able to make this showing, the obligations of the United States to its treaty partners may be satisfied with minimal administrative burden in many cases

The text of the INA, and the legal andhistorical backdrop against which it. was drafted, demon-strate that it does not.As a matter of textual construction (and historical fact),IIRIRA cannot. be properly read to eliminate traditionalhabeas inquiry of final removal orders. When Congressenacted IIRIRA -- which does closing habeas inquiry -- it wasnot expressly presumptivelyrefer to foreaware of thisCourt's two well-established principles of construction re-garding restrictions on habeas jurisdiction. First, congres-sional repeal of habeas jurisdiction must be explicit, may not be accomplished by implication. Second, thereand is afundamental cial "review"distinction between legislation that curbs of executive actions and legislation thatjudipur-ports to limit the constitutionally protected habeas inquiryinto executive tected againstdetention. The impairment bylatter is more: Congress. Thisvigorously prohabeas inquiryencompasses examination bases for questioning theof all statutory lawfulness of aor constitutional removal decision.Reading validity ofthe INA to preclude removal decisions is nothabeas inquiry only incorrect asinto the a matter2of statutory construction, but also it would offend Article I, section 9, Clause 2 of the Constitution. Habeas relief topersons seeking federal court inquiry into final removal orders has been guaranteed by the Constitution and by this Court's precedents. Accordingly, where, as here, a construction exists that does not require the Court to render an act ofCongress unconstitutional, sound rules of judicial restraintrequire adopting that reasonable construction. To demonstrate the historical basis for principles requir-ing habeas inquiry, section I] traces an unbroken line of cases dating back to the beginning of federal immigration regulation in which this Court has made clear that the constitutional right to a judicial forum for habeas inquiry is available to aliens challenging orders of deportation. Section II then describes how, although the scope of the right is not fully settled in every respect, "it clearly encompasses" challenges to the Attorney General's construction of a statute resulting in a final order of deportation.Applying these established background norms and principles of construction, section III demonstrates that the Government's interpretation of IIRIRA cannot stand. Provisions of IERIRA that refer only to a restriction of "review" without reference to habeas corpus inquiry are properly interpreted either as not impairing habeas jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, or as requiring at least the level of scrutiny that existed under the pre-1952 legal regime. Whether the Court applies the text of 28 U.S.C. § 2241, or at least the level of habeas inquiry mandated by the Constitution under the pre-1952 habeas regime, Petitioners are entitled to a judicial determination of claims challenging the lawfulness of their final removal orders in either the district courts or the courts of appeal.Finally, although Amicus urges the Court to read the statute appropriately, and thereby to avoid unnecessarily reaching this constitutional question, Amicus notes that the3construction endorsed by the Government would violate the constitutional right to habeas review, and- would be beyond the authority of Congress
17. The requirements imposed on State Parties by the Convention are rigorous and interconnected, designed not simply to sketch out theoretical or "paper" rights, but to provide for the effective protection and enforcement of human rights in the real world. Thus, where, as here, grave violations of the Convention are alleged, the fundamental duty of the State to guarantee the rights of its citizens enshrined in Article 1(1) of the Convention not only imposes on State Parties an affirmative duty to investigate, but requires, as this Court has previously said, that any such investigation must be "carried out by all available means with the aim of determining the truth and the investigation,24ABA Policy 8c (adopted February 1990), "Supporting efforts of lawyers/judges in Colombia", available on http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/directories/policy/1990_my_8c.authcheckdam.pdf. (last visited August 7, 2013). 25 Second Report on the Situation of the Human Rights Defenders in the Americas, Inter-Am. Comm'n H.R., OEA/ser.L/V/II. Doc 66, para. 398 (2011): "During the follow up period there have also been continued death threats against the judicial authorities to induce them to favor one of the parties in a proceeding or to cease investigating some crime. The information available to the IACHR indicates that in Colombia there have been reports of 750 cases of threats against judicial authorities in the last four years". 26 See Abogados Sin Frontera de Francia, Informe 2011: La Situación de Derechos Humanos de Abogadas y Abogados en Colombia; Letter of the Comité Ejecutivo de la Abogacía Colombiana to ABA President (August 21, 2013).9pursuit, capture, prosecution, and punishment of the masterminds and perpetrators of the facts, particularly when state agents are or may be involved".27 As Articles 8(1) and 25(1) of the Convention also recognize, the effective protection and enforcement of human rights in practice necessarily require the existence of an independent and impartial judiciary, an effective access to the courts, and the availability of timely and effective remedies. The full realization of each of these rights is essential to the rule of law. But these rights cannot be given effect if, as here, magistrates are killed, and the judges charged with investigating those killings are so seriously threatened that they genuinely fear for their own lives or those of their children. The rule of law cannot exist where judges, to protect themselves and their families, must choose between exile and death. The allegations in this case, if proved, demonstrate violations of each of these guarantees that cumulatively threaten the rule of law itself.4.
Well-established standards of professional conduct, recognized in this Court's jurisprudence, require that counsel conduct an independent and adequate investigation of the facts at each stage of a case. The unusually high stakes and complex requirements of capital habeas litigation make such investigations particularly essential in federal habeas proceedings ­ never more so than when petitioner's claim is that prior counsel conducted an inadequate investigation. Importantly, this Court has recognized, and professional standards make clear, that counsel must conduct an adequate investigation prior to making ultimate strategic determinations about which claims to present and how. The life-or-death importance of investigation in capital habeas litigation is starkly illustrated by the numerous cases in which habeas petitioners with meritorious claims initially failed to obtain relief based on the inadequacy of resources to investigate those claims.This Court also has recognized, and professional standards support, the judgment Congress made in 18 U.S.C. § 3599(f): to ensure that federal habeas serves its rights-protecting function and that the statutory guarantee of counsel in those proceedings is meaningful, petitioners are entitled to "reasonably necessary" services to support their representation. This statutory authorization of funding is essential because federal habeas counsel generally lacks the expertise, and frequently lacks the time, to carry out all tasks necessary for an investigation. Professional standards generally recommend that counsel secure5the services of investigators, mitigation specialists, and other experts as needed to ensure effective representation.Despite the importance of investigation in federal habeas and the clear need for reasonably necessary services to accomplish its aims, the Fifth Circuit has imposed a restrictive and circular "substantial need" rule that threatens effective representation in this crucial stage of capital litigation. As propounded by the Fifth Circuit, including in this case, the "substantial need" rule effectively requires counsel to establish a viable claim on the merits before the Circuit will authorize the funding needed to investigate the merits. If permitted to stand, the Fifth Circuit's approach will make it extraordinarily difficult or impossible for counsel representing federal habeas petitioners to meet their professional responsibilities and will jeopardize the ability of federal habeas litigation to ensure the integrity, fairness, and reliability of capital convictions and sentences
"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."U.S. CONST. art. I, § 9, cl. 2 (emphasis added).Shielding the removal process for noncitizens within the United States from meaningful judicial review contravenes fundamental principles of ourtopics, including access to justice, judicial reform, detentionprocedures, and prosecutorial reform.

The ABA, as the nation's leading legal organization and a longtime advocate of the foundational importance of judicial review, believes that it is critical that the Court grant certiorari. Until the Third Circuit's decision, no individual found on U.S. soil has been deemed outside the protections of the Suspension Clause absent a formal suspension of the habeas writ. Such a sea change in the law should not escape this Court's review.Petitioners, 28 Central American mothers and their 33 children, were arrested in Texas, placed into summary "expedited removal" proceedings, found to have no credible fears of persecution, and ordered removed from the country. Each family properly filed individual habeas petitions in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the procedures set forth in the Immigration and Nationality Act to challenge the removal order. Asylum seekers in expedited removal proceedings do not receive full immigration hearings, administrative review by the Board of Immigration Appeals, or direct judicial review in the courts of appeals. Yet the Third Circuit held that the expedited removal statute barred any review of Petitioners' claims--including habeas review--and that Petitioners were not even entitled to invoke the Suspension Clause to challenge the preclusion of judicial review.The Third Circuit's startling conclusion that Petitioners fall entirely outside the Suspension Clause's protections cannot be reconciled with this Court's precedent, which has repeatedly affirmed the availability of judicial review in immigration cases, including where the government seeks to remove a6noncitizen who has entered the country. See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 300-301 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 235 (1953)) The only situation in which Congress can suspend the constitutionally protected writ of habeas corpus is in "Cases of Invasion or Rebellion"--an exception obviously not applicable here.While Congress enjoys broad powers to regulate immigration, those powers cannot be construed to override fundamental structural and individual constitutional protections. Because the Third Circuit's opinion signals a stark retreat from the core protection of habeas corpus for individuals within the borders of the United States, this Court should grant review
 Reliance on pro bono representation is not a substitute for an adequately funded defense, especially in capital habeas corpus proceedings which require full investigation of the relevant facts and law and may be exceptionally complex. Recognizing this principle, federal law grants indigent petitioners in capital cases a right to appointed counsel in federal habeas corpus proceedings. Yet federal courts too often fail to grant the funding necessary for these attorneys to provide effective representation. Instead, courts increasingly seek to mandate pro bono representation in capital cases, either outright or by failing to fully fund the defense. The ABA is a strong and longstanding advocate of pro bono representation, and encourages attorneys to provide at least 50 hours of such services per year. See ABA Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 6.1. But pro bono representation cannot be the norm for constitutionally or statutorily mandated3counsel, and especially for the profound responsibility of representing an individual whose life is at stake. Adequate funding of the capital defense effort is necessary to ensure that indigent persons have access to quality legal services. Attempts to remedy inadequate funding in capital habeas cases with calls for pro bono service are not only inconsistent with the premise of state-provided counsel; they also are unworkable in practice.The United States Supreme Court reviewed this case in 2015 and remanded the case to federal district court with the instruction that the court should provide qualified, conflict-free defense counsel. Christeson v. Roper, 135 S. Ct. 891, 89395 (2015) (per curiam) (relying on Martel v. Clair, 132 S. Ct. 1276 (2012)). The district court subsequently appointed counsel but, rather than authorize appropriate funding provided by statute, invoked the legal profession's general commitment to provide pro bono service in order to justify granting only a small fraction of the necessary funding requested by counsel. The district court's refusal to grant adequate compensation frustrates the Supreme Court's intent to ensure Christeson's access to effective, conflict-free representation
On a proper construction of the Copyright Act, a copyright owner may prevent the importation into the United States of copies of copyrighted works made abroad, when no authorized first sale of those copies in the U.S. has occurred. The statute at issue in this case, 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) ­ which codifies the principle known as the "first sale" or "exhaustion" doctrine ­ applies to "the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title" (emphasis added). Qualifying copies exhaust the4 ABA Report with Recommendation #109 (Policy adopted Feb. 2010), available at http://www.abanow.org/house-of-delegatesresolutions-2010-midyear-meeting.4copyright owner's exclusive right to control the importation of those copies into the United States.The Ninth Circuit in this case correctly interpreted Section 109(a) in concluding that copies made abroad ­ and thus "lawfully made `under the law of some other country'" ­ are not copies lawfully made "under [Title 17]." Omega S.A. v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 541 F.3d 982, 988 (9th Cir. 2008). Put simply, copies made abroad are not "made under" U.S. law at all. The ruling below is consistent with this Court's guidance in Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L'Anza Research Int'l, Inc., 523 U.S. 135 (1998), that, as between an American and a British publisher of a work copyrighted in the United States, "presumably only those made by the publisher of the United States edition would be `lawfully made under this title' within the meaning of § 109(a)." Id. at 148.Interpreting the first sale doctrine of Section 109(a) instead to permit the importation of copies of works produced and sold outside of the United States over the objection of the copyright owner would render the right to control importation in Section 602(a) largely superfluous. It would moreover invite the adoption of costly and complicated contractual arrangements that have no purpose or effect other than to preserve the copyright owner's exclusive right to control distribution into the United States.The Ninth Circuit's judgment accordingly should be affirmed.55 The ABA takes no position on the view of the Ninth Circuit that an authorized first sale in the United States of a copy made abroad would exhaust the copyright owner's right to control
The New Jersey Supreme Court, having found that Boy Scouts of America ("BSA") is a "public accommodation" under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination ("LAD"), properly applied the principles of Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984), to determine that BSA cannot bar individuals from membership on the basis of sexual orientation.In Roberts, this Court fashioned an effective and comprehensive framework for weighing the compelling government interest in eradicating discrimination against competing First Amendment claims asserted by private associations. The Roberts framework has enabled courts throughout the United States to protect First Amendment rights without jeopardizing the equally important efforts by the states and the federal government to combat the corrosive effects of discrimination.A key component of the Roberts framework requires a group claiming First Amendment immunity from generally applicable anti-discrimination laws to demonstrate that a protected First Amendment interest is seriously burdened by the law as applied. 468 U.S. at 626. Where the claim concerns the right of expressive association, a court must3identify the expressive purposes that bring the group together, assess whether application of the antidiscrimination law at issue imposes a serious burden on the association's expressive activity, and then determine whether any such burden is justified by a compelling state interest unrelated to the suppression of ideas. By taking a hard look at the bona fides of the First Amendment claim, the court is able to dispose of weak and pretextual assertions while preserving First Amendment values against genuine encroachment. Without such close scrutiny, efforts to combat invidious discrimination would be blocked by the group's talismanic incantation of First Amendment protection to shield its discriminatory practices.Here, the New Jersey Supreme Court properly applied the Roberts framework by first examining BSA's expressive message, and then determining that enforcing the LAD does not impose a serious burden on that message.Reversal of the careful decision below, which appropriately followed this Court's controlling precedents, would have serious and troubling consequences for efforts to combat discrimination of all kinds.4
The Due Process Clause of the Constitution places limits both on the Government's ability to detain individuals and on their period of detention. In enacting 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b) or 1226(c), Congress did not expressly provide any mechanism by which immigrants detained pursuant to these laws would be guaranteed protection against confinement for an excessive period. Likewise, Congress provided no express time period in which immigrants detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) would receive a timely bond hearing. To avoid the serious constitutional issues raised by these omissions, the ABA in its initial brief urged this Court to apply the canon of constitutional avoidance and interpret each statute in question as containing a reasonable time limit, by2which a neutral decision maker must provide an individualized hearing on flight risk and danger to a person detained pursuant to one of these three provisions. Were this Court not to rely on the canon, the ABA concludes that each of these statutes would violate the Due Process Clause as applied to the class members because the statutes otherwise permit prolonged, and potentially indefinite, detention without any individualized hearing on flight risk or danger.Although the ABA takes no position as to the precise time at which the Government must provide an individualized hearing on the grounds for an immigrant's detention, it has drawn upon its membership's experience to offer guidance regarding the procedural elements required to ensure a timely and adequate hearing that satisfies due process principles. Based on multiple studies by various task forces in a range of matters concerning detained individuals, the ABA has concluded that at least two elements are essential to ensuring due process. First, the Government must bear the duty to justify the basis for detention. Second, to ensure the Government's duty is carried out in a timely manner, some outer time limit must be established for an individualized proceeding. The ABA notes that the approach adopted by the Court of Appeals complies with both of these principles.Accordingly, and to ensure due process, the ABA urges that the Court direct the Government to provide an individualized administrative hearing within a fixed time period to determine whether the3immigrant's detention is justified based on flight risk or danger
This case presents the narrow question whether the mandatory detention of lawful permanent residents under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c), without an individualized determination of flight risk or dangerousness, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The sole relief Respondent Mr. Kim seeks is an individualized hearing in which he may demonstrate that his detention is not necessary to ensure his appearance at subsequent proceedings or to protect the community. Mr. Kim asserts only that due process entitles him to a demonstration that the Government has some particularized reason why depriving him of his liberty is necessary to secure the legitimate state interests the Government says it seeks. As this Court has recognized time and again, lawful permanent residents in this country enjoy the protection of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution: no "person" in this country may be deprived of physical liberty without due process of law. By denying lawful permanent residents a meaningful opportunity to be heard before detaining them for an unspecified period, Section 1226(c) deprives these individuals of a liberty interest that the Constitution presumes they retain.At the same time, this case does not require the Court to test the Government's power to detain those individuals who are found to pose a danger to the community or present a particular risk of flight. Mr. Kim has resided in the United States since he was a child. Petitioner's Brief ("Petr. Br."), 3. Under(Cont'd) the procedural safeguards that are the norm in the criminal justice context. The ABA estimates that more than 55% of immigration detainees are incarcerated in penal facilities while awaiting their immigration hearings.4the challenged statute, Mr. Kim may be subject to mandatory detention for committing an offense no more inherently "dangerous" than tax evasion or shoplifting. 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c); 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). Indeed, because what counts as a "conviction" or "term of imprisonment" is uniquely defined under the 1996 immigration law (for example, a "term of imprisonment" can include a suspended sentence), an immigrant like Mr. Kim who is mandatorily detained under Section 1226(c) may never previously have spent a day in jail. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48).3 Moreover, contrary to the Government's assertion, only a tiny fraction of immigrant "aggravated felons" like Mr. Kim released under the discretionary provision that preceded Section 1226(c) ever engaged in felony activity again. According to the INS Law Enforcement Support Center, of nearly 1200 potentially removable "aggravated felons" who were released from prison, only 15 were subsequently convicted of additional felony charges ­ a recidivism rate of just 1.25%.4 And detention may extend for years because, while there is a "clearly identifiable event marking completion of the detention period (i.e. issuance of a final order)," there is no "clearly identifiable deadline by which that event must take place." Welch v. Ashcroft, 293 F.3d 213, 227 (4th Cir. 2002).This case likewise does not involve individuals who have been finally determined to be subject to removal. Mr. Kim has a right under federal law to reside permanently in the United States, and to remain in this country until a final order of removal3. Mr. Kim was detained under the portion of the statute mandating detention for individuals who are facing deportation for a wide variety of offenses, including drug addiction, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(ii); "moral turpitude crimes," id. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i); and "convictions" for offenses classified as "aggravated felonies," id. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), an "aggravated felony" includes offenses that are typically considered misdemeanors or minor crimes.4.

Courts have uniformly recognized their jurisdiction to determine whether the conviction for which the INS seeks removal was an "aggravated felony" under 8 U.S.C § 1227(a),5 and many like Mr. Kim have successfully disputed the classification of their convictions under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).6 Moreover, as this Court has made clear, a "great number" of individuals convicted of "aggravated felonies" remain eligible for discretionary relief after the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ("IIRIRA"). INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 323 (2001).7 And the statute itself provides5. See, e.g., Bell v. Reno, 218 F.3d 86 (2nd Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 2001 WL 12704 (U.S. 2001); Wireko v.

I.N.S., 27 Fed. Appx. 868 (9th Cir. 2001).7. St. Cyr carves out a significant exception to IIRIRA's denial of discretionary relief for aggravated felons by preserving discretionary relief for aliens "whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for § [1226 (c)] relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect." 533 U.S. at 326. By the Court's own estimation, the impact of its decision is sweeping, since the number of aliens who relied on Section 1226(c) prior to the passage of IIRIRA "is extremely large," id. at 295-96 (noting that in years immediately prior to the statute's passage more than 50% of the applicants under Section 1226(c) were granted relief) and that 90% of convictions are through guilty pleas, id.(Cont'd)6several avenues by which immigrants who have been convicted of an aggravated felony under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) may avoid removal altogether.8 In short, the fact that a lawful permanent resident has a prior "conviction" does not, of itself, establish that he is subject to deportation or will be ordered deported.In view of the limited nature of the case presented, Amicus confines its discussion here to two key points supporting the Court of Appeals' decision: (1) an individualized determination of the reasons why the absolute deprivation of liberty is necessary is the touchstone of U.S. civil and criminal detention systems, and (2) mandatory detention for every immigrant pending a deportation determination is both unnecessary and grossly out of step with standard methods for ensuring appearance and protecting the public in analogous civil or criminal detention systems in the United States.(Cont'd) at 323-25, n.51, n.54. Moreover, because IIRIRA "expanded the definition of `aggravated felony' substantially" to include "more minor crimes which may have been committed many years ago," an "increased percentage of applicants will meet the stated criteria for § [1226(c)] relief." Id. at 296 n.6. Finally, an individual may avoid deportation if he has been pardoned for his offense. 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(v); see also Elizabeth Rapaport, The Georgia Immigration Pardons, 13 Fed. Sent. Rptr. 184 (2001).8. An immigrant may not be removed if the Attorney General decides (1) that removal to a particular country might threaten the alien's life or freedom because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, and (2) the alien has not participated in persecution, has not committed a particularly serious crime, and does not pose a danger to the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). Removal may also be avoided through private legislation from Congress, see Vargas v. Reno, 966 F. Supp. 1537, 1549 (S.D. Cal. 1997), or under international treaties, such as the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, see Kamalthas v. INS, 251 F.3d 1279 (9th Cir. 2001).7Where the Government seeks to deprive an individual of a significant liberty interest, this Court has left no question that due process demands a determination that the Government's legitimate purposes are served by the deprivation in the individual case. This rule is past question when the Government's purpose in detention is punitive. It is equally essential when the Government's purpose is preventive. This principle is borne out in this Court's due process jurisprudence governing pretrial detention of arrestees; post-conviction termination of parole rights; the civil system of juvenile detention (for citizens and immigrants alike); and civil commitment of the mentally ill ­ even when commitment follows a jury finding of not guilty by reason of insanity. Without exception, the same rule has governed this Court's decisions regarding immigrants present in the United States. The insistence on individualized determinations in all of these contexts is with good reason. As the Court has recently emphasized, absent a statement of particular reasons why detention in the individual case is necessary, preventive detention related to immigration proceedings could become simply an easier mechanism for the Government to inflict punishment.As the Court has also made clear, a legitimate purpose alone is not enough to justify the absolute deprivation of liberty when alternative, less restrictive methods are available that serve the Government's asserted interests equally well. Here, there is no basis for a conclusion that detention is the sole solution. Despite the Government's heavy reliance on categorical statistics ­ suggesting that immigrants invariably pose a risk of flight or danger ­ the evidence regarding lawful permanent residents in this country points to just the opposite conclusion.The categories of individuals subject to detention pending the outcome of deportation proceedings have changed repeatedly in the past fifteen years. As a result, statistics and legislative history purporting to describe the "actual consequences" of discretionary release during this period cannot be readily compared, and until 1996, demonstrate nothing about the8consequences of discretionary release of lawful permanent residents following a bond hearing. Before 1988, everyone subject to deportation hearings was entitled to a bond hearing and was presumptively eligible to be released. Matter of Patel, 15 I. & N. Dec. 666, 1976 WL 32348 (BIA 1976). Between 1988 and 1990, any immigrant (legal or illegal) who had been convicted of an "aggravated felony" ­ then defined narrowly to include only murder, drug trafficking, and trafficking in firearms ­ was to be detained without bond. Former 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), § 1252 (1988). Courts soon concluded that this restriction was unconstitutional. See, e.g., Kellman v. District Director, 750 F. Supp. 625, 626-27 (S.D.N.Y. 1990); Caballero v. Caplinger, 914 F. Supp. 1374, 1376-77 (E.D. La. 1996) (citing cases). Accordingly, in 1990, Congress amended the law again to expand eligibility for bond ­ lawful permanent residents were again eligible for custody hearings and release. Just a year later, "lawfully admitted" immigrants were added to those eligible for release (even if currently in unlawful status). Former 8 U.S.C. § 1252 (1991). In 1996, Congress substantially expanded the types of crimes deemed to be "aggravated felonies," but the INS retained discretion to release "lawfully admitted" immigrants after a bond hearing until 1998.Because of these numerous changes, statistics purporting to describe recidivism or absconding by "aliens" during this period in fact describe widely differing groups of immigrants. They provide no basis for demonstrating that, as the Government would suggest, mandatory detention works and discretionary release does not. As important, only recently has there been any information about what happens to the current class of "aggravated felons" when released following an individual determination of flight risk or dangerousness. The single study during the relevant period that does examine how lawful permanent residents like Mr. Kim fared upon discretionary release pending deportation hearings found appearance rates of990% or better. Vera Institute of Justice, Testing Community Supervision for the INS: An Evaluation of the Appearance Assistance Program (August 1, 2000).9Likewise, for lawful permanent residents, any number of conditioned or supervised release programs can more than adequately satisfy the Government's interests in ensuring court appearances and protecting the public. Indeed, immigration detention is the only context in the United States in which such conditional release programs are not employed as a matter of course. Pretrial services programs in the criminal justice system have been the norm for the past four decades ­ to enormously beneficial effect. Moreover, the single such pilot program that has been conducted in the immigration context has demonstrated the overwhelming effectiveness of even a modicum of postrelease supervisory assistance.Everything that has been learned from conditional or supervised release programs in these contexts points to the same conclusion: long-term members of a community, who have close ties to that community, are overwhelmingly likely to satisfy all conditions of release and appear at court proceedings as scheduled. Despite the Government's suggestion otherwise, there is no evidence reasonably supporting the conclusion that immigration detention alone must operate outside the bounds of standard practice in the United States. Rather, the INS, like every other law enforcement body, should employ conditions of release that are no more extensive than necessary to accomplish the Government's stated goals
Shielding the removal process for noncitizens within the United States from judicial review contravenes fundamental principles of our constitutional system and this Court's precedent. This3 See About the ABA Rule of Law Initiative, available at https://www.americanbar.org/advocacy/rule_of_law/about/origin _principles/.4 Available at https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/ aba/directories/policy/2006_my_107c.pdf. In furtherance of its mission and goals, the ABA adopts policies that represent the ABA's official position on numerous legislative, national, and professional issues. The policies adopted by the ABA House of Delegates are each accompanied by a report, which provides background and insight into the reasoning underlying the ABA's adoption of the relevant policy.4Court has never excluded an individual on U.S. soil from the protections of the Suspension Clause absent a formal suspension of the habeas writ--and for good reason. To do so would flout judicial review, the Constitution, and the rule of law.Respondent Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam was arrested in the United States, placed into expedited removal proceedings, found not to have met the legal nexus required for asylum (even though his account of persecution was deemed credible), and ordered removed from the country. Not a single person outside of the Executive Branch reviewed his claims or the order removing him. And if the government's view prevails, no one outside of the Executive Branch ever will. Asylum seekers subject to expedited removal proceedings, like Respondent, do not receive a full immigration hearing, administrative review by the Board of Immigration Appeals ("BIA"), or direct judicial review in the courts of appeals. The expedited removal statute allows for habeas review of only three narrow claims regarding identity. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A), (e)(2). The government argues that Respondent is not entitled to any judicial review-- including habeas review--beyond that.The government's argument that the Suspension Clause affords no protections against removal in such circumstances cannot be reconciled with this Court's precedent. This Court has repeatedly affirmed the availability of judicial review in immigration cases, including where the government seeks to remove a noncitizen who has entered the country. See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 300-301 (2001) (citing Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 235 (1953)).5Denying habeas protections to noncitizens within the United States would have far-reaching implications beyond this specific case and raise analytical difficulties avoided by the categorical availability of habeas dictated by precedent. The expedited removal procedure (as DHS recently proposed) applies to any noncitizen who has not been admitted, anywhere in the country, for up to two years after his or her entry. So while Respondent was arrested near the border and soon after entering, the logic of the government's position would threaten judicial review for a much broader swath of noncitizens currently residing in this country. And that threat is no farfetched hypothetical: the government reportedly has deployed its expedited removal procedure against noncitizen students living in Michigan.Although Congress enjoys broad powers to regulate immigration, those powers cannot be construed to override fundamental structural and individual constitutional protections. Habeas provides a "time-tested device" that "maintain[s] the `delicate balance of governance' that is itself the surest safeguard of liberty." Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 745 (2008). To preclude noncitizens within our borders the protection of habeas corpus would be an affront to the Constitution and the rule of law.Nor can a judicial inquiry limited to questions of mistaken identity be considered compatible with the Suspension Clause's guarantees. The government's contrary argument disregards both the meaning and purpose of the "Great Writ"--an instrument the Framers and the Court agree is crucial to both holding6government accountable and securing individual liberty. The government's concerns over delay in the removal context fare no better: such incidental delay, part-and-parcel of habeas review, cannot justify upending the historic role of the writ
This Court should review the Eighth Circuit's en banc decision for two reasons:First, the impact of White is uncertain. Judicial elections and the state codes modeled on the ABA canons will be in limbo without guidance from this Court. Issues concerning fundraising and political activities in judicial campaigns are likely to recur unless the Court intervenes.Second, the proper scope of campaign regulations affecting judicial candidates and judges is important to the ABA and the public. The ABA's Model Code must both advance the goals of judicial independence, integrity, and impartiality and comport with this Court's guidance
As this Court has recognized, the rule of law requires that courts enunciate clear legal principles of general applicability, principles that do not change absent special justifications, and principles that allow legislatures, courts, and other institutions to conduct their business in compliance with-4-constitutional standards. The Court has repeatedlystressed the importance of this tenet in deciding constitutional questions.of staredecisisgSPtTSUoohreenievccimsseootasrnneiendddrCnmSoettSunAevatr.tnAmrat)aemetI.nelnelscdnaidennmdeodcevim.Cisnoes,ofMtinnois'stlat1sihl1eeswi6rsrte,elrUndlit.icotg-3Sroh0r.eut7ecrwgtta2iluscUt5tylot.2haiS.othbanete(astd1avh18rea7i8t4sm6si)oaulfi(reiin1tmn(t9istce8aiteo.9rnhrn)pe;pfartsireShnetiesitseefrena,deeegtdliceaoaeartt.stlnaehgehs,lde,.eono federal appellate court prior to the decision belowhas invalidated a Second Amendment. and executive actiongun tocontrol law based on the Those advocating legislativeregulate firearms -- as wellas government officials taking such action -- haverelied on this precedent and, consistent with thisconstitutional understanding, have crafted hundredsof federal and state laws and regulations to abatethe serious hazards of gun violence.The decision below, in rejecting this long line of precedent, leaves in doubt the constitutionality of a vast federal and state statutory framework of gun control laws and could impede efforts by federal and state legislatures to enact other public safety and crime-fighting legislation. By upsetting the rules on which this regulatory system is predicated, without articulating any special justifications for such a change, the decision undercuts the principle of stare decisis and defeats long-settled expectations.Furthermore, a key part of the standard the court of appeals applies -- whether the weapons subject to the challenged regulation are "lineal descendants" of revolutionary era firearms-5-compounds the Second of judicial courts to individual similaritiesthis problem Amendmentby leaving the indeterminate.boundaries of As a matteradministration, this test would requiredecide whether categories or evenmodels of firearms bear sufficientwith early flintlock pistols and musketsto warrant a privileged constitutional proliferating questions that courts willstatus. have toThe facebtbaeareescihesnntoedlcooohrgwnyei,dcgauliawdniadtanhncdeye,ctofnassccuttaci-nhtbuastbdeiedoe,ntaeolrvlmeaicrsnktiagatnkaiienfonyincsanpbcryweeocueelsdvodeonlatvsniioanwtlgothreaten all regulation of firearms.At the very least, taking this approach under the Second Amendment would prompt decades of litigation. Moreover, it would involve the courts in second-guessing legislative and executive policy judgments in an area vital to public health and safety. Accordingly, changing the longstanding interpretation of the Second Amendment would frustrate settled expectations, require courts to perform historically legislative functions, and would compromise important values of certainty and finality
The Executive Order at issue here suspends entry into the United States by all nationals of six almost entirely Muslim countries--Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen--for 90 days, subject to certain case-by-case waiver provisions. J.A. 1425-29. It likewise suspends entry of all refugees and decisions on applications for refugee status for 120 days, with a similar waiver process on a case-by-case basis. J.A. 1433-34. The suspension of entry purportedly serves to permit the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to review screening and vetting procedures for entry of foreign nationals. See J.A. 1425.4As authority for this action, the Order relies on section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ("INA"), Pub. L. 82-414, which states that "[w]henever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate." 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f). Echoing the language of § 1182(f), the Order states that "unrestricted entry into the United States of nationals" of the six countries "would be detrimental to the interests of the United States." J.A. 1426.I. The Government contends that this Court may not even consider whether § 1182(f) in fact gives the President the authority he claims. It contends that the exclusion of aliens is committed entirely to the political branches and that Congress accordingly may delegate to the President sweeping authority that can be exercised without any review by the courts. See Pet'rs Br. 22-27.This Court should reject the Government's attempts to insulate the Order from review. To be sure, judicial deference to the political branches' judgments regarding immigration--particularly to the extent those judgments implicate delicate questions of foreign relations--may be appropriate in certain circumstances. But deference does not justify5abdicating the duty of judicial review. Accepting the Government's position would eviscerate the most fundamental task of this Court: to say what the law is, even when that law touches on sensitive subjects like foreign relations and national security. This Court has regularly reviewed Executive action to ensure that it is within statutory and constitutional bounds, and invalidated it where necessary, even in wartime.The cases on which the Government relies articulating the doctrines of plenary power and "consular nonreviewability" are not to the contrary. Even to the extent the plenary power cases retain their full force today--and they are difficult to square with this Court's more recent precedent-- they do not stand for the proposition that this Court can never address the limits of Executive power in the immigration context. And the consular nonreviewability cases articulate a narrow rule governing aliens' individual challenges to their exclusion. They are inapposite here.II. Nor should the Court accept the Government's reading of § 1182(f) as granting the President unilateral and unreviewable authority. While the provision's language appears broad read in isolation, when it is examined in the context of the statute as a whole--as basic principles of statutory construction require--it becomes clear that the Government's interpretation of § 1182(f) would make a hash of the rest of the statutory scheme.6The Government's reading transformssignificant portions of a complex statute intosurplusage. The INA contains provisions designed toaddress the precise problems at which the Orderostensibly aims. Congress has enacted elaborateprovisions designed to exclude persons associatedwith terrorist activities or organizations fromobtaining a visa for entry to this country. And in2015, Congress amended the INA to ensure thatnationals of, or recent visitors to, the six countriesaddressed in the Order would have to undergo thatthorough vetting and could not take advantage of thevisa waiver program available to other foreignnationals. In doing so, Congress expressly declinedto adopt a travel ban, concluding that existingvetting procedures and the limitation of the visawaiver program sufficed. Section 1182(f) should notbe read to permit the President to overturnCongress's judgment.Moreover, on theGovernment's reading, § 1182(f) would permit thePresident to override the INA's historic prohibition ofnational-origin discrimination in the issuance ofimmigrant visas.The Government's interpretation of § 1182(f) also raises serious constitutional questions, including separation-of-powers questions. It would collapse all power over the exclusion of aliens into a single branch of government, contrary to our constitutional structure of divided powers. And it would give the President the power to discriminate--for instance, on the basis of race, religion, or sex--in a way that would be prohibited in any other context and that implicates our most fundamental values as a nation.7This Court should interpret § 1182(f) narrowly, and read it to permit judicial review, to avoid those constitutional questions.III. The Court should also reject the Government's contention that, in reviewing respondent's Establishment Clause challenge to the Order, the Court should restrict its inquiry to the four corners of the Order. Where, as here, the President himself and his advisers have repeatedly made clear that the Order is intended as a "Muslim ban," this Court need not and should not ignore those statements in determining the Order's constitutionality.ARGUMENTI.THIS COURT SHOULD REJECT THEGOVERNMENT'S
 Through thirty-five years of thorough research, the ABA has concluded that caps on non-economic damages interpose barriers to court access and deny redress to tort victims with meritorious cases. Caps have a devastating impact on the poor, women, and the elderly, in particular. The Court's answer to the certified questions should reflect the empirical reality that caps undermine our Nation's commitment to open courts and equal justice under the law.
For over a quarter of a century, federal courts have been hearing tort claims under the ATS brought by aliens against defendants over whom federal courts have personal jurisdiction for viola tions of human rights universally recognized by the law of nations, including claims based on con duct occurring, in whole or in part, overseas. The ATS has provided victims with access to justice that is often unavailable in their own lands, making it a valuable enforcement mechanism in upholding the law of nations. The plain language of the statute supports the applicability of the ATS to such claims and counsels against a cate gorical denial of jurisdiction based on the fact that the conduct took place in a foreign jurisdiction. Although jurisdiction should be exercised with care, the legal rules, including prudential limita tions, that are regularly applied by federal courts in ATS cases--such as the requirement of personal jurisdiction, the doctrines oi forum non conveniens and exhaustion, and the defined limitations of thescope of ATS jurisdiction to universally recognized wrongs--sufficiently ameliorate the concerns presented when federal courts are asked to entertaincases arising from events in other countries.Restricting the ATS to violations that occur within the territory of the United States (or on the high seas) would be inconsistent with this nation's historic commitment to promoting accountability for human rights violations and encouraging all nations to develop effective remedies for viola tions. ATS precedents have powerfully influenced the development of human rights law and adher ence to the rule of law throughout the world andhave served as a model for foreign courts hearing international human rights cases. A narrow reading of the ATS would diminish the United States' voice in fostering universal adherence to norms ofinternational law
The ABA respectfully submits that while this Court limited its holding in Graham to juvenilesccashoduanuprlvptaiosccrttteesrdiisdttehinictsoiffiCaeondudrnto'dsniin-fhfceoorRmneoicnpccleieurdseiboenatnwdteohefanfteGnrsjceuahsvih,elandmirleensevtaeharnarydteless morally culpable and have a greater capacity for rehabilitation than adults also supports an extension of Graham's holding to all juvenilesregardless of whether they were convicted ofhomicide. Similarly, Graham's holding that the standard penological justifications of sentencingare not served by juvenile life without parole (`JLWOP") sentences applies with equal force to juveniles convicted of homicide. Moreover, theexclusion of juveniles convicted of homicide fromthe protection of Graham does not comport with the "evolving standards of decency that mark theprogress of a maturing society." Roper, 543 US. at560-61. Each of these arguments for extendingGraham to juveniles convicted of homicide is supported by the ABA's research, investigation and the experience of its members in formulating, adopting and periodically reviewing the ABA's Juvenile Justice Standards, which specifically include standards for sentencing.Moreover, the ABA urges a conclusion that a JLWOP sentence is unconstitutional even for juveniles convicted of homicide crimes based on thefact that would be parole.neither public safety nor penal compromised by allowing the Further, consideration shouldobjectives chance for be given totheoverwhelmingoppositionto JLWOPdemonstrated by international authorities.While the Petitioners may focus on the constitutionality of JUWOP as applied to fourteen year old children under particular circumstances, the ABA requests, for the reasons set forth herein and consistent with the consensus of medical and behavioral scientists as to a child's_ braindevelopment, that this Court hold categorically that a JLWOP sentence for any child under the ageof eighteen for any crime is unconstitutional.The ABA is not asserting that all juvenilesshould be entitled to parole, but only that theyshould not be denied the opportunity to beconsidered for parole before they die in prison. Theneed for such protection for juvenile offenders ismade more compelling by the fact that manyjuveniles sentenced to JLWOP, including thePetitioners here, are tried as adults before trialjudges with no discretion to sentence them toanything but life without the possibility of parole.Thus, many trial judges are stripped of anyopportunityto considerthebackgrounds,developmental differences or other mitigatingfactors of youth that this Court, the scientificcommunity, and the ABA have recognized.
I. This Court should hold that the Sixth Amendment, of its own force and as incorporated against the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that jury verdicts in felony criminal cases be unanimous. Although a divided Court allowed a non-unanimous verdict to stand against a Sixth Amendment challenge in Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), no opinion commanded a majority of the Court, and the plurality and concurring opinions that supported the judgment relied on differing, even contradictory reasoning--and in each case on rationales inconsistent with both prior and subsequent decisions of this Court. Under these exceptional circumstances, and where individual constitutional rights necessary to secure a fundamentally fair trial are at stake, the Court should overrule Apodaca.Four Justices in Apodaca would have held that the Sixth Amendment by itself does not require unanimous juries. But that reasoning was rejected by five other Justices, deviated from prior decisions, and has been rejected in other opinions stating without qualification that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts. One Justice would have held that, even though the Trial by Jury Clause of the Sixth Amendment does require unanimous verdicts, the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate that particular requirement. But that partial approach to incorporation has never been adopted by the Court and has been expressly repudiated in subsequent decisions. Thus, giv-5en its weak underpinnings and inconsistency with both earlier and later precedents, Apodaca has little claim to the force of stare decisis.II. The precedential effect of Apodaca is further undermined by two factors that the Court did not consider in that decision: scholarship demonstrating that unanimity is important to the functioning of the jury, and historical evidence showing that in both Louisiana and Oregon, non-unanimous verdicts have a racially tainted origin. First, the Apodaca Court had little empirical evidence about non-unanimous juries, but subsequent research supports a conclusion that juries operating under a unanimity rule deliberate more carefully and thoughtfully, and with greater respect for all jurors' opinions, including those representing minority and dissenting viewpoints. These qualities are essential if the jury is to play its fundamental constitutional role as the conscience of the community, and in particular the representative of a fair cross-section of a diverse community.Second, the ability of a majority-rule jury to ignore minority viewpoints is particularly troubling given historical evidence that, in both Louisiana and Oregon, the non-unanimous verdict was authorized as a vehicle of racial discrimination. In Louisiana, non-unanimous verdicts were written into its constitution at the 1898 Convention, which adopted numerous measures to reinforce white supremacy in the State. And in Oregon, non-unanimous verdicts were authorized after a sweep of anti-Semitism and other discriminatory attitudes across the State following the partial acquittal of a Jewish defendant. The tainted origins of these measures provide further reason the Court should not allow them to stand, and should instead hold that the constitutional guarantee of unanimous jury verdicts in felony criminal cases applies equally across the Nation.
The ABA submits that the holding of Stern v. Marshall, 131 S. Ct. 2594 (2011) should not be extended to eliminate the ability of litigants to consent to adjudications by bankruptcy and other4 ABA Policy # 109 (adopted February 2013), available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/ho use_of_delegates/resolutions/2013_hod_midyear_meeting_109.d ocx. In addition, concerned that Stern might be seen as calling into question the constitutionality of the consent provisions of the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(1), the ABA adopted similar policy supporting that Act's grant to magistrate judges "upon the consent of the parties, the power to conduct any and all proceedings in a jury or non-jury civil matter in federal court and to order the entry of judgment in the case, as being consistent with and not violative of Article III of the United States Constitution." ABA Policy # 10B (adopted February 2012), available at http://www.americanbar.org/ content/dam/aba/administrative/house_of_delegates/resolutions/ 2012_hod_midyear_meeting_10b.doc.4non-Article III courts. Stern held only that a creditor did not consent to be sued in bankruptcy court on a state law claim merely by filing a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case. Id. at 2614-15. In a situation where a litigant has not consented, Stern held, as a plurality of the Court did in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982), that Article III precluded the bankruptcy court from entering a final judgment on a state law claim that did not "stem[] from the bankruptcy itself" and which would not "necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process." 131 S. Ct. at 2618.During the thirty-one years since Northern Pipeline, the Court has held in other analogous contexts that "Article III's guarantee of an impartial and independent federal adjudication is subject to waiver, just as are other personal constitutional rights that dictate the procedures by which civil and criminal matters must be tried." Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 848-49 (1986). The argument that, following Stern, litigants can no longer consent to having non-Article III courts decide their claims runs contrary to this precedent and to the Court's statement that its holding in Stern was "narrow." 131 S. Ct. at 2620. It also contradicts the principle that `"courts should not lightly overrule past decisions.'" See Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 115 (1985) (quoting Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375, 403 (1970)).5If accepted, this argument also would strip bankruptcy courts of adjudicative powers they have held since Congress enacted the modern Bankruptcy Code and force that work upon the district courts' already very crowded dockets. As demonstrated by the 1,107,699 bankruptcy cases filed in the year ending September 30, 2013, "the volume of bankruptcy cases is staggering." Stern, 131 S. Ct. at 2630 (Breyer, J., dissenting).5 The number of adversary proceedings is equally high. As of September 30, 2012, 65,599 adversary proceedings were also pending in the bankruptcy courts.6To illustrate the impact on the district courts and litigants if bankruptcy courts may no longer hear and determine fraudulent transfer, preference, and state-law counterclaims with litigant consent, or recommend proposed rulings in those proceedings, the ABA gathered case filing data from the CM/ECF system for a sample district from each circuit for the four year period of July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2013. As demonstrated in the ABA's chart summarizing that analysis, see infra at 21-22, those eleven district courts would have been required to hear and decide at least 37,639 additional cases. Spread out over the entire federal court system, the shift in work load would be significant.5 http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatist ics/BankruptcyFilings/2013/0913_f2.pdf. 6 http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/JudicialBusiness/ 2012/appendices/F08Sep12.pdf.6This Court predicted in Stern that its ruling would not "meaningfully change[] the division of labor" between the district courts and bankruptcy courts under 28 U.S.C. § 157. 131 S. Ct. at 2620. The ABA respectfully submits that, consistent with this Court's prediction in Stern, and its established precedent in bankruptcy and analogous contexts, the Court should conclude that bankruptcy and other non-Article III courts may continue to hear and determine matters with litigant consent
The ABA is concerned about the adverse impact on attorneys, their clients, and the judicial system of requiring copyright holders to wait to seek relief for copyright infringement until a certificate of registration is issued by the Copyright Office or the Copyright Office refuses to issue one. This "certificate approach" to the term "registration" in the Registration and Civil Infringement Actions provision of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 411(a) denies access to the courts in a manner inconsistent with the overall structure and nature of the Copyright Act.4 By contrast, the "application approach"-- which merely requires a copyright holder to submit a complete set of registration materials (i.e., an application, deposit copy, and registration fee) to the Copyright Office--is more consistent with the text of Subsection 411(a), the text of neighboring Copyright Act provisions, the purposes of the Copyright Act, and the overall copyright system.The ABA closely has monitored--long before the Fourth Estate case itself--the circuit split between the4 While Respondents and certain lower court opinions refer to this as the "registration" approach, that name is misleading because, as discussed below, the term "registration" in the Copyright Act properly means the act of delivering a copyright application, deposit copy, and fee to the Copyright Office.4"certificate approach" and the "application approach." After careful analysis and input from its members, many of whom are expert intellectual property practitioners, the ABA IPL Section adopted a resolution favoring the application approach in October 2017. The ABA House of Delegates adopted a similar resolution on behalf of the ABA as a whole in February 2018. The ABA favors the application approach interpretation of Subsection 411(a) for several reasons.First, the application approach better reflects the text of the Copyright Act. As an initial matter, this Court already has considered the text of Subsection 411(a) in Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick and tacitly recognized that the term "registration" in that Subsection refers to an act performed by copyright holders (when they submit their applications, deposits, and fees to the Copyright Office) not the Copyright Office (when it issues or refuses to issue a certificate of registration). See 559 U.S. 154, 158 n.1 (2010) (considering "the registration process" and the "incentives to encourage copyright holders to register their works" (emphasis added)). Similarly, other provisions of the Copyright Act describe "registration" as something that the copyright holder "may obtain" when she delivers the registration materials to the Copyright Office without reference to the Office's issuance or refusal of a certificate memorializing that registration. See infra 9. Moreover, the "effective date of registration" is the date on which the copyright holder delivers her registration materials to the5Copyright Office, not when the Copyright Office issues its decision. See infra 9.Second, the application approach is particularly important to copyright practitioners who submit copyright registrations and counsel clients on the meaning of the Copyright Office's review. In sharp contrast to patent law--where no rights exist until and unless a patent is formally issued--under copyright law, a copyright exists at the moment an original work is "fixed" in a "tangible medium of expression," regardless of any action by the Copyright Office. See infra 13. In addition, unlike in patent law, the Copyright Office's refusal to issue a certificate of registration for a work has no preclusive effect on the district court, which reviews copyrightability de novo.5 See infra 21. As copyrights exist regardless of whether works are registered, and the Copyright Office's position on copyrightability is not binding on the courts, it does not make sense and would be an abrupt departure for copyright practitioners from the normal operation of copyright law to interpret Subsection 411(a) as requiring receipt of a final5 To be clear, the ABA has great respect for the Copyright Office and the role that it plays in the copyright system. But the submission of registration materials to the Copyright Office should suffice for a copyright holder to gain access to the courts. Under this approach, a court still benefits from the Copyright Office's views at some point early in the case, and the benefits of collecting deposit copies and filing fee revenues are still realized, but in a manner that better enables litigants to obtain adequate redress.6decision from the Copyright Office before a lawsuit can be commenced.Third, the application approach avoids the draconian impact that the certificate approach has on litigants as it permits the prompt filing of lawsuits to obtain urgent injunctive relief, while still ensuring that copyright holders register their works with the Copyright Office. See infra 23. It also eliminates the adverse consequences for meeting the Copyright Act's short three-year statute of limitations that can flow from the certificate approach's preclusion of suit until the Copyright Office decides whether to issue a certificate of registration. See infra 29.Finally, the application approach reduces the inequity authors of United States works face as Subsection 411(a)'s prerequisite applies only to them, not authors of foreign works, who are entirely exempt from Subsection 411(a)'s registration requirement to gain access to United States courts. By permitting copyright holders to bring suit as soon as their registration materials are filed, rather than when the Copyright Office eventually decides whether to issue a certificate of registration, the application approach minimizes the additional burden on authors of United States works in gaining access to the court system. See infra 33.For these reasons, and as further detailed below, the application approach to Subsection 411(a) better comports with the Copyright Act as a whole, and7better serves authors of United States works, their lawyers, and the judicial system at large
In Atkins, this Court concluded that a national consensus had developed against the execution of persons with mental retardation and that such executions violated the Eighth Amendment. The Court also stated that the national consensus suggests that some characteristics of mental retardation, such as disabilities in the areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of impulses, undermine the procedural protections of our capital punishment jurisprudence and can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of12 A copy of all assessments may be found at: http://www. americanbar.org/groups/individual_rights/projects/death_penalty_ due_process_review_project/death_penalty_assessments.html.7capital proceedings against defendants with mental retardation.Although the Atkins Court left to the states the task of determining whether a defendant has mental retardation, the Court noted its approval of state statutory definitions that generally conform to the clinical definitions of professional mental disability organizations, such as the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) (formerly the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR)) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA).13In the eleven years since Atkins was decided, states have taken differing approaches to fulfilling this mandate. Many of these states have followed Atkins' guidance and have implemented tests that, consistent with the definitions used by recognized mental disability organizations, consider assessments of both an individual's intellectual functioning (i.e., IQ tests), including the standard margin of error or specific facts about the administration and scoring of the test, and an individual's conceptual, social and practical skills.Florida courts, however, have adopted a test that individuals who have a raw IQ score above 70 do not have mental retardation, without consideration of the standard margin of error or factors including cognitive and behavioral impairments that are encompassed in the definitions of mental disability professionals. In13 The AAIDD defines mental retardation as "a disability characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical skills." Definition, AAIDD, available at http://aaidd.org/intellectual-disability/definition# .UrJVfNJDs2c.8doing so, Florida has erected a test with no foundation in scientifically recognized definitions that prevents an accurate assessment of whether a defendant has mental retardation and allows for the execution of individuals with mental retardation who would not be executed in states that have followed Atkins' guidance. This, the ABA asserts, is an arbitrary and capricious application of the death penalty that denies the constitutional protection mandated by Atkins for the full range of defendants with mental retardation
 Title IX arose out of Congressional concern that discrimination in schools was having a corrosive effect on the educational prospects of students relegated to second-class treatment because of their gender. Accordingly, Title IX was intended to root out both practices that explicitly deny educational opportunities to students based on their sex, and practices that deter students from participating in the school community by subjecting them to harassment, stigma, or other impediments4Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 13 of 39Total Pages:(13 of 40)on the basis of their sex. Consistent with Congress's expansive purpose, and recognizing the grave and long-lasting harm that discrimination can wreak on children, the Supreme Court has construed Title IX broadly, barring any practice that, on the basis of sex, denies students equal access to educational opportunities. See, e.g., Davis v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629 (1999); Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274 (1998).The Gloucester County School Board's exclusionary bathroom policy-- though presented as a neutral measure that sorts students based on their sex as assigned at birth--in fact singles out G.G. and other transgender students for special treatment simply because they are transgender. This is discrimination on the basis of sex, and it denies G.G. the equality of educational opportunity Title IX was meant to secure. The School Board's policy presents him with two unacceptable alternatives: Though recognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia as a boy, he may use the girls' bathroom, which is as untenable for him as for any boy, or he may use a single-occupancy bathroom in the nurse's office that other students do not use. In either case, G.G. will be separated from the rest of the boys at his school and singled out for stigma--making it more difficult for him to attend classes and participate in the social fabric of the school community.Rather than choose between two bad options, G.G. has avoided using the bathroom at school and, consequently, contracted multiple urinary tract infections.5Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 14 of 39Total Pages:(14 of 40)JA-19. Policies like the School Board's also effectively exclude transgender students from an essential school facility: bathrooms that virtually all other students of their gender use. Because of these consequences, among others, studies demonstrate that transgender students who are excluded from bathrooms that align with their gender identities are likelier to attempt suicide or to have impaired academic performance and aspirations. This kind of harm, imposed on transgender students because of sex-related stereotypes, is exactly what Congress intended Title IX to eradicate.Reading Title IX to prohibit the School Board's discriminatory bathroom policy is consonant with the values expressed in decades of anti-discrimination jurisprudence. The Supreme Court has long held that discrimination unravels the fabric of American society by excluding people from participating in public life, and offends our shared commitment to individual dignity by classifying people based on their race, sex, or other group markers. The Supreme Court has found particularly troubling discrimination that occurs in educational institutions. Discrimination that abridges students' access to educational opportunity robs students of the means to provide a better life for themselves and their communities, and also undermines the values that animate our public education system. Transgender students subjected to discriminatory treatment are less likely to succeed academically. Their peers, in turn, are robbed of an opportunity to learn to look beyond stereo-6Appeal: 15-2056 Doc: 142-1Filed: 05/15/2017 Pg: 15 of 39Total Pages:(15 of 40)types and to treat those who express their gender differently with tolerance and respect.These consequences follow transgender students and their classmates into their professional lives, including the legal profession. Transgender students who suffer academically are less likely to pursue a legal education, depriving the bar of voices capable of speaking on behalf of those marginalized for their gender. Moreover, their classmates who have become lawyers are left less able to empathize with, and to provide effective representation for, their transgender or gendernonconforming clients. To preserve educational, professional, and social opportunities for transgender students, it is important that this Court recognize that the Gloucester's policy of discrimination violates Title IX
On September 12, 1996, a death row inmate named Exzavious Gibson stood-alone in a Georgia courtroom.' The occasion was a state habeas corpus hearing that represented his first opportunity to present evidence in support of severalconstitutional claims. One of the most significant of those*The ABA adopts the statement of proceedings in the petition for certiorari.3 claims was a Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel that Gibson could not have brought on direct appeal. Because no volunteer lawyer had been found to assist him, Gibson's claims were presented in a form petition having nothing to do with the facts of his case. Because a lawyer still had not been found by the time of the hearing, and because the state judge would not grant a continuance to allow the Georgia Resource Center additional time to assume the representation, Gibson was forced to act as his own lawyer at the hearing. He presented no evidence. He asked no questions of the only witness: He made no objections and offered no argument. After the hearing, the judge adopted the State's proposed findings verbatim and dismissed the petition. For all practical purposes, Gibson's post-conviction claims have never been heard.This case presents a narrow but critical question: whether an indigent death row inmate has a constitutional right to counsel to pursue initial state habeas claims, particularlywhere, as here, those claims could not have been raised ondirect appeal. Exzavious Gibson could not secure a lawyer to pursue such claims: he could not afford to hire one, the Statedid not provide one, and he was unable to find volunteer counsel. The question in this case thus was not answered in either Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.S. 1 (1989), or Coleman v.Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991). Writing separately (and casting the deciding vote) in Giarratano, Justice Kennedy emphasized that "[ijt cannot be denied that collateral relief proceedings are a central part of the review process for prisoners sentenced to death," and that "[t]he complexity of our jurisprudence in this area . . . makes it unlikely that capital defendants will be able to file successful petitions for collateral relief without the assistance of persons learned in the law." Giarratano, 492 U.S. at 14 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). The facts in Giarratano, however, revealed that4 "c(pCsnorKeoouecelnusnesprenmereneailtdnseyo,d,ntcoeorubrwnyJehs.o,peentrlrheiecdssoeenanfctctotahurhsreehr,riiohmniwCtsgoheuiirnntiidnnVpeiioatrtsirtgahtehlicesnoerirnoajsvvwtueiadhdctagietsmniemotbnahnheettae)ebnp.erpahrosu.ae.cndceaiSebsildbepmeierienolngtacqosreu.leaeo"ybdsb,litteniaIgoidit.nn.noColeman, 501 U.S. at 755.pir"EiSfvqrnosUoeeuitrfGanuotfonnacvrSfeiiaamltweaselsht.a.lautneielcuohirhnttsdautueeaIfrtew1tiarhb3iaes2hvtc6aeemwietsi1eteo5esibdanorita4o,dnaessao,tnitbDattnghhocilades3ecwegeld,lalto-7aseinea-irwh8sttttrwteeyapiaeihhiyy4srxneewgdrbntonee9opr(tnisalaeutgr2s1eiir,tiPfltas9.tefre"isefss,8iciihhenUot6cecaapa.oana)ahantTlSvefsn.nalic.ateha.crdatbavedrpynnecfweeiepdreAeytiacaaeaetndtTiAneoltssaaacethfcradhllarsp2iaet.ietlaaas4ptgmrnlciwhoehhseralsoeycsiaia(SofatcsehsonbeSfwinatAogrnetetmun1omoersBeisacn9mcfwnetvn.ee9sdeoKAietanec6qoinnrngitnr,mundacnteosmceaeglelfhut,ltaAmaleouPnhmaesstfoyltauedc.ieirftmhpbfJeielmtn.r.erad,rshsagmclpooc.eattleooamudpihLrhythucsie.snAeaiaeaneosnrssntmvMsdnstueauNeiteheenaldilpoocveinltis.te.fnsneu-tffeoyrebrnmiyfiTrMlrdsleeiofoneeo1eoeocfgrtr0rranun)ich--mSrts4ltrstc.aetoCthooh-idosaensour1ceesutiofunoss3aianoiretppcn.grt2n.tsssnercosrh,nme,tnoeaieoldansvlhsteitsrloiaOfa1sta4inftiodvSnn1i'tmt7neuybweeae0deohde7llee fiohrifirnangomvmhtametahtitTsemehbbsoeoeCrrteohetheunaorstptc,rihusoanermiefssapvoeueereqdelsrurulaebiolihscnnnaitogtdpagidnrnaitotliraihtteaaeicslnlctotatantiwweacoyhoponeefnphrrseaetaaab,ilntertodiauagsatshpdnituudohrecentsrlaoteualph,eicermoostfuc.thioneehnussednesmicNdl.gloaeajtwnifuihtomrorEseinars,ddccpeeehoarauttualhhrdiosdiefsnrrtinchotonoaehwgwtte5 Court's decisions concerning the rights of indigent parties to counsel reflects an assessment both of the importance of the underlying interest at stake and the extent to which counsel is necessary to protect the rights of the indigent party. See, eg., Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 356-58 (1963); Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs., 452 U.S. 18, 27-28 (1981); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 785-87 (1973). Employing that framework here, recognition of a right to counsel in the circumstances presented by this case is compelling: there are few interests more substantial than the fair administration of the death penalty, and few instances in which the assistance of a lawyer is more indispensable than the pursuit of initial state habeas claims, including ineffective assistance of counsel, that could not have been raised on direct appeal. The ABA therefore urges the Court to grant the petition
The question presented should be answered in the affirmative. In particular, an attorney-fee sanction under inherent power ­ like the one imposed in this case ­ must be limited to the expenses caused by the misconduct unless heightened procedural protections have been observed.The ABA's position is based on standards that it developed after years of studying sanctions law, including this Court's decisions on the federal courts' inherent power to punish litigation misconduct. These standards reflect several governing principles.First, the American Rule bars fee-shifting with only three narrowly defined exceptions when a court is acting under inherent power. One of the exceptions permits the use of an attorney-fee sanction to punish bad faith conduct falling short of contempt-of-court, but only if the award is remedial. This exception shares a common goal with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which also authorize compensatory attorney-fee sanctions for non-contumacious litigation misconduct. Thus, both sources of sanctioning power allow a court to punish misconduct through fee-shifting, but the measure of this punishment is the amount of fees caused by the violation. Notably, this sanction is less drastic than the sanctions available for contempt, which may include a noncompensatory fine equal to the entire cost of the litigation if criminal due process is applied.Second, due process demands proportionality in the assessment of fees under inherent power to guard against arbitrary punishment, which is a risk when a court functions as accuser, prosecutor, and sentencer.6The ABA standards embrace this concept by instructing trial judges to select the "least severe sanction" needed to serve the purpose at hand. Accordingly, when punishment is meant to be remedial in nature, the court should avoid an attorney-fee sanction that is over-inclusive, awarding fees that go beyond those caused by the violation. Furthermore, the notice aspect of due process requires a court to distinguish between a remedial attorney-fee award and a larger non-compensatory fine because, if a party is facing the latter, it must be told this in advance so that it can avail itself of the higher procedural protections that apply in that circumstance.As this Court has held, the heightened procedural protections required of criminal proceedings must be observed if a court wants to rely on inherent power to impose a significant non-remedial fine ­ like the attorney-fee sanction in this case, which even the district court acknowledged was vastly greater than the fees that were traceable to the misconduct.Finally, the ABA recognizes that it may be hard to tell what expenses were directly caused by the misconduct. Such difficulty cannot, however, enlarge inherent powers or eliminate procedural protections. Instead a court should consider how causation issues are resolved in other fee contexts (such as "prevailing party" awards under fee-shifting statutes) and exercise its discretion accordingly.In this case, however, the Ninth Circuit held that no such effort is required. That was error. Accordingly, the judgment below should be reversed.
 When a state holds a person in custody, it has a duty to provide that person with constitutionally adequate medical and mental health care. Prison overcrowding has been shown to have a number of deleterious effects on the medical and mental health of those who are held in prisons and jails, as well as those who work in these institutions. There are, however, many cost-effective prison populationreduction measures that may be safely and immediately implemented without need for legislative change, including (1) early release on exceptional and humanitarian grounds; (2) increased use of alternatives to incarceration for offenders, including those with substance abuse and/or mental illness problems, who are deemed to pose no substantial risk to public safety; (3) more effective parole and probation6 supervision policies that rely on graduated sanc-tions rather than automatic returns to prison; and (4) rehabilitative and reentry services aimed at reducing recidivism. Because the lower court appropriately left to California and its prison administrators the discretion to determine which methods to use to reduce its prison population without compromising public safety, the lower court's order should be affirmed

Its members practice in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Territories, and other jurisdictions. They are prosecutors, public defenders, private defense counsel, and appellate lawyers, as well as attorneys in law firms, corporations, non-profit organizations, and governmental agencies. Its members are also judges, legislators, law professors, law students, and non-lawyer "associates" in related fields.The ABA has a tradition of advocating in capital cases for the administration of justice and the effective representation of clients. Although the ABA takes no position on the death penalty as a general matter, over the course of the past thirty years, the1 Pursuant to S. Ct. R. 37.6, counsel for all parties received timely notice of amicus's intent to file this brief. All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. No counsel for a party authored any part of this brief, and no counsel or any other party or entity, other than amicus, its members, or its counsel, made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief.Neither this brief nor the decision to file it reflects the views of any judicial member of the ABA. This brief was not circulated to any member of the Judicial Division Council before its filing. No inference should be drawn that any member of the Judicial Division Council participated in the adoption or endorsement of the positions taken in this brief.2ABA has become increasingly concerned that capital jurisdictions too often provide neither fairness nor accuracy in the administration of the death penalty. The ABA supports efforts to ensure that death penalty cases are administered fairly, in accordance with due process, and to minimize the risk that innocent persons may be executed.In 1989, the ABA adopted policy in the form of Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, which were designed to expand on positions previously adopted by the ABA "on effective assistance of counsel in capital cases" and to "enumerate the resources and practices necessary to provide effective assistance of counsel." In 2003, the ABA adopted revisions to the Guidelines that updated and expanded on the obligations of death penalty jurisdictions to ensure due process of law and justice. See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 31 HOFSTRA L. REV. 913 (2003). The Guidelines have been relied on and cited favorably by this Court in several cases. See, e.g., Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000).Perhaps most relevant for this case, in 2001, the ABA launched its Death Penalty Due Process Review Project to conduct research and educate the public and decision-makers on the operation of capital jurisdictions' death penalty laws and procedures. The Project has completed in-depth assessments for twelve states. The assessments are designed to provide policy-makers with an objective instrument3to evaluate each state's death penalty system by comparing actual practices in each state with a series of recommendations based on the 2001 ABA Protocols on the Administration of Capital Punishment, which are based on ABA policy, and the revised 2010 version of those Protocols. See Death without Justice: A Guide for Examining the Administration of the Death Penalty in the United States (2001) ("2001 Protocols"); ABA Death Penalty Moratorium Implementation Project: Jurisdictional Assessments (2010) ("2010 Protocols"). The assessment teams were composed of academics, prosecutors, defense counsel, current and former judges, state bar representatives, and state legislators, who lent their expertise and made specific recommendations for reform. The ABA assessments have also been relied on and cited favorably by this Court. See, e.g., Maples v. Thomas, 132 S. Ct. 912, 917­18 (2012).The Project completed its expert assessment of Virginia's death penalty system in 2013. See Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems: The Virginia Death Penalty Assessment Report ("Virginia Assessment"). (A copy of the assessment is available at http://www.am ericanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/death_ penalty_moratorium/va_complete_report.authcheck dam.pdf.) The assessment evaluated Virginia's postconviction procedures for death-sentenced inmates against the ABA Protocols, noted several areas of concern, and included specific recommendations for reform.The ABA submits this brief to share the results of the Virginia Assessment and highlight the4foundational constitutional principles at stake in this case. The ABA believes that the information reflected in the Virginia Assessment will help the Court evaluate the merits of the petition. The ABA also believes that this case presents an ideal opportunity for the Court to address an important, recurring question of federal law: what are the minimum post-conviction procedures that a state must follow when adjudicating claims that a deathsentenced prisoner's constitutional rights have been violated. More specifically, the ABA urges the Court to grant review to provide guidance on two issues: first, in what circumstances may a state postconviction court resolve disputed questions of fact without holding an evidentiary hearing, and, second, when a state court resolves disputed material facts without a hearing, should a federal court on collateral review defer to the state court's factual determinations under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).5INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF
Full participation of all racial and ethnic groups in the legal profession is a compelling state interest. See Point II.A., infra. Such participation ensures that the distinct voices of all segments of society are heard through effective representation for all people. It also creates a more inclusive legal system which better protects the rights of, and is more accessible to, the population that it governs. Furthermore, the full participation of all racial and ethnic groups in this country's legal profession preserves the legitimacy of our legal system and safeguards the integrity of our democratic government. See Point II.B., infra.Because law schools serve as the portal to the legal profession, it is essential that they continue to be permitted to consider race and ethnicity among the myriad of other factors used to determine admissions. Pursuant to this Court's decision in Bakke, law schools have adopted race-conscious admissions policies which further the compelling interest of diversifying the legal profession in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. See Point I., infra. These raceconscious admissions policies have paved the way for significant growth in the number of lawyers from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. See Point II.C., infra. Should the Court proscribe these race-conscious admissions programs, the likely result will be a precipitous decline in the number of lawyers from under-represented racial and ethnic groups. Ironically, that decline would coincide with the rapid growth of minority populations in this country. Such a disparity may foster a perception of illegitimacy of the legal system.States have powerful and legitimate interests in educating their citizenries to enhance the functioning of, and public support for, their own governments. See Point III., infra. This Court should give some deference to Michigan's, like other<<NYLIT~2192841.9:3926D:02/19/03­12:40p>>7states', decision to adopt constitutionally permissible admissions policies to promote the diffusion of knowledge and to protect and enhance the operation and legitimacy of their own systems of government
Because the Final Rule challenged by Petitioners deprives death row prisoners of competent representation by counsel, this case involves an issue of exceptional importance.As this Court has recognized, counsel in postconviction capital representation must have expertise beyond the skill of many appointed counsel. See McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 854 n.2 (1994). The Final Rule thwarts Congress' intent that expedited habeas corpus proceedings pursuant to chapter 154 of title 28 of the United States Code ("Chapter 154") be permissible only where Stateappointed defense counsel have the high-level1 This brief was not authored in whole or in part by counsel for a party, and no party or counsel for a party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No one other than the ABA or its members made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. Neither this brief nor the decision to file it should be interpreted as reflecting the views of any judicial member of the ABA. No inference should be drawn that any member of the ABA Judicial Division Council participated in the preparation of this brief or in the adoption or endorsement of the positions in it. This brief was not circulated to any member of the Judicial Division Council prior to filing.2expertise and experience necessary to undertake such expedited proceedings.Chapter 154 requires that States must, as a condition of instituting such expedited proceedings, "establish[] a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in State postconviction proceedings." However, the Final Rule failed to provide standards that will ensure States that are certified by the U.S. Attorney General have the competence to represent capital defendants, particularly in expedited proceedings. The Final Rule therefore is inconsistent with Congress' intent and this Court's rulings on what it takes to provide adequate representation of a capital defendant in habeas litigation. Without adequately trained and experienced counsel, any one of a number of issues could go unaddressed, potentially resulting in the unwarranted dismissal of a death-row inmate's postconviction claims.The Final Rule contains no meaningfulsubstantive competency criteria. It does not, forexample, reference objective standards such as theABAGuidelines,availableatwww.ambar.org/2003guidelines, which have beenwidely cited and utilized by courts as guides toimportant counsel qualifications and reasonablecounsel performance in capital cases. Further, theFinal Rule's inclusion of a "catch-all" provision, whichallows the Attorney General to certify a State if itsappointment mechanism appears to "otherwisereasonably assure a level of proficiency appropriateto State post-conviction litigation in capital cases,"effectively eliminates any requirement that3determinations of attorney competence be based on substantive criteria. Hence, the Attorney General's certification of States' mechanisms for appointment of habeas counsel under the Final Rule could essentially be arbitrary.These fundamental defects in the Final Rule are a life-and-death matter for capital defendants throughout the nation. Yet the Ninth Circuit determined it could not address those failings on the merits. The Ninth Circuit was wrong.Petitioners have standing to sue in this case. The Final Rule fundamentally alters the manner in which capital counsel must advise and represent their clients, creating actual and imminent harm. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).Under the Final Rule, Petitioners cannot predict whether a habeas petitioner's filing window is 180 days or 365 days until the Attorney General rules on a State's application for certification. Faced with this uncertainty, Petitioners must choose between conducting a thorough factual and legal investigation, which can easily take as much as a year, and compressing such an investigation into a shortened timeframe to avoid missing critical statutory deadlines, thereby forfeiting comprehensive review of their clients' cases. This Court has recognized the danger of rushed habeas petitions, noting the "time needed by habeas counsel to investigate claims" and "the harms created by lastminute petitions in capital cases." Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314, 330 (1996).Uncertain whether they will be subject to expedited proceedings, Petitioners' attorney members4are necessarily forced to plan for such proceedings, even though that may mean disregarding their obligations to their clients under the ABA Guidelines. Guideline 10.8, for example, provides that an attorney should consider and assert all potential legal claims after "thoroughly investigat[ing] the basis for each potential claim before reaching a conclusion as to whether it should be asserted . . . ." ABA Guidelines, § 10.8(A)(2). The need to conduct such an investigation in 180 days, solely due to the possibility of expedited proceedings, works an immediate and palpable harm on Petitioners by fundamentally undermining their ability to fulfill their professional obligations.Petitioners have standing not only to sue on behalf of their attorney members, but also in their own right as legal organizations. Under Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982), an organization has standing to sue where the conduct being challenged impinges on the organization's ability to carry out its mission. Petitioners' ability to perform their organizational missions--to provide high-quality legal representation to capital defendants in post-conviction proceedings--is fundamentally and immediately undermined by the Final Rule.The uncertainty created by the Final Rule is not mere "cost of doing business" for defense counsel organizations such as Petitioners. It is a particularized injury that has immediate impact. Review is warranted to correct the Ninth Circuit's failure properly to apply Havens and the principles that this Court and courts of appeals have established in other organizational standing cases.

 Clients are not commodities, and neither law firms nor lawyers own their clients or their clients' matters. The California Rules and the Rules of Professional Conduct adopted in every jurisdiction, as well as the ABA Model Rules, are based in part on a client's fundamental and unfettered right to select, retain, and change counsel at any time. Those Rules are not affected by a law firm's dissolution, even when a client's hourly rate matter is thereafter handled at a new firm by a former partner of the dissolved firm. The entitlement of a dissolved firm, under the unfinished business rule, to all the profits onsubject to the laws and rules of other jurisdictions. See Thelen LLP v. Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 736 F.3d 213, 220 (2d Cir. 2013) (applying New York law to a limited liability partnership governed by California law).5such matters, however, is inconsistent with the ethical obligations that the new firm and former partner of the dissolved firm have to the client, as set out in the Rules adopted by the applicable jurisdiction.First, the Rules of Professional Conduct, in protecting the rights of a client, govern the legal fees a lawyer and firm can charge and collect from the client, and how they can divide those fees with another lawyer or firm. These rules cannot be squared with the unfinished business rule's requirement that profits on hourly rate matters be paid to a dissolved firm after the client has moved its matter--and thus has discharged the dissolved firm--to a former partner's new firm. Contrary to the Rules requiring that a lawyer and firm can only retain legal fees based on legal work performed, the unfinished business rule obligates the new firm nevertheless to pay over legal fees to the dissolved firm, which no longer represents the client and is no longer in business. Further, contrary to the Rules governing the division of legal fees between two firms, the unfinished business rule requires that the new firm divide legal fees with the dissolved firm without client written consent and in a manner that has no relationship to the services provided. The ABA asserts that these6two provisions alone are sufficient to establish that the unfinished business rule cannot be applied to a client's hourly rate matters.Second, because it is conceded that the unfinished business rule does not apply if a lawyer leaves a firm prior to its dissolution, a lawyer may feel impelled under the Rules of Professional Conduct to leave a firm at the first signs of financial trouble, to ensure that the lawyer or the new firm will not be required to divide fees with a dissolved firm that performed no legal services. Further, because those rules require lawyers, when leaving, to avoid "reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the[ir] client[s]," California Rule 3-700(A)(2), lawyers may also be impelled to counsel a client to move its hourly rate matters before the firm dissolves. The ABA asserts that none of these actions should be necessary under law, equity or policy because, as the District Court concluded, a dissolved firm has no property interest in a client's hourly rate matters on which an application of the unfinished business rule might be based.7

 This Court's determination of whether due process under the New HampshireConstitution requires court-appointed counsel for indigent parent-defendants, in order to protect their fundamental right to parent, requires the balancing of three factors--(1) theprivate interest at stake, (2) the risk of error and the value of procedural safeguards, and (3)the state's interest.

This is especially true where the opposing party is the State. As to the third, state's interest factor, the ABA's investigation shows that the interests of both the parent and the state are best served where indigent parent-defendants are represented. The ABA respectfully suggests that the evidence and analysis relevant to these two factors is so compelling in most, if not all, abuse and neglect proceedings involving indigent parent-defendants, that a case-by-case balancing of the factors should be rejected in favor of a rule requiring the appointment of counsel] for indigent parent-defendants in all such proceedings.The evidence and analysis supporting the ABA's policy includes the fact that a substantial majority of states have recognized an unqualified right to counsel for indigentparent-defendants in child custody proceedings. Similarly, other industrial democraciesprovide indigent parent-defendants with such right to counsel. The ABA respectfully submits that this Court should require no less as a matter of due process under the New Hampshire Constitution.* Although of whetherJn re Shelby R. resulted in a or not a natural parent'splurality role inruling, the the familyCourt is awas not split fundamentalon the libertyquestion interestprotected by the State Constitution.

Several of this Court's decisions reflect a developing appreciation of the injury that can be inflicted when a "disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected." Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 634 (1996). But whereas many of those cases required the Court to consider the interplay of gender and sexual orientation discrimination as a matter of constitutional doctrine, the case at hand presents a simple question of statutory construction. The issue presented here is whether Title VII's express statutory prohibition against discrimination "because of * * * sex" encompasses discrimination against someone because that person's sexual orientation or transgender status does not conform to traditional stereotypes for persons of that ascribed sex. This Court has already answered that question, in substance, when it held in cases like Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), and Los Angeles Department of Water & Power v. Man-7hart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978), that Title VII bars discrimination on the basis of sex stereotyping.In passing Title VII, "Congress made the simple but momentous announcement that sex, race, religion, and national origin" have no relevance "to the selection, evaluation, or compensation of employees." Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 239 (plurality opinion). Indeed, the statute facially reflects Congress' intent to bar employment decisions on the basis of sex. In now-familiar language, Title VII forbids an employer to "fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," or to "limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's * * * sex." 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)-(2) (emphases added).This prohibition embodies a "broad rule of workplace equality," Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 22 (1993), that "strike[s] at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment" based on sex, among other protected characteristics, Manhart, 435 U.S. at 707 n.13 (emphasis added), "regardless of whether the discrimination" targets "majorities or minorities," Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 71-72 (1977). Consistent with these broadly sweeping objectives, this Court has long held that sex discrimination unravels the fabric of American society by excluding people from participating in public and private life, and offends our8Nation's shared commitment to individual dignity by classifying people based on their sex rather than their individual qualities and attributes.Reading Title VII to prohibit discrimination on the basis of the stereotypes regarding sexual orientation and transgender status that society ascribes to individuals because of sex honors the express text of the statute as construed through decades of this Court's antidiscrimination jurisprudence. "[C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, [the] * * * judicial inquiry is complete." Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 461-462 (2002). In accordance with the text's plain meaning, people experience discrimination "because of * * * sex" when they have been treated differently than they would have been had their sex been different. If a person is fired because he is a man who loves a man but would not have been fired if he had been a woman who loves a man, that person has been discriminated against "because of * * * sex." If a person is fired for presenting and identifying as female, because the employer ascribes that person as male, but would not have been fired if the employer ascribed that person as female, the employee has been fired "because of * * * sex."This Court's precedent makes clear that this kind of "but for" discrimination lies at the heart of antidiscrimination protections. In the context of race, for example, the Court made clear that anti-miscegenation laws were a form of discrimination on the basis of race, notwithstanding their "equal application" to white and9black persons, because a law that "makes the color of a person's skin the test of whether his conduct is a criminal offense" is one that restricts rights "on account of race." Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1967). The Court has construed Title VII to employ a similar "but for" test. Manhart, 435 U.S. at 711. The acts challenged here easily qualify; they would not have been taken had the employee's sex been different from the one ascribed to them by their employers. The discrimination they experienced was therefore "because of * * * sex."Failure to recognize these forms of discrimination would leave unchecked a significant and pervasive source of workplace discrimination, affecting a broad swath of individuals with minority sexual orientation or transgender status. More than 4% of the American workforce self-identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT), and numerous studies have highlighted the severe economic disparities and workplace instability faced by LGBT persons.5 Indeed, data collected by Gallup Inc. suggests that LGBT persons have significantly higher unemployment rates, 9%, than nonLGBT persons, 5%. The consequences borne from these discriminatory workplace disadvantages abridge LGBT persons' ability to participate fully in the larger economy and represent a deprivation of LGBT persons' entitlement under Title VII to equal treatment in employment.5 See, e.g., Sandy E. James et al., 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey 11, 12, 14 (2016), http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/ files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF.1
The Kansas statute at issue in this case allows a defendant to be convicted of a crime and sentenced to death, even when his mental disorder prevented him from understanding that his actions were wrong. For nearly four decades, the ABA has consistently opposed state statutes that permit this result, given their incompatibility with the Anglo-American legal tradition and with commonly-accepted rationales for punishment.I. Beginning in 1981, the ABA embarked on a project of unprecedented depth and scope to develop the Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards. The ABA convened nearly eighty experts in law and mental health in six task forces for this interdisciplinary effort. With5respect to the insanity defense, these experts researched and drafted a set of ten Standards outlining how courts should approach the defense and issues related to it. Those Standards were presented to and adopted by the ABA's House of Delegates as official ABA policy. Task force members subsequently drafted an accompanying Commentary that was published in 1986. The Mental Health Standards were updated again in 2016 after a similarly comprehensive review, with an updated Commentary to be published in the future. The ABA's Standards and Commentary have been repeatedly cited for their thoroughness, thoughtfulness, and fidelity to the best values of the American criminal justice system.II. Specifically, Standard 7.6-1 (and its associated Commentary) addresses the insanity defense. The ABA's review of the history and policies underlying Anglo-American criminal law found that for centuries, criminal culpability has required proof of morally blameworthy conduct. Thus in the Anglo-American tradition, morally blameless individuals with mental disorders have been excused from punishment for their otherwise criminal acts. To help define this class of morally blameless criminal defendants consistent with this age-old tradition, the ABA formulated a test that would excuse from responsibility any person who--due to their mental disorder--was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of their criminal conduct. Although the precise test used for the insanity defense has varied over time and by jurisdiction, the core principle underlying the defense has remained the same: only a morally blameworthy defendant should receive criminal6punishment.III. In chronicling and endorsing the affirmative insanity defense, the ABA Commentary specifically considered and rejected the kind of `mens rea' statute at issue in this case. As the Commentary explained, the mens rea approach is not the equivalent of an insanity defense, nor anything close to a redefinition of it. To the contrary, the mens rea approach omits the defining feature of the criminal law's traditional treatment of people with mental disorders: an assessment of the moral blameworthiness of the defendant's conduct. Statutes that prevent judges and juries from making such an assessment seriously interfere with the exercise of humane judgment. This is because a defendant may intend to do an act that causes harm (i.e., have the requisite statutory mens rea) without actually understanding that the act is morally wrong--which is an indispensable predicate for criminal punishment. Thus a psychotic or delusional defendant could be convicted under a statute like the one at issue in this case without the prosecution ever having to demonstrate that the defendant is morally accountable for their actions. Such a result is fundamentally at odds with centuries of the Anglo-American legal tradition
The ABA submits this amicus brief for the limited purpose of describing its experience and that of the federal courts regarding efforts to protect immigrant detainees from unconstitutionally prolonged detention, and why this experience supports the Court of Appeals' determination to interpret the relevant statutes as fixing a time limit by which hearings must be conducted. The ABA agrees with the Court of Appeals that the status quo of relying on immigrants to challenge their detention period case-by-case--typically through habeas petitions--has led to serious due process problems. Many immigrants have been detained for years under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(b), 1226(c), or 1226(a) without a bond hearing to determine the lawfulness of their detention. The Court of Appeals' approach of interpreting the statutes to include a time limit by which the Government must conduct such hearings after the immigrant is first detained best avoids detention that violates an immigrant's due process rights. Decades of experience with individual cases in the Ninth Circuit have confirmed that--absent a temporal limit-- the Government has not provided immigrants a timely hearing on whether their continued confinement was justified based on flight risk and danger.Because due process protections apply to immigration detention, the Government must, within a reasonable time, justify continued confinement. Specifically, it must show, at a hearing before a neutral decision maker, that the particular detainee presents a sufficient risk of danger or flight to outweigh their constitutionally protected liberty interests. Where, as here, Congress does not expressly provide the specific timing and method by which7detained immigrants can test the legal basis for their detention, the canon of constitutional avoidance requires the Court to construe the applicable statutes to provide some means of testing whether detention is justified. Under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, the Court interprets an ambiguous statute in a manner that avoids serious constitutional problems. Where Congress does not expressly set a time limit or establish a procedure for the Government to justify continued detention, the courts must construe the statutes in a manner that ensures compliance with the Constitution's due process requirements.The Court of Appeals correctly determined that the rules of statutory construction, as informed by the Due Process Clause and prior case law, require that a hearing be granted to respondents within six months of their detention to determine whether they present a danger or a flight risk. The extensive history of these proceedings confirms that, absent such a deadline for the Government to conduct a hearing, individuals who may well be entitled to release are confined to languish in prison-like conditions for years. The Due Process Clause requires a bright-line rule fixing the period by which the Government must demonstrate at a bond hearing that continued detention is required because of an issue of safety or because the detainee presents an ongoing flight risk.The case-by-case approach for evaluating the reasonableness of an immigrant's detention has resulted in unreasonably long and unpredictable detentions in the circuits that have adopted this kind of rule. These decisions typically depend more on the detention location and docket size of the court rather than on any consistent set of principles.8This Court has previously approved a bright-line rule for assessing when detention of individuals with final orders becomes presumptively unreasonable, and has also approved bright-line rules in other contexts. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 699-701 (2001); Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 (2005); see e.g., Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373, 380-81 (1966) ("Schnackenberg") (plurality opinion). The ABA thus urges this Court to affirm the use of a bright-line rule here to require bond hearings whenever detention under the relevant statutes exceeds a specific timeframe, and conduct periodic bond hearings thereafter. Such bright-line rules "provide some degree of certainty" and "articulate more clearly the boundaries of what is permissible" under the Constitution. County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 (1991) ("McLaughlin") (announcing bright-line presumption that probable cause hearing within 48 hours is generally timely under the Fourth Amendment).Finally, the Government does not meet its due process obligations by requiring detainees to file petitions for habeas corpus following their unduly lengthy confinement. Due process rights and the habeas privilege are distinct. Indeed, this Court has held that due process requires an administrative hearing to test detention without regard to whether a habeas remedy is also available. Even apart from the objectively inconsistent outcomes resulting from the case-by-case habeas approach, habeas procedures are particularly ill-suited to these circumstances for three reasons. First, ABA practitioners' experience as well as court data confirm that requiring detained immigrants to initiate habeas proceedings dramatically reduces their ability to obtain relief, because they rarely have access to counsel to navigate complex habeas procedures. Ingrid9V. Eagly & Steven Shafer, A National Study of Access to Counsel in Immigration Court, 164 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 32 (2015) (showing that only 14% of detained immigrants were represented by counsel). Second, because detainees cannot file habeas petitions until their claims are ripe, immigrants must wait until their detention has already become unreasonable before even beginning the lengthy habeas process--thus further compounding the delay. Lastly, as the lower courts have themselves made clear, reliance on federal courts with crowded dockets necessarily prolongs detention, given the numbers of detainees and the cumbersome nature of habeas proceedings.Absent a bright-line rule requiring a hearing before an immigration judge automatically after a fixed period of time, both Government officials and federal courts will be required to speculate regarding the point at which any immigrant's detention has likely become unreasonable. In Demore, a member of the Court's majority observed that an immigrant "could be entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention became unreasonable or unjustified." Demore, 538 U.S. at 532 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Current U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office of Immigration Review ("EOIR") statistics reveal that, in the thirteen years since Demore, thousands of immigrants have been subjected to detention for years, without any determination that they presented a danger or flight risk. See EOIR, Certain Criminal Charge Completion Statistics (2016), available at https://w w w.justice.gov/sites/default/files/pages/ attachments/2016/08/25/criminal-charge-completionstatistics-201608.pdf (showing thousands of detainee removal cases that lasted over 24 months from receipt10to initial case completion/decision, including in the period from 2003 to 2015). The Government has thus proved incapable of safeguarding detained immigrants' constitutional and statutory rights absent courtmandated, easily applied procedures. The experience of ABA practitioners, current EOIR statistics, the record below and the documented experience of prolonged detainees in other circuits all confirm that the concern expressed in the Demore concurrence is indeed reality. Thus, this Court should uphold the Ninth Circuit's ruling establishing a bright-line temporal limit on detention, after which time the Government must provide detainees with a bond hearing to determine if their continued detention is warranted by danger or flight risk and must provide periodic hearings thereafter
Six years ago, this Court clarified that the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment requires courts to determine that a capital prisoner has a rational understanding that he is to be executed for the crimes for which he has been convicted and that his execution will result in his death, stating, "A prisoner's awareness of the State's rationale for an execution is not the same as a rational understanding of it." Panetti, 551 U.S. at 959. The Court thus confirmed capital punishment's retributive purpose, stating that "[g]ross delusions7 Brief Amicus Curiae of the American Bar Association in Support of the Petitioner in Panetti v. Quarterman, February 21, 2007, at 6, 2007 WL 579237, citing ABA Policy #122A, Report at 16.6 stemming from a severe mental disorder may put that awareness in a context so far removed from reality that the punishment can serve no proper purpose." Id. at 960.Since Panetti, however, several state courts-- including the Florida Supreme Court in Petitioner's case--have read Panetti as having made no change in their governing legal standard. These courts continue to conclude that a prisoner is competent merely because he is aware the State intends to execute him for a crime. Other courts conflate the Panetti test with their own statutory "awareness" tests. And, as the Eleventh Circuit's decision in this case demonstrates, still other courts have affirmed a state court's use of the awareness test on the ground that the law, even after Panetti, requires further clarification.The Court should grant the petition for a writ of certiorari to clarify the proper scope of the Eighth Amendment standard that must be applied
International treaties constitute federal law, and as such are binding on the United States as a whole and preempt any conflicting state laws through the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77 ("Vienna Convention" or "Convention") is a treaty, duly ratified by the United States Senate. Article 36 of the Vienna Convention guarantees to the citizens of all signatory nations effective notice and access to consular services if they are arrested in another signatory nation. The companion Optional Protocol, to which the United States was also a signatory until February 28, 2005, provides for compulsory jurisdiction by the International Court of Justice ("ICJ") over all signatory nations to resolve disputes concerning the interpretation of the Convention's5 See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (rev. ed. 2003).4provisions, including Article 36. See Optional Protocol, 21 U.S.T. 325, art. I.The United States's withdrawal from the Optional Protocol in 2005 does not alter the United States's obligation to comply with judgments in cases to which the United States was a party and which were issued by the ICJ before its withdrawal.6 Both the rule of law, and the United States's commitment as a signatory to the United Nations Charter Article 94(1), require that all courts within the United States honor and enforce such judgments. See 59 Stat. 1031, T.S. 993 ("Each Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the [ICJ] in any case to which it is a party.").In the instant case, the State of Texas has violated Supremacy Clause principles by declining, in a state postconviction proceeding, to enforce an ICJ decision to which the United States is bound. The application of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention to Petitioner, Mr. Medellin, was formally decided in a 2004 ICJ case filed by Mexico against the United States, on behalf of Mr. Medellin and certain other Mexican citizens.7 The ICJ ruled in that case that Texas's failure to advise Petitioner of his right to consular services violated both Mexico's and Petitioner's rights under the Convention. See Case Concerning Avena & Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U.S.), 2004 I.C.J. 12 (Mar. 31, 2004) ("Avena Judgment") ¶¶ 106, 153(4)-(7). Although the ICJ denied Mexico's request for annulment of the convictions6 The ABA has not taken any position on the United States' withdrawal from the Optional Protocol and does not intend to take any position on this decision through submission of this brief.7 Mexico initially filed on behalf of 54 of its nationals, which was subsequently reduced to 52 at the time of decision. The ICJ concluded that Mexico failed to prove a violation with respect to one of the 52 remaining Mexican nationals. See Avena Judgment ¶ 74.5and sentences, id. ¶ 123, the ICJ held that United States courts must provide review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences involving the violations it had found. Id. ¶¶ 121, 128-34. The ICJ also specifically held that applying procedural default doctrines to bar consideration of the Mexican nationals' Vienna Convention claims would itself violate the Vienna Convention. Id. ¶¶ 112-13. 8Notwithstanding the Avena Judgment, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held in the proceeding below that Mr. Medellin's claim was foreclosed by Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S. Ct. 2669 (2006). See Ex parte Medellín, __S.W.3d __, 2006 WL 3302639, at *9 (Nov. 15, 2006). In so holding, the Texas court did not consider whether the Avena Judgment would be binding in the cases of the 51 nationals, including Petitioner, whose cases the ICJ specifically adjudicated. Thus, unlike Sanchez-Llamas, this case implicates the United States's legal duty to honor the judgments entered by the ICJ during the time the Optional Protocol was in effect. See Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Petitioner at 20, Medellin v. Texas,8 The Avena Judgment developed and strengthened the ICJ's earlier judgment in the LaGrand Case, a case brought by Germany against the United States also alleging violations of the Vienna Convention. LaGrand Case (Germany v. U.S.), 2001 I.C.J. 466 (June 27) ("LaGrand "). Unlike in Avena, by the time the ICJ ruled in LaGrand, both of the German nationals in question had been executed. The ICJ held in LaGrand that: (1) Article 36 of the Vienna Convention provides "individual rights" to foreign nationals; (2) applying procedural default rules to prevent detained individuals from challenging their convictions and sentences on the ground that their rights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention had been violated, itself violated the Vienna Convention; and (3) if the United States failed to comply with Article 36 in future cases involving German nationals subjected to severe penalties, it must "allow the review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence by taking account of the violation of the rights set forth in the Convention." LaGrand ¶¶ 77, 90-91, 125.6No. 06-984 (Mar. 2007) ("[Sanchez-Llamas] involved the question whether an ICJ interpretation should be given effect in this country's courts. Because it did not present the question whether an ICJ decision should be given effect, it did not resolve that question.").The Avena Judgment was rendered prior to February 28, 2005, while the United States was a party to the Optional Protocol and thus legally bound to abide by the results of the Optional Protocol's dispute resolution process. Consistent with that federal obligation, the Avena Judgment's conclusions--namely, that the Vienna Convention's consular notice provision was violated, and that this violation is not subject to domestic procedural default rules--must be given full effect in our domestic legal system in cases involving a party subject to that decision. This obligation is not affected by an assertion that a United States court might have resolved the issues in that case differently in the first instance. See, e.g., Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 203 (1895) ("[T]he merits of the case should not . . . be tried afresh . . . upon the mere assertion . . . that the judgment was erroneous in law or in fact.").Structural constitutional principles beyond the Supremacy Clause itself also require that United States courts give effect to the Avena Judgment. The need for uniform conduct among the states in matters of international relations is essential to effecting the treaty powers enjoyed by the President and the Senate, and must take precedence over the policy interests underlying procedural rules--interests that are themselves subject to balancing. The interests of comity would not be undermined by enforcing federal treaty obligations in state post-conviction proceedings. Moreover, the burden on state courts to resolve the claims of the named individuals who had their rights determined in the Avena Judgment would be minimal given the relatively small number of individuals who are the subject of that decision.7None of the potential problems with reconciling the ruling of the ICJ in Avena with the requirements of federal habeas that this Court noted in Medellin v. Dretke, 544 U.S. 660 (2005), exist here. The structural source of those potential problems was the parity between treaties and federal statutes--in particular, between the Vienna Convention and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. Here, however, it is a conflict between a federal treaty obligation and a state procedural rule that must be reconciled, and it is clear that, under the Supremacy Clause, the federal treaty obligations must prevail.Accordingly, the ABA urges this Court to hold, as a matter of law, that the Avena Judgment must be given effect as binding upon the courts of Texas pursuant to federal law
The present case involves numerous serious allegations of non-disclosure that, post-trial, a court must evaluate under this Court's Brady jurisprudence. However, a prosecutor's pre-trial ethical disclosure obligations, as governed by the attorney disciplinary rules of the state or jurisdiction in which the prosecutor practices, are separate from and broader than the constitutional standards. Specifically, ABA Model Rule 3.8(d) mandates disclosure of exculpatory and mitigating evidence without regard to materiality. This Rule's widespread acceptance is reflected in the fact that 49 states, including Louisiana, as well as the District of Columbia, the United States Virgin Islands, and Guam have adopted ethics rules that include a provision identical or substantially similar to it.10 Similarly, various provisions of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards promote broad disclosure of all exculpatory evidence, without regard to the materiality standard that is required for post-trial analysis under Brady. Accordingly, this Court should again recognize that a prosecutor's pre-trial ethical disclosure obligations are distinct from the constitutional standards that control a court's post-trial determination of Brady claims.10 See Appendix B, "Jurisdictional Survey of Provisions Analogous to ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8(d)" ("Jurisdictional Survey") (listing ethics rules based on ABA Model Rule 3.8(d)).
The requirement that there be a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine elements in the prior art is a useful and appropriate way to provide objectivity and avoid hindsight in obviousness determinations. The teachingsuggestion-motivation inquiry is deeply rooted in case law and finds support in this Court's decision in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1 (1966). The inquiry looks to both the explicit and implicit teachings of the prior art, the explicit and implicit knowledge of the skilled artisan, and the nature of the problem to be solved. The particular manner in which implicit teachings and knowledge may be used in an evidentiary-based analysis, though not developed in the opinion on review, is clearly developed in other Federal Circuit opinions.Abandoning the teaching-suggestion-motivation inquiry as urged by the Petitioner would significantly weaken the patent system by creating a less objective and less predictable methodology for determining patentability. Such3 http://www.abanet.org/leadership/2006/annual/DAILY_JOURNAL.pdf.3a result would stifle innovation by effectively disqualifying many new technologies from patent protection and by increasing the time and expense associated with patent procurement. A less objective methodology would also hinder innovation by increasing the frequency and expense and decreasing the predictability of litigation.Fundamentally changing the method for determining obviousness would have far-reaching economic and technological implications, and could be expected to affect different industries in many different ways. Congress is in a better position to investigate whether fundamental change is needed and decide what, if any, changes should be made. This case presents no reason to depart from longstanding and sound legal precedent. The ABA respectfully submits that the question before this Court should be answered in the negative

The writ of habeas corpus is the cornerstone of the rule of law and should not be weakened by exceptions of the kind relied on by the Court of Appeals. The Founders recognized the critical role of the writ in our Constitution. History, dating back to the Magna Carta, taught them that executive detention without judicial review is anathema to the rule of law. The inclusion of the Suspension Clause in the Constitution reflects their judgment that the writ is mostneeded when it, and the rule of law, are under the most intense assault and that exceptions to the writ, even in times° Availableat http://www. abanet.org/poladv/letters/antiterror/051114letter_detainees.(pldasft visited Aug. 20, 2007).5of emergency, are inconsistent with the rulethreaten to produce tyranny.

The ABA's personal solicitation ban, Florida's Canon 7C(1), and the similar personal solicitation bans adopted by 29 other states, support the states' compelling interest in protecting the integrity of their judicial systems. These bans are narrowly tailored to add ress the potential for corruption and the appearance of corruption of state judges by removing them from the quid of a potential quid pro quo, without limiting their ability to communicate their views and qualifications for office, or to form campaign committees to solicit funds to support their election efforts.The concerns that motivated the adoption of these personal solicitation bans, and that support their continued enforcement, are not inchoate. In Simes v. Ark. Judicial Discipline & Disability Comm'n, 368 Ark. 577, 247 S.W.3d 876 (Ark. 2007), for example, the Arkansas Supreme Court6disciplined a sitting judge who had personally called two lawyers who appeared before him (one of whom had cases pending before the judge) and asked them to contribute to his reelection campaign. The Florida Supreme Court, in this case, disciplined a lawyer who sent a personallysigned mailing asking people to contribute to her judicial campaign. These two cases lie within the continuum of direct solicitation conduct by judicial candidates. Without the ban in place, these and other personal solicitations will not only be permissible, but will also become commonplace, compounding the current public perception that campaign contributions are affecting judicial decisions.The First Amendment does not require this result. This Court previously upheld a similar solicitation ban in McConnell v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 540 U.S. 93, 182 (2003), overruled in part on other grounds by Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 558 U.S. 310 (2010). In McConnell, this Court applied the "closely drawn" scrutiny it had applied to campaign contribution regulations in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (per curiam). This Court should apply that reasoning here and hold that Canon 7C(1) does not violate the First Amendment.Even if this Court were to apply strict scrutiny, however, the Florida Supreme Court should still be affirmed because Canon 7C(1) is narrowly tailored to the state's compelling interest in protecting its judiciary's integrity and does not prohibit judicial candidates from discussing their qualifications or announcing their views. It only removes candidates from the "ask."Today, rules like Florida's Canon 7C(1) are even more important for the avoidance of the actuality and7appearance of quid pro quo. As the pressure to spend more on judicial campaigns increases and as interest groups become important funding sources, the bans protect against a public perception that judicial candidates are personally soliciting funds from contributors who may expect more in return than judicial competence.States should be allowed to protect their judicial systems through campaign bans that limit only a judicial candidate's personal solicitation while serving an interest of the highest order: countering the public perception that money influences judicial decisions
Congress created an express pathway for patent applicants to obtain de novo review of the PTO's denial of their applications: a civil action in district court under 35 U.S.C. § 145. Section 145 provides an alternative to a direct appeal of PTO decisions to the court of appeals. Congress imposed only one qualification on an applicant's choice of using that pathway: "All the expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant." 35 U.S.C. § 145. For nearly two centuries, the phrase "all the expenses of the proceedings" has been understood to mean that the applicant must pay only the PTO's out-of-pocket expenses for the proceedings, such as travel costs and expert witness fees. The PTO now urges a radical, novel departure from that longstanding interpretation, namely, that the provision requires the applicant to pay for the government's salaried attorneys any time the applicant invokes Section 145, even if the applicant prevails against the government in the proceedings.3 See Resolution 108A, at https://www.americanbar.org/news/ reporter_resources/midyear-meeting-2016/house-of-delegatesresolutions/108a.html.3If accepted, the PTO's newfound interpretation would have intolerable results. The doors of justice should be open to all, regardless of individual prosperity. But the PTO's interpretation would mean that applicants' wealth would determine their access to the pathway to justice provided by Congress. That interpretation would shut the door to the congressionally created Section 145 pathway for applicants lacking funds to pay for the federal government's lawyers. They would be blocked from the benefits of the Section 145 pathway--including de novo review of the denial of their applications and the ability to introduce new evidence in district court--solely because of their inability to pay. Meanwhile, those benefits would remain open to large corporations and affluent individuals able to shoulder the burden of paying for the government's lawyers.This would contrast starkly with the purpose of fee-shifting provisions. When Congress has enacted fee-shifting provisions in other statutes, it has generally done so to promote access to justice--for example, provisions in civil rights statutes allowing prevailing plaintiffs to obtain fees. To the ABA's knowledge, Congress has never enacted a feeshifting provision that shifts only the government's fees onto private parties--much less a provision doing so even if the government loses in the litigation.Additionally, the statutory text does not show a congressional intent to require patent applicants to pay the government's attorneys' fees. Under traditional rules of construing fee-shifting provisions, the "expenses of the proceedings" provision in Section 145 should be read to exclude attorneys' fees. The4background presumption is the American Rule: each litigant pays its own attorneys' fees, win or lose. Congress can depart from that rule and enact feeshifting provisions, but it must do so in a clear and explicit manner. The phrase "expenses of the proceedings" is not the type of clear and explicit statement required to overcome the presumption that the American Rule applies. That phrase falls far short of the level of clarity required for a novel statute shifting only the government's attorneys' fees onto private litigants--especially if the fee shifting would occur regardless of who wins.Congress does not hide elephants in mouseholes, Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001); here, it did not hide an unprecedented government-only, regardless-of-outcome, attorney-feeshifting intent in the word "expenses." There is no evidence Congress intended Section 145 to be a roadblock to justice, and the Court should not interpret it that way
 It is important for the United States to comply with the international treaties that this country has ratified, and to do so in a way that does not encourage other countries to disregard their obligations under those treaties. Compliance in a manner that subjects this country to substantial international criticism undermines the effects of existing treaties and the government's ability to negotiate new ones. Congress made a judgment that Section 514 was the appropriate way to comply with the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement,` and would result in important protections abroad for U.S. authors. Congress had the power under the Constitution to enact Section 514. The provisions of that Section, and of the copyright law generally, adequately protect Petitioners' First Amendment interests. The plain language of the Copyright Clause does not limit Congress's power to grant copyrights only to those works that are not in the public domain. Moreover, the historical record shows that Congress -- including the First Congress, which passed the Copyright Act of 1790 -- has repeatedly extended copyright protection to works in the public domain. Congress has done so on a substantial number of4 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ("TRIPS"), April 15, 1994, 33 LL.M. 1199. 5 Section 514 was passed as part of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Pub. L. No. 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809, 4976 (1994) ""URAA"), codified as amended at 17 U.S.C. Sections 104A, 109.5occasions and in a variety of different circumstances. This history is evidence of the consistent view of Congress that it has the power to restore copyright protection to works that have fallen into the public domain should it desire to do so. See Section A, below.Nor does Congress's exercise of its copyright power in Section 514 violate the First Amendment. The ABA believes that, when evaluating Section 514, deferential review --- and not intermediate scrutiny -- is the appropriate standard of review. Congress did not alter the traditional contours of copyright protection with Section 514; instead, it left in place the two First Amendment accommodations built into copyright law: (1) the "idea/expression dichotomy" and (2) the doctrine of "fair use." As such, under this Court's holding in Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186 (2003), the ABA believes that deferential review of Section 514 is appropriate. A higher level of review is not required merely because some of the Petitioners may have relied on the public domain nature of certain restored works by performing those works before their copyright protection was restored. See Section B.1, below. However, even if this Court applies intermediate scrutiny, Section 514 would be constitutional because Section 514 serves important, interrelated government interests -- the most critical of which is to ensure that the United States is in compliance with its treaty obligations -- and because the means chosen by Congress to further those interests were narrowly tailored to meet that objective. See Section B.2, below.
The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law infringes individual liberty by authorizing the State, through its criminal law, to intrude upon intimate associations, to undermine bodily integrity, and to invade the privacy of the home. It also irrationally singles out a discrete group for second-class treatment. The statute thereby undermines the rule of law and should be declared unconstitutional.A. Thirty years ago, amicus curiae, the American Bar Association (ABA), adopted a policy urging States to4repeal laws that criminalize private, noncommercial sexual contact between consenting adults. That 1973 ABA policy, like the similar recommendation of the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, was rooted in concerns that criminal sodomy statutes undermined the rule of law because no legitimate government interest warranted criminalizing the conduct; enforcement required intrusive police investigations; many Americans engaged in the conduct in disregard of the criminal prohibition, thereby undermining the public's respect for the law; the laws were arbitrarily enforced and members of racial minorities tended to be the persons prosecuted; there was a serious question of the statutes' constitutionality; and, although the laws applied to both heterosexual and homosexual conduct, they were most often enforced against, and used to discriminate against, gay men and lesbians. Since 1973, the ABA has adopted a series of other policies that make clear its support for the equal treatment of all persons, regardless of sexual orientation.All but 13 States now have repealed or judicially invalidated their criminal sodomy statutes. Contrary to the practices of an earlier era, state bars across the nation have determined that qualified gay men and lesbians should not be denied admission to the legal profession based on their sexual orientation. A majority of state courts, as well as many national law firms and law schools, have adopted policies prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. The success of those policies demonstrates the irrationality of discrimination based on sexual orientation.The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law and similar statutes, however, continue to stigmatize gay men and lesbians. The laws are used to justify discrimination against gay men and lesbians as second-class citizens not entitled to the same government protections as other members of society. Declaring Texas's Homosexual Conduct Law unconstitutional will remove that untenable justification for such conduct and will vindicate the rule of law.5B. The criminal convictions of petitioners under the Texas statute violate constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests. Although the Court held in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 191 (1986), that "homosexual sodomy" was not protected by the Due Process Clause, that holding is inconsistent with the weight of this Court's modern precedents regarding the Constitution's special protections for intimate association, bodily integrity, and the privacy of the home. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 857 (1992), the Court reaffirmed two lines of precedent that, over more than a hundred years, have recognized that the substantive component of the Due Process Clause protects "liberty relating to intimate relationships" and "personal autonomy and bodily integrity." An adult's right to engage in private, noncommercial, consensual intimate conduct is protected under the rationale of those lines of cases as reiterated and refined in Casey. Bowers departed from those cases by describing the historical right at issue as "homosexual sodomy" and did not take into account the fact that, at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868, nearly all of the States criminalized all sodomy. States' criminal statutes did not single out samesex conduct until the mid-20th Century.To deny same-sex couples protection from criminal prosecution for private noncommercial, consensual sexual conduct is also inconsistent with the Court's decisions that recognize the heightened protection accorded by the Constitution to conduct that takes place in the home. See Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 37 (2001). Bowers relied upon the conclusion that there had been no connection demonstrated between homosexual activity and the family. That connection has since been well documented through census figures that establish that more than one million people in this country live with a same-sex partner, and through studies that indicate, for example, that approximately 22% of partnered lesbians and 5% of partnered gay men are raising children in their homes ­ forming families that are nontraditional, but entitled to constitutional protection from state interference.6Finally, Bowers should be overruled because it is inconsistent with Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996). Romer's holding that the mere desire to make gay men and lesbians "unequal to everyone else" was not a legitimate government interest, id. at 635, is irreconcilable with Bowers' holding that the "belief of a majority of the electorate in Georgia that homosexual sodomy is immoral and unacceptable" is sufficient to justify a criminal sodomy law, 478 U.S. at 196.C. The Texas Homosexual Conduct Law also rests on a classification that is not rationally related to any legitimate government interest and thus violates the Equal Protection Clause. The disparate treatment of homosexual and heterosexual sodomy is a modern development that reflects the unwillingness of the majority to be subject to the same criminal strictures that are imposed on the minority, contrary to a fundamental tenet of the rule of law. There is no relationship between the State's asserted interest in encouraging marriage and biological reproduction, Br. in Opp. 18, and the classification at issue. The State's classification allows unmarried heterosexuals to engage in nonprocreative sexual conduct, but prohibits other unmarried persons (gay and lesbian couples) from engaging in the very same conduct. Tradition and history do not support the State's unequal treatment because sodomy laws singling out same-sex conduct are of only recent vintage. Ultimately, the State's only rationale for the Texas Homosexual Conduct Law is the "communal belief that the [homosexual] conduct is wrong and should be discouraged." Br. in Opp. 19. But that belief is not sufficient to justify a criminal sanction in light of the Court's holding in Romer that mere disapproval of homosexuality does not constitute a "legitimate government purpose" for "singling out a certain class of citizens for disfavored legal status or general hardships." 517 U.S. at 634, 633. Indeed, Texas's admitted practice of rarely enforcing the criminal statute undermines any claim that the statute actually furthers a legitimate state interest.
The court of appeals' invalidation of a portion of Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a), under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, raises important questions about the relationship between trademark validity and trademark registrability, as well as the legal significance of a determination of unregistrability. A correct understanding of those issues is important to answering properly the ultimate question in this case concerning the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The ABA therefore files this brief to rectify errors of basic trademark law in the opinion of the court of appeals and to confirm that: (1) a determination of mark unregistrability does not restrict the mark owner's right to use the mark in commerce; and (2) a determination that a mark is ineligible for registration on the USPTO's Principal Register does not necessarily render that mark invalid and unprotectable; but (3) owners of marks registered on the Principal Register enjoy certain substantive and procedural advantages in litigation to protect their marks that are not available to the owners of unregistered marks
The question in this case is the one left unanswered after Padilla: whether a defendant who received bad legal advice and pleads guilty to a crime--thereby unknowingly subjecting himself to permanent deportation--can be prejudiced by that decision, notwithstanding strong evidence of guilt.To show prejudice under Strickland, a defendant must show that "there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different." Padilla, 559 U.S. at 366 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). The Court of Appeals here in essence adopted a categorical rule--holding that, as a matter of law, Petitioner could never show prejudice, because he confronted strong evidence against him and a near-certain conviction at trial. This categorical approach is inconsistent with both this Court's jurisprudence and the ABA Standards. In fact, a defendant who receives incorrect advice about the immigration consequences of a plea can suffer prejudice under Strickland in at least two important ways.First, having received incorrect advice, a defendant cannot make an informed decision about whether to accept a plea offer or to proceed to trial. In this case, Petitioner faced mandatory deportation if he pled guilty to the charged offense--a fact that he did not know at the time he considered the plea offer. With correct legal advice, however, Petitioner would have viewed his options differently, and rationally could have decided to take his chances at trial, rather than lose his best option at staying in the only home he has known. Second, with bad legal advice, a defendant is6deprived of his ability to negotiate a more favorable plea agreement in the first instance. Our adversarial system relies upon defense counsel to advise not only their clients, but also the prosecution, about collateral immigration consequences, which leads to an informed negotiation over potential pleas and sentences. Counsel's constitutionally deficient advice about the deportation consequences associated with a plea offer can both limit the number and quality of the "alternative courses of action open to the defendant," as well as preclude the defendant's "voluntary and intelligent choice" among those options. See Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56 (1985) (citing North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 31 (1970)). The ABA Standards seek to safeguard against such prejudice
Today's business world is driven in large part by technology and interdependence, and the number of method patents filed in this environment will continue to increase, especially as Internet usage continues to expand. The ABA submits that the induced infringement standard the Federal Circuit majority adopted in Akamai is not appropriate for addressing this reality. Accordingly, the ABA respectfully urges this Court to reject the Federal Circuit's expansive interpretation of § 271(b) and, instead, construe § 271(a) to permit a finding of direct infringement where multiple actors act in concert to perform, or to direct or control the performance of, all of the steps of a method patent as part of a common design or purpose
In Loden v. McCarty, 778 F.3d 484 (5th Cir. 2015), the Fifth Circuit transformed the context-specific holding of Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465 (2007), into a bright-line rule. According to the Fifth Circuit, a capital defendant's waiver of the right to present punishmentphase evidence precludes any inquiry into the prejudicial impact that trial counsel's deficient investigation had on the defendant's waiver decision, even when the court assumes arguendo that trial counsel's mitigation investigation was deficient. This Court should grant certiorari to correct that interpretation of Landrigan.Deficient sentencing investigations adversely affect sentencing outcomes by failing to uncover mitigating evidence, leaving defendants unable to contest statutory aggravators, and reducing the possibility of pleabargaining. By undermining client trust and rapport, they can result in prejudice that can take the form of a waiver like the one at issue in this case. When counsel fails to perform an adequate mitigation investigation, the defendant may be left with few options other than to waive his Eighth Amendment right to present mitigating evidence, or risk putting on a weak or damaging mitigation defense. A waiver induced under such circumstances creates " `a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.' " Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 390 (2005) (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984)).Moreover, the risk that counsel's deficient investigation induced a defendant to waive a sentencing presentation is greatest when counsel's performance is the worst. Thus, the Fifth Circuit's Loden rule perversely requires the least scrutiny in cases in which counsel's mitigation investigation is the most lacking.6Because the Fifth Circuit failed to appreciate the many prejudicial forms that a deficient sentencing investigation can take, it incorrectly read Landrigan as establishing a broad, bright-line rule. The Court should grant certiorari to correct this erroneous conclusion that Landrigan categorically prohibits inquiry into the impact of a deficient mitigation investigation when the defendant declines to present punishmentphase evidence
The question presented in this case is whether a drug possession offense that is a felony under state law, but would be a misdemeanor under federal law, is an "illicit trafficking" "aggravated felony" within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).4 Resolution of this question also has implications for whether certain possession offenses that are not felonies under state law may nevertheless be deemed "illicit trafficking" "aggravated felonies." This amicus curiae brief offers an approach to the statute that is coherent as to both types of offenses.Some courts have deemed offenses such as Petitioner's, that do not involve trafficking and would be misdemeanors under federal law, to be illicit trafficking aggravated felonies because the offenses are state-law felonies. Other courts have deemed offenses that do not involve trafficking and are second or subsequent state-law misdemeanors to be illicit trafficking aggravated felonies, because repeat misdemeanors may be prosecuted as federal-law felonies. Properly read, the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision does not support including either type of offense.The statutory text, structure, and history dictate reading the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision as limited to felonies actually involving trafficking. Simple possession does not constitute "illegal trafficking." Also, in order to be4 The ABA submits this brief in support of Petitioner Jose Antonio Lopez ("Lopez"), but arguments relevant to Petitioner Reymundo Toledo-Flores ("Toledo-Flores") also support reversal in that case. See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 371, 380 (2004) ("[W]e must interpret the statute consistently, whether we encounter its application in a criminal or noncriminal context.").5 an "aggravated felony," a state offense must as a threshold matter be a felony under state law. See infra Section I.Imposing mandatory deportation and other harsh immigration consequences for low-level possession offenses results in a drastic disparity between the direct and collateral consequences of such convictions. This leads not only to individual injustices but also to unanticipated adverse consequences for the integrity and fair and regular operation of the criminal justice system. These concerns support application of the rule of lenity, which requires that any lingering ambiguities in the statute be construed against deportation. These same concerns also support application of the rule of constitutional avoidance, because reading the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision to apply to lowlevel possession offenses may raise problems under the voidfor-vagueness due process doctrine. In light of the disparity between direct and collateral consequences, a non-citizen may lack sufficiently definite warning that a low-level simple possession offense could result in extreme immigration consequences. See infra Section II.The illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision moreover should be construed so as to avoid problems of non-uniformity in immigration law. Congress is presumed to legislate with uniformity in mind. Immigration law uniformity is also grounded in the "uniform Rule of Naturalization" clause of the U.S. Constitution. Applying the illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision to state-law possession offenses that are misdemeanors under either federal or state law raises non-uniformity problems. Immigration consequences may turn on the happenstance of which state law a non-citizen was convicted under. The doctrine of constitutional avoidance counsels that the statute be construed to avoid such problems. See infra Section III.The ABA therefore supports Petitioner's argument that a simple possession offense, even if a state-law felony, cannot6 be an illicit trafficking aggravated felony if it would be a federal misdemeanor. However, a state's classification of a possession offense as a misdemeanor may not be disregarded simply because the offense might be prosecuted as a federal felony. Deeming either type of offense to be an illicit trafficking aggravated felony: (1) cannot be reconciled with the aggravated felony definition's text; (2) adversely affects the administration of criminal justice and the uniformity of immigration law; and (3) is contrary to the rules of lenity and constitutional avoidance. We submit that Congress never intended such a result. The illicit trafficking aggravated felony provision should be construed to include only offenses that involve trafficking and that are not misdemeanors under either federal or state law.
This Court should grant Taylor's petition for certiorari for important legal and practical reasons. Correcting the Ninth Circuit's misapplication of Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), by confirming that Heck only applies where the person seeking relief under § 1983 remains incarcerated or could have sought habeas relief while incarcerated-- as five Justices agreed in Spencer v. Kemna, see 523 U.S. at 19-21 & 25 n.8--would provide much-needed guidance to the lower courts. The Circuits have split on the circumstances in which Heck bars a § 1983 suit, and their decisions, and those of the lower courts, have been increasingly confused. Deciding that issue would not only provide much-needed guidance to the lower courts, but also to states, municipalities, and prosecutors' offices when they are deciding how to proceed after concluding that a prior conviction likely was unlawful.The legal question presented by the petition also has important practical consequences. Some prosecutors' offices have required that unlawfully convicted, but still incarcerated defendants enter a new guilty, no-contest, or Alford plea to secure their immediate release. That practice is at odds with several of the ABA's prosecutorial standards, rules, and resolutions, and the ABA believes it undermines public faith in, and the very integrity of, our criminal justice system. By granting certiorari and holding that Heck does not bar § 1983 claims in such circumstances, this Court would discourage that troubling prosecutorial practice.1
 One of the most important constitutional challenges to the adequacy of criminal process is a claim that a defendant was denied the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of trial counsel. This is because the right to counsel is necessary to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial. Many states, including Arizona, designate post-conviction proceedings as the preferred or mandatory forum for litigating an(Winter 2009) (describing the process by which the Standards are developed and promulgated).4ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim ("trialphase IAC claim") for the first time.The ABA respectfully asserts that counsel representing a defendant at that proceeding should provide the same quality of representation--that is, effective assistance of counsel--as is constitutionally required of counsel at trial. First, unless counsel adequately investigates, builds a record for, and litigates a viable trial-phase IAC claim in that first proceeding, it is unlikely that the defendant will succeed on his trial-phase IAC claim. Second, effective assistance of counsel in the first state postconviction proceeding is necessary in light of the potential for procedural and other errors that can preclude review of a defendant's Sixth Amendment claim. Third, an inadequately constructed record will likely affect the defendant's ability to obtain relief in a subsequent federal habeas proceeding because, under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (`AEDPA") and Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. 1888 (2011), defendants can no longer obtain federal habeas relief on the basis of facts outside of a defectively-constructed state record.That is, a defendant may have a viable trial-phase IAC claim, but if counsel at that first proceeding is ineffective, he may be foreclosed from any opportunity for relief in either state or federal postconviction proceedings. The ABA accordingly asserts that recognition of a right to effective assistance of counsel at the first proceeding in which a defendant may bring a trial-phase IAC claim is paramount if state and federal post-conviction proceedings are to remain viable forums for enforcing a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial counsel.5
This Court's decisions in Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617 (1989), United States v. Monsanto, 491 U.S. 600 (1989), and Kaley v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 1090 (2014), explicitly distinguished between assets that were the proceeds of, or facilitated, criminal violations ("tainted" assets) and those that were not ("untainted" assets) in explaining why pretrial restraints on "tainted" assets could withstand Fifth and Sixth Amendment objections. This case6 The ABA filed one amicus brief for both cases. That amicus brief is available at 1989 WL 1127836. 7 Available at 2013 WL 3458156 (U.S.).5represents a profound expansion of the government's pretrial exercise of control over a defendant's assets. Unlike previous asset forfeiture cases this Court has considered, the pretrial restraining order in this case covers not only tainted assets, but also bars the use of lawfully obtained, untainted property to secure representation by counsel of choice.That distinction is pivotal. First, the Eleventh Circuit was incorrect to conclude summarily that petitioner's challenge to pretrial restraints on lawfully obtained, untainted property was "foreclosed" by Caplin & Drysdale, Monsanto, and Kaley. See Pet. App. 3. Second, in disregarding that distinction, the Eleventh Circuit ignored the principal legal basis upon which, as Kaley observed, a defendant can contest a pretrial asset freeze orderthe traceability of assets to the alleged offense. Kaley, 134 S. Ct. at 1099 n.9. If, along with any "tainted" assets, defendants are also prevented pretrial from using their lawfully obtained assets to retain counsel of choice, then there is no practical purpose to challenging "traceability," and all of the accused's assets are potentially unavailable to retain counsel.Third, the ramifications for the criminal justice system of permitting pretrial restraint of untainted assets are pervasive and uniquely harmful. If the government can restrain pretrial a defendant's use of untainted assets to retain counsel of choice, then the government is effectively granted the capability to deprive the accused of counsel of choice. Because lawyers will not know whether or when the6government may make a defendant's untainted assets unavailable, they would accept the representation risking violation of their professional ethical codes by entering into what may become, at any time, a contingent-fee arrangement that is dependent on the outcome of the trial. The risk of losing counsel of choice under such circumstances is widely recognized to discourage candor and interfere with formation of an attorney-client relationship. Even if lawyers agree to continue the representations pro bono, or the accused must accept court-appointed counsel, such defendants are disadvantaged because their lawyers will have limited resources available for conducting research and investigations, and for developing strategies for defense, for negotiations with the prosecution, and for conducting trial. Moreover, if the defendant is found not guilty, or the government is otherwise found not entitled to untainted assets that were needed for payment of counsel of choice, the defendant's deprivation of counsel of choice is a structural error that cannot be cured. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 547 U.S. 140, 148 ( 2006) ("Deprivation of the right [to be assisted by counsel of choice] is `complete' when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants").The Eleventh Circuit's conclusion is all the more incorrect because the relevant statutory language contains no indication that Congress intended to abridge Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. In these circumstances, there is no basis for attributing to Congress such a constitutionally infirm intent.

As the country's leading association of legal professionals, the ABA is acutely aware that lawyers historically argued that their "constitutional rights of expression and association" provided legal shelter from antidiscrimination laws. Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 78 (1984) (quotation marks omitted). But this Court has long held that such claims are not entitled to "affirmative constitutional protection" Id. The ABA urges this Court to reject petitioners' equivalent arguments and hold that Colorado may constitutionally apply its public accommodations law to bar commercial enterprises from refusing to sell wedding cakes to same-sex couples.The ABA is one of the largest voluntary professional membership organizations in the United States. Its membership comprises more than 400,000 attorneys in private firms, corporations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies. Membership also includes1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus curiae state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no party or counsel for a party, or any other person other than amicus curiae or its counsel, made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties have consented in writing to the filing of this brief.2judges,2 legislators, law professors, law students, and non-lawyers in related fields.The ABA's mission is to serve the legal profession and the public "by defending liberty and delivering justice." Consistent with that mission, the ABA has long advocated against discrimination based on sexual orientation. For example, in 1973, two decades before this Court's landmark decision in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), the ABA adopted a policy urging the repeal of laws criminalizing private sexual relations between consenting adults.3The ABA also has worked to eliminate discrimination against gay and lesbian people who are, or who wish to become, lawyers. In 1992, the ABA amended its constitution to make the National Lesbian and Gay Law Association an affiliated organization with a vote in the HOD. In 1994, the ABA incorporated into its standards of Approval of Law Schools a requirement that accredited law schools not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. In 2002, the ABA amended its constitution to prohibit state and local bar associations that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation from being represented in the HOD.2 Neither this brief nor the decision to file it should be inter-preted to reflect the views of any judicial member of the ABA.No inference should be drawn that any members of the JudicialDivision Council participated in the adoption or endorsement ofthe positions in this brief. This brief was not circulated to anymember of the Judicial Division Counsel prior to filing.3 Only recommendations that are presented to and adopted bythe ABA's House of Delegates ("HOD") become ABA policy. SeeABAHouseofDelegates,https://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/house_of_delegates.html.3Of special relevance here, the ABA in 1989 adopted a policy advocating against discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public accommodations; in 2006, adopted a similar resolution with respect to discrimination based on actual or perceived gender identity; and in 2010, adopted a policy urging the elimination of all legal barriers to civil marriage between two persons of the same sex.The ABA has filed amicus briefs in several cases in which this Court has considered the equal dignity of gay and lesbian people, including Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), and Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015).INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE
 Immigration judges and the Board have the authority to order administrative closure, and that authority should not be withdrawn. The Attorney General has delegated to IJs and the Board the power to "take any action ... appropriate and necessary for the disposition" of the cases that are assigned to them. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(1)(ii), 1003.10(b). That includes the authority to take administrative and ministerial steps necessary to adjudicate those cases--including the power to stay or administratively close cases. The Supreme Court has described the power to defer adjudication of a case as inherent in the authority to decide cases, and that authority is regularly employed without incident by courts. The Justice Department's practice is no different in that regard: The Board and IJs have used2immigraAtvioanil/acbolie_caotmhtptlpest:e/_/wfuwllw_r.aempoerrti.caaunthbcahr.eocrkgd/caomn.tpednft./dam/aba/publications/commission_on_ 2administrative closure for three decades, and during that time the Department has promulgated more than a dozen regulations that assume that the Board and IJs are empowered to place cases on inactive status. That assumption is correct. Absent express revocation, the Attorney General's delegation of administrative authority to IJs and the Board should be read to encompass the authority to close cases.Nor should this authority be revoked. Administrative closure serves the interests of both the parties and the court. By suspending activity in cases that are not (and may never be) ripe for adjudication--typically because the noncitizen may well be eligible for immigration relief after the culmination of proceedings in another forum--an IJ can concentrate scarce resources on those cases that are priorities, while also saving the parties time and expense. Withdrawing the authority to order closure would clog IJs' dockets with cases that do not need to be adjudicated and exacerbate an already substantial backlog. No other docket-management tool offers the same advantages as administrative closure; in particular, continuances offer IJs and the parties at best a patchwork solution to a problem better addressed in a more systematic and efficient way. Administrative closure offers the court and the parties those benefits.Finally, if the Attorney General decides to withdraw the authority to order administrative closure, he should not recalendar the hundreds of thousands of closed cases en masse. Doing so would swamp the courts with previously closed cases, exacerbating the heavy burdens faced by IJs and the Board and adding to a backlog that already threatens the system's ability to dispose of cases in a balanced and efficient manner.3
The Court granted review to decide whether a challenge by a nonbreaching patent licensee to the validity of the licensed patent meets the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III, as implemented by the Declaratory Judgment Act. The ABA respectfully submits that such a challenge does not meet that requirement, but also that the Court need not decide that constitutional question here. As an equitable and prudential matter, a federal district court should decline jurisdiction over such challenges based on the doctrine of licensee estoppel, whether or not an Article III case-or-controversy exists.I. Although the Court in Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653 (1969), broadly rejected the doctrine of licensee estoppel, the facts of the case did not require the Court to do so, and the Court's broad rejection of the doctrine produces unfortunate, if unintended, consequences. The Court's holding was correct on the facts of the case; this case presents an appropriate opportunity to limit the reasoning of the decision. On its facts, Lear properly stands for the proposition that a patent licensee may, upon repudiation of the license, contest the validity of the licensed patent. As the Federal Circuit's decision suggests, Lear should not be read to permit a non-repudiating licensee, like Petitioner, to contest the patent's validity.II. The Federal Circuit's conclusion that this case does not present an Article III case-or-controversy is consistent with Lear. First, whether under the doctrine of licensee estoppel, or for the other reasons stated by Respondents, Petitioner is not entitled to challenge the licensed patent. As long as Petitioner complies with the license agreement, it has no judicially cognizable right to assert. Second, Petitioner is not suffering injury. Petitioner was not compelled to enter into the license agreement and is not2compelled to continue to perform under the agreement. Petitioner's only "injury" is its uncertainty about its potential legal exposure if it repudiates the license agreement but continues to practice the licensed invention. That is an everyday question for which businesses seek the advice of attorneys, not Article III courts.III. Considerations of practicality and the wise administration of justice counsel that a district court, as an equitable and prudential matter, should decline jurisdiction in a case like this. A rule allowing a non-repudiating licensee to challenge the licensed patent would be contrary to the aims of the Declaratory Judgment Act, federal patent law and policy, and prudential standing principles. Such a rule would permit the licensee to challenge the patent while simultaneously enjoying its benefits, protected by the license from an infringement action by the licensor and competition by non-licensees. Moreover, such a rule would discourage, not promote, challenges to invalid patents. Licensors would insist that licensees agree in the license not to challenge the patent during the term of the license or while the licensee remains in good standing, or require licensees to make front-loaded, non-refundable royalty payments. At worst, such a rule would undermine the statutory goal of encouraging innovation and invention by discouraging patent licensing
In 1963, at the height of the Cold War, the United States signed the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77 ("Vienna Convention" or "Convention"). Article 36 of the Convention guarantees to all United States citizens abroad and to foreign nationals in this country that if they are arrested outside their home country: (1) law enforcement officials will tell them without delay that they may have their nation's consul informed of their arrest, and (2) if they consent to notification, the law enforcement entity will promptly advise consul of their arrest. The United States played a leading role in negotiating the wording of Article 36. See Report of the United States Delegation to the Vienna Conference on Consular Relations, reprinted in Sen. Exec. E, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., May 8, 1969, at 41, 59-61. To ensure the faithful and consistent application of these important protections, the United States also proposed and advocated for the dispute settlement provision that became the companion Optional Protocol. Id. at 72-73. The Optional Protocol provides for compulsory jurisdiction by the International Court of Justice ("ICJ") over all signatory nations to resolve any disputes concerning the interpretation of the Convention's provisions. See Optional Protocol, 21 U.S.T. 325, art. I.Once the Vienna Convention and Optional Protocol were ratified by the Senate, they became binding on the United States as a whole and, under the Supremacy Clause, preemptive of any conflicting state laws. Nevertheless, when6Texas law enforcement authorities arrested Petitioner Jose Ernesto Medellin Rojas in connection with two murders, he was not advised of his right to contact the Mexican consul even though he informed the authorities that he was born in Mexico and that he was not a United States citizen. See Petition for Writ of Certiorari at 8, Medellin v. Dretke (No. 04-5928). Mr. Medellin was therefore unable to take advantage of the valuable assistance Mexican consular officers routinely give capital defendants. This assistance typically includes providing funding for experts and investigators, gathering mitigating evidence, contacting and translating for Spanish-speaking family members, and most importantly, ensuring that Mexican nationals are represented by competent and experienced defense counsel.5Instead, Mr. Medellin was left with a court-appointed lead counsel who was suspended from the practice of law at the time of the investigation and trial and who performed extremely poorly. Id. at 9. In addition to failing to determine and assert the rights of his client under the Vienna Convention, Mr. Medellin's counsel failed to strike jurors who indicated that they would automatically impose the death penalty, and called no witnesses at the guilt phase of trial. Id. After Mr. Medellin was convicted of capital murder, the5. See, e.g., Michael Fleischman, Note, Reciprocity Unmasked: The Role of the Mexican Government in Defense of Its Foreign Nationals in United States Death Penalty Cases, 20 Ariz. J. I NT'L & COMP. LAW 359, 366-74 (2003) (describing the history and successes of Mexico's consular assistance program); Raymond Bonner, U.S. Bid to Execute Mexican Draws Fire, N.Y. T IMES, Oct. 30, 2000, at A20 (reporting that the legal attaché at the Mexican embassy said that in the two prior years he had persuaded prosecutors in four states not to seek the death penalty in murder cases and that, altogether, Mexican consular officials had intervened in an average of 3 death penalty cases per month between December 1994 and October 2000, with the ultimate result that in nearly half of those cases prosecutors did not proceed with a capital prosecution).7only expert witness the defense called during the penalty phase was a psychologist who had never met Mr. Medellin. Id. Mr. Medellin was subsequently sentenced to death. Mexican consular authorities only learned of Mr. Medellin's detention after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had affirmed his conviction and sentence. Id. at 10.Mexico filed an application with the International Court of Justice on behalf of itself and 54 of its citizens, including Petitioner, to enforce the Vienna Convention against the United States. After receiving extensive written and oral submissions from Mexico and the United States, the ICJ ruled that Texas' failure to advise Petitioner of his right to consular services resulted in a violation of both Mexico's and Petitioner's rights under the Convention. See Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U.S.), 2004 I.C.J. 128 (Mar. 31) ("Avena") ¶¶ 106, 153(4)(7). Although the ICJ denied Mexico's request for annulment of the convictions and sentences, id. ¶ 123, the Court held that United States courts must provide review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences tainted by the violations it had found. Id. ¶¶ 121, 128-34. The ICJ also specifically held that applying procedural default doctrines to bar consideration of the Mexican nationals' Vienna Convention claims would itself violate the Vienna Convention. Id. ¶¶ 112-13.66. The Avena Judgment built on and strengthened the ICJ's earlier judgment in the LaGrand Case, a case brought by Germany against the United States also alleging violations of the Vienna Convention. (Germany v. U.S.), 2001 I.C.J. 104 (June 27) ("LaGrand"). Unlike in Avena, by the time the ICJ ruled in LaGrand, both of the German nationals in question had been executed. The ICJ held in LaGrand that: (1) Article 36 of the Vienna Convention provides "individual rights" to foreign nationals; (2) applying procedural default rules to prevent detained individuals from challenging their convictions and sentences on the ground that their(Cont'd)8In the proceedings below, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that judicially created procedural default rules barred federal courts from reviewing Petitioner's conviction or sentence. 371 F.3d 27980 (5th Cir. 2004). Because this case goes to the very core of the United States' commitment to honor the rule of law adopted when the United States signed and ratified the Vienna Convention and its Optional Protocol, and because the Fifth Circuit's decision would effectively deny foreign nationals and their nation-states meaningful federal review of their treaty rights, its decision should be reversed.The federal policies underlying the court-made procedural default rules are not advanced by applying those rules to claims arising under the Vienna Convention. In the traditional habeas corpus case, the procedural default doctrine serves to ensure respect for state court procedural rules. In contrast, cases involving Vienna Convention claims implicate the federal government's plenary and paramount interest in the conduct of foreign relations. The risk to international relations is particularly acute where, as here, an individual state's procedural rule may be used to evade a binding and authoritative decision of the ICJ that favors one of the United States' treaty partners. Moreover, unlike the ordinary case in which procedural default rules are designed to prevent gamesmanship by counsel, defendants and their attorneys are generally unaware of the existence of Vienna Convention rights. Failure to raise them because of sheer(Cont'd)rights under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention had been violated itself violated the Vienna Convention; and (3) if the United States failed to comply with Article 36 in future cases involving German nationals subjected to severe penalties, it must "allow the review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence by taking account of the violation of the rights set forth in the Convention." LaGrand ¶¶ 77, 90-91, 125.9ignorance cannot be the result of a strategic choice. Such a rule also would not unduly interfere with the efficient administration of federal courts.This Court's per curiam opinion in Breard v. Greene, 523 U.S. 371 (1998), does not require application of the procedural default doctrine in this case. Breard's determination that the procedural default doctrine could bar that petitioner's Vienna Convention claim was based on assumptions about the Convention that the ICJ's authoritative interpretation in Avena has now shown to be incorrect and on a statutory provision that does not apply to this case. The policy implications of this case also differ from those of Breard .Enforcement of the ICJ's Avena Judgment is critical to promoting the rule of law throughout the world and to protecting United States citizens' rights under the Convention. The manner in which foreign nationals are treated in domestic courts can have broad international and domestic consequences, and these matters are soundly committed by the Constitution to the judgment of the federal government. Moreover, in light of the ICJ's authoritative interpretation of the Vienna Convention, a decision of this Court that would prevent federal courts from giving effect to that decision would severely undermine international confidence in the United States' commitment to the Optional Protocol and would invite breaches by other treaty partners.1
Where an indigent defendant faces incarcerationfor contempt of court, the potential deprivation of thedefendant'slibertyinterestwarrantstheappointment of counsel--regardless of whether theproceeding is labeled "civil" or "criminal'--to ensurethe fair and efficient administration of justice. Theline between civil and criminal contempt proceedingshas become increasingly blurred, and thus cannotprovide a useful basis for determining the right tocounsel where personal liberty is at stake.The appointment of counsel promotes the fair and efficient administration of justice. Concerns over increased administrative and financial burdens associated with providing counsel must be balanced against the costs of improper incarceration, as well as any gains from negotiation of an order with which a defendant can comply. Appointment of counsel promotes the public's interest in obtaining correct outcomes and in efficient use of judicial time and resources.As the Court has noted, court proceedings must not only be fair, but also must appear to be fair. Representation enhances public confidence and results in increased satisfaction in legal outcomes and respect for the justice system.Counselshouldbeprovidedin _ thesecircumstances, accordingly, because of the potential6deprivation of the defendants' liberty interests, andbecause representation will result in fairer outcomes with greater judicial efficiency and will increase public confidence in our judicial system
 There should be a right to an immediate appeal under Cohen when a court rules that the attorneyclient privilege has been waived and compels production of attorney-client communications, because of the importance of the attorney-client privilege and the importance of maintaining the appropriate balance between the public interests embodied in the privilege and in the principle that the public has a "right to every man's evidence." Trammel v. UnitedStates, 445 U.S. 40, 50 (1980). In interpreting the privilege's scope, the courts areguided by "the principles of common law ... in the light of reason and experience." Fed. R. Evid. 501. The decisions of the lower courts, however, have not7 Available from the ABA.6 always been correct, and "fa]n uncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results in widely varying applications by the courts, is little better than no privilege at all." Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 393.To maintain the appropriate balance between the public interests served by the privilege and the competing interest in access to evidence, a balance that is directly implicated by rulings regarding the scope of the privilege, decisions that the privilege has been waived and compelling production of otherwise privileged information should be included in that "small class" of orders immediately appealable under Cohen. The third prong of Cohen's test, which the ABA submits is the only prong in dispute in such rulings, is satisfied because "the legal and practical value of [the privilege] would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial." Lauro Lines S.R.L. v. Chasser, 490 U.S. 495, 499 (1989). Further, the costs that can result when review of an erroneous ruling must await a final judgment (or in many cases not occur at all) make these orders "sufficiently important to overcome the policies militating against interlocutory appeals." Id. at 503 (Scalia, J., concurring)
As explained in the Statement of Interest, the ABA for many years has devoted considerable time and resources to the study and improvement of the juvenile justice system, including the formulation of policy which directly bears on the issue here. It is precisely because of these extensive efforts that the ABA submits this amicus brief in support of the Petitioner's position.The ABA respectfully submits that Miller fundamentally altered Eighth Amendment jurisprudence as to when a sentence of life without parole is permissible for a juvenile. Miller not only barred states from imposing mandatory life without parole sentences on juveniles, but also made clear that this harshest of juvenile sentences is constitutionally permissible only for "the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption." 132 S. Ct. at 2469. Under the retroactivity analysis of Teague v. Lane, Miller announced a substantive rule severely restricting the13 ABA Policy #107C (adopted Feb. 2015), available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/abanews/ 2015mm_hodres/107c.pdf.7circumstances under which a juvenile can be sentenced to life without parole. Under the rule in Miller, the great majority of juveniles serving life without parole are serving a sentence that the law cannot constitutionally impose on them. That is the epitome of a substantive rule that should be applied retroactively.As demonstrated below, retroactive treatment of Miller is necessary to avoid unjust and unconstitutional treatment of juvenile offenders, will not unduly burden the states, and does not implicate the same concerns of finality and deterrence that this Court has considered in other cases addressing the possible retroactive application of a new constitutional rule. Indeed, several states have recognized this fact and either through court decision or legislative action have applied Miller retroactively and commenced resentencing hearings. Miller and the Court's decisions in Roper and Graham are all premised on juveniles' lesser culpability and greater capacity to change. Because nearly all juvenile offenders sentenced to mandatory life without parole before Miller are serving a sentence that the law cannot impose on them, it is only just that they be given the opportunity to demonstrate, at some point before dying in prison, that they too are capable of change.
In this case, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) prohibited Texas courts from considering current clinical standards for determining intellectual disability, instead requiring them to apply a standard articulated by the CCA in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Briseno purported to apply the AAMR's 1992 standards for determining intellectual disability, but in fact departed from those standards in numerous ways. Most egregiously, Briseno replaced the clinical standards for determining whether a defendant has deficits in adaptive functioning--one of the three critical components of an intellectual-disability diagnosis--with a fundamentally different and far more restrictive test of the CCA's own invention that lacks any clinical basis.The so-called "Briseno factors"--which include such questions as whether the defendant's family and friends think he has an intellectual disability, whether the defendant can respond coherently to a question, whether he can lie, and whether his crime required planning--all depart from clinical standards in many ways. For example, they rely on and reflect lay stereotypes of intellectual disability that are not used in clinical assessments and that often bear no relation to the actual abilities and behavior of individuals with intellectual disability. They invite courts to overlook a defendant's deficits in adaptive functioning based on strengths in other areas, despite the scientific consensus that adaptive limitations often coexist with strengths in persons with intellectual disability. And they emphasize the circumstances of the defendant's crime even when they are atypical of the defendant's functioning in everyday life.6No scientific authority supports the CCA's approach, which allows the execution of individuals who indisputably meet clinical standards for a diagnosis of intellectual disability. That is not happenstance: The CCA adopted the Briseno test specifically for the purpose of restricting the protections of Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), to a small subgroup of persons with intellectual disabilities. In the CCA's view, its task was not to ensure that no persons with intellectual disability are executed, but to "define that level and degree of mental retardation at which a consensus of Texas citizens would agree that a person should be exempted from the death penalty." Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 6.As Atkins and Hall v. Florida, 134 S. Ct. 1986 (2014), make clear, however, States do not have license to ignore the medical community's agreed-upon standards for diagnosing intellectual disability. "If the States were to have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished, the Court's decision in Atkins could become a nullity, and the Eighth Amendment's protection of human dignity would not become a reality." Hall, 134 S. Ct. at 1999. Indeed, "[t]he clinical definitions of intellectual disability ... were a fundamental premise of Atkins." Id. Accordingly, States may not "disregard[] established medical practice" and establish a standard for defining intellectual disability that contradicts that practice. Id. at 1995. Texas's Briseno standard overrides established clinical practice in the exact way Hall found impermissible.Unsurprisingly, Texas's anti-clinical approach to adaptive functioning is an outlier. As legislation, judicial decisions, and the ABA's assessments of numerous capital jurisdictions make clear, most States seek to employ standards that bar the death penalty for all7persons who warrant a clinical diagnosis of intellectual disability. Because Texas repudiates those standards, its approach has excluded multiple defendants with compelling claims of intellectual disability from the protection of Atkins. That approach contravenes the Eighth Amendment and should be rejected
 Habeas corpus, the power of the courts to review detention by the Executive, has existed in some form for over seven hundred years, and is no less critical today than it was at the inception of our constitutional system. It remains, in the context of military detentions of this country's citizens, a vital protection of the rule of law. Without habeas corpus, such constitutional protections as due process would be unenforceable and meaningless. The habeas petitioners here are United States citizens who allege that they have been detained as "enemy combatants" and "security internees" by United States military authorities for over two years without due process. Even though these citizens brought their habeas petitions prior to any action by the Iraqi courts, the government now seeks to turn them both over to Iraqi officials, one to be tried before an Iraqi criminal court, and the other to be executed pursuant to an Iraqi judgment.Although there may be circumstances in which a citizen may be detained as an enemy combatant or transferred to the custody of a foreign government, due process must be provided to ensure that such detentions and transfers are according to law and not arbitrary. There can be no such inquiry without an opportunity for judicial inquiry into the process actually used.The government argues that its actions are immune from judicial review because it is operating as part of a "multinational force." The ABA respectfully asserts that this argument is inconsistent with this Court's ruling in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that United States citizens have habeas rights even when they are captured abroad and designated "enemy combatants." See 542 U.S. 507, 533 (2004) (plurality opinion). Operation as part of a multinational force should not be permitted to defeat the United Statesgovernment's responsibilities to its citizens. Unreviewable military action is not consistent with American legal principles
 Congress created an express pathway for patent applicants to obtain de novo review of the denial by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") of their applications: a civil action in district court under 35 U.S.C. § 145. Section 145 provides an alternative to a direct appeal of PTO decisions to this court. Congress imposed only one qualification on an applicant's choice of using that pathway: "All expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant." 35 U.S.C. § 145. For nearly two centuries, the phrase "all expenses of the proceedings" has been understood universally to mean that the applicant must pay only the PTO's out-ofpocket expenses for the proceedings, like travel costs and expert witness fees. The PTO now urges a radical, novel departure from that longstanding interpretation: that the provision actually requires the applicant to pay for the government's salaried attorneys any time the applicant invokes Section 145, even if the applicant prevails against the government in the proceedings.2 See ABA Resolution 108A, at: https://www.americanbar.org/news/reporter_resources/midyear-meeting2016/house-of-delegates-resolutions/108a.html.3Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 11 Filed: 01/23/2018An interpretation of Section 145 that requires the payment of such fees would shut the door to the Congressionally created Section 145 pathway for all except those who can afford to pay not only their own legal fees but also those of the federal government. Applicants who lack sufficient funds to pay for their adversary's lawyers would be blocked from the benefits of the Section 145 pathway--including de novo review of the denial of their applications and the ability to introduce new evidence in district court--solely because of their inability to pay for the federal government's lawyers. Meanwhile, those benefits would remain open to large corporations and affluent individuals who can afford to shoulder the burden of paying for the government's lawyers. The PTO's newfound interpretation, if accepted, would have intolerable results. The doors of justice should be open to all, regardless of individual prosperity. The "expenses" provision in Section 145 should be interpreted and applied so that applicants' wealth does not determine their access to the district court pathway that Congress provided.Moreover, the statutory text does not show Congressional intent to require patent applicants to pay the government's attorneys' fees. Indeed, under traditional rules of construing fee-shifting provisions, the "expenses of the proceedings" provision in Section 145 should be read to exclude attorneys' fees. The background presumption is the American Rule: each litigant pays its own attorneys' fees, win or lose. Congress can depart from that rule and enact fee-shifting provisions, but it4Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 12 Filed: 01/23/2018must do so in a clear and explicit manner. The phrase "expenses of the proceedings" is not the type of clear and explicit statement required to overcome the presumption that the American Rule applies. Moreover, the mere word "expenses" falls far short of the level of clarity that would be required to enact a novel statute that would shift only the government's attorneys' fees onto private litigants, and that would do so in every case, regardless of outcome.Where Congress has enacted fee-shifting provisions in other statutes, it has generally done so to promote access to justice--for example, provisions in civil rights statutes allowing prevailing plaintiffs to obtain fees. To amicus's knowledge, Congress has never enacted a fee-shifting provision that shifts only the government's fees onto private parties, much less a provision that does so even if the government loses the litigation. To read Section 145 in such an unprecedented way requires far more clarity than the mere word "expenses." Congress does not hide elephants in mouseholes; it did not hide a government-fee-shifting intent in the word "expenses." There is no evidence Congress intended Section 145 to be a roadblock to justice, and this court should not interpret it that way.5Case: 16-1794 Document: 119 Page: 13 Filed: 01/23/201
The ABA submits that current law strikes the appropriate balance between the notice function of patent claims and the need to accommodate practical difficulties inherent in drafting patent claims. Under that established jurisprudence, the determination of whether issued patent claims are sufficiently definite under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, looks not to4whether claim language is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, but instead whether a person of ordinary skill would understand what is claimed. Adopting the unreasonably stringent test for definiteness for issued patents that petitioner advocates would adversely change this Court's definiteness jurisprudence for all patents and patent owners.The statutory definiteness requirement addresses the need for public notice of the scope of patent claims. But as this Court's decisions have long recognized, that need must be tempered to provide adequate protection of inventions and appropriate incentives for innovation. Accordingly, this Court has held that a claim is sufficiently definite so long as a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the boundaries of what is claimed. This wellestablished principle of claim construction should be preserved.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in applying these principles, has used different formulations, including the phrase "insolubly ambiguous." But rather than articulating a separate test for definiteness, the factual settings in which that formulation is used demonstrate that it is simply a shorthand for the well-established principle that claims are indefinite when a person of ordinary skill cannot discern the scope of the claims in light of the specification and prosecution history.5Petitioner seeks to elevate notice above all other considerations, urging that claim language be deemed indefinite if it is amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations. But few claims will be so clear that no uncertainty can be found in their interpretation. Under this Court's jurisprudence, the proper question should be whether the patent claims are sufficiently definite and descriptive to permit a court to resolve any concrete disputes between the parties by applying the traditional tools of claim construction--a task that courts are well-equipped to undertake using existing law.Finally, adoption of petitioner's stringent definiteness requirement would adversely affect both patent litigation before the district courts and patent prosecution before the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Litigants would have an incentive to advance multiple "reasonable" interpretations of any claim term, forcing patent practitioners and inventors to draft a multiplicity of claims to try to capture every possible variation of an invention and to guard against later possible assertions of indefiniteness.Accordingly, the ABA urges the Court to reaffirm that, in determining whether an issued patent claim satisfies the definiteness requirement of Section 112, second paragraph, the appropriate test remains whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the bounds of the claim in light of the specification and prosecution history.
 I. Appellant Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One ("the Utility District") is incorrect in asserting that "[t]he record Congress amassed in 2006 * * * is not of the quality to demonstrate that §5 remains a valid exercise of Congress's enforcement powers." App. Br. 2. The congressional record that supported Section 5's renewal is replete with evidence, both statistical and in the form of firsthand accounts, demonstrating the necessary predicates for Section 5--namely, that unconstitutional voting discrimination continues in the covered jurisdictions and that Section 5 is an effective tool to combat it. The legislative record is far more robust than the Utility District admits and is more than sufficient, under this Court's precedents, to justify Section 5's reauthorization. II. The Utility District is also incorrect in its assertion that Section 5 is no longer a "congruent and proportional" remedy under Boerne--an assertion it bases in large part on the claim that Section 2 offers sufficient tools to attack the sorts of discrimination extant in covered jurisdictions. First, the argument wrongly assumes that Boerne somehow displaces the standard of review this Court has employed in repeatedly affirming Section 5's constitutionality. See NAACP Br. 23-26. Second, it contradicts Congress' factual findings as to Section 2. But even setting aside these problems, the argument fails because contrary to the Utility District's implicit suggestion, Boerne does not create a least-restrictive-means requirement. Instead, it guards against legislative attempts to expand constitutional rights by ensuring that Congress's prophylactic legislation (i) actuallytargets demonstrable, unconstitutional state action and (ii) does not invalidate such a broad swath of state and local actions that it can no longer "be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior." Boerne, 521 U.S. at 531532. Section 5 meets both criteria. To the extent Boerne applies to this case, it compels affirmance
 As a matter of settled Alaska law, an indigent litigant is categorically entitledto the appointment of counsel in a child custody proceeding in which the adversaryparty is represented by an attorney provided by a public entity. Flores v. F/ores, 589P.2d 893 (Alaska 1979); Alaska Stat. 44.21.a1O(a)(a). ln F/ores, this Coutldetermined that the due process guarantees afforded by the Alaska Constitutionrequired the appointment of counsel under those circumstances to avoiddisadvantages to the unrepresented party in the adjudication of fundamentalparental rights that it held were "constitutionally impermissible." /d. at 896.Ti h¡¡Va.'iU,'Âì FlÂcrrlrrnifcÙV*'¡i¡¡lufhafil¡+ifhai!!'--rocrrlfraanhorlinFlnrociconnellrrannlinehletnthccircumstances in the case at bar, wherein the Appellant, an indigent litigant, wasconfronted in the child custody proceedings below by an adversary represented by aprivate attorney. The pure happenstance that the opposing party has a private,rather than a public sector, attorney does not alter any of the disadvantageousconsequences for an unrepresented parent in a child custody dispute that led thisCourt to determine that a right to appointed counsel is mandated by the AlaskaConstitution in this context. The ABA respectfully suggests that both due processand equal protection principles of Alaska constitutional law compel recognition of aright to counsel in this case, no less than in Flores.The ABA also submits that implementation of a right to appointment ofcounsel for unrepresented indigent parties in all child custody proceedings in which6 LEGA1127649715.1the opposing party is represented by counsel will inevitably enhance the quality and reliability of the outcomes reached in such cases, will foster the objectives of judicial economy and efficiency, and will diminish the extent to which members of the judiciary are confronted with situations in which their obligation to remain neutral andimpartial is placed in conflict. For all these salutary reasons, as elaborated more fully below, a right tocounsel should be recognized in this case, and the judgment to the contrary belowshould be reversed
In Holland v. Florida, this Court held for the first time that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act's ("AEDPA") one-year statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling. Holland v. Florida, 130 S. Ct. 2549 (2010). It also took that opportunity to clarify the application of equitable principles generally. "[O]ften," this Court explained, "exercise of a court's equity powers . . . must be made on a case-by-case basis" so as to avoid injustice that may result from "a hard and fast adherence to more absolute legal rules." Id. at 2563 (internal quotations omitted).Paul A. Howell, the petitioner here, appeals under another equitable tool, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). He seeks Rule 60(b) relief based on5the district court's use of a pre-Holland standard when denying his prior claim for equitable tolling. The Eleventh Circuit should have recognized that Holland, when considering the facts of Mr. Howell's case, constitutes an extraordinary circumstance warranting Rule 60(b) relief. The ABA asserts that it also should have considered important contextual factors--including deficiencies that existed in Florida's capital counsel appointment system at the time of the relevant events, as well as the severity and finality of the death penalty--in evaluating Mr. Howell's request for relief.The Court should grant the petition for a writ of certiorari to clarify the proper scope of a court's inquiry into a capital defendant's request for equitable relief under Rule 60(b)
 The Compensation Clause serves crucial dual objectives: to ensure the quality and "complete independence of the courts of justice." THE FEDERALIST No. 78, at 466 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed. 1961); United States v.' Available at http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/ poladv/documents/2003judpay.authcheckdam.pdf (last visited July 6, 2012).Hatter, 532 U.S. 557, 568-569 (2001). These objectives are "no less important today than in earlier times." Hatter, 532 U.S. at 569.Nevertheless, these constitutional objectives have been undermined by congressional actions that have systematically deprived federal judges of COLAs that were established by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-194, 103 Stat. 1716, and eroded judicial compensation to dangerously low levels. In the Act, Congress attempted to address its past failings by establishing automatic annual COLAs for judges and other senior government officials that were to take effect whenever a COLA was conferred on federal workers paid according to the General Schedule. But in six of the past eighteen years, Congress has blocked those "non-discretionary" COLAs for federal judges, including in years when it did authorize such COLAs for its own members and for executive branch officials, at times in apparent reliance on Section 140 of Public Law 97-92, which Congress revived in 2001. See Brief of Plaintiffs-Appellants ("Br.") at 6-7, 9-11;° see also U.S. Courts, Federal Judicial Pay Increase Fact Sheet ("Fact Sheet').'* The ABA joins Plaintiffs' argument that even if the 2001 amendment to Section 140 could be read as overruling the Ethics Reform Act, it too would violatethe Compensation Clause because the non-discretionary COLAs established by the Ethics Reform Act became part of federal judges' compensation in 1989 and cannot be diminished by subsequent congressional enactments. See Br. at 43-47.° Available at http://www.uscourts.gov/JudgesAndJudgeships/JudicialCompensation/JudicialPayIncreaseFact.aspx (last visited July 6, 2012).The panel in this matter concluded that it was unable to redress the threat to Judicial independence and integrity posed by Congress's revival of Section 140 because the Court's prior decision in Williams v. United States, 240 F.3d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 911 (2002), "controls the disposition of this appeal by a panel of this court." 671 F.3d 1299, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). The panel therefore invited relief from "this court en banc[,] the Supreme Court, or... Congress." /d. In now revisiting Williams, the Court en banc should address that panel's application of United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200 (1980), and acknowledge that Will does not foreclose the relief sought here. Further, the Court should take into account the important concerns discussed below, which are made even more urgent by the steadily growing body of data unavailable at the time Williams was decided.That data shows that highly qualified and experienced jurists are leaving the bench in unprecedented numbers, often for the more lucrative private sector. In the intervening decade since this Court last considered the constitutionality of Congress's actions, the decline in real judicial pay has continued. Even in those years in which salary adjustments were made, judges continued to lose ground because Congress's blocking of earlier COLAs already had reduced the base compensation to which later COLAs were applied. See Br. at 10-11. Over this same period of time, federal judges' workloads have increased dramatically due tothe political branches' delays in filling judicial vacancies and the explosion of case filings in the federal courts.The Ethics Reform Act was intended to stem the erosion of judicial compensation resulting from inflation that threatens to undermine the very independence essential to the judiciary's function and to upset the Constitution's careful calibration of the separation of powers among co-equal branches. The Court should hold that Congress's blocking of non-discretionary COLAs of the Ethics Reform Act violates the constitutional guarantee of undiminished compensation for the Article III judiciary
For almost 50 years, the ABA has issued reports documenting the deleterious effects of judicial "pay erosion," including those issued in December 2008 and August 2007, as well as a joint study with the Federal Bar Association issued in February 2001 (and updated in May 2003). See, e.g., In Support of a Fair and Impartial Judiciary (ABA Dec. 2008);3 Background Information on the Need for Federal Judicial Pay Reform (ABA May 2007);4 Federal Judicial Pay Erosion: A Report on the Need for Reform (ABA/FBA Feb. 2001) ("Judicial Pay Erosion")5 (documenting the significant decline of judicial salaries through 2001), updated by Federal Judicial Pay: An Update on the Urgent Need for Action (ABA/FBA May 2003) ("Urgent Need for Action").6 An unbroken chain of 15 ABA policy statements from 1963 to 2010 have supported increased judicial pay. See, e.g., ABA Report with Recommendation #300 (policy adopted3 Available at www.abanet.org/poladv/transition/2008dec_ judiciary.pdf (last visited June 15, 2010).4 Available at http://www.abanet.org/poladv/priorities/judicial_ pay/pospaper2007.pdf (last visited June 15, 2010).5 Available at http://www.abanet.org/poladv/priorities/judicial_ pay/fedjudreport.pdf (last visited June 15, 2010).6 Available at http://www.abanet.org/poladv/documents/2003 judpay.pdf (last visited June 15, 2010).4Feb. 2010).7 The ABA's studies and reports document how declining judicial pay is undermining the purposes of the Judicial Compensation Clause. See, e.g., Independence of the Judiciary: Judicial Salaries (ABA May 10, 2010).8The ABA's data and analyses are of particular significance here because, as discussed below, they demonstrate that inflation has substantially eroded the value of judicial compensation. Although Congress has enacted a series of statutory regimes designed to maintain the value of judicial pay and remove salary adjustments from the shifting priorities of the political process, those efforts have uniformly failed. The statute at issue in this case, the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-194, 103 Stat. 1716, attempted to address Congress' past failings by establishing automatic self-executing and non-discretionary annual cost-of-living adjustments (up to a maximum of five percent) for judges and7 Available at http://www.abanet.org/poladv/priorities/judicial_ pay/10M300.pdf (last visited June 15, 2010). Only recommendations that are adopted by the ABA's House of Delegates ("HOD") become ABA policy. The HOD has more than 500 delegates, representing states and territories, state and local bar associations, affiliated organizations, sections and divisions, ABA members and the Attorney General of the United States, among others.

See generally Urgent Need for Action at 9.But in six of the past 20 years, Congress has refused to authorize those "non-discretionary" COLAs. See Pet. 8-9, 12-13. And even in those years in which salary adjustments were made, judges continued to lose ground; Congress' failure to authorize earlier COLAs reduced the base compensation to which those percentage adjustments were made. Pet. 13. Over this same period of time, as the data below show, federal judges' workloads have increased dramatically. The effects of these trends are undisputed: highly qualified and experienced jurists are leaving the bench in unprecedented numbers, often to assume more lucrative posts in the private sector.The diminishment of judicial compensation and the exodus of federal judges from the bench have continued unabated since this Court declined to grant review in Williams v. United States, 240 F.3d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 911 (2002). Believing that the constitutional dimension of judicial "pay erosion" must be addressed, the ABA requests that review now be granted.
The Court initially addressed life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders in Miller. In that decision, the Court required a sentencing court "to take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison" and concluded that no juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole for a crime that reflects "unfortunate yet transient immaturity," rather than "irreparable corruption." 567 U.S. at 480 (internal quotation marks omitted).The Court held that the Miller ruling was a substantive rule of constitutional law in Montgomery. The issue in Montgomery was limited to whether Miller was retroactive on collateral review. Citing Miller, the Court again explained that a life without parole sentence violates the Eighth Amendment except for "the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption." Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734 (citing Miller, 567 U.S. at 479-480). The Court held that Miller announced a new "substantive rule of constitutional law" rendering life without parole an unconstitutional penalty for a class of defendants "whose crimes reflect the transient immaturity of youth." Montgomery, 136 S. Ct. at 734. Accordingly, the Court held that the Miller decision was retroactive to collateral challenges to convictions. Ibid.This case presents no new issues for the Court. The Court simply needs to reaffirm its holding in Miller that no juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole for a crime that reflects transient immaturity rather than irreparable corruption.For the Court to decide otherwise would violate fundamental rule of law principles. The rule of law,6which is "indispensable" for a just society, is secured by the Supremacy Clause and held sacrosanct by the Court. Moreover, a decision undercutting Miller could upset numerous state sentencing legislative acts and judicial decisions that relied upon the Court's Miller decision.The ABA urges the Court to reaffirm what it already held in Miller, safeguard the rule of law, and affirm the judgment below
 On this appeal, Petitioners erroneously contend that Section 242 of the Immigration and Naturalization ActNeither this brief nor the decision to file it should be interpreted to reflect the views of any judicial or individual member of the ABA. No inference should be drawn that any member of the Judicial Division of the ABA has participated in the adoption or endorsement of the positions in this brief. This brief was not circulated to any member of the Judicial Division Council of the ABA prior to filing.3("INA") as amended by the Illegal Immigration Reformand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L.No. 104-208, federal district110 Stat. courts of3009 ("IIRIRA"), divests the jurisdiction over constitutionalclaims arising from a decision by the Immigration andNaturalization Service ("INS") to initiate deportation pro-ceedings against Respondents.This Court has consistently held that congressional enactments regarding the jurisdiction of federal courts must be interpreted to permit meaningful judicial review of colorable constitutional claims, in order to avoid the grave constitutional questions that would arise if Congress were to foreclose review of such claims. Based on this concern, this Court has narrowly construed administrative review provisions that appear facially to preclude review of the merits of an administrative determination prior to the exhaustion of administrative remedies, in order to permit adequate and timely review of constitutional claims.In interpreting Section 242 of the INA, as amended by Section 306 of ITRIRA, the ABA urges that this Court ensure that aliens' access to a meaningful forum for vindication of their constitutional rights is preserved by providing, in appropriate cases, for prompt review of colorable constitutional claims in the federal district courts. Where, as here, a constitutional claim requires the development of a factual record for proper resolution, meaningful review requires access to the district courts, which are the only federal judicial fora capable of developing an adequate factual record. Moreover, in this and many other cases, access to the federal district courts at the outset would serve Congress' dual goals of providing meaningful review of constitutional claims and of efficient administration of the immigration laws.
Minnesota's announce clause, as definitively interpreted by the Minnesota Supreme Court, has the same scope as the corresponding provision of the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct. The ABA provision, which prohibits judicial candidates from committing or appearing to commit themselves to matters likely to come before the courts, has the long-standing support of a broad spectrum of the American legal profession. The ABA Code's prohibition is narrowly tailored to achieve three compelling state interests ­ namely, maintaining judicial independence and impartiality, preserving public confidence in the judiciary, and guaranteeing due process to litigants
This case involves a foundational principle of the attorney-client relationship: an attorney serves the interests of his or her client, and must respect the client's right to make fundamental decisions regarding the litigation of his or her case. There is no decision more fundamental in a criminal case than the decision whether to admit or contest guilt. And4while the deference an attorney owes to a client's strategic litigation decisions has important limits, the decision at issue in this case resides at the core, not the outer edges, of the classes of client decisions that counsel lacks discretion to overrule.The decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court is contrary to firmly entrenched constitutional norms that undergird the policy guidance promulgated by both the ABA and the Louisiana State Bar Association. A mentally competent client has the right to decide whether to contest or admit guilt.2 Mr. English's usurpation of Mr. McCoy's clearly-expressed decision to contest guilt at trial, however well intended, violated the principles underlying the proper role of counsel in an attorney-client relationship as laid out in the Constitution and the rules, guidelines, and standards of the ABA and the Louisiana State Bar Association
 For decades, the ABA has urged jurisdictions to reduce their reliance on financial conditions on pretrial release and to eliminate inflexible money-bail schemes based on preset bail schedules. See Standard 10-1.4; Standard 10-5.3. When the First Edition of the ABA's Criminal Justice Standards was adopted in 1968, the ABA emphasized the serious constitutional concerns with inflexible money-bail systems, which discriminate against the indigent and impair defendants' ability to prepare an effective defense. The ABA's concerns about overuse of money bail have only deepened over time, and the Third Edition of the Standards now provides that monetary conditions on pretrial release are appropriate only once the court considers the defendant's individual circumstances and the possibility of alternative conditions of release. Decades of research and study have shown that excessive use of money bail harms defendants with little offsetting benefit to jurisdictions that use such systems. Inflexible money-bail systems disrupt the lives of indigent defendants,- 5 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 16lead to worse legal outcomes, and pressure defendants to plead guilty. At the same time, inflexible money-bail systems, which tie pretrial detention to the defendant's ability to pay rather than an objective risk assessment, do not improve appearance rates or public safety, and leave jurisdictions that use such systems bearing the costs of overcrowded jails. It is no surprise, therefore, that a wide range of criminal justice stakeholders and a growing number of States and local jurisdictions have joined the ABA in rejecting inflexible use of money bail.Inflexible money-bail systems like the one at issue in this case violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that individuals may not be incarcerated solely because of their inability to pay fines, fees, and court costs. Moreover, an inflexible money-bail system based on a preset bond schedule fails to provide the individualized determination necessary to comport with due process. Accordingly, the district court's order entering a preliminary injunction should be affirmed.- 6 -Case: 16-5058 Document: 32 Filed: 04/26/2016 Page: 1
Though it has managed to divide the circuits for years, the question presented has a clear statutory answer. Nothing in 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a)--or anywhere else in the Lanham Act--requires proof of willful infringement to award a trademark infringer's profits. That judicially created prerequisite conflicts with § 1117(a)'s plain language and its purpose.By its own terms, § 1117(a) gives courts broad discretion to award profits "subject to the principles of equity." Yet in the circuits requiring willfulness, courts lose much of that discretion. Those courts must focus exclusively on willfulness as a threshold issue, without the ability to consider how other facts may impact the3equities. Only after finding willfulness may the court proceed to the broader equitable analysis demanded by the statute, but if the court finds no willfulness, that finding alone terminates the analysis before all other equities have even been considered. That is not what § 1117(a) says, and it defies the well-established principle that equity should not be reduced to a rigid formula.Inflexibly requiring willfulness before awarding profits also conflicts with how trademark law usually operates. Most trademark issues warrant flexible, case-by-case consideration. Absolute rules are relatively rare. In the few places they do exist, it is typically because Congress has enacted them with clear legislation. None of this is to say, however, that willfulness is irrelevant to awarding profits. Every circuit agrees that the infringer's intent is at least relevant. But currently, courts in some parts of the country have authority to consider that intent alongside the other equities, while other courts do not. The ABA believes all courts nationwide have authority under § 1117(a) to consider the complete equities of the case--an authority Congress has plainly given them

1. Juvenile offenders generally do not have the heightened moral culpability that the Court requires for the imposition of the death penalty. See, e.g. Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002) (holding that mentally retarded persons do not have the required heightened moral culpability). The law has long recognized that juveniles have a reduced level of moral culpability due to their reduced capacity for sense and reason and the fact that they generally are more impulsive and less self-disciplined than adults, and this conclusion has been bolstered by recent scientific studies. Moreover, the reduced capacity of juvenile offenders means that retribution and deterrence rationales for the death penalty are inapplicable and that juveniles face a special risk of wrongful conviction and of receiving unjustified death sentences.2. Since 1989, when the Court held that the execution of individuals who commit crimes when they are sixteen- or seventeen-years-old did not offend the Constitution, Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361 (1989), there have been significant developments in the law and society that necessitate reconsideration of this precedent. Since 1989, many states have shunned the execution of sixteen- and seventeen-year-old offenders, reflecting a broadening national consensus against putting juveniles to death. Only seven of the fifty states have executed juveniles in the past 30 years, and only approximately one-third of all states permit imposition of the death penalty against offenders under eighteen. This legislation and the empirical evidence upon which it is based reflects a general recognition that juveniles under age eighteen share deficits,4like mentally retarded individuals, that make it inappropriate to subject them to the ultimate punishment reserved for the most morally culpable members of society.The Court recently found the imposition of the death penalty on mentally retarded persons to be unconstitutional in Atkins based on similar grounds. The ABA respectfully requests that the Court reconsider its decision in Stanford v. Kentucky, and recognize, as it has in the context of executing those who are mentally retarded, that the execution of juvenile offenders constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the U.S. Constitution
 For the right to appointment of counsel under § 3599 to be meaningful, the appointment must result in an attorney-client relationship that includes both the right to knowing, rational communication and decision-making by the capital habeas petitioners and,was composed of 24 lawyers and mental health professionals, both practitioners and academics, and included members of the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association. Its conclusions were submitted to the ABA House of Delegates as Recommendation with Report #122A and adopted as ABA policy in August 2006. With minor changes, the Recommendation with Report was officially endorsed by the other two groups. Id. at 668-69. * Id.6 in appropriate circumstances, the right to an appropriate stay of proceedings when they are not competent to participate. Further, the lawyers appointed under § 3599 must retain their ability to comply with their licensing jurisdictions' formulations of the Model Rules. The Model Rules require that the lawyers maintain, as far as reasonably possible, normal lawyer-client relationships, and that they initiate appropriate protective actions, which may include moving for a stay of proceedings when they reasonably believe their clients cannot adequately act in the clients' own interests.Under the Model Rules, effective communication between the client and lawyer is presumed. When the normal relationship is impaired, the lawyer should continue as far as reasonably possible to take actions consistent with the client's directions and decisions. Because the attorney-client relationship is one of agent and principal, however, a lawyer has no choice but to withdraw if the client's impairment is such that the lawyer is unable to comply with his or her responsibilities under the Model Rules. However, if withdrawal cannot be accomplished without material adverse effect on the client, the Model Rules provide for the lawyer to continue the representation and seek appropriate protective action on behalf of the client.While the Model Rules permit a lawyer to seek and federal habeas law provides for appointment of a guardian in appropriate circumstances, appointment of a guardian is a serious deprivation of the client's rights and should not be undertaken by the lawyer if other, less drastic, solutions are available. Consistent with the Model Rules, accordingly, the ABA asserts that a lawyer appointed under § 3599 must be able to7 pursue "other protective action," including moving for a stay of proceedings in appropriate circumstances.Clearly, an attorneys showing that a capital habeas petitioner's incompetence will prevent a fair and accurate resolution of specific claims should be sufficient grounds for a stay. However, the showing required should be flexible, and based on the wide variety of difficulties that arise from a prisoner's impairments and the circumstances of the case. Accordingly, the ABA requests that this Court hold that § 3599 also requires that courts use a flexible standard based on the particular incompetency of a petitioner and the circumstances of the case in determining whether a stay is appropriate
In Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1354 S. Ct. 1962 (2014), the Court held that the doctrine of laches cannot bar a claim for damages brought within the three-year window for recovering relief established by the Copyright Act because the statute takes delay into account. The Court's holding in Petrella applies equally to patent cases, which include similar limitations on the recovery of relief based on a plaintiff's delay. Nothing in the Patent Act, its legislative history, or the common law compels a different conclusion. Moreover, sound judicial policy supports extending Petrella to patent cases. For years, in response to calls for patent litigation reform, Congress and the courts have been working to reduce the filing of unsubstantiated claims of patent infringement. Retaining laches to bar legal damages in patent cases, however, will continue to encourage rushed, premature filings, and discourage nonlitigation resolutions such as settlement. Finally, retaining laches as a defense in extraordinary circumstances to curtail prospective equitable relief would provide adequate protection against prejudicial delay by parties, and equitable estoppel will protect those defendants who were misled by the promises or actions of a plaintiff.In Petrella, the Court also correctly held that in egregious circumstances laches may limit injunctive relief. Accordingly, the ABA urges this Court to hold5that the doctrine of patent laches should not be applied to bar pre-suit legal damages in patent cases during the statutory six-year damages period, but should be available under extraordinary circumstances to prohibit resort to injunctive relief when appropriate
Justice: Powell, in his concurrence in Apodaca v.Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), determined that theConstitution does not require unanimous juryverdicts in state criminal trials.While thisdetermination was based in part on a 1968 ABAstandard that permitted less-than-unanimous verdicts, the ABA changed its standard in 1976 toaffirm that a jury verdict in criminal trials should be unanimous.Throughout the thirty-plus years since Apodaca was decided, the ABA has continued to affirm that a unanimous verdict should be a fundamental part of acriminal defendant's right to a jury trial. Mostrecently, in 2005, as the result of its American Jury4Project, the ABA principles, one ofdecision shouldheard by a jury.adopted nineteen which provides thatbe required in allcore jury trial a unanimouscriminal casesApowcnroBoormAcktpe,hTrsehesethsojeourrmnAecyeBsdo'Aiusn'vccoeselfrsuoldwesrehttehiaviecninthedhrwtaaehrtleidsiosafcbtdihrrileihesimasctivyeunneasaorsolncefahd-ljjuuwunrsaabyatnyeindslcoidewmee,btomeseupeyrishnsmratiisencbmadaa.eltlseciediodsTdnihatsoitho,nsaensilences minoritycriminal justiceviewpoints, erodessystem, and doesconfidence in thenot significantlycontribute to a reduction in hung juries and retrials.Because each member of the Apodaca Courtagreed on the importance of thorough jurydeliberations, attention to minority viewpoints andcommunity confidence in jury verdicts, and becausethe ABA's review of research and empirical data, aswell as the consensus of the legal community, hasconcluded that the opposite occurs through the non-unanimous decision process, the ABA supportspetitioner's request that Apodaca be revisited
The ABA urges the Court to uphold the 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act as constitutional. The congressional record contains extensive statistical evidence and first-hand accounts demonstrating that the predicates for Section 5 preclearance continue to exist--namely, that unconstitutional voting discrimination continues in covered jurisdictions, that such discrimination would be even more prevalent without Section 5, and that Section 5 is an effective tool to combat it.87 The ABA's participation included letters sent to Congress supporting reauthorization. See, e.g., Letter from Robert D. Evans, Director, ABA Governmental Affairs Office, to House of Representatives (June 20, 2006), http://www.abanet.org/poladv/ letters/electionlaw/060620letter_vra_reauth_house.pdf; Letter from Robert D. Evans, Director, ABA Governmental Affairs Office, to Senate 2 (July 20, 2006), http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/ election law/060720letter_vra_reauth_senate.pdf.8 Indeed, as recently as last year, courts continue to reject under Section 5 voting laws that have a discriminatory purpose or effect. See, e.g., Texas v. United States, __ F. Supp. 2d __, 2012 WL 3671924, at *18 (D.D.C. Aug. 28, 2012) (redistricting plan violated Section 5 because it "was enacted with discriminatory purpose" and would increase representation gap); Texas v. Holder, __ F. Supp. 2d __, 2012 WL 3743676, at *32 (D.D.C. Aug. 30, 2012) (voter ID law violated Section 55The congressional record also supports Congress' conclusion that Section 2 litigation alone would be an inadequate and insufficient remedy for voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions. That is the focus of this brief. Voting rights litigation under Section 2, as many ABA members know from front line experience, is extremely complex and costly. During the several years it regularly takes to litigate a Section 2 case, officials who were elected under an improper election regime continue to hold office, implement policies, and make a wide variety of decisions that remain in effect, often long after the election process that brought them to power is found to be discriminatory. Moreover, success in eliminating one discriminatory practice is often followed by the adoption of a new discriminatory practice that must be fought all over again. These effects are real and profound for representative democracy--and they cannot be remediated effectively through the prospective remedies Section 2 litigation characteristically offers.The congressional record documents the limitations that would result from relying exclusively on Section 2 litigation to fight voting discrimination in jurisdictions with a documented history of discrimination. These limitations underscore the continuing need for Section 5 preclearance. The time, cost, and complexity of prosecuting a Section 2 case cause significant on-going harms that could be minimized by Section 5 preclearance but often cannot be remedied after the fact.because it would have retrogressive effect on racial minorities' effective exercise of the right to vote).
 Individuals suffering from severe mental illness at the time of their crimes should not be sentenced to death, for three reasons. First, neither retribution nor deterrence is served by executing those whose perceptions of reality, logical reasoning, and ability to exercise rational judgment are significantly impaired at the time of the crime. Second, capital proceedings are substantially less reliable and fair for the severely mentally ill: as compared to their abled counterparts, those suffering from severe mental illness are more likely to confess to crimes they did not commit, less capable of making a persuasive showing of mitigation, and less able to assist their counsel in preparing and presenting a defense. Finally, the emerging consensus holds that executing the severely mentally ill is wrong. The only way to address these fundamental concerns is to categorically prohibit the execution of individuals who were suffering from severe mental illness at the time of their crimes. This conclusion is sound not only as a matter of policy, but also law. The Supreme Court of the United States already has categorically exempted the intellectually disabled from execution, for the same reasons. There is no principled basis to treat individuals suffering from severe mental illness differently. Indeed, the Court's4reasoning applies a fortiori in Nevada, where the State's constitutional ban on cruel or unusual punishments is by its terms broader than the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments
The American Bar Association is committed to preserving the integrity,impartiality, and independence of the judiciary. In furtherance of that end, the ABA has adopted model codes of judicial conduct and model rules for judicial disciplinary enforcement to assist states in creating their own rules and proceduresgoverning judicial conduct. Every state has adopted rules that vest responsibilityfor enforcing those codes of conduct in state judicial conduct organizations and thestates' highest courts. In light of the states' compelling interests and specialexpertise in regulating their judiciaries, state judicial disciplinary matters should beresolved in state, not federal, forums.|The New York provisions in question are critical to preserve the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the judiciary. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the federal judiciary have adopted codes of judicial conduct that contain provisions identical to or substantively the same as one or more of the New York provisions that were held to be facially unconstitutional. Therefore, affirmance of the district court's judgment would undermine judicial disciplinary efforts not just in New York but in jurisdictions throughout the nation.The New York provisions that were held to be unconstitutional embody the American legal profession's longstanding views on Judicial conduct and judicialcampaigning. The origins of the standards of conduct embodied in thoseprovisions date as far back as the 1924 ABA Canons of Judicial Ethics, and the 1990 and 1972 ABA Model Codes of Judicial Conduct, upon which the New York provisions are largely based, were the product of extensive study and discussionb:y a broad cross-section of the legal profession and the public, including members of the judiciary. Adoption of similar provisions by virtually every other jurisdiction and the courts' consistent rejection of constitutional challenges to the affected provisions confirms the consensus of opinion underlying those provisions.For the reasons stated above, the American Bar Association respectfully urges that this Court reverse the district court's F ebruary 20, 2003 judgment.
 While the Special Master recognized that individual public defenders have significant professional and ethical obligations to their clients that cannot be properly met due to excessive caseloads, the Special Master concluded that caseload limitation by monthly cutoff makes the problem worse for the rest of the criminal justice system. The ABA respectfully asserts that, in resolving this issue, appropriate weight must be given to the ethical and professional obligations set forth in the Missouri Supreme Court Rules ("Missouri Rules") and the ABA Model Rules, each of which require, with no exceptions, that all lawyers - including the individual public defenders - must provide diligent and competent representation to each of their clients. Specifically, a lawyer must not take on a new representation, even where court-appointed, or must withdraw from a current representation, if representation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct. The ABA also believes that appropriate weight must be gIven to the responsibility of the Public Defender Office who, in addition to supervising individual public defenders and providing oversight for their workloads, must also take corrective action in advance of a subordinate lawyer's violation of the ethical and professional rules. When a Public Defender Office concludes that assignments must be stopped or withdrawals permitted, the ABA believes that according5substantial deference to this assessment promotes independence of the defense function from the judiciary and is consistent with the ethical and professional obligations of the Public Defender Office and the individual lawyers to ensure diligent and competent representation for each client
Federal immigration law consists of a framework of federal statutes and regulations that are implemented by a multitude of agencies and specialized courts. Based on the experiences of ABA member-volunteers and staff working with federal immigration detainees, the ABA respectfully submits that none of the four enjoined provisions of 5.B. 1070 can be implemented without inevitably conflicting with this federal system. Because ABA experience is particularly relevant to the potential enforcement of Sections 2 and 6, the ABA focus herein is on those sections.5Section 2 of S.B. 1070 is especially problematic inits requirement of indefinite detention by Arizonastate and local authorities of anyone suspected ofbeing unlawfully present until immigration status isverified by federal authorities.In addition tosignificant due process concerns from state "non-criminal" detention without federal immigrationoversight, this Section does not consider thecomplexity of federal immigration laws andregulations, or that United States citizens and manylawfully present aliens are not required to have orcarry identification, or that there are manycategories of lawful presence, or that there is nosingle, accurate database for verifying immigrationstatus.Of similar concern is Section 6, which requires that state and local officers determine whether an alien is removable based on criminal history. Whilecommission of certain crimes clearly triggers grounds for removal, others require multiple proceedings before a determination can be made, and even then, there are forms of relief that may be available.Finally, while there are mechanisms for state and local law enforcement assistance under federal supervision, there have been serious problems with state and local action even in these programs. If states are permitted to create a patchwork of conflicting mandates, the decisions about arrest and detention across states may well depend on whetherenforcement activity is conducted by federal authorities, or by a state under federal supervision,6or by a state under its own, possibly unique,immigration law.None of the four enjoinedprovisions of S.B. 1070 mandate actions that areconsistent with the role for state and_ localimmigration enforcement that is contemplated underfederal law and policy and, accordingly, each shouldbe found to be preempted
 All criminal defendants, regardless of their financial means, are entitled toeffective assistance of counsel. To meet this Constitutional standard, ethical rules require attorneys to provide their clients with competent and diligent representation. An excessive caseload makes it impossible for even the most qualified and committed lawyer to provide competent and diligent representation to all of her clients all of the time. Inevitably, this results in a juggling act under which some clients at times do not receive effective assistance of counsel.Petitioners have asserted that excessive caseloads prevent the Law Office of the Public Defender ("LOPD") and its attorneys from providing all clients with the competent and diligent representation required by the New Mexico Rules of Professional Conduct and articulated in ABA professional standards. The court below found that LOPD is "chronically underfunded, understaffed and [has] caseloads that exceed National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals (NAC), and standards set by the New Mexico Public Defender Commission." Under these circumstances, LOPD is not just permitted, but ethically required, to decline appointments.5Ultimately, courts must ensure that public defense providers and their lawyers are able to provide competent and diligent representation in accordance with their professional obligations and that the representation complies with the strictures of the Sixth Amendment. In determining appropriate relief for excessive public defender caseloads, reference to national caseload standards, while useful, is insufficient. Workload standards must take into account the practices and circumstances of the particular jurisdiction. A jurisdiction specific workload study is the most accurate way to set the appropriate workloads standards for LOPD. If such a workload study is not feasible, LOPD should be accorded substantial deference in determining the workload its attorneys can handle while meeting their Constitutional and ethical obligations. Accordingly, this Court should, under its power of superintending control, order lower courts to permit LOPD to decline appointments when LOPD deems necessary to provide effective assistance of counsel to its clients until such time as a workload study can be completed to determine the appropriate workload standard in New Mexico.III.
Under a correct construction of the Copyright Act and this Court's decision in Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L'anza Research International, Inc., 523 U.S. 185 (1948), a copyright owner may prevent the importation into the United States of copies of copyrighted works made abroad when no authorized first sale of those copies in the United States has occurred. The statute at issue in this case -- which codifies the principle known as the "first sale" or "exhaustion" doctrine -- applies to "the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title." 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) (emphasis added). An authorized first sale of qualifying copies exhausts the copyright owner's exclusive right to control the importation of those copies into the United States. For two reasons, this Court should hold that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to works manufactured outside the United States.5 First, that interpretation of the Copyright Act is most consistent with this Court's prior guidance in Quality King, which drew a distinction between copies lawfully made under the law of the United States and copies made "under the law of some other country." 523 U.S. at 147. Quality King strongly suggested that the latter category would not be subject to the firstsale doctrine. Although this discussion was dictum, it has induced substantial reliance from attorneys advising clients, as well as from copyright holders and manufacturers. Departing now from the reasoning of Quality King would disrupt settled expectations in the marketplace that have been based on reasonable reliance on that precedent and long-standing lower court decisions. Second, limiting the availability of the first-sale defense to goods manufactured domestically best comports with the text and structure of the Copyright Act. Copies made abroad are not naturally regarded as being "lawfully made under" U.S. law, much less under U.S. copyright law, which does not apply extraterritorially. Moreover, interpreting the first-sale doctrine to permit the importation of copies of works produced and sold outside the United States despite the lack of an authorized first sale in the United States would render the right to control importation in Section 602(a) largely superfluous. It would also invite the adoption of costly and complicated contractual arrangements that have no purpose or effect other than to preserve the copyright owner's exclusive right to control distribution into the United States.6 The Second Circuit's conclusion that "foreignmanufactured works" are not "made under" U.S. copyright law and thus fall within the protections of Section 109(a) when there has been no qualifying first sale accordingly should be affirmed
 The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit marks a substantial departure from the "principles of the common law" as they have historically been "interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience." Fed. R. Evid. 501. It represents the first time a federal court has ruled that the death of a client so weakens the attorneyclient privilege that it may be overcome based on a court's balancing of the government's claimed need for privileged information against the client's interest in confidentiality. This novel ruling, while directly applicable only to federal criminal proceedings, has the potential to affect attorney-client relationships nationwide and to impair the goals of the ethical principles that require attorneys to protect client confidences. It undermines the certainty of clients and attorneys everywhere that their communications will remain confidential, and it may confound many thousands of persons who, anticipating their own death, seek the advice of attorneys to assist in ordering their affairs. Indeed, it is fair to assume that hundreds of thousands if not millions of Americans live today--in hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, or in their own homes--in the expectation that they may soon die, whether from disease, old age, or occupational perils, or--like the client in this case--by their own hands. Many of these people undoubtedly have secrets and confidences that, if revealed, would be at the least highly embarrassing to themselves or their friends and loved ones. These might include wrongs done to others by themselves, their friends, or members of their families; hidden assets or financial transactions; or illegitimate children or relationships. Countless other examples could be given. The attorney-client privilege exists in large part because disclosure to lawyers of confidences such as these enables4. people to obtain advice and assistance to guide future actions or to rectify or ameliorate the consequences of past actions. Absent the assurance of confidentiality, such disclosures likely would never be made. The existence and integrity of the attorney-client privilege does not obstruct the truthfinding process. Instead, it promotes disclosure of the truth to lawyers and fosters actions available under the law to redress wrongs that might otherwise be left undiscovered and unaddressed. Decisions such as the one below threaten to impede these important aims.This is not, it should be emphasized, a case involving the proposed creation of a new privilege, or the expansion of an existing one into hitherto unprotected areas. Such expansions of privilege may be problematic or controversial, see, e.g., Jaffee v. Redmond, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 1933 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting), and the courts have traditionally stepped carefully in such matters. The issue here, however, is whether a firmly entrenched privilege is to be scaled back through the creation of a new exception wholly at odds with its history and purposes. The burden of establishing that "reason and experience" justify such curtailment of the privilege has not been met, and the Court should not allow the perceived needs of the moment to override the weight of history, tradition and policy that support the privilege.The lower court's opinion is equally destructive of another critical protection afforded by the law to communications and other materials created by lawyers in the course of representing their clients: the work-product doctrine. Crafted by this Court over the course of half a century, this doctrine helps to protect the adversary system by creating a zone of protection for the mental impressions lawyers develop in anticipation of litigation--i.e., for "opinion work product." Although the attorney notes sought by the Independent Counsel in this case lie at the center of5. this protected zone, the D.C. Circuit did not grant them the heightened protection that the work-product doctrine affords such materials. The lower court's rationale for denying the notes such protection rests on an arbitrary distinction between initial client interviews and subsequent interviews conducted by attorneys in anticipation of litigation--a distinction that fails to accord with either reason or the experience of practicing lawyers

The ABA urges this Court to hold that factual findings made in support of a district court's claim construction be reviewed only for clear error, as prescribed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6). The ABA also respectfully requests that this Court overrule any contrary Federal Circuit precedent requiring de novo review of factual findings made during claim construction, including the en banc decisions in Cybor and Lighting Ballast.1. The Federal Circuit's de novo standard of review for the factual matters underlying claim construction stems from the majorities' holdings in Cybor and Lighting Ballast that claim construction is a purely legal matter. This Court, however, has previously classified claim construction as a mixed question of fact and law. Moreover, the evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic evidence by district courts during claim construction necessarily involves the determination of issues of fact. These include determining the level of skill in the art, evaluating the patent specification and prosecution history and assessing the value of any expert testimony. The hybrid nature of claim construction thus demands a hybrid standard of review: a de novo assessment of the ultimate claim construction, and clear error review for the factual matters underlying this determination.2. Neither the Cybor nor Lighting Ballast majorities have attempted to square de5novo review with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6), which states that "[f]indings of fact . . . must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous." Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6). This Court has noted that Rule 52(a) applies to all factual findings in actions tried before a judge. It has also explained that factual findings underlying other mixed issues of patent law, e.g., obviousness, should be reviewed for clear error pursuant to Rule 52(a)(6). The departure from the "clear error" standard in the claim construction context should thus be corrected.3. De novo appellate review of factual findings ignores the proper role of district courts, which are best positioned to make findings of fact during claim construction. Applying a de novo standard of review undermines confidence in trial court Markman rulings. It also often results in overruling a district court construction that is based on first-hand access to witnesses and other evidence, in favor of an appellate interpretation of patent claims based solely on the written record. Clear error review pursuant to Rule 52(a) would therefore reestablish the traditional role of the trial court as a finder of fact.The rule espoused in Cybor and Lighting Ballast has led to high reversal rates for district court claim construction rulings at the Federal Circuit. The resulting unpredictability regarding appellate outcomes has left the patent community lacking in guidance as to how patent claims should be drafted, interpreted and litigated. In addition, the increased uncertainty that has resulted from de novo review has led to longer and more costly lawsuits and has discouraged settlement. By increasing predictability, clear error review of district court factual findings would alleviate these problems.

The ABA takes no position on the precise question before this Court ­ if and under what circumstances can a court approve a settlement that consists solely of a cy pres award with no direct relief to class members based on a finding that such payments are not feasible. Consistent with that limited scope, the ABA will not argue the specifics of whether the district court's decision should be affirmed, reversed, or remanded. However, as an amicus curiae, the ABA seeks to provide information to this Court about the role of cy pres awards in class actions, their importance in funding legal services to low-income and indigent litigants, and the potential impact on state statutes and rules providing for cy pres awards. These are important considerations for this Court as it considers for the first time the5specific standards that lower courts should apply in considering if and under what circumstances they should authorize cy pres awards in class action settlements.The cy pres doctrine, originally a creation of trust law, has increasingly been used as a basis to distribute residual funds from class action settlements to nonprofit organizations or other thirdparty beneficiaries with interests reasonably approximate to those of the class members. This equitable doctrine ensures that neither the defendant nor class members receive windfalls when settlement funds go unclaimed or distribution to class members proves infeasible.Cy pres is most commonly used in class actions brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), which permits aggregate claims for monetary damages. Such claims often involve small individual recoveries, which may deter individual litigants from pursuing claims and counsel from taking on representations. Rule 23(b)(3), thus, serves the purpose of improving the ability of class members to obtain justice by aggregating their claims and deterring wrongful conduct.A similar purpose is served by the legal services organizations that are often appropriate recipients of cy pres awards. These organizations provide legal services to low-income and indigent litigants who otherwise would have no representation in civil courts. This unity of purpose justifies cy pres awards to legal services organizations, as both courts and state legislatures have recognized. The ABA urges this Court to do the same.6Finally, the ABA asks this Court to limit any decision about cy pres awards to the question presented and to avoid broad pronouncements about the constitutionality of cy pres remedies in class action settlements. Such a ruling would not only impact federal class actions, but would potentially disrupt state statutory schemes that provide for cy pres awards to legal services organizations
The Constitution enshrines equal justice as a core principle of our democracy. The promise of equal treatment without regard to economic status inheres in multiple provisions of the Constitution. Indeed, this Court has treated equal justice as one of the Constitution's cardinal guarantees. Again and again in cases involving the criminal justice system, the Court has elevated the principle of equal justice over considerations of cost, administrative ease, and more potent law enforcement. The Court has guaranteed criminal defendants a lawyer at both the trial and appellate level without regard to ability to pay, barred fees that would prevent access to the courts, and prohibited differential punishments for those who can pay fines and those who cannot.5The Court has also recognized that imposing the same requirements or penalties across the board on defendants presenting a wide array of different circumstances is not equal justice. A million-dollar fine, for example, is unlikely to deprive a very rich person of food, shelter, or livelihood. The same fine--or even one that is orders of magnitude smaller--levied on a poor person who cannot pay it could cast him into an inescapable spiral of debt and imprisonment.The Excessive Fines Clause should be a bulwark against fines that deny equal justice. The Clause has historically served two functions. First, it has sought to bar fines so disproportionate to the crimes they punish that they entrap defendants into endless cycles of poverty. Second, it has sought to prevent fines so disconnected from individual defendants' ability to pay that they render punishment harsher for poor defendants than for rich ones, potentially rendering the penalty out of proportion to the offense by depriving low-income defendants of food, shelter and livelihood even for relatively minor infractions.Empirical evidence corroborates how excessive fines undermine equal justice. The evidence demonstrates that excessive fines have a disproportionate impact on the poor, as well as a significantly disparate impact based on race.This Court has held that a right in the Bill of Rights must be incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause if that right is "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty" and "so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental," McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 760-61 (2010). The Excessive Fines Clause meets that standard. As dis-6cussed below, the historical record shows that equal justice in the imposition of fines--the objective of the Excessive Fines Clause--is deeply embedded in the protections afforded in the criminal justice system. Further, this Court's long insistence on equal treatment in the administration of criminal justice, without regard to financial means, further demonstrates the centrality of equal justice where a defendant's liberty is at stake. Despite this insistence, empirical evidence demonstrates the persistence of inequities in the system of justice, and corroborates that excessive fines disproportionately burden the poor and communities of color. That disparate impact implicates additional guarantees and protections of equal treatment, adding to the combination of attributes that place equal justice at the core of ordered liberty.No just society should knowingly subject defendants to fines they can never pay and then punish them further for their financial default. Such denials of equal justice, however, are rampant in local courts throughout the country, spawning a renaissance of debtors' prisons--an institution ostensibly abolished as inhumane 170 years ago--to house those who cannot pay the fines imposed upon them. The prohibition on excessive fines, once identified as the Magna Carta's most important guarantee, is increasingly important to safeguard the fundamental right to equal justice.
Section 3's unprecedented discrimination against gays and lesbians legally married under state law bars them from legal protections and civic responsibilities that accrue under federal law to every other lawfully married couple. As attorneys, ABA members observe firsthand Section 3's damaging effects on fundamental aspects of their gay and lesbian clients' lives.I. Among its consequences, Section 3 denies married gay and lesbian couples protections under the Family Medical Leave Act; for some, it deprives them of access to affordable health insurance and healthcare; it impairs the ability of married gay and lesbian couples to plan for their futures and save for retirement; it may compel them to pay higher taxes; it withholds benefits that our country bestows on married members of the U.S. Armed Forces; and it excludes gay and lesbian spouses who are non-U.S. citizens from some of the protections of our immigration laws.II. Section 3 is an unprecedented intrusion by Congress into domestic relations law, which has historically been the exclusive province of the States. Section 3 is the first time that Congress has attempted to define marriage for purposes of all55989710v.1federal laws and regulations and the only time that Congress has sought to exclude a class of marriages valid under state law from all federal protections and benefits of marriage. "[D]iscriminations of an unusual character especially suggest careful consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to" constitutional principles. Romer, 517 U.S. at 633. Moreover, laws, like Section 3, that upset the traditional federal-state balance should be carefully scrutinized to ensure that they comply with the Constitution's demands.Even under the rational-basis review applied in Romer, none of the governmental interests advanced in support of Section 3 justifies its sweeping exclusion of lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from the rights and responsibilities of marriage. Section 3 does not enable the federal government to define marriage for itself, nor does it create a uniform definition of marriage. Federal law, by and large, still defers to the States' varied definitions of marriage, except in the case of gay and lesbian couples. Still less does Section 3 encourage the States to experiment with recognizing same-sex marriage; to the contrary, it prevents States from granting their married gay and lesbian citizens true equality with their heterosexual counterparts. And even if Section 3 saves the federal government money, that cannot by itself be a sufficient justification for excluding a specific group from government benefits. Finally, Section 3's exclusion of gay and lesbian married couples does nothing whatever to encourage heterosexual marriage and child-rearing. Section 3 discriminates against legally65989710v.1married gay and lesbian couples and rationally furthers no governmental interest except an illegitimate one of "mak[ing] them unequal to everyone else." Romer, 517 U.S. at 635
The ABA Standards on Pretrial Release recommend that States adopt statutes that favor citation and release, rather than arrest, for minor offenses, unless additional factors suggesting danger or a likelihood of non-appearance are present. 2007 Pretrial Release Standards at 65­66, App. 5­6 (Standard 102.2). These Standards have been studied, refined,6and formally adopted by the ABA on four different occasions over the past forty years. They have influenced the statutes and rules adopted in the vast majority of American jurisdictions, including Virginia, that favor citation and release for minor offenses. See generally Whitcomb, Citation Release, supra. Thus the ABA Standards represent a realistic, balanced, and reasonable policy--a consensus view adopted by a wide range of thinkers and law enforcement interests over time--and they have proven to be effective in the field.This Court has, in other cases, relied on the ABA Standards to determine what is reasonable. E.g., Rompilla, supra, 545 U.S. at 387 (Sixth Amendment); Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 761 (2005) (citing the Standards and Commentary to evaluate arrest authority). In particular, because the state courts here found no facts to reasonably suggest that an arrest was necessary for this minor offense, and Virginia state law prohibited the arrest, the ABA Standards counsel that the arrest was unreasonable. Moreover, the Commentary to ABA Standard 10-2.4 recognizes that when no reasonable grounds for arrest are present, then "once a citation is issued the police officer has no authority to search unless a basis other than incident to arrest is apparent (e.g., plain view)." 2007 Pretrial Release Standards, Commentary to Standard 10-2.4, at 70 n.31, App. 13 n.31. Thus the search here, conducted pursuant to an unreasonable arrest, was also unreasonable. The ABA respectfully submits that this Court should consider the consensus views expressed in the Pretrial Release Standards to determine that the Virginia statute reflects a reasonable rule in the7Fourth Amendment context, and for that reason, affirm the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court
 The ABA has long encouraged immigration courts to decrease the imposition of financial conditions on pretrial release and to eliminate any bond system that does not account for a noncitizens ability to pay. In place of arbitrarily fixed bonds, the ABA supports the use of individualized bond determinations, including the consideration of humane alternatives to detention that are the least restrictive means to ensuring appearance. This policy, which is consistent with ABA policies in the criminal justice context, serves both principled and practical objectives. First, an arbitrary bond systemunder which a noncitizen may be detained solely because of her inability to paydiscriminates against indigent parties and thereby offends bedrock constitutional principles that govern pretrial detention, particularly the guarantees of due process and equal protection in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court has held that pretrial detention deprives noncitizen respondents of their fundamental right to liberty. That deprivation may be permissible only if it furthers a legitimate law enforcement rationalenot if it punishes noncitizens for4Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» ïë ±º ìëtheir poverty. Constitutional principles therefore require that conditions of pretrial release, including bonds, be calibrated to account for the noncitizens financial resources as well as his or her risk of flight.In addition to ensuring that bond procedures are constitutionally sound, ABA policies are intended to promote the evenhanded and efficient administration of justice. Arbitrary detention based solely on wealth imposes substantial harms on the legal and financial interests of detained individuals and their families. Detainees often lose their jobs, and as a result may lose their homes and parental rights over U.S.-born children. In addition, detainees are substantially less capable of securing representation in removal proceedings, with the effect of dramatically decreasing their chances of a successful outcome. The collective impact of arbitrary bond determinations is an increase in the detained population and an increase in the total time noncitizens spend in detentiona result that overburdens a detention system that already costs this country nearly $2.5 billion per year. These personal and financial harms are even less justified in light of data suggesting that5Ý¿-»æ ïêóëêèîçô ðíñðèñîðïéô ×Üæ ïðíìçðìïô Üµ¬Û²¬®§æ íïô Ð¿¹» ïê ±º ìëalternatives to detention, such as supervised release, are extremelyeffective at ensuring appearances at removal proceedings.For the reasons set forth herein, the ABA asks this Court to affirmthe district courts injunction
 For decades, the ABA has urged jurisdictions to reduce their reliance on financial conditions on pretrial release and to eliminate inflexible money-bail schemes based on preset bail schedules. See Standard 10-1.4; Standard 10-5.3. When the First Edition of the ABA's Criminal Justice Standards was adopted in 1968, the ABA emphasized the serious constitutional concerns with inflexible money-bail systems, which discriminate against the indigent and impair defendants' ability to prepare an effective defense. The ABA's concerns about overuse of money bail have only deepened over time, and the Third Edition of the Standards now provides that monetary conditions on pretrial release are appropriate only once the court considers the defendant's individual circumstances and the possibility of alternative conditions of release. Decades of research and study have shown that excessive use of money bail harms defendants with little offsetting benefit to jurisdictions that use such systems. Inflexible money-bail systems disrupt the lives of indigent defendants,- 5 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 17 of 47lead to worse legal outcomes, and pressure defendants to plead guilty. At the same time, inflexible money-bail systems, which tie pretrial detention to the defendant's ability to pay rather than an objective risk assessment, do not improve appearance rates or public safety, and leave jurisdictions that use such systems bearing the costs of overcrowded jails. It is no surprise, therefore, that a wide range of criminal justice stakeholders and a growing number of States and local jurisdictions have joined the ABA in rejecting inflexible use of money bail.Inflexible money-bail systems like the one at issue in this case violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that individuals may not be incarcerated solely because of their inability to pay fines, fees, and court costs. That principle is particularly strong in the context of pretrial detention, given that our criminal justice system affords the accused a presumption of innocence. Moreover, an inflexible money-bail system based on a preset bond schedule fails to provide the individualized determination necessary to comport with due process. Accordingly, the district court's order entering a preliminary injunction should be affirmed.- 6 -Case: 16-10521 Date Filed: 08/18/2016 Page: 18 of 4
For four decades, the ABA has adhered to theposition that counsel should be provided to anindigent criminal defendant as soon as feasible aftercustody begins, formal charges are filed, or theaccused appears before a committing magistrate,whichever is earliest. This position is presented inStandard 5-6.1 of the ABA's Standards for CriminalJustice.The ABA's Standards represent theconsensus views of experienced criminal adjudicatorsand practitioners, and have informed this Court'sconstitutional analysis, including its interpretation ofthe Sixth Amendment.This Court's cases, as well as Standard 5-6.1,recognize that timely participation by counselprotects individual liberty and promotes the fair andefficient administration of justice.Competentcounsel can promptly move for the dismissal ofunfounded charges, preserve evidence vital to laterstages of proceedings, and secure pretrial release orfavorable bail conditions for the accused. The failureto appoint counsel at the early stages may result inunnecessaryincarcerationandavoidableprosecutions; it may also deny indigent defendants4 crucial protections and, in so doing, perpetuate discrimination between impecunious defendants and those of means.Petitioner's plight illustrates the soundness of ABA Criminal Justice Standard 5-6.1 and the peril of the court of appeals' approach. Petitioner was innocent of the charged offense from the start. Had a competent attorney assisted him at or after his initial appearance, petitioner may well have permanently regained his liberty much earlier. Instead, he was indicted by a grand jury, rearrested, incarcerated and transferred to a_ different jail because of overcrowding. He was not finally cleared of charges until nine months after his initial arrest. The failure to appoint counsel in response to petitioner's early requests may have caused not only an unnecessary loss of liberty for petitioner, but an equally unnecessary expenditure of the state's limited judicial and penological resources
Plaintiffs' brief rests on the erroneous assumption that Phillips v.Washington Legal Foundation, _ U.S.__, 118 S. Ct. 1925, 141 L.

Further, Phillips does not address the three elements of the takings claims asserted by plaintiffs Brown and Hayes, real estate purchasers whose funds were deposited into LPO IOLTA accounts. Brown and Hayes can satisfy none of those elements. First, under Washington law, they have no property right in the earnings on escrowed funds that they voluntarily placed beyond their dominion and control, especially when those funds could not have generated a net return for them. Second, no property has been "taken," since Brown and Hayes have been deprived of no investment-backed expectations and have lost nothing of value. Third, they are entitled to no compensation since, by virtue of the protections of APR 12.1, the property supposedly taken had no value to them.Plaintiffs fare no better with respect to their First Amendment claim, which rests on the premise that the state has forced them to engage in "speech" against their will. Rather than identify allegedly compelled expression to which they are opposed, plaintiffs object to the fact of IOLTA funding itself. The Supreme Court has held, however, that such a financial objection does not raise a cognizable Firstincentive to obtain the parties' agreement as to the allocation of interest before depositing funds in an interest-bearing account.15ovu vueuuue wetAmendment claim. Further, given the remote and anonymous connection betweenBrown's and Hayes' deposits into escrows and the alleged expressive activitiesundertaken by the ultimate recipients of IOLTA funds, plaintiffs cannot plausiblyclaim to be associated with any "message." Plaintiffs' claims thus fall outside theestablished purpose of the compelled-speech doctrine, which is to protect©ege ve eesindividuals from involuntary identification with expression not of their choosing.Iv
A. Because money is fungible, an alleged taking of money is categorically different from an appropriation of tangible personal or real property, to which a per se takings analysis may apply. Petitioners' claim that an appropriation of money must be evaluated as a per se taking runs counter to takings jurisprudence generally, which applies the multifactor regulatory takings test even where governmental action has severe monetary impacts. Thus, the alleged taking here must be analyzed under regulatory takings principles, just as this Court has analyzed alleged takings of money in the past. As Respondents explain in their brief, such an analysis leads to the conclusion that the Washington IOLTA program does not effect a taking at all.7 See Civil Justice: An Agenda for the 1990s (1989), at http:// www.abanet.org/legalservices/downloads/sclaid/accessconf.pdf.7B. Even if a taking had occurred, no compensation would be due to Petitioners. It has long been settled that the measure of compensation under the Fifth Amendment is what the owner of the property has lost, not what the State has gained. Here, Petitioners have suffered no pecuniary loss. While Petitioners may have lost the right to exclude others from the use of the interest earnings on their deposits, such a loss in these circumstances has no economic significance for purposes of just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. In any event, Petitioners lost the right to exclude others from using interest earnings on their deposits not as a result of Washington's adoption of an IOLTA program, but as a result of their voluntary decision to deposit funds into escrow that could not earn net interest.C. The fact that Petitioners are owed nothing in the way of just compensation resolves the case. Because the Constitution forbids only takings without just compensation, there can be no constitutional violation when no compensation would be due. Nothing in the Fifth Amendment or in takings jurisprudence supports Petitioners' notion that a taking of valueless property can be enjoined, while the taking of valuable property can proceed, subject only to the owner's right to seek compensation
In Executive Benefits, this Court reserved the second question on which certiorari has now been granted, stating, "[T]his case does not require us to address whether Article III permits a bankruptcy court, with the consent of the parties, to enter final judgment on a Stern claim." 134 S. Ct. at 2170, n.4. The ABA respectfully asserts that allowing the bankruptcy courts to finally adjudicate a non-core or Stern claim, with the parties' consent, does not violate Article III. Rather, it is consistent with this Court's precedents and discussion in Executive Benefits of the historical underpinnings of consent in bankruptcy proceedings.Further, the ability of litigants to consent to final adjudications by non-Article III bankruptcy courts serves an important role in the federal court system. If litigants are no longer permitted to continue to consent to have their non-core and Stern claims adjudicated in the bankruptcy courts, the district courts' workloads will be impacted significantly, contrary to the Court's statement that its holding in Stern was "narrow" and would not "meaningfully chang[e] the division of labor in the current statute." 131 S. Ct. at 2620. Because magistrate judges serve the district courts under substantially similar constitutional6analysis, it may also include in its sweep matters now heard by the magistrate judges, who account for a staggering volume of judicial work. And more cases on the district courts' dockets would necessarily mean more delay for non-bankruptcy cases, as more cases compete for the district courts' time and attention.With significant considerations of judicial economy and practicality in question, this Court should clarify that there are no separation of powers concerns when litigants consent to non-Article III bankruptcy court adjudications of their Stern claims.---------------------------------  --------------------------------
1. "[P]risoners have a constitutional right of access to the courts." Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 821 (1977). The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996) ("PLRA"), provides that a prisoner who brings a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 must first exhaust the administrative remedies available in the prison system. Some courts have broadened this statutory requirement by demanding that prisoners also comply to the letter with all procedural requirements crafted by prison officials, including time limits, or be "procedurally defaulted" and barred from bringing their federal lawsuits. This case presents the question whether this judiciallycreated "procedural default rule" should be upheld, notwithstanding the fact that it is not mentioned in the text of the PLRA, inhibits a prisoner's constitutional right of access to the courts, and does not further the congressional policies underlying the PLRA.2. Because prison grievance procedures typically provide short deadlines to file a grievance, sometimes as little as a few days, the rule proposed by Petitioners would create4enormous practical barriers to the ability of prisoners-- including juveniles and illiterate prisoners--to pursue meritorious civil rights claims. Nothing in the text or legislative history of the PLRA suggests that Congress intended such a drastic interference with a prisoner's constitutional right of access to the courts.The creation of a procedural default rule unsupported by statutory language is inconsistent with this Court's decisions with respect to other statutory schemes that include administrative exhaustion requirements. Most notably, in cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, this Court has held that a petitioner's failure to meet a state-imposed statute of limitations for filing an administrative grievance does not constitute failure to exhaust administrative remedies and does not bar the petitioner from pursuing the claim in federal court. See EEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U.S. 107, 124 (1988); Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U.S. 750, 762-63 (1979).3. Circuits that have imposed a procedural default rule in prisoner civil rights litigation have improperly imported the rule from Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991), with respect to habeas corpus petitions. This Court explained that a procedural default rule furthers the purposes underlying the requirement in the habeas context that state judicial remedies be exhausted: "`to protect the state courts' role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state judicial proceedings.'" Id. at 731-32 (quoting Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518 (1982)).The PLRA's administrative exhaustion requirement, however, was neither designed nor intended to preserve the power of state courts, which have authority and expertise to render decisions regarding the scope of constitutional and other legal rights. Congress's purpose in enacting the5PLRA's administration exhaustion requirement was simply to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits by "afford[ing] corrections officials time and opportunity to address complaints internally before allowing the initiation of a federal case." Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524-25 (2002). This purpose is met so long as a prisoner pursues a grievance through the grievance process, though perhaps not necessarily in perfect compliance with the short timelines often set by corrections officials. In other words, so long as the grievance has been submitted to corrections officials, they will have been afforded an opportunity contemplated by Congress to resolve the grievance internally, if they so desire
The practicing patent bar and its clients require predictability with respect to the nature of enforcement of3 At its February 13, 2006 meeting, the House of Delegates of the ABA adopted the following statement as policy of the Association:RESOLVED, that the American Bar Association supports the granting of a permanent injunction enjoining a patent infringer from future infringement of a patent that has been adjudicated to be valid, enforceable and infringed, in accordance with the principles of equity on such terms as the court deems reasonable;FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Association opposes consideration of the extent to which the patent owner has practiced the patented invention or has licensed others to do so, except when determining whether grant of a permanent injunction would adversely affect public safety, public welfare, the national security, or the like.3patents. Attorneys must advise clients whether to undertake the very substantial expense of bringing a patent infringement action, whether and how to defend such an action, and whether to proceed through trial rather than reach an accommodation. Given the limited duration of patents, and the potential for multiple infringers if patents are not vigorously protected, patentees must make these choices quickly and with the knowledge that failure to bring a claim may undermine the very essence and value of its patent right: to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale or selling the patented invention for a limited time. 35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(1); Zenith Radio Corporation v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 135 (1969); Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U.S. 405, 429-430 (1908). The ABA respectfully submits that the Federal Circuit correctly articulated the expectation of Congress and patent litigants based on over a century of decisions in holding that a patentee is entitled to a permanent injunction against an infringer absent some special circumstance. That decision should not be disturbed.The right to permanently exclude an adjudicated infringer from continuing to practice the patented invention finds its basis in the Constitution and is a fundamental right recognized by Congress for the benefit of patentees, whether they practice their patented inventions or choose only to exploit their property rights through licensing or other lawful means. Because a patent confers no affirmative rights, without this well-established right to exclude, a patent has no intrinsic value.Existing statutory law and the jurisprudence of this Court and the U.S. Courts of Appeals, including in particular the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ("Federal Circuit"), support the granting of permanent injunctions in all cases of adjudicated infringement, except in those rare situations in which the injunction would adversely affect4public safety, public welfare, the national security or interests of similar importance to the public. The Federal Circuit applied these longstanding principles in this case. That court has not, as has been argued, adopted a per se or "near automatic" rule that divests the district courts of the equitable discretion provided under 35 U.S.C. § 283.The patent statute and judicial precedent recognize that a district court must exercise discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a permanent injunction. The Federal Circuit acknowledged that responsibility in this case. MercExchange L.L.C. v. eBay.com Inc., 401 F.3d 1323, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2005).However, the district court's discretion does not extend to making policy determinations reserved to Congress. Rather, this equitable discretion is limited to historically recognized equitable considerations, not ad hoc considerations of recent vintage. Accordingly, a district court is not empowered to deny a permanent injunction based on the nature of the patented subject matter of a patent or the nature of the patentee's activities in exploiting its patent absent the presence of important public interests. Such fundamental changes to long-established rules of patent law, that have been relied upon for generations by practitioners and industry, should come from Congress and not the courts.This case does not compel a departure from more than one hundred years of legal precedent. The private interests of adjudicated infringers and the policy arguments that Petitioners ask this Court to endorse would erode the value of patents and their attendant incentives for innovation.Accordingly, the ABA respectfully submits that the two questions posed by the Court should be answered in the negative.
