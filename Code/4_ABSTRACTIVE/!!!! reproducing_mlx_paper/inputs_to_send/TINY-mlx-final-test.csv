0,"['RECEiVED IN THE UNITED STATES DIscTcquR FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICTLO ALAAMA 1 \nSHARNALLE MITCHELL, LORENZO BROWN,\nDEB -RA P\nHCETT. CLV\nUS u 1 STCid 3 ALA flCTr\'T I Li Li L i \nCOURTNEY TUBBS,\nTITO WILLIAMS,\nPlaintiffs, \nV.\nTHE CITY OF MONTGOMERY,\nDefendant.\nCOMPLAINT Introduction The Plaintiffs in this case are each impowrished people who were jailed by the City of Montgomery because they were unable to pay a debt owed to the City from traffic tickets. In each case, the City ordered the Plamtiff either to pay the City immediately or to ""sit out"" his or her debt in the City jail at a rate of $50 per day. Although the Plaintiffs pleaded that they were Unable to pay due to their poverty, each was sent to jail for nonpayment and none was afforded the inquiry into their ability to pay that the United States and Alabama Constitutions require. Once locked in the City\'s jail, the Plaintiffs were told that they could reduce their time in jail by working off their debts for an additional $25 per day if they agreed to perform janitorial tasks assigned by City employees, including cleaning feces and blood from jail floors and wiping the jail bars inside their overcrowded cells.\nThe treatment of Sharnalle Mitchell, Lorenzo Brown, Tito Williams, and Courtney Tubbs reveals systemic illegality perpetrated by the City of Montgomery against some of its. poorest people. The City of Montgomery, as a matter of policy and practice, engages in the same conduct against many other indigent human beings on a daily basis, unlawfully jailing people if they are too poor to pay traffic tickets and the associated fees that the City increasingly levies.\nBy and through their attorneys, Plaintiffs seek in this civil action the vindication of their fundamental rights, compensation for the violations that they suffered, injunctive relief assuring that their rights will not be violated again, and a declaration that the City\'s conduct is unlawful. In the year 2014, these practices have no place in our society.\nNature of the Action\' It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to jail people when they cannot afford to pay debts owed to the City resulting from prior traffic tickets without conducting any inquiry into the person\'s ability to pay and without considering alternatives to imprisonment as required by federal and Alabama law.\n2. It is the policy and practice of the City to jail indigent people for these debts without informing people of their right to counsel and without providing adequate counsel.\n3. It is the policy and practice of the City to hold prisoners in the City jail at a rate of $50 per day, ""serving out"" their debts until the debts are extinguished. It is the policy and practice of the City to tell inmates that their time in City jail can be further reduced if they agree to ""work oft"" their debts to the City While in jail by laboring at janitorial and other work for the City at a rate of $25 per day toward their debts.\n\'Plaintiffs make the allegations in this Complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which they have had personal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters.\n4. It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to contract with a private for-profit corporation, Judicial Correction Services, Inc. (""JCS, Inc""), to perform what the City calls ""probation"" services, which consists of collecting City debts in exchange for fees added to the debts owed by people who cannot afford to pay their traffic ticket fees, costs, and surcharges immediately. It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to rely on the discretionary recommendations and factual representations of this private entity to make decisions about Whether to arrest a person, what disposition to enter in a person\'s case, and whether to put the person on ""probation"" or to require immediate payment or jail despite the fact that the private entity has a significant personal financial stake in these judicial enforcement proceedings.\n5. Plaintiffs seek declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief. Jurisdiction and Venue\n6. This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, 18 U.S.C. § 1595, and 28 U.S.C. § 2201, et seq.., and the Fourth, Sixth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S.. § 1331 and 1343.\n7. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1391. Parties\n8. Plaintiff Sharnlle Mitchell is a 23-year-old resident of Montgomery. Plaintiff Lorenzo Brown is a 58-year-old resident of Montgomery. Plaintiff Courtney Tubbs is a 23-yearOld resident of Montgomery. Plaintiff Tito Williams is a 38-year-old resident of Montgomery.\n9. Defendant City of Montgomery is a municipal corporation, organized under the laws of the State of Alabama, that operates the Montgomery City Jail and the Montgomery Municipal Court.\nFactual Background A. The Plaintiffs\' Imprisonment \nL\nPlaintiff Sharnalle Mitchell\n10. Sharnalle Mitchell is a 23-year-old woman and a mother of two children—a 1- year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl.\n11. On January 26, 2014, Montgomery City police officers came to Ms. Mitchell\'s home and arrested her because she owed the City money from traffic tickets issued in 2010.\nOfficers took Ms. Mitchell away from her two children and brought her to the City jail.\n12. The next day, January 27, 2014, she was brought to the City court and was told that she would not be released from jail unless she could pay the total amount of the fines, costs, associated fees, and extra surcharges from her tickets, which she was told was now in excess of \n$4,500\nMs. Mitchell told the City prosecutor and the court that she was too poor to pay.\n13. The City Attorney and City judge did not make any inquiry into her ability to pay or into any alternatives to imprisonient as required by federal and Alabama law, and the City did not appoint her an attorney to represent her at the hearing. The City judge instead told Ms.\nMitchell that she would have to ""serve out"" her fine at a rate of $50 per day in the City jai l.2\n14. When Ms. Mitchell was taken back to the City jail, she was given a sheet of paper stating that her jail term had been reduced to 58 days ""or"" payment of $2,907. See Exhibit 1.\nMs. Mitchell was also informed by jail guards that she could ""work off"" an additional $25 per 2 According to JCS, Inc., Ms. Mitchell was ineligible for the company\'s ""probation"" services because the company believed that she was not making reliable payments to the company when placed on ""probation"" in the past. The City policy is to check with JCS, Inc. prior to making a case decision and to rely on the company\'s discretion about whether to put someone on ""probation"" or not.\nThe statements in court about the amount owed and the jail term to be served almost invariably differ from what debtors are told when they return upstairs to the jail. Typically, the jail term as announced by the judge is reduced, and some portion of the debt is reserved so that debtors, like Plaintiffs, are placed back on a ""payment plan"" when released This practice ensures the City\'s ability to continue to hold hearings to charge supervision fees and other charges through the private ""probation"" provider responSible for collecting the debts.\nday toward her debt to the City if she agreed to perform labor consisting of janitorial tasks, including cleaning floors and wiping jail bars.\n15. Desperate to get back to her young children, Ms. Mitchell accepted this opportunity on her first day in jail. Thereafter, she labored to clean the floors and jail bars as directed by City jail employees on as many other occasions as she could.\n16. Attached to this Complaint is a photograph of Ms. Mitchell\'s initial desperate attempt to account for how much of her debt she ""worked off\' in this way, which she calculated by hand each night on the back of the piece of paper given to her by the City court so that She could determine when she could be released to her family. See Exhibit 3.\n17. Prior to herjailing, Ms. Mitchell earned money from styling people\'s hair to support herself and her two children. Based on her income in 2013, Ms. Mitchell and her children were subsisting at about 33% below the federal poverty line. 4 Because of her lack of resources, Ms. Mitchell relies on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or \'-\'Food Stamps"") and the Women, Infants, Children (WIC) program to feed her family.\n18. At the time she was jailed in 2014, Ms. Mitchell did not own a house, car, financial instruments, Or any other significant assets. She had no bank account She was struggling to pay the utility bills and to provide clothes for her children.\nH.\nPlaintiff Lorenzo Brown\n19. Lorenzo Brown is a 58-year-old disabled Montgomery resident. He was arrested early in the morning on January 24, 2014, when City police came to the dilapidated boarding This number likely substantially overstates Ms. Mitchell\'s financial resources Ms. Mitchell estimates her 2013 revenue from hair styling at approximately $14,000. Her actual earnings were far lower, however, because Ms. Mitchell is responsible for purchasing all of the equipment and supplies necessary for her work. The federal poverty line for a family of three was $19,530 in \n2013\nMs. Mitchell had not worked for several weeks pnor to her jailing. See Exhibit 4.\nhouse in which he lives and took him into custody for failure to pay court fines, fees, and surcharges arising from traffic tickets issued in 2010.\n20\nMr. Brown was kept in jail for three days until January 27, 2014, when he was brought to the Municipal Court. The Municipal Court informed Mr. Brown that he would be released from jail if he found someone to pay half of the total amount of his outstanding balance, a sum in excess of $1,100 as reported to Mr Brown\nMr. Brown informed the court about his previous drug addiction and his financial inability to pay the debt, and he asked the court for mercy.\n21. The court, without conducting any inquiry into Mr. Brown\'s ability to pay, without appointing Mr. Brown an attorney to represent him at the hearing, and without considering any alternatives to imprisonment, ordered him to serve 44 days in City jail, purportedly to ""serve out"" his $2,200 debt at a rate of $50 per day.5\n22. When Mr. Brown was brought back to the City jail, he was given paperwork informing him that he could be released after payment of $1,400 ""or"" 28 days in jail. See Exhibit\n5. This document also Stated that Mr. Brown could be released ""upon payment of half."" \n23\nMr. Brown depends on a monthly Social Security disability check for survival. He does not own a house, car, financial instruments, or any other significant assets. He maintains a bank account to collect his disability check, but it usually has no more than a few dollars in it because he survives check-to-check. See Exhibit 7.\n24\nMr. Brown suffers constant pain from a variety of ailments, including spinal problems, arthritis, pain and a lack of movement in his bands, and persistent joint pain. As a result, he is not able to work consistently.\nAccording to JCS, Inc., Mr. Brown Was ineligible for the company\'s ""probation"" services in January 2014 because the company believed that he had not made reliable payments to the company in the past.\niii.\nPlaintiff Tito Williams\n25. Tito Williams is a 38-year-old father of two children who lives in Montgomery with his mother and his children.\n26\nME. Williams went to the City police station on January 26, 2014, after he learned that he had outstanding warrants for debt from unpaid traffic tickets. Upon reporting to the police station, he was arrested and placed in the City jail (which physically connects to the police station). He was kept overnight and brought before the Municipal Court on January 27, 2014.\n27., The City prosecutor and the court informed Mr. Williams that he owed the City approximately $1,600 and asked him why he had not paid it Mr. Williams informed the court that he had no money to pay the City. The judge, Without conducting any inquiry into Mr.\nWilliams\'s ability to pay and without considering any alternatives to imprisonment, ordered him to serve out his debt at $50 per day.\n28. When Mr. Williams returned to the City jail, he was given paperwork that told him that he would be released if he paid $1,164 ""or"" served 23 days in jail. See Exhibit \n8.\n29\nMr. Williams was told by City jail employees that he could ""work off\' his debt and be released from confinemert earlier at a rate of $25 credit toward his debts per day if he agreed to labor for the City while in jail, including performing janitorial tasks and serving food at the jail. During Mr. Williams\'s first few days at the jail, several incidents involving another inmate led to a significant mess of blood and feces throughout an area of the jail. City jail employees did not want to clean the mess and offered extra labor credits to any inmate who agreed to clean the blood and feces, Mr. Williams, desperate to get home to his family, agreed to clean the blood and feces from the jail floors On several occasions despite the extraordinary discomfort that the task brought him.6\n30. At the time of his jailing, Mr. Williams had very recently obtained employment for a few weeks, but he lost his job while he sat in the City jail for his traffic ticket debt.\n31. Since his release, Mr. Williams has obtained a new job that pays near the minimum wage. The new job is approximately a 20-minute drive from his home, and he must rely on his mother to drop him off and pick him up each day at great expense to his family.\niv. Plaintiff Courtney Tubbs\n32. Courtney Tubbs is a 23-year-old Montgomery resident who was incarcerated by the State of Alabama from 2010 until 2013 due to a state criminal conviction separate froth municipal debt Mr. Tubbs learned after his incarceration that he had been assessed traffic tickets by the City at the time of his 2010 arrest. He had not been aware of the tickets prior to his state incarceration. After his release, he also received a new traffic \'ticket in the summer of 2013.\n33. Since his release from prison, Mr. Tubbs has not been able to find Stable, significant employment, and he is indigent. He lives with his little brother and his mother, who is legally blind and who relies on Mr. Tubbs to help take care of her. He does not own a car, house, financial instruments, or any other significant assets. He has no bank account.\n34. On January 25, 2014, while sitting on his front porch, Mr. Tubbs was arrested by City police.\n35. Two days later, on January 27, 2014, Mr. Tubbs was brought before the City judge, who asked Mr. Tubbs why he had not paid his debt Mr. Tubbs stated that he could not afford to pay. The judge asked Mr. Tubbs if he could get money down to the court that day, and 6 After his release, Mr. Williams did not receive the extra credit toward his debt as promised by the City. Other inmates also participated in this labor in addition to Mr. Williams.\nMr. Tubbs said that he could not. The court did not conduct an inquiry into Mr. Tubbs\'s ability to pay, did not appoint him an attorney, and did not consider alternatives to imprisonment Mr. Tubbs was ordered imprisOned unless and until he paid $626 ""or"" spent 12 days in jail.\nB. The Plaintiffs\' Release From Cit y Jail\n36. On January 30, 2014, and January 31, 2014, with the assistance of present counsel, Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Brown, Mr. Williams, and Mr. Tubbs each filed petitions for emergency relief in the Montgomery County Circuit Court seeking their immediate release from confinement. After confemng with the state couft judge, counsel for the City and counsel for Plaintiffs agreed on a course of action to obtain the release of the Plaintiffs, to subsequently drop the emergency petitions for release from jail as moot, and to litigate the issues raised by the City\'s treatment of Plaintiffs in federal court.\n37. According to this agreement and following a similar procedure to that taken by the City in two similar suits (2013-cv-732-MEF and 2013-cv-733-MEF), counsel for Plaintiff was to file Notices of Appeal in Municipal Court objecting to the orders of incarceration for the inability to pay debts, and the Plaintiffs would be subsequently released from the City jail.\n38\nMr. Tubbs was released by the City on February 5, 2014, having served out the entirety of his debt Mr. Williams was released on February 7, 2014 and told by the City to pay the remainder of his debts by May 6,\n2014. See Exhibit \n9\nMs\nMitchell. and Mr. Browii were each released on February 10, 2014, and the City has ordered them to pay the City $100 and $150 per month respectively or risk re-imprisonment. 7 See Exhibits 2, 6.\nAfter the Notices of Appeal were filed as agreed, the Municipal Court notified Plaintiffs\' counsel that, pursuant to policy, it intended to charge Ms. Mitchell and Mr. Brown appellate bonds of $500 for each of their tickets for the right to appeal the order imprisoning them meaning that Ms Mitchell would be charged $9,000 and Mr. Brown $5,000 for the right to appeal Counsel requested an indigency hearing for the purpose of proceeding in forma pauperis with the Notices of Appeal On the date of that hearing, the Court cancelled the previous order jailing the Plaintiffs and ordered Ms Mitchell and Mn Brown released and subject to a new debt payment plan\n39. Plaintiffs Mitchell, Brown, and Williams thus continue to owe the City debts relating to fines, fees, costs, and extra unknown surcharges from traffic cases that were long ago resolved. 8 They remain impoverished and struggling to provide for themselves and their families. See Exhibits 4, 7,\n10. 9 When they are again unable to afford the payments required by the City, they will again be Subject to the same unconstitutional treatment pursuant to the City\'s ongoing policies and practices. They thus suffer an ongoing fear of imminent imprisonment based on the City\'s policies and practices with respect to municipal debt collection.\nC. The City\'s Policies and Practices\n40. The treatment of Plaintiffs was caused by and is representative of the City\'s policies and practices concerning traffic tickets and collecting related debts. These facts, policies, and practices are similar to those alleged in the Amended Complaints in cases 201 3-cv732-MEF (Doc. 10) and 2013-cv-733-MEF (Doc. 9), which describe additional people whose rights were violated by the same policies and practices.\n41. The Plaintiffs and other witnesses have observed numerous other impoverished Montgomery residents jailed by the City for non-payment of debts without a meaningful inquiry into their ability to pay, without the representation of counsel, and without the consideration of whether imprisonment serves legitimate state interests in light of available alternatives as required by federal and Alabama law.\'° 8 Notwithstanding the unconstitutionality of the City\'s conduct regardless of state law, the City has not offered in any of the Plaintiffs\' cases any valid state-law basis for continuing to put people on ""probation"" years after tickets are resolved, let alone for jailing them for nonpayment of old monetary debt from various costs, fees, and extra surcharges associated with that ""probation."" Exhibit 10 is a copy of the sworn declaration and motion that Mr. Williams submitted to the state court while jailed. Since his release, he has obtained another low-wage job for several weeks to replace the one lost because of his jailing, but his financial situation remains materially unchanged from when he appeared before the City court. 10 In addition to violating the United States Constitution these practices also violate the Alabama Constitution and the explicit requirements of Alabama court rules. See Ala Const\nart. I, § 1,6,22; Ala R. Crim \nP. 26.11.\n42. The Plaintiffs and other witnesses have observed numerous other people and families who were told that they or their family member would be held in jail by the City unless and itil they brought forward large sums of money to pay off debts supposedly owed for traffic tickets and subsequent surcharges.\n43. On the date that each Plaintiff was order jailed, there were 67 people brought into court from the City jail for the City\'s jail docket, almost all of which involved money owed for traffic tickets or minor offenses. The City holds Municipal Court every business day.\n44. The City\'s policy is to assess fines, costs, surcharges, and additional fees upon a finding of a traffic violation. If the person can afford to pay the total cost, the person is permitted to pay, and the case is closed. If the person cannot afford to pay the entire amount, the City either gives the person a date by which to pay in full or puts the person on a ""payment plan""\n45. The City has contracted with Judicial Correction Services (JCS, Inc.) to collect those payments, referring to this system of debt collection for traffic tickets as ""probation."" JCS, Inc. operates what it calls an ""Offender Funded Model"" of probation, promising the City that it Will not charge the City for its services. Instead, JCS, Inc. charges debtors—those who cannot afford to pay their tickets immediately—additional monthly fees for the ability to be on ""probation,"" typically $40 per month on top of whatever is owed to the City. JCS, Inc. also charges an initial ""set up"" fee when a person is placed on ""probation."" The City places people on such ""probation"" payment plans pursuant to general practice and standing orders.\n46. If an impoverished person is unable to make a full payment, JCS, Inc. often takes out the amount owed to JCS, Inc. first so that JCS, Inc. is paid even if a person\'s debt to the City is not reduced.\n47. If a person misses payments or pays less than ordered, JCS, Inc. has the purported contractual authority and discretion to decide whether to petition the City for ""revocation"" of probation.. JCS, Inc. also has a policy of placing people who cannot make full payments—from whom the company has difficulty making a profit—in ""warrant status,"" which can result in warrants issued for their arrest and which constitutes a JCS, Inc. determination that JCS, Inc. will not accept the person for future probation supervision. JCS cOmmunicateS this decision to the City, and the City policy is to agree not to place such people back on payment plans, requiring instead that those people pay in full or go to jail.\n48. In other cases in which a person is making substantial payments, JCS, Inc. has a personal financial interest in extending a person\'s probation and in keeping the person ôñ a plan for as long as possible so that it can profit from the collection of more monthly fees.\n49. Thus, under the City\'s scheme, JCS, Inc. can not only decide whether to initiate judicial revocation proceedings, but also whether a person is put on probation and what judicially ordered conditions are imposed. JCS, Inc., will also make other recommendations to the City judge concerning how JCS, Inc. believes the person has fared on probation, whether the person should be placed on probation, whether JCS, Inc. considers the person ""eligible"" for probation, what the amount of monthly court-ordered payments should be, and a variety of other caserelated decisions. For example, in the eases of Ms.. Mitchell and Mr. Brown, the City could not put them on payment plan probation with JCS, Inc. because JCS, Inc. declined to accept them.\n50. JCS, Inc. has a personal financial interest to conduct its role as a probation officer in away that maximizes its personal profit and not necessarily as a neutral public cotirt officer.\n51. JCS, Inc. uses a ""probation"" room inside the City building that also houses the Municipal Court, directly across from the Municipal courtroom. A JCS, Inc. employee often sits in the Courtroom near the judge and advises the judge about how to handle the cases of ""probationers"" and potential ""probationers.""\n52. JCS, Inc. and the City enforce a policy and practice of initiating and issuing arrest warrants when a person misses a payment or fails to make sufficient payments without considering the person\'s ability to pay—even when they have knowledge that the person is indigent—and without providing notice and summoning the person to court for a hearing. Instead, City policy allows the City to issue and serve arrest warrants, and City officers go to the homes of traffic debtors to arrest them.\n53. The City often executes these warrants prior to or over the weekend, which results in a person serving needless extra time in jail prior to the next available court date.\n54. When warrants are issued and executed, the City adds fees, costs, and surcharges to the amounts of debt already owed. In addition to court fees and JCS, Inc. fees and costs, the City routinely adds Surcharges for warrants, a ""solicitor"" fee, and even a 30% debt-collection fee. Navigating the origin of these numerous fees and surcharges and determining whether they are even validly assessed by the City in any particular case is a complicated inquiry involving the application of state law, local law and practice, and constitutional law to a person\'s case history.\n55. When a person is brought into court after an arrest, the City\'s policy is to order them to pay their debt—or a significant portion of their debt—immediately or be held in jail until their debt is extinguished at a rate of $50 per day. If JCS, Inc. informs the City that it does not want to accept a person onto ""probation,"" the person will be ordered to pay Of be jailed.\n56. The City calls these orders ""fines or days"" and refers to this policy, without any irony, as ""commuting"" people\'s ""sentences.""\n57. If family members are present, the City often calls them up to the bench and asks them to pay as much of their family member\'s debts as they can on the threat that the person Who allegedly owes the in will be jailed if the family members do not pay."" The City does not conduct any meaningful inquiry into the person\'s ability to pay and does not even explain to people how they might claim indigency through standard forms issued by the State of Alabama.\n58. As with the Plaintiffs in this case, the amount Of debt announced to debtors by the judge in court often differs from the amount listed on the paperwork that they receive on their return to the jail. The paperwork amount is usually less, meaning that people like the Plaintiffs Will often have a balance remaining after they ""serve out"" their fine, leading to their placement back on a payment plan and their continued supervision. The City appears to refer to this as ""reopening"" their cases, although this ""reopening"" and the corresponding modifications that it entails are not performed at any formal hearing or even in the person\'s presence.\n59. Once people return to the jail from City court, they are told of the City policy to have them, ""work off\' an extra $25 per day toward their debts if the person agrees to labor in the City jail while they are imprisoned.\n60. Inmates desperate to return to their families by ""working off\' their debts more quickly compete to be selected by City jail employees for a limited number of difficult, unsanitary, and demeaning daily labor tasks.\nFor example, on January 27, 2014, the same day that the Plaintiffs appeared in the City court, another local man was brought from the City jail before the court for unpaid traffic tickets. The judge informed the man and his family, who appeared with him in court, that they would have to pay about $915 in order to get him out ofjãil or else he would ""sit out"" his debt to the City. When the family informed the judge that they were too poor to pay, the judge ordered him held in custody, and the man was taken back to the City jail. The man\'s mother was concerned for her family because the man had recently been hired at a new manufacturing job and was still in his probationary period with his new employer. He would have been fired from his job if he served out his debt. The next day, the man\'s indigent, disabled mother was able to pull together some money, and she brought $452 to the clerk\'s office. The clerk\'s office accepted the money, and the man was released that afternoon.\n61. The City\'s debt collection practices are enormously profitable, especially in getting family members with no legal obligation to pay any money to the City to come up with money to get their loved ones released from jail and in getting low income people to forgo basic necessities of life, in order to pay JCS, Inc. and the City in an attempt to avoid jail.\n62. For example, the 2013 City of Birmingham budget reflects approximately $2.8 million from court fines and traffic citations, the City of Mobile approximately $2 million, and the City of Huntsville approximately $2.5 million. In contrast, the City of Montgomery budget reflects revenue of $15.9 million from municipal court \'Tines and forfeitures.""12\n63. The City uses the money collected through these procedures to fund the City jail, to pay Municipal Court judicial salaries, to pay City Attorney\'s Office salaries, and to fund other portions of the City budget.\n64. The City\'s recent ""Amnesty Program"" starkly demonstrates its practice of jailing persons who are unable to pay debts to the City. In May 2013, Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange and City Municipal Court Administrator Kenneth Nixon (who is also a member of the Mayor\'s cabinet), announced that the Municipal Court would offer an ""Amnesty Program"" on the first two Saturdays in June. Under thisprogram, the City announced that it would remove certain fees, eliminate arrest warrants, and institute a payment plan if individuals were unable to pay the full amount to which the City claimed it was entitled.\n65. However, at least 15 people were arrested on the first day of the Amnesty Program because they had too much money allegedly outstanding (greater than $2,500) or did not bring at least $150 (or 10% of what was owed, if greater) to pay towards their debts.\n12 The City\'s publicly available budget does not itemize ""fines and forfeitures"" in as much detail as do the budgets of some other cities, which makes it difficult for the public to know the exact source of these funds. But, the ""fines and forfeitures"" collected by the City of Montgomery appear substantially higher than those collected by any other major Alabama City, even those cities larger than Montgomery.\n66. These policies and practices have created a culture of fear among the City\'s poorest residents, who are afraid even to appear in City court to explain their indigence because they know they will be jailed by the City without any meaningful process. Indeed, Mr. Nixon reported to the Montgomery Advertiser that many residents were jailed during the amnesty program becausethe y owed too much and could not pay Mr. Nixon publicly acknowledged that the arrests probably scared others from participating in the Amnesty Program.\n67. The same fear motivates many very poor City residents to sacrifice expenditures on food, clothing, utilities, sanitary home repairs, and other basic necessities of life in order to scrape together money to pay traffic debt to the City.\n68\nMr. Nixon warned that, following the 2013 Amnesty Program, the City would be ""stricter"" about arresting people for unpaid debt. The City also has a policy of referring unpaid debt to the Montgomery County District Attorney\'s Office, which will send letters to debtors threatening imminent arrest if they do not pay their debts. A surcharge of 30% of the value of the debt is added to the debt to compensate the District Attorney\'s Office for its participation in the City\'s debt collection. The City purports to have the authority to arrest and jail indigent people when they cannot pay even these additional surcharges.\n69. The City has stated that it seeks to use these collection programs and tactics to go after old traffic debt, including debt dating back to the 1980s.\n70. As in the Plaintiff\'s cases, the City\'s policy is to modify orders of incarceration outside of any formal judicial process. These modifications include: decreasing a person\'s sentence from what was announced in court so that a person is released with a remaining balance owed; allowing a person\'s release without any hearing if the person or family members present Ef1 some money to the City clerk; and allowing City employees to reduce the time a person is ordered to be in jail based on labor performed in the jail without any judicial involvement.\n71. Plaintiffs and Witnesses have observed numerous other violations of basic constitutional rights in the Montgomery Municipal Court within the past year.\n72. For example, on January 27, 2014, a homeless military veteran appeared with a social worker from the Veterans Administration. The man told the judge that he could not afford the debts but that he hoped to be receiving some disability payments from the Veterans Administration and hoped to get a job when he completed a mental health program in which he was currently enrolled. The judge told him that the City would not wait for the Veterans administration to pay the man and that, if the man could not pay by June, he would lose his job because he would be ""upstairs sitting your fine out"" at the City jail.\n73. On that same day, the City ordered several other people to jail terms for failure to pay traffic ticket debt despite their protestations of indigence. The City did not hold any inquiry into their ability to pay as required by clearly established Alabama and federal constitutional law. These cases included:\na. A diabetic man who claimed to be too poor to afford his debt. The judge told him: ""I gotta get some money before you can go."" Then the judge said.- ""you get $1,000 down here, you can come home."" As the man attempted to protest to the judge, courtroom security took him back into custody.\nb. Another inmate was brought out from the jail, and the judge told his family that he would not be released unless the family could get several hundred dollars down to the municipal court clerk\'s office.\nc. Another woman claimed to be too poor to afford her debt to the City. The judge told her: ""you\'ve got to get this paid or you\'ll end up in jail."" He then ordered her to pay in full within 4 weeks and told her that she would not be granted any extensions. The judge did not conduct any hearing into her indigence.\n74. Plaintiffs seek the following relief and hereby demand a jury in this cause for all matters so appropriate.\nClaims for Relief Count One: Defendant City of Montgomery Violated Plaintiffs\' Rights By Jailing Them For Their Inability To Pay the City.\n75. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-74.\n76. The Fourteenth Amendment\'s due process and equal protection clauses have long prohibited imprisoning a person for the failure to pay money owed to the government if that person is indigent and unable to pay. Defendant violated Plaintiffs\' rights by imprisoning them when they could not afford to pay the debt allegedly owed. Defendant violated Plaintiff\'s rights by imprisoning them, and by threatening to imprison them, without conducting any inquiry into their ability to pay and without conducting any inquiry into alternatives to imprisonment as required by the United States Constitution.\n77. Defendant\'s policy and practice of imprisoning people when they cannot afford to pay their debt and of automatically converting monetary fines into days in jail at a rate of $50 per day violates the due process and equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution. Count Two: Defendant City of Montgomery Violated Plaintiffs\' Rights By Imprisoning Them For Inability To Pay Debts Without Appointing Adequate Counsel.\n78. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-77.\n79. Defendant violated Plaintiffs\' right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by imprisoning Plaintiffs during proceedings initiated by City prosecutors at which Plaintiffs did not have the benefit of adequate counsel and did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive counsel.\n80. The City\'s policy of not providing adequate counsel at hearings in which indigent people are ordered to be imprisoned in the City jail for unpaid debts, which are, in turn, based on traffic violations at which the person was also unrepresented, violates the Sixth and FOurteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nCount Three: Defendant City of Montgomery\'s Use of a Private Actor With a Personal Financial Stake in the Outcome of Judicial Proceedings and Case Decisions As a Supposedly Neutral Probation Official Violates Plaintiffs\' Due Process Rights.\n85. The City unlawfully imprisoned Plaintiffs for a monetary debt owed to the City. On top of being unlawfully imprisoned for failure to pay debts owed to the City, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Williams were, pursuant to City policy, coerced with longer unlawful prison terms by City officials if they did not ""volunteer"" to labor in the City jail under disgusting conditions for an extra credit of $25 per day toward their debts.. This amounts to peonage and forced labor, whereby a person is coerced by threat of legal sanction—i.e. imprisonment—to work off a debt to.a master. It is also an abuse of the legal process that exploited Defendant\'s unlawful incarceration of Plaintiffs to force them to accept, in their desperation to end their unlawful incarceration more quickly, the conditions of forced labor, performing janitorial tasks that even City employees did not want to perform, such as cleaning significant amounts of blood and feces in an overcrowded jail environment.\n86. Plaintiffs allegedly owed the City a solely monetary debt for traffic tickets and associated fees, costs, and surcharges. Because Plaintiffs were not imprisoned or sentenced to involuntary servitude as punishment for any crime, the Thirteenth Amendment bars the coerced Use of their labor to work Off their purely monetary debt. The City\'s conduct also violates federal statutory law, including 18 U.S.C. § 1589 (forced labor under threat of physical restraint or abuse of process), § 1593A (benefitting from peonage); and § 1595 (providing a civil remedy).\nCount Five: Defendant City of Montgomery\'s Use of Jail and Threats of Jail To Collect Debts Owed to the City Violates Equal Protection Because It Imposes Unduly Harsh and Punitive Restrictions On Debtors Whose Creditor Is the Government Compared To Those Who Owe Money to Private Creditors.\n87. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-86 above.\n88. The United States Supreme Court has held that, when governments seek to recoup costs of prosecution from indigent defendants—for example, the cost of appointed counsel—they may not take advantage of their position toimpose unduly restrictive methods of collection solely because the debt is owed to the government and not to a private creditor. Not only does the City charge additional fees only to those people who are indigent and cannot afford to pay their costs, fees, and fines in full immediately and place such indigent people on ""pay only"" probation when the cases of wealthier people would be closed, but by imposing imprisonment, threats of imprisonment, indeterminate ""probation,"" and other restrictions on Plaintiffs, the City takes advantage of its control over the machinery of the City jail and police systems to deny debtors the statutory protections that every other Alabama debtor may invoke against a private creditor. This coercive policy and practice constitutes invidious discrimination a4 Violates the fundamental principles of equal protection of the laws.\nCount Six: Defendant City Of Montgomery\'s Policy and Practice of Issuing and Serving Arrest Warrants Solely Based on Nonpayment of Monetary Debts Violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n89. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1-88 above.\n90. The City\'s policy and practice is to issue and serve arrest warrants at the homes of those who have not paid their traffic debt. These warrants are sought, issued, and served without any inquiry into the person\'s ability to pay even when the City has advance knowledge that the person is impoverished and unable to pay the debts. These warrants are sought, issued, and served without any finding of probable cause that the person has committed any offense. The City chooses to pursue warrants instead of issuing summons even when it has spoken to people on the phone or in person and has the opportunity to notify them to appear in court. As in the case of Mr. Brown, the City often chooses to serve these warrants prior to a weekend so that a person can spend, as did Mr. Brown, up to three ftill days in the City jail prior to the next court session, a practice designed to increase the time a person spends in jail and that is arbitrary and In without justification for such delay. These practices violate the Fourth and Fourteenth AiflendrPents and result in a deprivation of fundament1 liberty without adequate due process.\nCount Seven: Defendant City of Montgomery\'s Policy and Practice of Requiring a Costly ""Appeal Bond"" for Indigent People Without Conducting a Meaningful Inquiry Into Their Ability to Pay Violates Due Process and Equal Protection.\n91. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegation.s in paragraphs 1-90 above.\n92. When Plaintiffs Mitchell and Brown attempted to file an emergency appeal of the order imprisoning them for owing the City a monetary debt, the City followed its policy of attempting to bar their appeal unless Plaintiffs paid to the City a total of $9,000 and $5,000 respectively, significantly more than the amount either owed to the City, which Plaintiffs were already unable to afford—a fact of poverty that led to their illegal incarceration in the first place.\n93. This policy of charging appeal bonds to those who cannot afford them, which a previous decision from this Court held unconstitutional, violates the equal protection rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nReq uest for-Relief WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court issue the following relief:\na. A declaratory judgment that the Defendant City violated Plaintiffs\' Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights by imprisoning them because they could not afford to pay the City and by imprisoning them without conducting any meaningful inquiry into their ability to pay or into any alternatives to incarceration;\nb. A declaratory judgment that Defendant violated Plaintiffs\' rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments by imprisoning them WithOut appointing adequate counsel at the judicial proceeding that led to their incarceration;\nc. A declaratory judgment that Defendant violated Plaintiffs\' rights by employing and relying On a non-neutral ""probation"" officer who has a significant personal financial stake in the outcome of Plaintiffs\' judicial proceedings;\nd. A declaratory judgment that the City violated Plaintiffs\' constitutional and statutory rights by coercing them into performing labor in its jail in order to work off their debt;\ne. A declaratory judgment that Defendant violated Plaintiffs\' equal protection rights by imposing harsh debt collection measures not imposed on debtors whose creditors are private entities;\nf. A declaratory judgment that Defendant violated Plaintiffs\' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by issuing and serving arrest warrants without probable cause, with unreasonable delay prior to presentment, and without providing pre-deprivation of liberty process where such process is easily available to the City;\ng. A declaratory judgment that Defendant violated Plaintiffs\' equal protection rights by charging indigent people appeal bonds on Which the right to pursue and appeal Was purportedly contingent; h An order and judgment preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendant from enforcing the above-described unconstitutional policies and practices against Plaintiffs;\ni. A judgment compensating the Plaintiffs for the damages that they suffered as a result of the City\'s unconstitutional and unlawful conduct;\nj. An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneys\' fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and 18 U.S.C. § 1595, and any other relief this Court deems just and proper.\n_\'14, Respectfully submitted, /s/Matthew Swerdlin Matthew Swerdlin (ASB-9O9i-M0 MATTHEW SWERDLIN, Attorney at Law P.O.

 'IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA\nNORTHERN DIVISION\nSHARNALLE MITCHELL, et al., Plaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY, Defendants.\nCASE NO.: 2:14-cv-186-MEF (WO Do Not Publish) \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ORDER\nOn May 1, 2014, the Court held a hearing to address Plaintiffs Sha rnalle Mitchell (“Mitchell”), Lorenzo Brown (“Brown”), and Tito William s’s (“Williams”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) Motion for Prelim inary Injunction (Doc. #2). The hearing was attended by counsel for both parties. Based on the subm issions of the parties, the applicable law, representations made by counsel at the hearing, and the record as a whole, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated: (1) that Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success on the m erits of its claim that Defendant City of Montgom ery (“the City”) violated their Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights as outlined in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), by imprisoning them, and by threatening to imprison them, for failing to pay the balance on outstanding fines, fees, and costs associated with traffic tickets they incurred without first conducting a meaningful inquiry into the reasons for their failure to pay, including their potential status as indigents, and without considering alternatives to im prisonment; (2) that there is a substantial threat of irreparable injury to Plaintiffs if the preliminary injunction does not issue because there is no evidence suggesting the City will refrain from confining Plain tiffs at the upcom ing May 9, 2014 com pliance hearing, or at any time thereafter, without first inquiring in a meaningful way into the reasons for their failure to pay; (3) the harmsuffered by Plaintiffs absent an injunction would exceed the harm suffered by the City if the injunc tion issues; and (4) an injunction would not disserve the public interest. Therefore, in accordance with Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court finds that issuing a prelim inary injunction is appropriate and necessary to protect Plaintiffs’ rights until sucha time as the Court renders a decision on the merits.\nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED as follows:\n1. The City of Montgomery is enjoined from collecting or attempting to collect all outstanding fines, fees, costs, surcharges or the outstanding balance of any monies owed to the City or to Judicial Correction Services, Inc. (“JCS ”) associated with traffic tickets by Sharnalle Mitchell, Lorenzo Brown, and Tito Williams until further order of the Court.\n2. On or before June 2, 2014, the City shlal submit to the Court a comprehensive plan listing the current or proposed policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations of an individual’s ability to pay, the policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in m aking future determinations as to reasons for an individual’s failure to pay, the policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in m aking future determ inations of any alternative m easures of punishm ent other than imprisonment for the non-payment of fines, and the policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations of whether these alternative measures are adequate to m eet the City’s interests in punishing and deterring the non-paym ent of fines, which shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n3. On or before June 13, 2014, Plaintiffs shall subm it objections to the City’s proposed plan.\n4. The Court will hold a hear ing to address the adequacy of the City’s current or proposed plan on June 30, 2014, at 9:00 a.m., in the United States Courthouse, One Church Street, Courtroom\n5. Montgom ery City Attorney Kim O. Fe hl, Municipal Court Director Kenneth Nixon, Montgomery City Police Chief Kevin J. Murphy, and the Presiding Montgom ery Municipal Court Judge shall be present in person for the June 30, 2014 hearing.\n6. This Preliminary Injunction Order shall apply to the parties, the parties’ officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and any other person who is in active concert or participation with the parties or the parties’ offic ers, a gents, servants, em ployees, and attorneys.\n7. Because the risk is low that the City will incur substantial expenses, costs, or damages during the pendency of this prelim inary injunction, because Plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on the m erits, and because Plaintiffs have lim ited financial resources, no security bond will be required under Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nDONE this the \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE'

Plaintiffs further take the position that the result of the City’s actions was the illegal jailing of indigent City residents.1 Plaintiffs seek a timely resolution of their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief in order to end the challenged practices and take the position that the following provisions, to which the parties agree, provide significant constitutional protections relating to their claims in the above-styled litigation.\nThe Judges of the Municipal Court of the City of Montgomery, in their official capacities, while denying liability and in order to promote the efficient and effective operation of the Court, agree to the following which are to be implemented beginning not more than forty-five days after the execution of this agreement:\n1. To audio record compliance and indigence hearings (as those hearings are described in the Judicial Procedures attached hereto as Appendix 1) for a period of not less than twenty-four months following the execution of this Agreement.\n1 Nothing in this Agreement should be construed to constitute an admission by the Plaintiffs that the City of Montgomery is not liable for the constitutional violations alleged in this case or capable of remedying those violations and providing the relief sought. Similarly, nothing in this agreement should be construed to constitute an admission by the City that it is liable for the same.\n2. To use a microphone when conducting court unless a Party asks that the microphone be turned off and the court finds, after allowing for objections to be made, that to turn the microphone off is appropriate to guard against disclosure of private medical information, information about a minor child, or other sensitive, private information. Use of the microphone pursuant to this Agreement shall be for a period of not less than three years following the execution of this Agreement.\n3. To notify Plaintiffs’ Counsel by email within twelve hours of any Municipal Court defendant’s being placed in jail for nonpayment of a fine, costs or restitution (or otherwise placed in jail pursuant to the Plan, including for contempt of court for nonperformance of community service or any other reason stemming from nonpayment or nonperformance of community service in lieu of payment). Said notification would be provided to Alec Karakatsanis at the following email address: alec@equaljusticeunderlaw.org. The notification will include the defendant's name, the date of the order jailing the defendant, the case number(s), the name of the attorney representing the defendant, a copy of any written findings, and instructions regarding how to request the recording of the proceeding. The responsibility for providing said notifications will end one hundred and eighty days from the date this Agreement is executed.\n4. To permit entry of the public into the courtroom in the event the doors are locked. Specifically, the Court will provide a means for the public to request entry into the courtroom by pressing a button located outside the entrance door to the courtroom which will notify security personnel within the courtroom that a member of the public wishes to enter. Once security inside the courtroom has been established, security personnel will go to the courtroom door and screen the person(s) wishing to enter the courtroom. Admission to the courtroom using this procedure will be granted as promptly as practicable. A sign will be posted at the entrance door to the courtroom stating this procedure in large print. The amount of time in which the Municipal Court courtroom doors are locked will be minimized and limited to the time necessary to secure the courtroom, and, if it takes longer than ten minutes to secure the courtroom, and someone is seeking entrance, the Judge or courtroom clerk will call another staff member to open the door. This term will be in place for not less than three years following the execution of this Agreement\n5. To train the Public Defenders regarding the requirements and holding of Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S Ct. 2507 (2011), within thirty days of the execution of this Agreement. The training will be conducted by Shannon Holliday and any designee made by her, and the need to request a Bearden hearing for any person who is subject to being jailed for failure to pay a fine, court costs, or restitution will be fully discussed with the Public Defenders as will the defendants’ rights as implemented under the Judicial Procedures. The training will also emphasize the Public Defenders’ obligation to represent their clients during courtroom proceedings in Municipal Court as described in the Judicial Procedures, to meet with and advise clients prior to any indigence/ability-to-pay hearing and to provide to the client the Public Defender’s name and contact information, if requested, in cases in which clients are incarcerated for failure to pay fines and costs or have a pending contempt proceeding for failure to comply with an order to do community service in lieu of paying fines and costs and to fully inform their clients of their pertinent rights under Alabama law, the United States Constitution, and the new Municipal Court procedures as they relate to the indigence/ability to pay hearings.\nTo cause the Public Defenders’ contracts to be altered so as to remove the clause referencing the “Fair Trial Tax Fund” by which the Public Defender’s compensation is currently linked to whether enough money is placed in that account, to add a clause requiring the Public Defender’s attendance at the training provided by the Municipal Court regarding the general operations of the Court, and to add a clause to the effect that the Public Defenders’ duties in connection with defendants who are incarcerated for failure to pay fines, court costs, or restitution include notifying defendants of applicable appellate rights and assisting them in filing notices of appeal and motions to waive any appellate bond if they wish to claim indigence. This provision shall be in place for not less than three years following the execution of this Agreement.\n6. To train the Prosecutors regarding the Judicial Procedures to ensure the proper functioning of the compliance and indigence hearings described in the Judicial Procedures, attached hereto as Appendix 1, and to train the prosecutors regarding the holdings of Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S Ct. 2507 (2011).

This term will be in place for a period of not less than three years following the execution of this Agreement.\n8. To agree not to hire, contract with, or otherwise use any private probation company (or any other company profiting from offering payment plans relating to unpaid court fines, costs, and restitution) for a period of not less than three years following the execution of this Agreement.\n9. To comply with the provisions set out in the Judicial Procedures, attached hereto as Appendix 1, for a period of not less than three years following the execution of this Agreement.\n10. To designate at least two days within the six months following the execution of this Agreement during which individuals who have outstanding arrest warrants for having failed to appear for compliance hearings, or for initial appearances for scheduled or nonscheduled offenses, or who otherwise owe outstanding payments, can appear at the window of the Municipal Court, receive a compliance hearing date and the formal notice thereof, and clear any warrants related to their nonpayment2 or failure to appear rather than being arrested. These days will be referred to hereinafter as “amnesty days” for the sake of convenience, but the Parties understand that no individual will be relieved of fines, costs or restitution as a result of the provisions of this paragraph, although the Court retains its existing authority to do so on a case by case basis. The amnesty days will be publicized through a press release provided to local media outlets at least seven, but not more than twenty-one, days before the scheduled amnesty days, and news outlets will be permitted to ask questions related thereto at a press conference held during the same period of time subsequent to the publication of the press release. The press release will be posted on the window and front door at the courthouse and on the Municipal Court website. The foregoing provisions of this paragraph notwithstanding, any (a) individuals with outstanding arrest warrants for conduct unrelated to nonpayment and not based on failures to appear for initial appearances or compliance hearings and (b) individuals who were ordered to appear at compliance hearings in connection with matters other than the payment of a fine, court costs, or restitution, may be arrested when they appear for any reason at the window. Counsel for the Plaintiffs will be notified at least one week in advance of each amnesty day selected as part of compliance with this agreement. The press release mentioned herein will contain the following sentence: “No person who comes to the court for the Amnesty Day will be jailed for non-payment or for a warrant in a case in which the only outstanding issue is non-payment.”\n11. The Judges agree that the obligations set out in this Agreement are binding on their successors in office but only to the extent that said successors fulfill the office of Municipal Court Judge during the relevant time limits set out herein.\nTHE CITY agrees to the following to be implemented beginning not more than forty-five days after the execution of this Agreement unless otherwise set out herein:\n1. To take whatever actions are necessary on its part to accomplish the items to which the Judges of the Municipal Court agreed above.\n2. Its jail administrator will not knowingly jail a defendant based on nonpayment of fines, costs, or restitution without the above-referenced certification from the Municipal Court Judge regarding compliance with the Judicial Procedures.\n3.

Segall Shannon L. Holliday Matthew Swerdlin Joseph Mitchell McGuire \nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nBASIC PREMISES:\n1. No defendant will be incarcerated for inability to pay any court-ordered monies, including fines, court costs or restitution. (Rule 26.11, Ala R\nCrim. P.).\n2. A Public Defender will represent all defendants not otherwise represented by counsel at all compliance and indigence/ability-to-pay hearings. At said hearings, the judge will require that the Public Defender appear with the Defendant in front of the judge, and the Court will note the Public Defender’s appearance in the record.\n3. Procedures involving initial appearances at the window are applicable to those defendants appearing on or before the due date indicated on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and Complaint (“UTTC”).\n4. The granting of an initial sixty (60) day review will be afforded to all cases (new and old) as the procedures are implemented.\n5. Form One (Payment of Fines and Costs) will be placed on the City of Montgomery website, displayed conspicuously in the Court and Lobby of the Municipal Court, and provided to defendants at their initial appearance if they are provided a compliance hearing along with Form Two (Order for Compliance Review).\n6. The Court will use the current Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”) chart when making an indigence determination, and there will be a presumption of indigence when a defendant is at or below 125% of the FPL subject to review of his or her assets.\n7. The defendant will fill out an Affidavit of Substantial Hardship (Form C-10A) or any updated version of the same, and the inquiry relative to income and assets will follow from the information provided therein. A public Defender will be available to answer any questions about the form.\n8. A defendant at 125% of FPL or below without substantial liquid assets available to pay the fines, costs, fees, or restitution will be deemed indigent. In determining whether a defendant has substantial liquid assets, the Court will not consider up to the first $3,000 in personal property, and up to $5,000 in home equity. A finding of substantial liquid assets cannot be based on the receipt of an Earned Income Tax Credit.\n9. An indigent defendant will be given the option of either paying $25.00 a month to pay off his fines, court costs, fees, and restitution or doing community service.\n10. The Court retains the discretion to make credibility determinations relative to testimony and evidentiary submissions regarding income and assets and to question defendants relative to the same.\n11. The ability of a defendant to pay who is not deemed indigent but who expresses an inability to pay his fines, costs, fees and restitution in full will be based on that defendant’s: (i) disposable income, as reflected in the Affidavit of Substantial Hardship (Form C-10A) and as further clarified by questions raised in the indigence hearing, (ii) the defendant’s assets, and (iii) the defendant’s earning potential.\n12. The community service hours’ computation will be based on a minimum of $10 credit for each hour of community service worked. The monthly requirements will be a minimum of eight (8) hours and a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours of community \nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nservice, provided, however, that the court may order more hours of monthly community service at the request of the defendant.\n13. The court record shall contain an explanation of any determination of non‐indigence.\n14. The Court or its designee will designate the entity with which the defendant assigned to community service must work, taking into account the needs of the City for community service, the needs of the other entities providing community service opportunities, and the defendant’s needs.\n15. Defendants who do not initially pay in full are provided Forms One and Two attached hereto which provide notice regarding the procedures set out herein and defendants’ rights.\n16. No person may be incarcerated for nonpayment in any case unless these procedures are followed.\n17. The payment of restitution as ordered by the court cannot be satisfied by the performance of community service, unless the restitution is owed to the City.\n18. The present language of Rule 19(C)(2) of the Rules of Judicial Administration authorizes an increase in the fine only when there is a failure to appear at the initial appearance (pre-judgment) on the ticket.\n19. After an initial ability to pay or indigence determination, a defendant’s ability to pay may be re-assessed at subsequent compliance hearings based on changed circumstances or at the Court’s discretion following the procedures set forth herein.\n20. No person unable to pay his or her fines and costs in full will be charged an additional fee for being placed on a payment plan unless affirmatively authorized by law.\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nFIRST COURT APPEARANCE WITH ADJUDICATION OR PLEA OF GUILTY\n1. Plea of guilty entered at the window (scheduled offenses only) a. Obtain signature on Plea of Guilty/Waiver of Rights Form b. Collection of scheduled fine and court costs i. If paid in full, close case and issue receipt.\nii. If unable to pay on the same day, the defendant will be given an (approximate) sixty (60) day review by the Court at a compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided).\n2. Plea of guilty entered or adjudicated in Court (scheduled and non‐scheduled offenses) a. Judge orally receives guilty plea or adjudication of guilt b. Imposition of Sentence (possible fine, court costs and jail sentence) i. If it is determined that the conduct for which the defendant has been convicted warrants the imposition of a jail sentence, the sentence shall be carried out as directed by the Court. The imposition of a jail sentence will have nothing to do with a defendant’s inability to pay the fines and court costs.\nii. If able to pay the fine and court costs on the same day, the defendant may be directed to the pay window or otherwise informed how to make payment. The full amount is paid and the case is closed.\niii. If the defendant tells the Court that he or she is unable to pay on the same day, the defendant will be given the following options and/or ordered as follows: placed on a payment plan and given a compliance hearing date; given an approximate sixty (60) day review by the Court at a compliance hearing; given an order to complete community service; or any other disposition deemed just and appropriate at the discretion of the Court, excluding incarceration. (Forms One and Two to be provided) (a) It will not be a standard practice to hold an indigence /ability-topay hearing at this stage of the proceedings. However, the Court reserves the option to do so and, where the defendant is found indigent, to provide the defendant the option of the minimum payment plan or community service at this stage and to enter an order consistent with the option chosen.\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nCOURT APPEARANCE – COMPLIANCE REVIEW DATES\n1. If the defendant does not appear (and the defendant has not received a continuance from the Court) a warrant will be issued.\n2. The defendant must be given an opportunity to present evidence that the amount allegedly owed is not accurate or is not in fact owed if the Defendant believes that the amount is not correct.\n3. If the defendant has not paid in full the Court will inquire as to the reasons for noncompliance, including whether the defendant has an inability to pay the amount then due. During this inquiry the Court will specifically ask questions pertaining to the defendant’s ability or inability to pay the amount owed in full. One of the initial questions asked in connection with the ability to pay inquiry will be “Are you able to pay today?” or words to that effect.\n4. If after inquiry by the Court, there is a. No indication of inability to pay, the defendant may be placed on a payment plan by the Court; given another review date set as a compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided); sentenced to serve time in jail (but not without an indigence/ability-to-pay hearing described below); or given any other disposition deemed just and appropriate at the discretion of the Court.\nb. An indication of inability to pay i. the defendant will be directed to a Public Defender to assist with the completion of an Affidavit of Substantial Hardship Form and any further paperwork the Court deems necessary; ii. the Court will then hold a hearing at which the Public Defender will represent the defendant, and the Court will make an indigence/ability to pay determination taking into consideration any testimony, the Affidavit of Substantial Hardship, any other paperwork the Court deems necessary, and any documents submitted by the defendant. The defendant will be permitted to present evidence. If, after questioning (including questioning by the Court) and presentation of evidence, the defendant is (a) determined to be at or below 125% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), the defendant will be determined to be indigent and unable to pay the fines, fees, court costs, and/or restitution in full at the Compliance Hearing, unless the defendant has substantial liquid assets with which he or she could satisfy the payments. In determining whether a defendant has substantial liquid assets, the Court will not consider up to the first $3,000 in personal property, \nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nand up to $5,000 in home equity. A finding of substantial liquid assets cannot be based on the receipt of an Earned Income Tax Credit.\n(b) determined to be above 125% of the FPL, the defendant will not receive a presumption of indigence, but the Court will still consider whether the defendant has the ability to pay based on the defendant’s disposable income, liquid assets, and earning potential.\niii. If the defendant is determined to be indigent or otherwise unable to pay the amount owed for fines, fees, court costs, and/or restitution in full as ordered, the Court:\n(a) may determine the defendant’s ability to make payments based on that defendant’s: (i) disposable income, as reflected in the Affidavit of Substantial Hardship and any other paperwork required by the Court, and as further clarified by answers to questions posed in the hearing, (ii) the defendant’s assets, and (iii) the defendant’s earning potential; order the defendant to make payments consistent therewith; and schedule a review at another compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided). However the Court will not order a monthly payment in excess of $25.00 for indigent defendants; (b) may remit costs and fines; (c) must (unless fines and costs are remitted in full) provide a defendant deemed indigent or otherwise unable to pay the $25.00 minimum monthly payment, the option to complete community service (if physically able) in lieu of payment of costs and fines and schedule a review at another compliance hearing, provided that: (i) if a defendant who has previously been placed on a payment plan fails to make one or more payments, the Court may order said defendant to complete community service (if physically able) to satisfy his or her debt; and (ii) that community service will not be an option for satisfaction of amounts owed for restitution, unless restitution is owed to the City (Forms One and Two provided); and/or (c) may order any other remedy deemed just and appropriate at the discretion of the Court, excluding incarceration.\niv. If the defendant is determined in the indigence/ability-to-pay hearing to have had the ability to pay as ordered (including individuals previously placed on a payment plan), the Court may:\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\n(a) place the defendant on a payment plan or modify the existing payment plan and schedule a review at another compliance hearing in approximately sixty days (60) (Forms One and Two provided); (b) give the defendant another review date set as a compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided); (c) order the defendant to complete community service (if physically able) in lieu of payment of costs and fines and schedule a review at another compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided); (d) remit costs and fines; (e) order the defendant to serve jail time with fines and costs reduced per day at an amount no less than that allowed by Ala R. Crim P. 26.11 (Public Defender present unless otherwise represented) if there is a finding of willful nonpayment provided that the days to which the defendant is sentenced do not exceed the number of days required to work off the amount then currently due and owing; and/or (f) provide any other disposition deemed just and appropriate at the discretion of the Court.\n5. If the defendant was ordered to do community service in lieu of paying, the Court may, upon the defendant’s failure to comply, set a contempt hearing to determine if the defendant should be sanctioned. The Court will comply with the requirements of Ala R. Crim P. 33, including, but not limited to, providing notice, hearing, and written findings. The Court will remit additional fines and costs associated with any contempt conviction and will remit the original fines, fees, and costs in connection with any jail sentence given for contempt at the same rate as that provided defendants jailed pursuant to Ala R. Crim \nP. 26.11.\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nMISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES\nIn addition, the Judges of the Court will:\n1. provide notice of a compliance hearing, as set out in these procedures, to all defendants on a Judicial Correction Services payment plan or contract as of June 2014;\n2. treat probationers as set out in the above procedures if and when probation is subject to revocation for nonpayment of fines, costs, fees or restitution;\n3. treat those who are currently on payment plans as set out in the above procedures;\n4. have the Public Defender inform any defendant not otherwise represented by counsel of his or her appellate rights and provide said defendant Form 3 should he or she be sentenced to jail for failure to pay fines, costs, fees or restitution;\n5. instruct the clerks to provide defendants who have failed to appear as required by their UTTC (uniform traffic ticket and complaint) with a license reinstatement letter (if the Court has notified the Alabama Department of Public Safety of the failure to appear) upon the defendant’s first voluntary appearance at a compliance hearing or upon full payment of costs, fines, fees or restitution, whichever occurs first; and\n6. permit a defendant who has failed to appear at his or her initial appearance date for a scheduled traffic offense and who is subject to an arrest warrant for the same, to appear at the window at the Court and not be arrested on that warrant but instead to be provided a compliance hearing date; and\n7. instruct the clerks that no warrant for failure to appear shall be confirmed unless it is supported in the Court’s file by notification from the Court or notification in a charging instrument which notification provides a specific date and time for a court hearing.\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nFORM ONE\nPayment of Fines and Costs If at any time you cannot pay your fines and costs as ordered by the Court, you may go before the Court at your Compliance Hearing to discuss your financial situation, to ask that the Court’s Order be changed (for example, to ask that you pay less) and/or to explain why you are unable to pay. The time and date of your Compliance Hearing before the Court will be provided to you in a Court Order given to you.\nIf you indicate that you are unable to pay your fines and costs, the Court will order you to complete an Affidavit of Substantial Hardship and other forms as deemed necessary, and may inquire about your finances, to include but not be limited to: income, expenses (i.e. rent, childcare, utilities, food, clothing, medical condition/bills, transportation, etc.), bank accounts, and other assets. In some circumstances, the Court may also inquire about your efforts to obtain the money to pay, including your job skills and efforts to apply for jobs. You should present any documents that you have to the Court during this inquiry. If you cannot afford an attorney, the Court will provide a Public Defender to represent you.\nBased on your income, you may be ordered to perform community service or be placed on a monthly payment plan. You will be given a Compliance Hearing date to return to Court for the Judge to review your particular case(s). Your appearance at this Compliance Hearing is mandatory.\nYou cannot be put in jail solely for your inability to pay your fines and costs, or for nonperformance of community service, unless you willfully failed to pay or to perform the community service ordered despite having the ability to do so.\nYou may pay the full amount you owe at any time in accordance with the Court’s Order, and at that point you will not have to continue to make payments, finish your community service, or appear at your next scheduled Compliance Hearing. You may contact the Court or inquire at a Municipal Court pay window if you would like to obtain your balance owed.\nIf the Court determines that you have a disability, illness, or other circumstances that would prevent you from performing community service, you will not be required to perform community service.\nIn summary, after you have been ordered by the Court to pay your fines and court costs or to perform community service, you will be given a Compliance Hearing date to come back to Court to review your case(s). This hearing is mandatory. Even if you are unable to pay all of your fines and costs or complete the hours ordered before that date, you must attend. At this Hearing, you will have the opportunity to explain to the Court why you have not complied with the Court’s Order(s) and present evidence. You could be put in jail only if the Court determines that you willfully violated the Court’s Order. If you do not appear at your Compliance Hearing, a warrant will be issued for your arrest.\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nFORM TWO\nMunicipal Court City of Montgomery 320 North Ripley Street Montgomery, AL 36104 \nORDER SETTING HEARING FOR COMPLIANCE REVIEW\nIN THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA MUNICIPALITY OF MONTGOMERY V.

P, and/or Rule 20, Fed R. Civ P. As grounds therefor, the City shows the following:\n1. The Judges of the Municipal Court of Montgomery, Alabama include the following persons: Presiding Judge Les Hayes, III, Judge Milton Westry, Judge Darron Hendley, and Judge Lloria James (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Judges of the Municipal Court,” or “the Judges”).\n2. The current Parties to this action along with the Judges of the Municipal Court of Montgomery Alabama, in their official capacities, have entered into an agreement entitled Agreement to Settle Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Claims (hereinafter “Settlement Agreement”)which settles all matters relative to the declaratory and injunctive relief requested by the Plaintiffs in this action.\n3. The Judges of the Municipal Court in their official capacities will be providing relief to the Plaintiffs as agreed upon in the Settlement Agreement.\n4. The Plaintiffs in this case further seek this Court’s continued jurisdiction over the equitable relief agreed upon by the Parties including the Municipal Court Judges, as set out in the Settlement Agreement.\n5. It is the City’s understanding and as represented in the Agreement attached hereto and signed by the Municipal Court Judges of the City of Montgomery, that the Municipal Court Judges of the City of Montgomery, in the interests of promoting the efficient and effective operation of the Court, and further promoting the resolution of the lawsuit and thereby any potential proceedings which might be brought against them in the future, have agreed to joinder in their official capacities. They have agreed to joinder for this limited purpose and do not intend, in doing so, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement, to waive any potential immunity to claims for damages, attorneys’ fees, or any other relief, including other equitable relief, nor do they intend to waive any other defenses. The Judges join for the sole purpose of filing hereafter with the other Parties to this action a Joint Motion for Entry of Final Declaratory and Injunctive Relief.\n6. For the entirety of the equitable relief negotiated and agreed to by the parties in the Settlement Agreement to be afforded, it is necessary that the Judges of the Municipal Court of the City of Montgomery be joined in their official capacities as Party Defendants to this action for the sole purpose of making them subject to the jurisdiction of this Court relative to this Court’s equitable jurisdiction over the Settlement Agreement.\n7. This basis for seeking joinder is consistent with the requirements of Rules 19 and 20 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n8. Rule 19(a)(1) provides that “[a] person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if: (A) in that person’s absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or (B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person’s absence may: (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person’s ability to protect the interest; or (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.”\n9. With respect to Rule 19, the Settlement Agreement between the Parties is such that without joinder of the Municipal Court Judges in their official capacities Plaintiffs cannot obtain the full constellation of negotiated equitable relief. See Rule 19(a)(1)(A).\n10. Furthermore, the Municipal Court Judges in their official capacities have an interest relating to the subject matter of this lawsuit (specifically the request for equitable relief) such that it is in their interest to control the nature of any resolution of this matter involving the operations of the Municipal Court. For that reason, it was in their interest to take part in the negotiations between the Parties and to agree to the specific relief set out in the Settlement Agreement. See Rule 10(a)(1)(B)(i).\n11. Rule 20 provides that “persons … may be joined in one action as defendants if: (A) any right to relief is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (B) any question of law or fact common to all defendants will arise in the action.”\n12. With respect to Rule 20, permissive joinder is appropriate because the relief which the Plaintiffs request arises, in part, out of the same transactions, i.e., hearings held before the Municipal Court, and the parties have agreed to a negotiated settlement which involves the agreement of the Judges of the Municipal Court to take certain actions.\n13. Joinder as Defendants for the purpose of entering into the Settlement Agreement is the most efficient manner in which the equitable relief agreed to by the parties in this action can be resolved.\n14. Furthermore, joinder for the purpose of settling civil rights actions that implicate and involve multiple parties is appropriate under Rule\n19. See, e.g., Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755 (U.S. 1989), abrogated by statute as the holding applies to Title VII as recognized in, Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 251 (U.S. 1994).\n15. Once joinder is granted, the Parties collectively intend immediately to file a Joint Motion for Entry of Final Declaratory and Injunctive Relief.\n16. As set forth in the Agreement to settle the Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, nothing in that Agreement or in this Motion should be construed as an admission by the City of Montgomery that it is liable for the constitutional claims alleged in this case or by the Plaintiffs that the City of Montgomery is not liable for the constitutional claims alleged in this case.\n17. Plaintiffs do not oppose this motion to the extent it seeks permissive joinder under Rule 20.\nWHEREFORE, the City asks this Court to join the Judges of the Municipal Court as Party Defendants in this action for the limited purposes set out above.\ns/Shannon L.

 ""IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA\nSHARNALLE MITCHELL, et al.\nPlaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY, et al, Defendants.\nCase No. 2: 14-cv-186-MHT \nNOTICE OF WILLFUL VIOLATION OF COURT ORDER\nThe Complaint in this case described the modern debtors’ prison run by the City of Montgomery. See Doc. 26 Exhibits 1-34. The conduct of the City and its employees, agents, and judges prior to the filing of this lawsuit was disgraceful.\nAlthough this Court entered an order on November 17, 2014, requiring the City and four of its municipal judges to refrain from jailing people because of their poverty and to take a number of actions to ensure that such conduct did not occur again, the City and at least one of its judges have recently committed flagrant and repeated violations of this Court’s order.\nThe Plaintiffs continue to conduct an investigation with the assistance of counsel for the City and may seek limited court-ordered discovery prior to making a decision concerning whether to file a Motion to Show Cause Why the Defendants Should Not Be Held in Civil Contempt if the Plaintiffs are unable to obtain the relevant information from the Defendants.\nNonetheless, as explained infra, the Plaintiffs file this Notice pursuant to their obligation as officers of the Court to notify this Court of the willful violation of its order so that the Court can take whatever action it deems appropriate, if any, under Fed R. Crim \nP. 42.\nII. Background A. The Old System For years, in assembly line fashion, the City of Montgomery locked human beings in cages to sit out their debts, solely because they were poor and without any of the process required by federal and state law. The City made millions of dollars in profits by demanding payment from desperate family and friends, threatening them that their loved ones would be jailed and kept in jail if they did not bring money down to the clerk’s office immediately. Once locked in jail, debtors who could not pay that ransom or who did not know anyone who could pay it for them were coerced into performing janitorial labor for the City to “work off” their debts. But see 18 U.S.C. § 1589 (making it a federal felony to obtain labor through the threat of physical restraint). The scheme was an assault on the United States Constitution and on the basic humanity of the City’s poor. See generally, Doc.\n26\nB. The Preliminary Injunction On May 1, 2014, this Court heard uncontroverted evidence that the City of Montgomery had been jailing some of its poorest people for debts to the City without providing any of the simple process that the United States Constitution and Alabama law require.1 Judge Fuller issued an order granting preliminary injunctive relief to protect three of the initial Plaintiffs from further unlawful treatment by the City until the City could demonstrate a debt-collection plan that complied with the law. See Doc.\n18. He also ordered City officials to appear in person before this Court to explain the City’s policies and procedures Id. Almost immediately after this Court’s clear statement to the City, the City resumed the same unlawful conduct. In the days after the May 1 order of this Court, the City repeatedly 1 Three of the Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief based on the City’s failure to conduct any inquiry into their ability to pay prior to jailing them for non-payment. See Doc.\n2. After a Response by the City defending its policies and practices, Doc. 14,1 a Reply by the Plaintiffs, Doc. 15, and oral argument before this Court on May 1, 2014, Judge Fuller found that the City’s failure to conduct such an inquiry or consider alternatives to incarceration prior to jailing the Plaintiffs likely violated their constitutional rights and threatened them with irreparable harm. See Doc. 18.\nlocked in its jail impoverished people for debts in proceedings that continued to violate Bearden, Turner, Tucker, Rule 26.11, and the spirit of this Court’s oral statements and written order. See generally Doc. 2 (citing cases); Doc. 15 (same). The City again forced people to “sit out” their debts at the City’s rate of $50 per day without any inquiry into their ability to pay. In short, nothing changed. While this Court’s initial Order pertained only to Ms. Mitchell, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Williams, the City’s return to practices that this Court condemned just days after this Court condemned them was, at best, a troubling reflection of the City’s indifference to the law.\nAfter this Court’s preliminary injunction ruling, the Plaintiffs repeatedly requested that the City cease its unconstitutional behavior. For weeks, the City refused.2 Indeed, a City prosecutor declared in municipal court that he had not read Bearden, had not read Turner, and that he did not intend to. See Doc. 34 at 5.3 Ultimately, after the City hired outside counsel, it 2 At a hearing on this matter, the Plaintiffs would offer proof of the following examples: This Court issued its Order on the evening of Thursday, May 1,\n2014. Two business days later, on Monday May 5, 2014, while obtaining records from a window clerk at the City court, a representative of the Plaintiffs overheard a different window clerk telling a woman that, if she did not bring nearly $200 to the court the next day, the City would jail her. (In subsequent proceedings, counsel for the Plaintiffs represented the woman pro bono, and she was found to be indigent.) This conversation led to an immediate investigation after which the Plaintiffs learned that a number of people had been jailed by the City in cursory proceedings without any Bearden inquiry that morning. The proceedings were materially indistinguishable from the proceedings described in the Preliminary Injunction hearing: no inquiry was made into the inmates’ ability to pay or alternatives to incarceration before they were jailed. Indeed, in a cruel twist, the City judge affirmatively cut off inmates when inmates tried to explain their poverty, refusing to let them be heard even on that basic question and jailing them immediately for non-payment. Four of the people illegally jailed by the City that morning became named Plaintiffs in this case: Kendrick Maull, Tamara Dudley, Demetri Colvin, and Risko McDaniel The City judge then told relatives of those inmates that the person would not be released from City jail unless the relatives could produce enough money to pay some of their debts. But see Doc. 15 at 19 n.14 (citing cases holding such a practice unlawful). Each person was returned to the jail immediately when the relatives stated that they also did not have enough money to satisfy the City Mr. Maull’s family was so frightened that he would not survive in the City jail with inmates who had actually committed crimes, that they raised enough money from multiple family members to get him released that night, on his second day in jail Ms. Dudley was not so lucky— her family was so impoverished that it could not raise enough money to release her. She was held until counsel for the Plaintiffs secured her release later in the week by filling a Notice of Appeal in forma pauperis—a request that was actually granted after counsel submitted the standard state-issued Affidavit of Substantial Hardship describing her indigence. Ironically, as soon as the City bothered to examine her circumstances, Ms. Dudley was found unable to pay the costs of an appeal (as was Mr. Colvin), and she was therefore released pending her appeal of the order jailing her. 3 Perhaps even more troubling are the events of May 6,\n2014. On that date, the City convened hearings to reconsider the jailing of named Plaintiffs Tequila Ballard and Thomas Ellis at the request of undersigned counsel Ms. Ballard, a single mother of four children living in poverty, was ordered by the City to serve 99 days in the City jail for non- released several dozen debtors from its jail on a single day in May 2014 and promised in writing to cease jailing people until it had submitted new procedures to be approved by this Court.\nC. The November 17 Order On November 17, 2014, after the parties had negotiated a new set of procedures to be implemented to guard against the abuses that pervaded the City’s scheme, this Court issued an order requiring the City to comply with those procedures Doc. 51; Doc. 51-1.\nAmong other important procedures in the settlement agreement, the City was ordered to comply with the following provisions:\npayment of debts from traffic tickets. The City made no inquiry into her ability to pay prior to jailing her in a cursory hearing at which she was not represented by an attorney. She had been languishing in the City jail since March 22,\n2014. See Doc. 26 at \n11\nMr. Ellis, a 57-year-old disabled stroke victim, was similarly jailed without any inquiry into his ability to pay and had been confined in the City jail for non-payment of debts since April 17,\n2014. See Doc. 26 at 12.\nCounsel had alerted the City Attorney’s office to the unlawful jailing and continued illegal detention of Tequila Ballard and Thomas Ellis over two weeks prior to May 6, but the City continued to confine them. After this Court’s preliminary injunction ruling, when the City finally set their cases for a reconsideration hearing, the result was a highly irregular legal proceeding.\nThe City prosecutor (who is a private attorney contracted by the City to pursue debt collection and other cases in City court) refused to explain, prior to Ms. Ballard’s hearing, why the City sought to keep her in jail at the hearing and why he had declared that Ms. Ballard was “not indigent” even though she clearly fell significantly below state statutory indigency standards. At the hearing, the City judge refused to let Ms. Ballard put on evidence with respect to her indigence or ability to pay. She was returned to the City jail having not even been given the opportunity to establish her inability to pay—the critical legal question that necessitated the hearing in the first place—or to be heard on any other relevant issue. By that point, she had spent 45 days in the City’s jail away from her four children, one of whom is disabled and all of whom depended on her.\nMr. Ellis, whose only income was his disability benefits, appeared after Ms Ballard\nMr. Ellis has difficulty talking and being understood since his stroke, and he was clearly out of sorts and confused in the courtroom on May\n6. He did not know what day or what month it was, and he could not remember when he had been put in the City jail. He repeatedly stammered and slurred his words. The City prosecutor frequently smiled to the courtroom audience and mocked Mr. Ellis’s confusion over what day it was and how long he had been jailed Mr. Ellis was visibly uncomfortable and disoriented, turning away from the prosecutor and shielding his face. At one point during this humiliation, Mr. Ellis reported that his rent expenses were lower than had been stated on the Affidavit of Substantial Hardship filled out by counsel while Mr. Ellis was handcuffed at the City jail. Instead of exploring the situation, examining Mr. Ellis’s circumstances, or making any findings concerning ability to pay given that Mr. Ellis survived on disability income, the City ordered Mr. Ellis returned to the jail to continue serving out his debts. He had been sitting in the City jail for 19 days at that point. It was after that hearing that the City prosecutor announced that he had not read the Supreme Court decisions of Bearden v. Georgia and Turner v. Rogers and that he “[did not] intend to.” After the hearings on May 6, 2014, counsel for the Plaintiffs notified the City Attorney of the Plaintiffs’ intent to take further action to obtain the immediate release of Ms. Ballard and Mr. Ellis given what had occurred in the City courtroom on May\n6. The next day, the City “sua sponte” released each of them along with an order for them to make monthly payments of $50 per month beginning June 1, 2014.\n\uf0b7 “No defendant will be incarcerated for inability to pay any court-ordered monies, including fines, court costs or restitution.” Doc. 51-1 at 11.\n\uf0b7 “No person may be incarcerated for nonpayment in any case unless these procedures are followed.” Doc. 51-1 at 12.\n\uf0b7 “If the defendant has not paid in full the Court will inquire as to the reasons for noncompliance, including whether the defendant has an inability to pay the amount then due.” Doc. 51-1 at 14.\n\uf0b7 Any defendant unable to pay on the date of adjudication “will be given” a variety of options “excluding” being jailed for nonpayment Doc. 51-1 at 13.\n\uf0b7 “A Public Defender will represent all defendants not otherwise represented by counsel at all compliance and indigence/ability-to-pay hearings. At said hearings, the judge will require that the Public Defender appear with the Defendant in front of the judge, and the Court will note the Public Defender’s appearance in the record.” Doc. 51-1 at 11.\n\uf0b7 The judge shall “have the Public Defender inform any defendant not otherwise represented by counsel of his or her appellate rights and provide said defendant Form 3 should he or she be sentenced to jail for failure to pay fines, costs, fees or restitution.” Doc. 51-1 at 17.\n\uf0b7 To audio record all indigence and compliance hearings at which a person’s ability to pay is determined.\n\uf0b7 To keep the courtroom unlocked and open except in the even that it is “necessary” to “secure” the courtroom to keep the doors locked for a limited period of time not to exceed 10 minutes Doc. 51 at 4.\n\uf0b7 “To notify Plaintiffs’ Counsel by email within twelve hours of any Municipal Court defendant’s being placed in jail for nonpayment of a fine, costs or restitution.” Doc. 51-1 at 3.\nAll of these procedures were designed to prevent the City from again jailing a person because he or she could not make a payment and to enable efficient monitoring of the City’s compliance with that order.\nIII. The March 13, 2015, Violations of this Court’s Order On March 13, 2015, a group of more than 10 people arrived at the City municipal court shortly after 8:00 a.m. The group was met by a City police officer. The officer informed the group that they were late, that the courtroom was locked, that they would not be allowed entry to the courtroom, and that they would be fined $50. The officer then informed the group of individuals that they would be jailed for a day if they did not have $50 to pay the City. Then, without an attorney present, the officer ordered the people to sign a piece of paper purporting to admit to the late time that they had arrived.\nThe officer then refused to allow the people entry into the courtroom. After some time, at approximately 8:30 a.m. and about 15 minutes after many of them had arrived, the officer unlocked the door and let them into the courtroom. A different courtroom bailiff told the group that they would have to pay $50 or be jailed for one night if they did not have the money.\nJudge Darron Hendley then ordered the group to stand near a wall and assessed $50 fines to the individuals in summary fashion one person at a time. No formal process was followed prior to the assessment of what the group was told was a “fine.” Judge Hendley then jailed at least two of these people when they could not immediately pay the $50 fine. None of them was appointed a lawyer.4 Counsel for the Plaintiffs was alerted to the situation through one of the members of the group threatened by City officers with jail if they could not pay. This person was known to City employees as a person involved in federal court litigation against the City relating to these issues. Instead of being fined and jailed as the City officers had done to other individuals in the group, that person was removed from the courtroom and told that she had been in that line against the wall as a mistake.\nAfter an urgent inquiry by undersigned counsel, counsel for Judge Hendley and counsel for the City investigated the situation and admitted in writing that two people were taken into City custody when they could not immediately pay $50 and that no indigence or ability to pay hearing was conducted to determine whether the individuals could pay what appears to have 4 None of those fined or taken into custody when they could not pay were informed of their appellate rights after conviction as required by the Court order.\nbeen the issuance of a summary fine for criminal contempt.5 The Defendants also admitted that no attorney was provided for those jailed. The Defendants represented that Judge Hendley was the only City judge who had engaged in that behavior. The Defendants took what they describe as immediate action to release from custody the sole person who remained confined. The Defendants have assured the Plaintiffs that they have changed their policies and have promised that no one will be jailed again in the future for the inability to pay a $50 fine. Of course, that is the promise that the Plaintiffs had already secured with the entry of this Court’s order.\nCounsel for the Defendants subsequently provided to undersigned counsel the names of 23 individuals fined and threatened with jail by Judge Hendley pursuant to his policy on various occasions since the entry of this Court’s order, as well as and the names of the two people taken into custody on March\n13. The City has also agreed to refund their fines, and Judge Hendley has resigned to be effective within 90 days.\nHowever, a number of other questions remain concerning how this could have happened on numerous occasions and regarding the City’s policies and practices surrounding the March 13 incident or similar incidents, including how many people have been subjected to such unlawful summary contempt proceedings (the City has also now admitted that many other people are routinely being found in criminal contempt by the other City judges on a daily basis for being late without following any of the procedures required my Alabama and federal law, see supra 5 Judge Hendley’s conduct violates state and federal law mandating due process prior to findings of criminal contempt. The Defendants argued to undersigned counsel that Judge Hendley was adjudicating the people for criminal contempt pursuant to his “inherent authority” to hold them in contempt for violating a court order to arrive at 8:00 a.m., although he followed none of the statutory or constitutional provisions required in criminal contempt cases. See Ala R. Crim Pro. 33.1; 33.3; Ala. Code § 12-14-31; see also, e.g., United States v. KS W Offshore Eng'g, Inc., 932 F.2d 906, 909-10 (11th Cir. 1991) (reversing contempt judgment for a lawyer who arrived late to court and holding that the use of summary contempt procedures for late arrivals was not appropriate and that such procedures are reserved for contumacious conduct observed by a judge in the courtroom).\nnote 5), threatened with jail for non-payment by City officers and bailiffs, barred from the courtroom, and denied counsel.\nIndeed, after representing for over two weeks that the above-related events constituted the extent of their unlawful behavior, counsel for the Defendants informed counsel for the Plaintiffs in writing on the eve of the Plaintiffs filing this Notice to alert this Court about the March 13 violations that Judge Hendley and City officers had openly enforced this policy since at least December 30, 2014, and that Defendant Hendley and City employees had taken into custody at least four additional people when they could not afford to pay a $50 fine for being late that had been summarily imposed. The Defendants therefore admitted that the misconduct in violation of the Court order had been occurring for four months, and the Defendants violated the Court order to notify undersigned counsel within 12 hours of any person being jailed for nonpayment and to provide a certification to the City jail administrator that the federal court order had been complied with prior to jailing. Counsel for the Plaintiffs has not yet been provided the names or contact information for these additional individuals but expects to receive that information.\nIn all, the Defendants have now admitted in writing to violating this Court’s order in numerous ways on multiple occasions, including by taking into custody six human beings when they could not afford immediately to pay a mere $50 fine.\nIV. Willful Violation of the Court’s Order Federal court orders are a serious matter, particularly when they involve enforcing basic constitutional rights in the wake of rampant civil rights violations. Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 22 (1958) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (“For those in authority thus to defy the law of the land is profoundly subversive not only of our constitutional system but of the presuppositions of a democratic society.”).\nAfter systemic wrongdoing was exposed and enjoined, the City chose to keep the same contract prosecutors, municipal judges, and contract defense attorneys6 even though all of them had been involved in violations of clearly established federal law and violations of the Rules of Professional Ethics on a daily basis.\nIt is now clear that Judge Hendley and multiple City officers and bailiffs decided to hold people in criminal contempt summarily with no lawyer and no formal process to determine willfulness—and, further, to take those people into custody for not being able to pay a $50 fine immediately.7 (All of this for allegedly being a few minutes late in a City that refuses to utilize restricted drivers’ licenses and that does not fund adequate public transportation.) In doing so, Judge Hendley and the City (whose employees apparently knew of Judge Hendley’s policy for some time and whose officers implemented it) violated a federal injunction prohibiting some of the most serious abuses in our society: widespread jailing of people because of their poverty as part of a pattern of extortion. Judge Hendley’s “pay or jail” scheme was what this entire lawsuit was about from the very beginning, and the Defendants have demonstrated remarkable defiance of a federal injunction just months after it was issued by this Court.8 6 The City was also aware that a contract defense attorney’s sworn affidavit submitted to Judge Fuller stating that he met with every inmate prior to their court hearings was explicitly contradicted by numerous sworn declarations submitted by the Plaintiffs in this case. 7 The Defendants assert that most of the individuals were not actually transported to the City jail but were instead confined to a holding cell. 8 Through counsel, Judge Hendley now claims that he believed that he was allowed through his “inherent authority” to jail indigent people who could not afford immediately to pay a fine because he claimed this Court’s order was somehow limited “to fines and costs for misdemeanors and traffic offenses” and not to people too poor to pay fines for contempt offenses. The logic of this assertion is baffling.\nTo their credit, counsel for the Defendants have been forthcoming in responding to requests for basic information made by Plaintiffs’ counsel prior to filing any Motion to Show Cause. The Plaintiffs are still awaiting verified responses to their inquiries, as well as additional information necessary to conduct and complete their investigation. If the Plaintiffs are unable to obtain the information sought from the City, it may be necessary, in order to determine the scope and nature of the violations to which the Defendants have already admitted in general terms, for the Plaintiffs to request:\n\uf0b7 Interrogatories relating to basic questions about the events of March 13 and any related policies, practices, or similar incidents.\n\uf0b7 Permission to notice depositions of all City employees and agents present for the March 13 violations, as well as any City employees and agents with knowledge of similar incidents in December 2014 or related policies.\n\uf0b7 Production of any documents relevant to the violations, including court documents, sign-in sheets, records, and any other documents reflecting the names and contact information of witnesses to the violations of March 13, 2015, or any other similar event. This includes an order to the City to provide the names and contact information of the victims of the violation of this Court’s order, if it is in the City’s possession, as well as all those held in summary contempt for being supposedly late to court since the entry of this Court’s injunction.\nSee, e.g., United States v. City of Northlake, 942 F.2d 1164, 1170 (7th Cir. 1991) (reversing district court’s denial of discovery on possible violations of a consent decree by a municipal government); Wesley Jessen v. Bausch Lomb, 256 F. Supp.\nAlthough the Defendants have already admitted to serious violations of this Court’s order and although the institution of contempt proceedings is appropriate because the orders of this Court must be followed, it is prudent for the Plaintiffs to investigate as soon as practicable the full scope of the violations prior to the Plaintiffs determining whether civil contempt sanctions are required to cease ongoing violations of this Court’s order.\nIn any event, the Plaintiffs file this Notice with the Court so that the Court can make its own determination concerning whether to refer the matter to the relevant authorities in order to initiate criminal contempt proceedings to punish the Defendants for blatant violations of this Court’s order. See, e.g., Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370 (1966) (explaining that civil contempt seeks to coerce future compliance while criminal contempt seek to punish for past violations); Skinner v. White, 505 F.2d 685, 688 (5th Cir. 1974) (“[C]ivil contempt lies for refusal to do a commanded act, while criminal contempt lies for doing some forbidden act.... [C]ivil contempt is conditional, and may be lifted if the contemnor purges himself of the contempt….”); see also Wyatt ex rel. Rawlins v. Sawyer, 80 F.

Georgia ||| up to three years ||| December 12, 2014 | January 16, 2015 ||| April 2, 2015 ||| April 7, 2015 [SUMMARY] On March 8th, 2014, several citizens of Montgomery, Alabama, who had been imprisoned for failing to pay traffic fines, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, under 42 U.S.C. §1983, against the City of Montgomery, Alabama. The plaintiffs, represented by Equal Justice Under Law and private counsel, asked the court for a declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs' rights were violated, compensation for the damages caused by the city's conduct, and attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs alleged they did not have the ability to pay for the traffic tickets and that the City should not have imprisoned them for failing to pay the traffic tickets when they did not attempt to determine whether the plaintiffs had an ability to pay.

On May 1, 2014, the district court (Judge Mark E. Fuller) granted a motion for a preliminary injunction. The injunction enjoined the city from attempting to collect monies owed to the city associated with traffic tickets by the plaintiffs. The city was also required to submit a comprehensive plan on how they will determine an individual's ability to pay for traffic fines. On August 20, 2014, the case was reassigned to Judge Myron H. Thompson, and on August 21, 2014, Judge Thompson extended the injunction until the court ordered a change.

On October 31, 2014, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the case because they entered into a settlement agreement about the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court granted this dismissal on November 17, 2014, and the court agreed to the plaintiffs’ request to maintain jurisdiction over the settlement in case of any breaches by the defendant. 

Within the settlement, the Municipal Court of the City of Montgomery agreed to numerous changes in its operations, including using a microphone in its courtroom proceedings, notifying this plaintiff's counsel within 12 hours of a defendant being jailed for nonpayment of a fine, and training public defenders and prosecutors on compliance with Bearden v. Georgia and Turner v. Rodgers. The terms of the settlement agreement lasted up to three years.

On December 12, 2014, Judge Thompson formally closed the case, though the court retained jurisdiction over the settlement and allowed the parties to resolve the issue of attorneys' fees, which was subsequently resolved on January 16, 2015. 

On April 2, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a notice with the court that the defendants willfully violated the settlement agreement. The matter seemed to be resolved quickly because on April 7, 2015, Judge Thompson ordered that no further action would be taken on the notice because defendants had taken corrective action. 

The case is now closed.","[ENTITYCHAIN] March 8, 2014 | City of Montgomery, Alabama ||| May 1, 2014 ||| October 31, 2014 [SUMMARY] The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit on March 8, 2014, alleging that the City of Montgomery, Alabama, improperly imprisoned them for failing to pay traffic fines. They alleged that they did not have an ability to pay the fines due to their financial circumstances and that the city did not consider their ability to pay. On May 1, 2014, the District Court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the city from collecting more money from traffic tickets of plaintiffs'. On October 31, 2014 the parties filed to dismiss the case pursuant to a settlement agreement, which included numerous changes to Municipal Court proceedings.

WESTRY,\nRespondents.\nAMENDED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY RELIEFS WRIT OF CERTIORARI, OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WRIT OF MANDAMUS\nCOMES NOW Petitioner Harriet Delores Cleveland, by and through undersigned counsel, and states as follows:\nI. INTRoDucTIoN I. Petitioner Harriet Cleveland is an indigent woman who was ordered\' to be incarcerated in the Montgomery Municipal Jail, in violation of her constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and to counsel.\n2. Petitioner has been unable to find full time employment Since she was laid off from her job at a day care in\n2009. She has been babysitting and renting out rooms in her home to strangers in order to make ends meet. Very recently, she obtained a part time job as a custodian.\n3. In 2008 and 2009, when a police roadblock was often set up in her West Montgomery neighborhood, she incurred several tickets because she could not afford car insurance. Her license was soon suspended because she could not pay the fines imposed, and she obtained tickets for this failure as well when she drove to work and took her child to school.\nThis order remains in effect, but Petitioner was released from jail on a bond pending the resolution of her appeal.\n4. On August 20, 2013, Petitioner was arrested at her home for failure to pay fines and costs associated with various traffic tickets in the Montgomery Municipal Court (""Municipal Court""). She had received a letter from the District Attorney, notifying her that she ""MUST pay this amount in full within SEVEN (7) days of the date of this notice or [she] may be ARRESTED."" (emphasis in original).\n5. The Municipal Court ordered Petitioner to either pay $1554 immediately to satisfy those fines, or be immediately taken into custody to serve a 31 day sentence. Petitioner told the Municipal Court that she could not pay the full amount, but nonetheless was taken to the Montgomery Municipal Jail immediately, where she remains.\n6. The incarceration is unconstitutional for at least two reasons:\n7. First: It is unconstitutional under both the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and Alabama Constitution to jail an indigent person for failure to pay a fine. U.S Const\namend. XIV; Ala Const\nart. I, § 1, 6, 22; Ala R. Crim P. 26.11 (setting out procedures to comply with this constitutional right). See also Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S 660, 672-73 (1983) (jailing a probationer because he cannot pay a fine without considering her ability to pay violates Fourteenth Amendment); Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971) (""[T]he Constitution prohibits the State from imposing a fine as a sentence and then automatically converting it into a jail term solely because the defendant is indigent and cannot forthwith pay the fine in full.""); Frazier v. Jordan, 457 F.2d 726, 728-29 (5th Cir. 1972) (finding that an alternative sentencing scheme of $17 dollars or 13 days in jail was unconstitutional as applied to those who cannot immediately pay a fine).\nIn order to grant the relief Petitioner seeks, this Court need not consider the facts surrounding her nonpayment or make any express finding about her inability to pay. Rather, the fact that Petitioner said that she could not pay, coupled with the failure of the Municipal Court to make a meaningful inquiry into Petitioner\'s ability to pay, constitutes a violation under the Constitution and Rule 26.11 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and mandates that this Court quash the order of the Municipal Court.\n9. Second: Because Petitioner was actually imprisoned on the charges against her, Petitioner was jailed in violation of her right to counsel, as she never knowingly and intelligently waived this right. See U.S Const\namend. VI; Ala Const\nart. I, § 6; see also Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 373 (1979) (Because ""actual imprisonment is a penalty different in kind from fines or the mere threat of imprisonment,.. actual imprisonment [is] the line defining the cônstittitional right to appointment of counsel"" in nonfelony cases.).\n10. Petitioner therefore asks that this Court issue a writ of certiorari and quash the order of the Municipal Court requiring Petitioner to serve the 31-day sentence, and declare that this order violates the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions and Alabama laW.\nII. JURISDICTION\n11. This COurt has jurisdiction of Petitioner\'s claim for declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Ala. Code § 6-6-222, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as Petitioner asks that this Court declare that the order and practice of the Municipal Court violates Alabama law and the Alabama and U.S Constitutions. There is a justiciable controversy between the parties based on the order of confinement and practice of the Municipal Court to issue Such orders.\n12. This COurt also has jurisdiction over this petition for a writ of certiorari. Petitioner Cleveland is appealing the decision of the Municipal Court to confine her in jail, long after the original conviction and sentence was imposed. For this reason, Section 12-14-70 of the Alabama Code, which provides for a direct appeal to the circuit court of a conviction by a municipal court, appears to be inapplicable. Direct appeal under Section 12-14-70, which ""was intended to provide an avenue by which criminal defendants... might enjoy and be guaranteed their... constitutional rights to trial before a jury,"" appears not to be implicated here, where Petitioner seeks only to challenge the court\'s unconstitutional modification of her sentence long after her original conviction. McDaniel v. State, 397 So.2d 237, 239 (Ala Crim\nApp. 1981), writ denied sub nom. Exparte McDaniel, 397 So.\n13. Rather, where review in the nature of certiorari ""would be considered eually effective and certainly less duplicitous,"" it has been deemed the proper method to challenge a post-conviction decision by a municipal court Id. See also Essix v. City of Birmingham, 308 So.\n14. In the alternative, if a writ of certioriari is unavailable and the concurrently filed appeal is improper, this Court has jurisdiction over a writ of prohibition or mandamus. Exparte Owen Fed. Bank, FSB, 872 So.\n15. The petition was filed within a reasonable time, as it was filed within 14 days of the Municipal Court\'s order of confinement to jail.\n2 Petitioner has also noticed an appeal in the Municipal Court within the time limit of 14 days from the Municipal Court\'s order of confinement if this Court believes this to be the correct way to review the judgment Ala. R Crim\nP. 30.3(a).\nIII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\' A. Order of Incarceration\n16. Petitioner Harriet Cleveland was ordered by the Municipal Court to be incarcerated in the Montgomery Municipal Jail for 54 days because of her failure to pay fines and fees on multiple traffic tickets.\n17. Petitioner is a 49-year-old resident of Montgomery. She was arrested at her home on August 20, 2013, while babysitting her grandson. She was arrested and incarcerated for being unable to make payments on old traffic tickets in the amount of $1554.\n18. Approximately two months earlier, Petitioner received a letter from the Office of the District Attorney of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, notifying her that she owed $2714 in fines and fees on her traffic tickets. The letter states that she ""MUST pay this amount in full within SEVEN (7) days Of the date of this notice or [she] may be ARRESTED."" (emphasis in original). It does not give any other options if Petitioner cannot pay.\n19. Petitioner spent one night in jail and appeared before The Honorable Milton J. Westry of the Montgomery Municipal Court on August 21,\n2013. Judge Westry told Petitioner that she must serve 31 days in jail if she did not pay $1554 immediately.\n20. Petitioner told Judge Westry that she previously did not have a job. She told him that, very recently, she had finally found a part-time job that would help her make money to pay the tickets. Judge Westry asked an agent of Judicial Correction Services (""JCS""), who Sits at the front of the courtroom, whether Petitioner was qualified for a payment plan, and the agent said no. Petitioner was returned to jail.\nPetitioner previously verified the facts contained in the original Petition, which have not changed with this amendment except to reflect the fact that Petitioner has since been released from the Montgomery Municipal Jail.\nhi\n21. Petitioner heard Judge Westry give others the same option of paying fines or serving time in jail. When one woman said that she was unable to pay, he said that she must be jailed because of a policy that he must follow.\n22. A copy of the transcript given to Petitioner, which details the court\'s disposition of each of these cases ,4 is attached to this Petition. Each case is listed as ""commuted,"" and the judge\'s order to either pay the fine or spend 31 days in jail is detailed at the bottom of the order.\n23. Petitioner has been told by many others that they also have been, or are currently, incarcerated because of their inability to pay fines.\nB. Background\n24. Petitioner incurred the traffic tickets on which she is currently jailed in 2008 and 2009, when a police roadblock was often set up in her neighborhood.\n25. She was jailed at least twice in 2009 and 2010 on these tickets. When she told the judge at one hearing that she could not afford to pay because she was only able to find part-time work, he told her to find another job.\n26. Petitioner was previously ordered to make payments of $140 per month to Judicial Correction Services (""JCS""), a private probation company. She paid what she could when she had the money, but never had the full $140 every month. The Municipal Court did not conduct a review of her financial situation or ability to make those large monthly payments.\n27. Petitioner has been unable to find full-time work for years. Petitioner lost her full time job at a daycare in 2009, and was able to obtain only a part time job over the next year until she was again laid off. Since that time, she has made some money for daily necessities by babysitting and by renting out two rooms of her home to strangers. Very recently, Petitioner was 4 The case numbers are 2008TRT029308; 2009TRT022302; 2009TRT034595; 2009TRT035054; 2009TRT047492; 2009TRT095474; 2009TRT095475; and 2009TRT1 06724.\nRI\nable to obtain a part-tithe job cleaning a daycare. However, after years without a full-time job, she is still left without resources to pay for daily necessities. She filed for bankruptcy in June 2013.\n28. Under her Chapter 13 plan, she must make monthly payments of $250.00, which she is unable to do while she is in jail and unable to work. She also believes that she will lose her cleaning job as well as her babysitting jobs while she is forced to stay in jail and miss work for over a month.\nIV. STATEMENT OF ISSUES\n29. Should the order of the Municipal Court be quashed or declared to be in violation of Alabama law and the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions because of the Municipal Court\'s failure to make a meaningful inquiry into Petitioner\'s inability to pay and her indigency, thereby subjecting her to incarceration because of her inability to pay in violation of the equal protection and due process clauses?\n30. Should the order of the Municipal Court be quashed or declared to be in violation of Alabama law and the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions because of the Municipal Court\'s failure to appoint counsel for Petitioner or obtain a waiver of this right? V. STATEMENT WHY WRIT SHOULD ISSUE AND WHY DECLARATORY RELIEF SHOULD BE \nGRANTED\n31. Petitioner is unlawfully incarcerated because of her indigence and inability to pay her fines, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; Article I, Sections 1, 6, and 22 of the Alabama Constitution; and Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n32. She is also unlawfully incarcerated in violation of her right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 6 of the Alabama Constitution.\n33. On a petition for a common-law writ of certiorari, the Court is ""responsible for reviewing the record to ensure that the fundamental tights of the parties, including the right to due process, had not been violated."" Franks v. Jordan, 55 So.\n34. This Court should exercise its ""supervisory power. by way of certiorari"" to protect the rights of Petitioner and ensure that the Municipal Court understands its duties and the rights of all criminal defendants under the United States and Alabama Constitutions. Essix, 308 So.\n35. The Court may also declare this order and practice to be in violation of Alabama law and the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions under Ala. Code § 6-6-222 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nA. Due Process and Equal Protection\n36. The Municipal Court violated Petitioner\'s due process and equal protection rights by failing to make a meaningful inquiry into her ability to pay and sentencing her to serve a jail term simply because of her inability to pay the fines and fees imposed..\n37. The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held that courts violate the Fourteenth Amendment by treating indigent criminal defendants differently than those who are able to pay.\nSee Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 672-73 (1983) (to ""deprive a probationer of her conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of her own he cannot pay a fine.. would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment""); Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395 (1971) (holding that to imprison a defendant who was unable to pay a fine violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 241 (1970) (""reaffirm[ing] allegiance to the basic command that justice be applied equally to all persons""); Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 355 (1963) (denouncing the ""evil"" of ""discrimination against the indigent""); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 19 (1956) (""There can be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money be has."").\n38. In Tate, the Supreme Court adopted the view that ""the Constitution prohibits the State from imposing a fine as a sentence and then automatically converting it into a jail term solely because the defendant is indigent and cannot forthwith pay the fine in full."" Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971). This is true ""whether or not the fine is accompanied by a jail term."" Id. It noted that the State may constitutionally resort to other alternatives in Order to serve its valid interest in enforcing payment of fines, such as imposing installment plans Id. at 399-400.\n39. In Bearden, the United States Supreme Court reversed the trial court\'s probation revocation based on the defendant\'s failure to pay fines and restitution, because the court did not first determine that the defendant had the ability to pay. The Bearden Court held,:\n[I]n revocation proceedings for failure to pay a fine or restitution, a sentencing court must inquire into the reasons for the failure to pay if the probationer willfully refused to pay or failed to make sufficient bona fide effOrts legally to acquire the resources to pay, the court may revoke probation and sentence the defendant to imprisonment within the authorized range of its sentencing authority. If the probationer could not pay despite sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to do so, the court must consider alternative measures to punishment other than imprisonment. Only if alternate measures are not adequate to meet the State\'s interests in punishment and deterrence may the court imprison a probationer who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay.5 Bearden, 461 U.S. at \n672.\n40. The former Fifth Circuit explicitly held that an alternative sentencing scheme, such as that used by the Municipal Court in this case, was unconstitutional as applied to those who were unable to pay the fine at once. See Frazier v. Jordan, 457 F.2d 726, 727 (5th Cir. 1972) (ending, based on the Supreme Court\'s decisions in Williams and Tate, that an alternative sentencing scheme of $17 dollars or 13 days in jail was unconstitutional as applied to indigent defendants).\n41. The Court of Criminal Appeals similarly has made clear that, ""[i]n revocation proceedings for failure to pay fines, restitution, court costs, or supervision fees, the trial court should inquire into the reasons for the failure to pay and make Specific detrminatiotis and findings in accordance with Bearden v. Georgia,"" including findings, ""supported by the evidence, that defendant willfully refused to pay; that he failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts to pay; or, in the event of a showing of sufficient efforts to pay, that alternative measures to punish and deter are inadequate."" Snipes v. State, 521 So.2d 89, 90-91 (Ala Crim\nApp. 1986).\n42. Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure also purports to establish procedures ""consistent with the United States Supreme Court\'s holding in Tate v. Short."" Committee Comments, Ali R. Crim P. 26.11. It mandates that ""[un no case shall an indigent The Supreme Court has rejected three reasons offered to show why imprisonment was required to further penal goals. First, the state\'s interest in ""ensuring that restitution be paid to the victims"" is insufficient, because [r]evoking the probation of someone who through no fault of his own is unable to make restitution will not make restitution suddenly forthcoming Bearden 461 U S at 670 Similarly, the state \',s interest in removing a defendant from the temptation of committing other crimes in order to protect society and rehabilitate him is also insufficient as this would amount to ""little more than punishing a person for her poverty."" Id. at\n671. Finally, although the state\'s interest in punishment and deterrence of others is a valid interest it can be served fully by alternative means including extending the time for making payments reducing the fine or directing that the probationer perform labor or public service in lieu of the fine Id. at 671-72.\ndefendant be incarcerated for inability to pay a fine or court costs or restitution."" Ala R. Cnm P. 26.11 (1)(2). Moreover, ""[i]ncarceration should be employed only after the court has examined the reasons for nonpayment,"" including ""consideration of the defendant\'s situation, means, and conduct with regard to the nonpayment of the fine and/or restitution."" Id. 26.11 (i)(1). Thus, the court must consider the financial situation of any defendant and her ability to pay before ordering incarceration.\n43. Rule 26.11 provides other remedies for a defendant\'s failure to pay, including (1) reducing the fine to an amount the defendant is able to pay; (2) continuing or modifying the schedule of payments; (3) ordering an employer to withhold wages; or (4) releasing the defendant from an obligation to pay the fine Id. 26.11(h).\n44. In the instant case, the Municipal Court failed to conduct even a cursory review of Petitioner\'s ability to repay her fines or her bona fide efforts to acquire the money to pay. It thus failed in its affirmative duty to inquire into ability to pay, as required by Rule 26.11 and Bearden.\n45. The Municipal Court should not have a policy requiring incarceration when individuals cannot pay their fines. It may not categorically determine that failure to meet any previously imposed payment plans justifies an alternative sentence of immediate payment or mandatory incarceration, especially when the previous payment plans involved a rninimtirn monthly payment far beyond the means of Petitioner. Under Rule 26.11 and the Alabama and U.S. Constitutions, the court is still required to determine the reasons for the inability to pay and whether Petitioner is indigent before imposing a sentence that mandates incarceration for failure to pay.\n46. This Court need not consider the facts surrounding Petitioner\'s nonpayment and make an express finding that Petitioner did not have the ability to pay order to grant the relief requested. Rather, Petitioner\'s inability to pay the fine immediately coupled with the failure of the Municipal Court to meaningfully inquire into Petitioner\'s ability to pay constitutes a violation under the Alabama and U.S. Constitutions and Rule 26.11, and mandates that this Court quash the order of the Municipal Court.\nB. Right to Counsel\n47. Petitioner was sentenced to incarceration without being provided With counsel or waiving this right, in violation of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 6 of the Alabama Constitution.\n48. Because ""actual imprisonment is a penalty different in kind from fines or the more threat of imprisonment,... actual imprisonment [is] the line defining the constitutional right to appointment of counsel"" in nonfelony cases Scott V. IllinOis, 440 U.S. 367, 373 (1979); see also Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 662 (2002).\n49. ""In Order to waive the right to counsel, the record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer."" Ex parte Shelton, 851 So.\n50. At the hearing on August 21, Petitioner was actually incarcerated on the Municipal Court\'s order. She was not provided with appointed counsel, and did not waive her right to counsel.\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for relief as follows:\nA. Promptly grant the writ of certiorari or, in the alternative, mandamus;\nB. Find and declare that the Municipal Court\'s order constitutes a violation of the due process clause, equal protection clause, and/or the right to counsel provisions of the Alabama or U.S. Constitutions; and C. Quash the order of confinement ordering Petitioner to the Montgomery Municipal Jail in violation of her constitutional rights.\nDated this 18th day of September, 2013.\nRespectfully submitted, /s/ Sara Zampierin Sara Zampierin (Bar No. ZAM002) Southern Poverty Law Center 400 Washington Avenue Montgomery, Alabama 36104 Telephone: (334) 956-8200 Fax: (334) 956-8481 Email: sara.zampierin@splcenter.org Attorney for Petitioner \nMANDATORY TIME RELEASE DA7I: COMD TIME RELEASE NAT\nDocument 1-2 I UfI1t ELECTRONICALI Y FILED 9í1 S 2013 1 :2( I\\f \n(L -2OI3-9O44J CIR(\'T IT OF RI OF\nIII I-ANY B. \\IL(ORi), CT ERK MANCRYT PR&PSAUD BVi L \nMONTGOMERY MUNICIPAL.COURT STATE OF ALABAMA\n)ATK&TTh4B: 8/20/2013 18AOb.:2o3OO816t \nNAMB:HA1UM3TDLEVELAN.0\ng•.\nRACE 3\nSEX P\nSSN\nADDESS 326.E QODN.

 ""IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA\nNORTHERN DIVISION\nHARRIET DELORES CLEVELAND,\nPlaintiff, vs.\nCITY OF MONTGOMERY,\nTHE HONORABLE MILTON J.\nWESTRY,\nDefendants.\nCase No. 2:13-cv-00732-MEF-TFM \nAMENDED COMPLAINT\nINTRODUCTION\n1. Plaintiff Harriet Cleveland is an indigent woman who has been ordered1 to be incarcerated because of her inability to pay traffic tickets, in violation of her constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and to counsel.\n2. Plaintiff has been unable to find full time employment since she was laid off from her job at a day care in\n2009. She has been babysitting and renting out rooms in her home to strangers in order to make ends meet. Very recently, she obtained a part time job as a custodian at a day care.\n3. In 2008 and 2009, when a police roadblock was often set up in her neighborhood, she incurred several tickets because she could not afford car insurance. Her license was suspended because she could not pay the steep fines and court costs. Thereafter, she obtained tickets for driving without a suspended license when she drove to work and took her child to school.\n1 This order has not been vacated. Plaintiff was released from jail on a bond, and Defendants and the Municipal Court have agreed not to arrest her on the cases implicated by this lawsuit while it remains pending.\n4. On August 20, 2013, Plaintiff was arrested at her home for her inability to pay fines and costs associated with various traffic tickets in the Montgomery Municipal Court (“Municipal Court”).\n5. Defendant, the Honorable Milton J. Westry, was presiding over the Municipal Court proceedings on August 21, 2013 and ordered Plaintiff to either pay $1,554 immediately to satisfy those fines or serve a 31 day sentence in jail. When Plaintiff told the court that she could not afford to pay the full amount on the spot, she was taken to the Montgomery Municipal Jail.\n6. Plaintiff challenges these collection procedures and practices and her incarceration under the due process and equal protection clauses of the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions, and the Alabama state law implementing these provisions. See U.S Const\namend. XIV; Ala Const\nart. I, §§ 1, 6, 22; Ala R. Crim P. 26.11. Although Plaintiff informed Defendant Judge Westry that she could not pay, Defendant failed to make a meaningful inquiry into Plaintiff’s financial situation and her ability to pay.\n7. Plaintiff further challenges this incarceration as violating her right to counsel under the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions, as she was jailed without being provided counsel to represent her during the aforementioned proceedings or waiving that right. See U.S Const\namend. VI; Ala Const\nart. I, § 6.\n8. Plaintiff therefore asks that this Court declare that this order violates the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions and Alabama law.\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE\n9. Plaintiff filed this action in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County on August 28,\n2013. Defendants removed to this Court on October 4, 2013.\n10. Plaintiff brings claims arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the U.S. Constitution, which this Court has jurisdiction over pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over all claims arising under the Alabama Constitution and laws pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.\n11. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a) because this Court sits in the district and division in which the state court action was pending.\nPARTIES\n12. Plaintiff Harriet Cleveland is a 49-year-old resident of Montgomery, Alabama.\n13. Defendant City of Montgomery (“City”) is an Alabama municipal corporation organized pursuant to Act 73-618 of the Alabama Legislature and located in Montgomery County, Alabama.\n14. Defendant Judge Milton J. Westry is a resident of the State of Alabama.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS Order of Incarceration\n15. Plaintiff Harriet Cleveland was ordered to serve 31 days in jail because of her inability to pay fines and fees on multiple traffic tickets.\n16. Plaintiff incurred these traffic tickets in 2008 and 2009, when a police roadblock was often set up in her neighborhood.\n17. She was jailed at least twice before for these tickets in 2009 and\n2010. When she told the judge at one hearing that she could not afford to pay because she was only able to find part-time work, he told her to find another job.\n18. Plaintiff received a letter from the Office of the District Attorney of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama dated June 24, 2013, notifying her that she owed $2,714 in fines and fees on her traffic tickets. The letter, attached as Exhibit A, states that she “MUST pay this amount in full within SEVEN (7) days of the date of this notice or [she] may be ARRESTED.” (emphasis in original). It does not give any other options if Plaintiff cannot pay.\n19. Plaintiff was arrested at her home on August 20, 2013, while babysitting her grandson and brought to the Montgomery Municipal Jail.\n20. Plaintiff spent one night in jail and appeared before Defendant Judge Westry of the Montgomery Municipal Court on August 21,\n2013. Defendant Judge Westry told Plaintiff that she must serve 31 days in jail or pay $1,554 immediately.\n21. Plaintiff told Defendant Judge Westry that she previously did not have a job. She explained that she had only very recently found a part-time job that would help her make money to pay the tickets. Defendant Judge Westry conducted no further inquiry into her ability to pay now or in the past.\n22. Defendant Judge Westry asked a person at the front of the courtroom, believed to be an agent of Judicial Correction Services (“JCS”), whether Plaintiff was qualified for a payment plan and when the agent said no, Plaintiff was ordered back to jail.\n23. No lawyer was appointed to represent Plaintiff during this proceeding. Although an individual spoke to Plaintiff before she was called before the court, he did not tell Plaintiff that he was her attorney or represent her when she appeared before Defendant Judge Westry.\n24. On the same day she was ordered to be incarcerated, Plaintiff heard Defendant Judge Westry give others the same option of paying fines immediately or serving time in jail.\nWhen one woman said that she was unable to pay, he said that she must be jailed because of a policy that he must follow.\n25. A copy of the transcript given to Plaintiff, which details the court’s disposition of each of these cases,2 is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit B. Each case is listed as “commuted,” and Defendant Judge Westry’s order to either pay the fine or spend 31 days in jail is detailed at the bottom of the order.\n26. Plaintiff has been told by many others that they have similarly been incarcerated because of their inability to pay fines.\nFinancial History and Indigency\n27. Plaintiff was previously ordered to make partial payments on her fines and court costs to Judicial Correction Services (“JCS”), a private probation company. JCS records indicate that Plaintiff’s monthly payment amount was $200 per month, of which $40 per month went directly to JCS. Plaintiff paid what she could, but almost never had the full amount every month. The Municipal Court did not conduct a review of her financial situation or ability to make those large monthly payments.\n28. Plaintiff paid approximately $3,186.00 to JCS over the time of her probation, which went toward fines and costs owed for these cases and for other cases that have since been closed. In early 2012 she used almost her entire income tax return to pay a large amount to JCS. However, after that, she was unable to continue making payments, as her income was already insufficient to cover her expenses. JCS recommended that she be removed from probation in July 2012, noting in its report to the court that Plaintiff had no income and lost her house.3 2 The case numbers are 2008TRT029308; 2009TRT022302; 2009TRT034595; 2009TRT035054; 2009TRT047492; 2009TRT095474; 2009TRT095475; and 2009TRT106724. 3 Plaintiff was facing foreclosure, but had not actually lost her home yet.\n29. The court files for the cases on which Plaintiff was jailed do not contain records of the entire amount paid to JCS towards her fines and court costs. Upon information and belief, the court files do not reflect the amounts that Plaintiff actually owes, since at least one case for which Plaintiff was jailed appears to have already been paid in full.\n30. Plaintiff has been unable to find full-time work for years. Plaintiff lost her full time job at a daycare in 2009, and was able to obtain only a part time job over the next year until she was again laid off from that job.\n31. Since that time, she has made some money for daily necessities by babysitting and by renting out two rooms of her home to strangers. She lost one babysitting job when she was jailed in August 2013.\n32. Plaintiff was able to obtain a part-time job cleaning a daycare just before she was imprisoned. She walks to this job every weekday, as she is unable to obtain a license because of her outstanding fines and unable to afford daily bus fare. She continues to look for a full-time job or additional work.\n33. After years without a full-time job, Plaintiff is left without resources to pay for daily necessities. She filed for bankruptcy in June\n2013. Under her Chapter 13 plan, she must make monthly payments of $250.00 to the Chapter 13 trustee and additional payments of over $600 to remain current on her mortgage and cure her past default. She fell behind on these payments in August 2013 when she was in jail and unable to work, and is facing the imminent loss of her home.\nPolicies and Practices of the City of Montgomery and Judges of the Municipal Court\n34. It is the policy and practice of Defendants to offer an alternative sentence to those who have not paid outstanding fines and court costs—requiring them to either pay the amount owed immediately or “sit out” the time in jail at a rate of $50 per day.\n35. When individuals are first sentenced or plead guilty and are unable to pay fines and court costs, these individuals are assigned to probation with JCS, under general practice and the Municipal Court’s standing orders. Individuals must make monthly payments to JCS that include monthly supervision fees of $40. When these individuals fail to make their payments, JCS reports back to the Municipal Court, triggering further proceedings in the Municipal Court to collect what is owed.\n36. The Municipal Court does not conduct indigency determinations or explain how an individual may claim indigency if s/he is unable to pay either when the person is initially assigned to JCS or facing jail time for nonpayment. This is true even when it has been reported to the court that a person, such as Plaintiff, has no income and is facing other financial difficulties.\n37. The City’s “Amnesty Program” further demonstrates Defendants’ practice of jailing persons who are unable to pay. In May 2013, Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange and Ken Nixon, the City’s Municipal Court Administrator and member of the Mayor’s cabinet, announced that the Municipal Court would offer an amnesty program on the first two Saturdays in June. Under this program, the court would, theoretically, remove certain fees, eliminate arrest warrants, and institute a payment plan if individuals were unable to pay the full amount owed.\n38. However, at least 15 people were arrested on the first day of the Amnesty Program because they had too much money outstanding (greater than $2,500) or did not have at least $150 (or 10% of what was owed, if greater) to pay towards their fines Mr. Nixon publicly acknowledged that the arrests probably scared others from participating.\n39\nMr. Nixon warned that, following the Amnesty Program, the City would be even stricter about arresting people with outstanding warrants. Later that same month, Plaintiff received a letter from the district attorney regarding her nonpayment. It threatened arrest, without informing her that she may not be jailed if she was found indigent. (Ex. A.) She was arrested approximately two months later.\n40. Over the past years, Plaintiff has witnessed and heard of many others who were not represented by counsel during the proceedings in which they were jailed, and during which no indigency determinations were conducted. In fact, as stated above, on the day that she was ordered to be incarcerated, she heard Defendant Judge Westry tell another woman that he had to enter such an order according to a policy that he must follow.\n41. The City of Montgomery relies on the Municipal Court to provide money not only for the court’s own expenses, but to pay for the Municipal Jail and for general fund expenses.\n42. Defendants’ policy is to charge court costs on every individual ticket, as was done in Plaintiff’s cases, even if multiple tickets arise from the same incident. But see Ala. Code § 1219-150(c) (“For the purpose of assessing fees in criminal cases, a case shall include all offenses arising out of the same incident. Fees shall be assessed on the basis of the most serious offense of which the defendant is convicted, provided, that the judge may, in his discretion, assess costs for each conviction.” (emphasis added)).\nCLAIMS COUNT I Declaratory Judgment of Violation of Plaintiff’s Rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202)\n43. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through \n42.\n44. Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202, Plaintiff seeks a declaration that Defendants’ actions, policies, and practices that led to her incarceration for her inability to pay traffic tickets violated the rights to due process and equal protection contained in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n45. The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits treating indigent criminal defendants differently than those who are able to pay or automatically converting a fine-only sentence to a sentence of imprisonment without an inquiry into their ability to pay.\n46. Defendants’ actions in violating Plaintiff’s constitutional rights also constitute violations of 42 U.S.C. §\n1983. Defendants were acting under color or law when their actions, policies, or practices caused Plaintiff’s confinement.\n47. There is a substantial continuing controversy, and Plaintiff will suffer further imminent injury if she is required to serve the remainder of her sentence. Defendants have not vacated the order confining Plaintiff or promised not to enforce it, but instead have agreed to stay the remainder of the incarceration period and other post-conviction collections until this Court has ruled on this case.\nCOUNT II Declaratory Judgment of Violation of Plaintiff’s Rights under the Sixth Amendment and 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 (28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202)\n48. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through \n47.\n49. Under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202, Plaintiff seeks a declaration that Defendants’ actions, policies, and practices that led to her incarceration violated the right to counsel contained in the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n50. Defendants violated Plaintiff’s right to counsel through their actions, policies, and practices that led to the failure to appoint counsel to represent her in her proceedings before the Municipal Court. Plaintiff was actually imprisoned, and did not knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily waive her right to counsel.\n51. Defendants’ actions in violating Plaintiff’s constitutional rights also constitute violations of 42 U.S.C. §\n1983. Defendants were acting under color or law when their actions, policies, or practices caused Plaintiff’s confinement.\n52. There is a substantial continuing controversy, and Plaintiff will suffer further imminent injury if she is required to serve the remainder of her sentence. Defendants have not vacated the order confining Plaintiff or promised not to enforce it, but instead have agreed to stay the remainder of the incarceration period and other post-conviction collections until this Court has ruled on this case.\nCOUNT III Common Law Certiorari\n53. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 52.\n54. Plaintiff requests review in the nature of certiorari to determine whether the order of incarceration violated Plaintiff’s rights under the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions and Alabama law.\n55. Defendants violated Plaintiff’s constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and counsel as explained in the preceding paragraphs, including the equivalent protections under the Alabama Constitution, Ala Const\nart. I, §§ 1, 6,\n22. Their actions, policies, and practices also violated her rights to an examination into her ability to pay before incarceration and not to be incarcerated as an indigent person under Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure, Ala R. Crim P. 26.11(g), (h), (i).\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays for relief as follows:\na. A declaration that Defendants violated Plaintiff’s Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983;\nb.

A declaration, pursuant to certiorari review, that Defendants violated Plaintiff’s rights under the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions and Alabama law;\nd. An order awarding reasonable attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and e. Other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\nDated this 12th day of November, 2013.\nRespectfully submitted, /s/ Sara Zampierin____________ Sara Zampierin, Ala.

No defendant will be incarcerated for inability to pay any court-ordered monies, including fines, court costs or restitution. (Rule 26.11, Ala R\nCrim. P.).\n2. A Public Defender will represent all defendants not otherwise represented by counsel at all compliance and indigence/ability-to-pay hearings. At said hearings, the judge will require that the Public Defender appear with the Defendant in front of the judge, and the Court will note the Public Defender’s appearance in the record.\n3. Procedures involving initial appearances at the window are applicable to those defendants appearing on or before the due date indicated on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and Complaint (“UTTC”).\n4. The granting of an initial sixty (60) day review will be afforded to all cases (new and old) as the procedures are implemented.\n5. Form One (Payment of Fines and Costs) will be placed on the City of Montgomery website, displayed conspicuously in the Court and Lobby of the Municipal Court, and provided to defendants at their initial appearance if they are provided a compliance hearing along with Form Two (Order for Compliance Review).\n6. The Court will use the current Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”) chart when making an indigence determination, and there will be a presumption of indigence when a defendant is at or below 125% of the FPL subject to review of his or her assets.\n7. The defendant will fill out an Affidavit of Substantial Hardship (Form C-10A) or any updated version of the same, and the inquiry relative to income and assets will follow from the information provided therein. A public Defender will be available to answer any questions about the form.\n8. A defendant at 125% of FPL or below without substantial liquid assets available to pay the fines, costs, fees, or restitution will be deemed indigent. In determining whether a defendant has substantial liquid assets, the Court will not consider up to the first $3,000 in personal property, and up to $5,000 in home equity. A finding of substantial liquid assets cannot be based on the receipt of an Earned Income Tax Credit.\n9. An indigent defendant will be given the option of either paying $25.00 a month to pay off his fines, court costs, fees, and restitution or doing community service.\n10. The Court retains the discretion to make credibility determinations relative to testimony and evidentiary submissions regarding income and assets and to question defendants relative to the same.\n11. The ability of a defendant to pay who is not deemed indigent but who expresses an inability to pay his fines, costs, fees and restitution in full will be based on that defendant’s: (i) disposable income, as reflected in the Affidavit of Substantial Hardship (Form C-10A) and as further clarified by questions raised in the indigence hearing, (ii) the defendant’s assets, and (iii) the defendant’s earning potential.\n12. The community service hours’ computation will be based on a minimum of $10 credit for each hour of community service worked. The monthly requirements will be a minimum of eight (8) hours and a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours of community \nEXHIBIT A\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nservice, provided, however, that the court may order more hours of monthly community service at the request of the defendant.\n13. The court record shall contain an explanation of any determination of non indigence.\n14. The Court or its designee will designate the entity with which the defendant assigned to community service must work, taking into account the needs of the City for community service, the needs of the other entities providing community service opportunities, and the defendant’s needs.\n15. Defendants who do not initially pay in full are provided Forms One and Two attached hereto which provide notice regarding the procedures set out herein and defendants’ rights.\n16. No person may be incarcerated for nonpayment in any case unless these procedures are followed.\n17. The payment of restitution as ordered by the court cannot be satisfied by the performance of community service, unless the restitution is owed to the City.\n18. The present language of Rule 19(C)(2) of the Rules of Judicial Administration authorizes an increase in the fine only when there is a failure to appear at the initial appearance (pre-judgment) on the ticket.\n19. After an initial ability to pay or indigence determination, a defendant’s ability to pay may be re-assessed at subsequent compliance hearings based on changed circumstances or at the Court’s discretion following the procedures set forth herein.\n20. No person unable to pay his or her fines and costs in full will be charged an additional fee for being placed on a payment plan unless affirmatively authorized by law.\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nFIRST COURT APPEARANCE WITH ADJUDICATION OR PLEA OF GUILTY\n1. Plea of guilty entered at the window (scheduled offenses only) a. Obtain signature on Plea of Guilty/Waiver of Rights Form b. Collection of scheduled fine and court costs i.\nIf paid in full, close case and issue receipt.\nii. If unable to pay on the same day, the defendant will be given an (approximate) sixty (60) day review by the Court at a compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided).\n2. Plea of guilty entered or adjudicated in Court (scheduled and non scheduled offenses) a. Judge orally receives guilty plea or adjudication of guilt b. Imposition of Sentence (possible fine, court costs and jail sentence) i.\nIf it is determined that the conduct for which the defendant has been convicted warrants the imposition of a jail sentence, the sentence shall be carried out as directed by the Court. The imposition of a jail sentence will have nothing to do with a defendant’s inability to pay the fines and court costs.\nii. If able to pay the fine and court costs on the same day, the defendant may be directed to the pay window or otherwise informed how to make payment. The full amount is paid and the case is closed.\niii. If the defendant tells the Court that he or she is unable to pay on the same day, the defendant will be given the following options and/or ordered as follows: placed on a payment plan and given a compliance hearing date; given an approximate sixty (60) day review by the Court at a compliance hearing; given an order to complete community service; or any other disposition deemed just and appropriate at the discretion of the Court, excluding incarceration. (Forms One and Two to be provided) (a) It will not be a standard practice to hold an indigence /ability-topay hearing at this stage of the proceedings. However, the Court reserves the option to do so and, where the defendant is found indigent, to provide the defendant the option of the minimum payment plan or community service at this stage and to enter an order consistent with the option chosen.\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nCOURT APPEARANCE – COMPLIANCE REVIEW DATES\n1. If the defendant does not appear (and the defendant has not received a continuance from the Court) a warrant will be issued.\n2. The defendant must be given an opportunity to present evidence that the amount allegedly owed is not accurate or is not in fact owed if the Defendant believes that the amount is not correct.\n3. If the defendant has not paid in full the Court will inquire as to the reasons for noncompliance, including whether the defendant has an inability to pay the amount then due. During this inquiry the Court will specifically ask questions pertaining to the defendant’s ability or inability to pay the amount owed in full. One of the initial questions asked in connection with the ability to pay inquiry will be “Are you able to pay today?” or words to that effect.\n4. If after inquiry by the Court, there is a. No indication of inability to pay, the defendant may be placed on a payment plan by the Court; given another review date set as a compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided); sentenced to serve time in jail (but not without an indigence/ability-to-pay hearing described below); or given any other disposition deemed just and appropriate at the discretion of the Court.\nb. An indication of inability to pay i.\nthe defendant will be directed to a Public Defender to assist with the completion of an Affidavit of Substantial Hardship Form and any further paperwork the Court deems necessary; ii. the Court will then hold a hearing at which the Public Defender will represent the defendant, and the Court will make an indigence/ability to pay determination taking into consideration any testimony, the Affidavit of Substantial Hardship, any other paperwork the Court deems necessary, and any documents submitted by the defendant. The defendant will be permitted to present evidence. If, after questioning (including questioning by the Court) and presentation of evidence, the defendant is (a) determined to be at or below 125% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), the defendant will be determined to be indigent and unable to pay the fines, fees, court costs, and/or restitution in full at the Compliance Hearing, unless the defendant has substantial liquid assets with which he or she could satisfy the payments. In determining whether a defendant has substantial liquid assets, the Court will not consider up to the first $3,000 in personal property, \nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nand up to $5,000 in home equity. A finding of substantial liquid assets cannot be based on the receipt of an Earned Income Tax Credit.\n(b) determined to be above 125% of the FPL, the defendant will not receive a presumption of indigence, but the Court will still consider whether the defendant has the ability to pay based on the defendant’s disposable income, liquid assets, and earning potential.\niii. If the defendant is determined to be indigent or otherwise unable to pay the amount owed for fines, fees, court costs, and/or restitution in full as ordered, the Court:\n(a) may determine the defendant’s ability to make payments based on that defendant’s: (i) disposable income, as reflected in the Affidavit of Substantial Hardship and any other paperwork required by the Court, and as further clarified by answers to questions posed in the hearing, (ii) the defendant’s assets, and (iii) the defendant’s earning potential; order the defendant to make payments consistent therewith; and schedule a review at another compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided). However the Court will not order a monthly payment in excess of $25.00 for indigent defendants; (b) may remit costs and fines; (c) must (unless fines and costs are remitted in full) provide a defendant deemed indigent or otherwise unable to pay the $25.00 minimum monthly payment, the option to complete community service (if physically able) in lieu of payment of costs and fines and schedule a review at another compliance hearing, provided that: (i) if a defendant who has previously been placed on a payment plan fails to make one or more payments, the Court may order said defendant to complete community service (if physically able) to satisfy his or her debt; and (ii) that community service will not be an option for satisfaction of amounts owed for restitution, unless restitution is owed to the City (Forms One and Two provided); and/or (c) may order any other remedy deemed just and appropriate at the discretion of the Court, excluding incarceration.\niv. If the defendant is determined in the indigence/ability-to-pay hearing to have had the ability to pay as ordered (including individuals previously placed on a payment plan), the Court may:\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\n(a) place the defendant on a payment plan or modify the existing payment plan and schedule a review at another compliance hearing in approximately sixty days (60) (Forms One and Two provided); (b) give the defendant another review date set as a compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided); (c) order the defendant to complete community service (if physically able) in lieu of payment of costs and fines and schedule a review at another compliance hearing (Forms One and Two provided); (d) remit costs and fines; (e) order the defendant to serve jail time with fines and costs reduced per day at an amount no less than that allowed by Ala R. Crim P. 26.11 (Public Defender present unless otherwise represented) if there is a finding of willful nonpayment provided that the days to which the defendant is sentenced do not exceed the number of days required to work off the amount then currently due and owing; and/or (f) provide any other disposition deemed just and appropriate at the discretion of the Court.\n5. If the defendant was ordered to do community service in lieu of paying, the Court may, upon the defendant’s failure to comply, set a contempt hearing to determine if the defendant should be sanctioned. The Court will comply with the requirements of Ala R. Crim P. 33, including, but not limited to, providing notice, hearing, and written findings. The Court will remit additional fines and costs associated with any contempt conviction and will remit the original fines, fees, and costs in connection with any jail sentence given for contempt at the same rate as that provided defendants jailed pursuant to Ala R. Crim \nP. 26.11.\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nMISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES\nIn addition, the Judges of the Court will:\n1. provide notice of a compliance hearing, as set out in these procedures, to all defendants on a Judicial Correction Services payment plan or contract as of June 2014;\n2. treat probationers as set out in the above procedures if and when probation is subject to revocation for nonpayment of fines, costs, fees or restitution;\n3. treat those who are currently on payment plans as set out in the above procedures;\n4. have the Public Defender inform any defendant not otherwise represented by counsel of his or her appellate rights and provide said defendant Form 3 should he or she be sentenced to jail for failure to pay fines, costs, fees or restitution;\n5. instruct the clerks to provide defendants who have failed to appear as required by their UTTC (uniform traffic ticket and complaint) with a license reinstatement letter (if the Court has notified the Alabama Department of Public Safety of the failure to appear) upon the defendant’s first voluntary appearance at a compliance hearing or upon full payment of costs, fines, fees or restitution, whichever occurs first; and\n6. permit a defendant who has failed to appear at his or her initial appearance date for a scheduled traffic offense and who is subject to an arrest warrant for the same, to appear at the window at the Court and not be arrested on that warrant but instead to be provided a compliance hearing date; and\n7. instruct the clerks that no warrant for failure to appear shall be confirmed unless it is supported in the Court’s file by notification from the Court or notification in a charging instrument which notification provides a specific date and time for a court hearing.\nJUDICIAL PROCEDURES OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY FOR\nFORM ONE\nPayment of Fines and Costs If at any time you cannot pay your fines and costs as ordered by the Court, you may go before the Court at your Compliance Hearing to discuss your financial situation, to ask that the Court’s Order be changed (for example, to ask that you pay less) and/or to explain why you are unable to pay. The time and date of your Compliance Hearing before the Court will be provided to you in a Court Order given to you.\nIf you indicate that you are unable to pay your fines and costs, the Court will order you to complete an Affidavit of Substantial Hardship and other forms as deemed necessary, and may inquire about your finances, to include but not be limited to: income, expenses (i.e. rent, childcare, utilities, food, clothing, medical condition/bills, transportation, etc.), bank accounts, and other assets. In some circumstances, the Court may also inquire about your efforts to obtain the money to pay, including your job skills and efforts to apply for jobs. You should present any documents that you have to the Court during this inquiry. If you cannot afford an attorney, the Court will provide a Public Defender to represent you.\nBased on your income, you may be ordered to perform community service or be placed on a monthly payment plan. You will be given a Compliance Hearing date to return to Court for the Judge to review your particular case(s). Your appearance at this Compliance Hearing is mandatory.\nYou cannot be put in jail solely for your inability to pay your fines and costs, or for nonperformance of community service, unless you willfully failed to pay or to perform the community service ordered despite having the ability to do so.\nYou may pay the full amount you owe at any time in accordance with the Court’s Order, and at that point you will not have to continue to make payments, finish your community service, or appear at your next scheduled Compliance Hearing. You may contact the Court or inquire at a Municipal Court pay window if you would like to obtain your balance owed.\nIf the Court determines that you have a disability, illness, or other circumstances that would prevent you from performing community service, you will not be required to perform community service.\nIn summary, after you have been ordered by the Court to pay your fines and court costs or to perform community service, you will be given a Compliance Hearing date to come back to Court to review your case(s). This hearing is mandatory. Even if you are unable to pay all of your fines and costs or complete the hours ordered before that date, you must attend. At this Hearing, you will have the opportunity to explain to the Court why you have not complied with the Court’s Order(s) and present evidence. You could be put in jail only if the Court determines that you willfully violated the Court’s Order.

As explained below, the Court may enter the declarations requested by the parties and resolve the cases with a final judgment order.\nCASE ALLEGATIONS\nPlaintiffs Harriet Cleveland and Markis Watts allege that they were both given tickets, were sentenced to pay fines and costs on said tickets, failed to pay the fines and costs, and were jailed in the Montgomery Municipal Court in August,\n2013. Plaintiffs were given credit for each day of incarceration, at a rate of $50 per day, to pay off their outstanding fines. Cleveland First Am Compl. 5, 34 (No. 2:13-cv-732, ECF No. 10); Watts First Am Compl. 17, 26 (No. 2:13-cv-733, ECF No. 9). Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants Municipal Court Judge Westry and Chief Judge Hayes violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as well as Article I Sections 1, 6, and 22 of the Alabama Constitution and Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure, by jailing them without conducting an indigency determination, as required by Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983); by failing to provide meaningful notice in advance of the hearing where they were ordered incarcerated, as required by Turner v. Rogers, 131 S Ct. 2507 (2011); and by failing to provide an attorney to represent them in these hearings. Cleveland First Am Compl. 43–55; Watts First Am Compl. 35–47. Plaintiffs alleged that these violations were part of a policy and practice by the Defendants Westry and Hayes as well as Defendant City of Montgomery. Cleveland First Am Compl. 34–42; Watts First Am Compl. 26–34. Defendants dispute these factual allegations.\nCASE PROCEDURAL HISTORY While in custody in the Montgomery Municipal Jail, Plaintiffs filed petitions for writ of certiorari, or in the alternative, writs of mandamus, in state court, which Defendants removed to federal court. See Notice of Removal (Cleveland, No. 2:13-cv-732, ECF No. 1; Watts, No. 2:13cv-733, ECF No. 1). Plaintiffs then filed first amended complaints seeking declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees and costs, Defendants answered, and the matters were consolidated. First Am Compls. (Cleveland, No. 2:13-cv-732, ECF No. 10; Watts, No. 2:13-cv-733, ECF No. 9); Order Consolidating Cases (ECF No. 13);1 Answer (ECF No. 15). Defendants agreed to stay the orders of incarceration and collection of all amounts owed by Plaintiffs during the course of this federal litigation.\nThe Parties commenced discovery. While that continued, the case Mitchell v. City of Montgomery, No. 2:14-cv-186, was filed. The Mitchell case raises similar claims to the instant cases, but additionally sought injunctive relief and monetary damages. In the Mitchell case a preliminary injunction order was entered, in which the Court enjoined the City of Montgomery from collecting fees from the Mitchell plaintiffs, and ordered the City of Montgomery to submit to the Court a comprehensive plan listing the current or proposed policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations of an individual’s ability to pay, the policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations as to reasons for an individual’s failure to pay, the policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations of any alternative measures of punishment other than imprisonment for the non-payment of fines, and the policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations of whether these alternative measures are adequate to meet the City’s interests in punishing and deterring the non-payment of fines, which shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nMitchell Order 1–2 (No. 2:14-cv-186, ECF No. 18). The Court further provided a briefing schedule and set a hearing to evaluate the constitutionality of the comprehensive plan Id. 3– Plaintiffs Cleveland and Watts obtained permission to participate in briefing and the proposed hearing regarding the comprehensive plan contemplated in the Mitchell Order. See Order (ECF No. 35). The Mitchell, Cleveland, and Watts Parties then agreed to engage in a private mediation to attempt to develop a comprehensive plan to which all Parties could agree 1 Docket entries for everything including and after the Order Consolidating Cases are based on the lead case, Cleveland, No. 2:13-cv-732.\nwould facially satisfy the relevant constitutional requirements. (See ECF Nos. 44, 45, 49). As a result of the mediation and related negotiations, the Mitchell, Cleveland, and Watts Parties agreed upon a set of procedures that they believe facially comply with the federal and Alabama Constitution, as well as applicable Alabama state law and rules of procedure. Those procedures are attached as Exhibit A to the amended motion.\nDECLARATIONS REQUESTED IN THE AMENDED MOTION\nThe parties request that the Court issue certain declarations under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 to resolve disputes between the Parties as to what would constitute facially legally permissible Municipal Court proceedings.2 Upon the issuance of such declarations, all disputes between the Parties arising out of the claims in this case will be resolved, and the Court can issue a final judgment.\nFirst Declaration Related to Constitutional Principles The Parties first ask the Court to declare that:\nunder the current status of the law, the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), regarding incarceration for non-payment; and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S Ct. 2507 (2011), regarding notice, and, to the extent applicable in a particular case, the Judges of the Montgomery Municipal Court are legally required to follow them.\nAm. Joint Mot. 6.a. Each of these concepts—incarceration for non-payment and notice—are discussed below.\nFirst, In Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), the Supreme Court held: [T]hat in revocation proceedings for failure to pay a fine or restitution, a sentencing court must inquire into the reasons for the failure to pay. If the probationer willfully refused to pay or failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts legally to acquire the resources to pay, the court may revoke probation and 2 The Parties seek a ruling only as to what is facially required during Municipal Court proceedings, and whether the proposed procedures are facially constitutional. The actual implementation of the procedures may hypothetically raise new issues but those hypothetical issues are not presently at issue between the Parties.\nsentence the defendant to imprisonment within the authorized range of its sentencing authority. If the probationer could not pay despite sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to do so, the court must consider alternate measures of punishment other than imprisonment. Only if alternate measures are not adequate to meet the State’s interests in punishment and deterrence may the court imprison a probationer who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay. To do otherwise would deprive the probationer of his conditional freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he cannot pay the fine. Such a deprivation would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment Id. at 672–73. The Supreme Court explained that “alternate measures of punishment” that could satisfy the State’s interest in punishment and deterrence could include “extend[ing] the time for making payments, or reduc[ing] the fine, or direct[ing] that the probationer perform some form of labor or public service in lieu of the fine.” Id. at\n672. Alabama courts have explained that, “in accordance with Bearden v. Georgia,” courts must inquire into the reasons for any failure to pay and make specific determinations and findings, including findings “supported by the evidence that the defendant willfully refused to pay; that he failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts to pay; or, in the event of a showing of sufficient efforts to pay, that alternative measures to punish and deter are inadequate.” Snipes v. State, 521 So.2d 89, 90–91 (Ala Crim\nApp. 1986). The Parties agree, and seek a declaration from the Court, that these standards articulated in Bearden apply to the Montgomery Municipal Court when that court is considering whether to incarcerate someone who has not paid their fines and costs. Second, in Turner v. Rogers, 131 S Ct. 2507, 2511 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the due process clause requires procedural safeguards in cases involving a potential for incarceration for nonpayment. The Court went on to note that one, non-exclusive, way in which these procedural safeguards can be satisfied is by: (1) notice to the defendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical issue in the contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equivalent) to elicit relevant financial information from him; (3) an opportunity at the hearing for him to respond to statements and questions about his financial status; and (4) an express finding by the court that the defendant has the ability to pay. Turner v. Rogers, 131 S Ct. 2507, 2519 (2011). Turner also suggested that alternate provisions other than the four identified above may also satisfy the procedural safeguards required by the due process clause Id. at 2519–20. The Parties agree, and seek a declaration from the Court, that the general principles articulated in Turner apply to the Montgomery Municipal Court when that court is considering whether to incarcerate someone who has not paid their fines and costs. The Parties thus respectfully ask that the Court enter the requested First Declaration Related to Constitutional Principles to resolve any dispute between the Parties regarding whether these principles apply to the Montgomery Municipal Court when it is considering whether to incarcerate a person who has not paid his or her fines and costs, as Plaintiffs allege occurred to them in August 2013, and as Plaintiffs allege could happen to them again in the future absent such a declaration.\nSecond Declaration Related to Judicial Procedures and Federal Caselaw The Parties next ask the Court to declare that: the Judicial Procedures attached as Exhibit A facially comply with the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), regarding incarceration for non-payment; and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S Ct. 2507 (2011), regarding notice Am. Joint Mot. 6.b. The Parties agree that the Judicial Procedures agreed upon by the Parties facially comply with the cited requirements regarding incarceration for non-payment, and notice. Each is discussed below. First, the requirements of Bearden v. Georgia are satisfied. Prior to incarcerating anyone for non-payment, the Procedures require the municipal court judge to ask if the person has the ability to pay. See Ex. A at 4\n3. If, at a compliance hearing, a defendant expresses an inability to pay, the court will hold a hearing to make a determination of that person’s ability to make payments and ascertain whether the person is indigent. See id. at 4–5. The defendant may present evidence or testimony at this hearing Id. at 4 4.b.ii. The court will order an individual to serve jail time only after making an express finding of willful nonpayment Id. at 6 4.b.iv.e. The Procedures also include alternates to incarceration to provide punishment and deterrence, including the option of payment plans, delaying payments owed, remitting costs and fines, providing community service, or any other remedy deemed just and appropriate Id. at 5 4.b.iii, 6 4.b.iv. Thus, because the Procedures require an actual finding of willful nonpayment before any person can be incarcerated for non-payment, and because the Procedures authorize alternatives to incarceration as needed to permit Defendants to fulfill their legitimate interest in punishing defendants who cannot afford to pay, the Parties believe, and ask the Court to declare, that the Procedures facially comply with Bearden v. Georgia.\nSecond, the Judicial Procedures agreed upon by the Parties facially comply with the right to notice required by due process as articulated in Turner v Rogers. The Procedures provide notice to individuals that their ability to pay is a critical issue in the proceeding, both by an initial inquiry by the municipal court judge, see Ex A. at 4 3, and by providing a notice of rights form, id. at\n8. An affidavit of substantial hardship form is used to elicit relevant financial information, id. at 4–5 4.b.i–iii, and the defendant may present evidence or testimony at this hearing, id. at 4 4.b.ii.\nThus, because the Procedures require notice that the ability to pay is a critical issue, both orally by the municipal court judge and in writing before the hearing, and because the Procedures require use of a form to elicit relevant financial information, and because the Procedures state explicitly that the defendant may present evidence, the Parties believe, and ask the Court to declare, that the Procedures facially comply with Turner v. Rogers.\nThird Declaration Related to Judicial Procedures and Constitutional and State Law Provisions The Parties next ask the Court to declare that: the Judicial Procedures attached as Exhibit A facially comply with the requirements of the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, sections 1, 6, and 22 of the Alabama Constitution, and Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure Am. Joint Mot. 6.c. The cases cited in the Amended Motion set out the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S Constitution. Thus, by providing the opportunity for a hearing on ability to pay before incarceration, by requiring a finding of willful nonpayment, and by providing all defendants with notice that the ability to pay is relevant and with a form that solicits relevant financial information, the Procedures facially comply with these constitutional provisions. The Judicial Procedures also comply with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Municipal Court will provide counsel at each compliance hearing or indigence determination. See Ex. A at 1 2 (“A Public Defender will represent all defendants not otherwise represented by counsel at all compliance and indigence/ability-to-pay hearings. At said hearings, the judge will require that the Public Defender appear with the Defendant in front of the judge, and the Court will note the Public Defender’s appearance in the record.”); see also id. at 4 4.b.i, ii; 6 4.b.iv.e. The Municipal Court will also provide counsel, in accordance with Rule 33 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure, for any contempt proceedings initiated for those who fail to complete community service. See id. at 6 5; Ala R. Crim P. 33.3(d); 6.1(a). Defendants do not concede that this is necessarily actually required by the Sixth Amendment, but all Parties agree that by providing counsel, the Judicial Procedures do facially comply with the Sixth Amendment.\nFor the same reasons explained above, the Judicial Procedures also necessarily facially comply with the corresponding provisions of the Alabama Constitution. Alabama courts have interpreted the State Constitution to provide equivalent rights to equal protection, due process, and right to counsel. See State v. Adams, 91 So.\nFurthermore, Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure was meant to establish procedures “consistent with the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Tate v. Short.”3 Committee Comments, Ala R. Crim P. 26.11. Under Rule 26.11, “If the defendant cannot pay the costs, fine, and/or restitution immediately after pronouncement of the sentence as preferred, the court may permit payment of the costs, fine, and/or restitution, at some later date, or in specified installments.” Ala R. Crim P. 26.11(d). If a defendant fails to pay within the 3 See Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971) (“[T]he Constitution prohibits the State from imposing a fine as a sentence and then automatically converting it into a jail term solely because the defendant is indigent and cannot forthwith pay the fine in full.”).\nspecified time, Ala R. Crim P. 26.11(f), the Court may inquire into the reasons for nonpayment and impose remedies, including reducing the amount owed, continuing or modifying the schedule of payments, ordering an employer to withhold a portion of wages, releasing defendant from the obligation, or incarcerating the defendant Id. 26.11(g), (h). “Incarceration should be employed only after the court has examined the reasons for nonpayment,” including “consideration of the defendant’s situation, means, and conduct with regard to the nonpayment of the fine and/or restitution.” Id. 26.11(i)(1). “In no case shall an indigent defendant be incarcerated for inability to pay a fine or court costs or restitution.” Id. 26.11(i)(2).\nDefendants do not concede that the judges of the Municipal Court ever “immediately” or “automatically” incarcerated criminal defendants who did not pay fines and costs or that the judges of the Municipal Court incarcerated the Plaintiffs or any other criminal defendants because they were unable to pay fines and costs. Defendants further deny that any of them violated Rule 26.11 or Tate, supra, and Defendants submit that it was the practice of the Municipal Court judges generally to give individuals appearing there time to pay fines and costs.\nNevertheless, the new Judicial Procedures comply with these state and federal requirements. As explained above, these procedures facially satisfy the due process and equal protection clauses by requiring a hearing and a determination of a person’s ability to pay and an express finding of willful nonpayment before ordering jail time. See Ex. A at 4–6. The plan also provides the judges with the options, including incarceration and other alternatives, available under Rule 26.11(h) Id. at 5 4.b.iii, 6 4.b.iv. With the above declarations, the Parties submit that all disputes between them raised in these actions will be resolved. The Parties thus respectfully ask the Court to enter the requested declarations, and to further enter a final judgment as to all claims in the above-styled cases.\ns/ Samuel Brooke Sara Zampierin Samuel Brooke David Carter Dinielli Southern Poverty Law Center 400 Washington Avenue Montgomery, AL 36104 Email: samuel.brooke@splcenter.org Email: sara.zampierin@splcenter.org Email: david.dinielli@splcenter.org \nATTORNEYS FOR PLAINTIFFS\ns/Jason C.

 ""IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHERN DIVISION\nHARRIET DELORES CLEVELAND,\nPlaintiff, v. CITY OF MONTGOMERY and \nTHE HONORABLE MILTON J.\nWESTRY,\nDefendants.\nMARKIS ANTWUAN WATTS,\nPlaintiff, v. \nCITY OF MONTGOMERY, THE\nHONORABLE MILTON J.\nWESTRY, and THE HONORABLE \nLES HAYES III,\nDefendants.\nOPINION\n“Providing equal justice for poor and rich, weak and powerful alike is an age-old problem. People have never ceased to hope and strive to move closer to that goal.” Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 16, (1956).\nPlaintiffs Harriet Delores Cleveland and Martin Antwuan Watts bring these consolidated federal cases against defendants City of Montgomery and two of the City’s municipal judges, claiming that they were thrown in jail for being too poor to pay parking tickets in violation of their rights to counsel, equal protection, and due process under the following federal and state laws: the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution; Article I, §§ 1, 6, and 22 of the Alabama Constitution; and the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. Subject-matter jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal question), 1343(a)(3) (civil rights), and 1367 (supplemental). These cases are before this federal court on the parties’ joint motion for entry of agreed settlement order. The motion will be granted.\nI. BACKGROUND Cleveland and Watts allege that they were unconstitutionally jailed because they were too poor to pay Montgomery city traffic-ticket fines and associated court costs. Although the facts remain disputed, to give background for the settlement the court briefly reviews them as alleged by Cleveland and Watts.\nCleveland alleges that, over a period of five years, she received a number of traffic tickets that she could not afford to pay. The first tickets were for a lack of car insurance. Over a two-year span, police set up roadblocks in her West Montgomery neighborhood, and she was ticketed each time she could not present proof of insurance. Because she could not afford to pay these tickets, the City of Montgomery suspended her license. Nevertheless, she continued driving to work and her child’s school, and she eventually received additional tickets for driving without a license. She remained unable to pay the fines owed, and, in August 2013, her outstanding fines were converted into a term of imprisonment in the Montgomery Municipal Jail.1 Similarly, Watts alleges that he was taken into custody to serve a 54-day sentence based solely on his inability to pay a traffic ticket when he appeared before the Montgomery Municipal Court regarding an unrelated misdemeanor charge. Although the court dismissed the misdemeanor, it learned that Watts had outstanding traffic fines. The court gave him two options: either pay or face jail time. After he stated that he could not afford to pay the outstanding fines, the court sentenced him to jail.\nIn August 2013, while still in custody in the Montgomery Municipal Jail, Cleveland and Watts each brought suit individually in state court. Following removal to this federal court, the cases were\n1. Cleveland also alleges that she was jailed at least twice prior to 2013 due to her inability to pay the traffic tickets she received during 2008 and\n2009. Little information was provided, however, regarding those periods of incarceration or the municipal-court proceedings that produced them.\nconsolidated. Cleveland and Watts sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The City and the other defendants agreed to a stay of the municipal-court orders of incarceration and the collection of outstanding debts pending discovery in this matter.\nDuring discovery, another federal case, Mitchell v. City of Montgomery, No. 2:14cv186-MHT, was filed. The facts in Mitchell are analogous, and the Mitchell plaintiffs raise substantially similar claims. The Mitchell court, however, entered a preliminary injunction. As part of the injunction, the City of Montgomery was ordered to submit a comprehensive set of proposed judicial procedures that it would implement for the collection of fines going forward. While Cleveland’s and Watts’s cases have been litigated separately from Mitchell, this court allowed Cleveland and Watts to participate in the briefing and proposed hearing regarding the proposed judicial procedures.\nAll parties then decided to engage in private mediation to develop agreed-upon procedures that would facially satisfy federal and state-law requirements. The parties now contend that the resulting proposed procedures establish a scheme whereby indigent defendants will not be “incarcerated for [their] inability to pay fine[s] or court costs or restitution.” Ala R. Crim P. 26.11(i)(2). The procedures are guided by four key components: access to counsel, notification forms, “indigence/ability-to-pay” hearings, and express judicial findings.\nUnder the proposed judicial procedures, a debtor who does not otherwise have counsel is to be represented by a public defender at all compliance and indigence/ability-to-pay hearings. A public defender will also be available to a debtor who needs assistance completing an affidavit of substantial hardship and related documentation prior to hearings. Lastly, public defenders are instructed to inform any debtor who is ultimately subject to imprisonment of her appellate rights.\nIf a debtor is unable to pay her fine, she will be notified of her right to a public defender, the date of her compliance hearing, and her right to present evidence of financial hardship through a set of forms:\nForm One (“Payment of Fines and Costs”) and Form Two (“Order Setting Hearing for Compliance Review”). The forms notify the debtor that an individual “cannot be put in jail solely for [her] inability to pay... fines and costs” absent a finding of willful non-payment. The forms go on to indicate how a debtor would begin establishing inability to pay at her first compliance hearing.\nDuring a debtor’s first compliance hearing--scheduled for all debtors who do not pay their fines and costs in full at their first appearance--the debtor must be given the opportunity to dispute the amount allegedly owed.\nAdditionally, the municipal-court judge is required to ask why the debtor has failed to pay in full, specifically asking whether the debtor “is able to pay [that day].” If, in response to the municipal court’s inquiry, the debtor indicates that she is unable to pay, the court will direct the debtor to a public defender and schedule an indigence/ability-to-pay hearing. Even if the debtor does not indicate an inability to pay, the court is prohibited from converting the debtor’s fines into a prison sentence without first conducting an indigence/ability-to-pay hearing.\nAt an indigence/ability-to-pay hearing, the court is required to make an express indigence/ability-to-pay determination, taking into account testimony, the debtor’s affidavit of substantial hardship, any other documents submitted by the debtor, and any additional information the court deems necessary. If, after questioning and the presentation of evidence, the court determines that the debtor is at or below 125 of the federal poverty level, the debtor will be presumed indigent and unable to pay the fines, court costs, and restitution previously levied, unless the debtor is found to have substantial liquid assets with which to pay the obligations. If the debtor is found to be above 125 of the federal poverty level, no such presumption of indigence will attach; the debtor will, however, still be afforded an opportunity to show the court that she is unable to pay, taking into consideration disposable income, liquid assets, and earning potential.\nIf, following the hearing, the debtor is determined to be indigent or otherwise unable to pay, the court will have the option of proposing a new payment plan guided by the debtor’s available financial resources, remitting the fines and costs, or ordering any other remedy deemed just and appropriate other than incarceration. Additionally, the court is required to provide the debtor the option of completing community service in lieu of making monetary payments. The court will be able to order the debtor to serve jail time only if the hearing results in an express finding of willful non-payment, that is, the debtor refuses to pay despite having the ability to pay.\nII. JOINT MOTION FOR ENTRY OF AGREED SETTLEMENT ORDER\nThe parties have submitted to this federal court the proposed judicial procedures as an exhibit to their joint motion for entry of agreed settlement order. In the joint motion, they request that the court issue certain declarations under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 addressing the proposed judicial procedures’ facial compliance with applicable federal and state law.\nFor each of these requested declarations, the court will now determine whether the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with federal and state law. It need not--and will not--determine whether the new procedures represent the minimum requirements under federal and state constitutional law or, instead, go beyond what is required.\nA. Declaration 1 The parties ask this federal court to declare that, under the current status of the law, the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), regarding incarceration for non-payment, and Turner v. Rogers, U.S. 131 S Ct. 2507 (2011), regarding notice, apply in municipal-court proceedings, and that, to the extent applicable in a particular case, the judges of the Montgomery Municipal Court are legally required to follow them.\nIt is uncontroverted that these cases apply to municipal-court proceedings. Both cases addressed state judicial proceedings, see Bearden, 461 U.S. at 662 (addressing Georgia state courts); Turner, U.S. at 131 S Ct. at 2512 (addressing South Carolina family court), and “[m]unicipalities are but subordinate departments of state government.” Alexander v. State ex rel. Carver, 274 Ala. 441, 443 (1963); see also Ysursa v. Pocatello Educ. Ass’n, 555 U.S. 353, 662 (2009) (“Political subdivisions of States... are subordinate governmental instrumentalities created by the State.”). As such, judges in municipal courts, like judges in state courts, must follow Bearden and Turner, and the judges in the Montgomery Municipal Court are no exception.2 B. Declaration 2 The parties next request this federal court to declare that the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the constitutional principles set out in Bearden, regarding incarceration for non-payment, and Turner, regarding notice. In Bearden, the Supreme Court held that, under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause, a trial court cannot “automatically revok[e] probation because [a] petitioner could not pay his fine, without\n2. The parties’ proposed order for declaratory relief specifically requests that “to the extent applicable in a particular case, the judges of the Montgomery Municipal Court are legally required to follow” Bearden and Turner Am. Joint Mot. for Entry of Agreed Settlement: Proposed Order (Doc No. 56-3) (emphasis added). This court reads the “extent applicable” phrase to mean only that the municipal judges are bound by these Supreme Court cases whenever an issue before the municipal court implicates them rather than implying exceptions for municipal judges in certain cases.\ndetermining that petitioner had not made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay or that adequate alternative forms of punishment did not exist.” 461 U.S. at 662.\nThis holding breaks down into a three-part process. First, a court must ask why a person could not pay a fine Id. at\n672. Second, if the person has the resources and willfully refuses to pay, the court may imprison her; if she does not have the resources, the court must ask whether she made bona-fide efforts to obtain the resources Id. Last, if she made bona-fide efforts, the court must consider if there are adequate alternative measures--such as giving more time to pay the fine, reducing the fine, or requiring labor or public service in lieu of the fine--that could satisfy the State’s interest in punishment and deterrence Id. at 672-673. “Only if alternate measures are not adequate to meet the State’s interests in punishment and deterrence may the court imprison a probationer who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay.” Id. at\n672. Indeed, “[t]o do otherwise would deprive the [debtor] of his constitutional freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he cannot pay a fine.” Id. at 672-73.\nTurner expanded on Bearden by defining an indigent person’s due-process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment when facing civil contempt. Turner, U.S. at 131 S Ct. at\n2512. Although the Supreme Court found that a State did not have to provide counsel, drawing a distinction between civil- and criminal-contempt proceedings, it held that a State should provide “substitute procedural safeguards” that, when “employed together, can significantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty.” Id. at 131 S Ct. at 2519 (internal citation omitted). These safeguards could include “(1) notice to the defendant that his ability to pay is a critical issue in the contempt proceedings; (2) the use of a form (or the equivalent) to elicit relevant financial information; (3) an opportunity at the hearing for the defendant to respond to statements and questions about his financial status... and (4) an express finding by the court that the defendant has the ability to pay.” Id.\nHere, the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the constitutional requirements outlined in Bearden. Under Bearden, a court may imprison a debtor only upon a finding of willful non-payment or when, despite the debtor making a bona-fide effort to pay, “alternative measures [of punishment] are not adequate to meet the State’s interests in punishment and deterrence.” 461 U.S. at\n672. The judicial procedures agreed to by the parties here conform to that standard, allowing a debtor to be imprisoned only if (1) the municipal court determines that the debtor had the ability to pay and (2) the court makes an express finding that the non-payment was willful.\nSimilarly, the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the due-process requirements provided for in Turner. Although the Sixth Amendment does not provide debtors facing incarceration a right to counsel during civil-contempt proceedings, the Due Process Clause does require several “substitute procedural safeguards” during these civil proceedings. Turner, U.S. at 131 S Ct. at\n2519. The judicial procedures offered by the parties incorporate all of the procedural safeguards discussed in Turner. Under the procedures, debtors are notified that an individual cannot be incarcerated solely due to an inability to pay; the court utilizes a form to elicit debtors’ financial information and debtors are afforded an opportunity to respond to questions regarding their financial capabilities; and the court is required to make an express finding regarding each debtor’s ability to pay. The judicial procedures then go a step further to safeguard against the “erroneous deprivation of liberty” and provide for public-defender representation at all indigence/ability-to-pay hearings for debtors facing the possibility of incarceration following non-payment.\nC. Declaration 3 Last, the parties request that this federal court declare that the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the requirements of the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, §§ 13, 64, and 225 of the Alabama Constitution, and Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.6\n3. Section 1 provides, “That all men are equally free and independent; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”\n4. Section 6 provides, “That in all criminal prosecutions, the accused has a right to be heard by himself and counsel, or either; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation; and to have a copy thereof; to be confronted by the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; to testify in all cases, in his own behalf, if he elects so to do; and, in all prosecutions by indictment, a speedy, public trial, by an impartial jury of (continued...) the county or district in which the offense was committed; and he shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law; but the legislature may, by a general law, provide for a change of venue at the instance of the defendant in all prosecutions by indictment, and such change of venue, on application of the defendant, may be heard and determined without the personal presence of the defendant so applying therefor; provided, that at the time of the application for the change of venue, the defendant is imprisoned in jail or some legal place of confinement.”\n5. Section 22 provides, “That no ex post facto law, nor any law, impairing the obligations of contracts, or making any irrevocable or exclusive grants of special privileges or immunities, shall be passed by the legislature; and every grant or franchise, privilege, or immunity shall forever remain subject to revocation, alteration, or amendment.” Ala Const\nArt. I, § 22.\n6. The relevant part of Rule 26.11 provides, (continued...) First, the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the Fourteenth Amendment. As discussed above, Bearden and Turner govern the application of the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause to civil-contempt proceedings for indigent parties, and the proposed judicial procedures meet the requirements set out in those two cases.\nSecond, the procedures facially comply with the Sixth Amendment.\nUnder the Sixth Amendment, an indigent defendant has the right to government-appointed counsel in criminal--but not civil--contempt proceedings. Turner, U.S. at \n131 S\nCt. at\n2516. The court, however, need not speak to the nature of the municipal proceedings in this case.\nBecause the parties’ proposed judicial procedures provide for the representation of all “In no case shall an indigent defendant be incarcerated for inability to pay a fine or court costs or restitution.” Ala R. Crim Proc. 26.11.\ndebtors during compliance and ability-to-pay hearings, they would comply with the Sixth Amendment.\nThird, the procedures facially comply with the due process, right to counsel, and any equal-protection principle embodied in Article I, §§ 1, 6, and 22 of the Alabama Constitution for the same reasons they comply with the United States Constitution. As to due process, “[t]he right to due process is guaranteed to the citizens of Alabama under the Alabama Constitution of 1901, Sections 6 and 13,” and it applies to both criminal and civil cases. Ross Neely Exp., Inc v. Alabama Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt., 437 So.\ndoes not afford a state agency any additional right to due process not found in the federal constitution.”) (citing Elliott v. Van Kleef, 830 So.2d 726, 730 (Ala. 2002)); Vest v. Vest, 978 So.\nSimilar to their interpretation of state due-process rights in light of federal due-process rights, Alabama courts have also frequently interpreted the Alabama Constitution’s right to counsel in light of the federal right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. See, e.g., Hill v. Bradford, 565 So.\nfines will be provided counsel under the proposed procedures, the procedures meet the right-to-counsel requirement under the Alabama Constitution.\nAs to equal protection, there is an open question whether Article I, §§ 1, 6, and 22 of the Alabama Constitution can be read together to establish an equal-protection principle. Hutchins v. DCH Reg’l Med. Ctr., 770 So.2d 49, 59 (Ala. 2000) (“The question whether §§ 1, 6, and 22 of Article I, Constitution of Alabama 1901, combine to guarantee the citizens of Alabama equal protection under the laws remains in dispute.”); see also Dyas v. City of Fairhope, 2010 WL 5477754 (S.D Ala. 2010) (Steele, C.J.) (analyzing past Alabama Supreme Court cases on the issue). Assuming arguendo that these clauses do combine for an equal-protection principle, the court finds that the proposed procedures meet this principle for the same reason the procedures fulfill the requirements of the federal Equal Protection Clause Cf. State v. Adams, 91 So.\nAlabama sex-offender law unconstitutional under the federal Equal Protection Clause and the state equal-protection principle because it deprived indigent and homeless, but not wealthy, offenders of liberty based on their poverty).\nLast, the procedures facially comply with the requirements of Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.11. The rule mandates that, “Incarceration shall not automatically follow the nonpayment of a fine or restitution.” Ala R. Crim P. 26.11. Indeed, a state court may not incarcerate an indigent defendant for the inability to pay a fine Id. To avoid this result, the state court may inquire into the defendant’s ability to pay, reduce the debt owed, modify the payment schedule, or release the defendant from the obligation altogether Id. The proposed judicial procedures (which require indigence/ability-to-pay hearings, guarantee of counsel, and exclusion of incarceration as a remedy for indigent defendants) facially conform to this rule.\n*** This federal court will, therefore, grant the parties’ joint motion for entry of agreed settlement order. An accompanying judgment will be entered.\nDONE, this the 17th day of November, 2014.\n/s/ Myron H. Thompson___ UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE""

Appealable Orders: Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction conferred and strictly limited by statute:\n(a) Appeals from final orders pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291: Only final orders and judgments of district courts, or final orders of bankruptcy courts which have been appealed to and fully resolved by a district court under 28 U.S.C.§ 158, generally are appealable. A final decision is one that “ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.” Pitney Bowes, Inc v. Mestre, 701 F.2d 1 365, 1 368 11th Ci r. 1 983). A magistrate judge’s report and recommendation is not final and appealable until judgment thereon is entered by a district court judge. 28 U.S.C. § 636(c).\n(b) In cases involving multiple parties or multiple claims, a judgment as to fewer than all parties or all claims is not a final, appealable decision unless the district court has certified the judgment for immediate review under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Williams v. Bishop, 732 F.2d 885, 885- 86 (11th Cir. 1984). A judg ment which resolves all issues except matters, such as attorneys’ fees and costs, that are collateral to the merits, is immediately appealable. Budinich v. Becton Dickinson Co., 486 U.S.196, 201, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 1721-22, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988); LaChance v. Duffy’s Draft House, Inc., 146 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir. 1998).\n(c) Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a): Appeals are permitted from orders “granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions...” and from “[i]nterlocutory decrees... determining the rights and liabilities of parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.” Interlocutory appeals from orders denying temporary restraining orders are not permitted.\n(d) Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) and Fed.R.App.P. 5: The certification specified in 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) must be obtained before a petition for permission to appeal is filed in the Court of Appeals. The district court’s denial of a motion for certification is not itself appealable.\n(e) Appeals pursuant to judicially created exceptions to the finality rule: Limited exceptions are discussed in cases including, but not limited to: Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949); Atlantic Fed Sav. Loan Ass’n v.

Time for Filing: The timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional. Rinaldo v. Corbett, 256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir. 2001). In civil cases, Fed.R.App.P. 4(a) and (c) set the following time limits:\n(a) Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1): A notice of appeal in compliance with the requirements set forth in Fed.R.App.P. 3 must be filed in the district court within 30 days after the entry of the order or judgment appealed from. However, if the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 60 days after such entry. THE NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED AND FILED IN THE DISTRICT COURT NO LATER THAN THE LAST DAY OF THE APPEAL PERIOD – no additional days are provided for mailing. Special filing provisions for inmates are discussed below.\n(b) Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(3): “If one party timely files a notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period ends later.” (c) Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4): If any party makes a timely motion in the district court under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of a type specified in this rule, the time for appeal for all parties runs from the date of entry of the order disposing of the last such timely filed motion.\n(d) Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(5) and 4(a)(6): Under certain limited circumstances, the district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal. Under Rule 4(a)(5), the time may be extended if a motion for an extension is filed within 30 days after expiration of the time otherwise provided to file a notice of appeal, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Under Rule 4(a)(6), the time may be extended if the district court finds upon motion that a party did not timely receive notice of the entry of the judgment or order, and that no party would be prejudiced by an extension.\n(e) Fed.R.App.P. 4(c): If an inmate confined to an institution files a notice of appeal in either a civil case or a criminal case, the notice of appeal is timely if it is deposited in the institution’s internal mail system on or before the last day for filing. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746 or a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.\n3. Format of the notice of appeal: Form 1, Appendix of Forms to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, is a suitable format. See also Fed.R.App.P. 3(c). A pro se notice of appeal must be signed by the appellant.\n4. Effect of a notice of appeal: A district court loses jurisdiction (authority) to act after the filing of a timely notice of appeal, except for actions in aid of appellate jurisdiction or to rule on a timely motion of the type specified in Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4).']",CJ-AL-0020,"[ENTITYCHAIN] August 28, 2013 | Montgomery Municipal | Circuit Court of Montgomery County | Alabama ||| Montgomery | Milton J.

Thompson | November 17, 2014 [SUMMARY] On August 28, 2013, an indigent detainee in the Montgomery Municipal Jail filed this lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama. The plaintiff sued the City of Montgomery and the Honorable Milton J. Westry under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The petitioner, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, requested the court quash the Municipal Court order requiring the petitioner to serve an imprisonment term of 54 days. Petitioner claimed that the Municipal Court order violated  Sixth Amendment, due process, and equal protection clause. The plaintiff was an indigent woman who accumulated $2,714.00 in fines and fees on traffic tickets that she received in 2008 and 2009. On August 20, 2013, the plaintiff was arrested and brought to the Montgomery Municipal Jail. The next day, the plaintiff appeared before Defendant Judge Westry, who told the plaintiff that she must pay $1,554.00 immediately or serve 31 days in jail. When the plaintiff informed Judge Westry that she would not be able to pay after only recently securing a part-time job, Judge Westry ordered the that her outstanding fines be converted into a term of imprisonment in the Montgomery Municipal Jail. Petitioner was not appointed a lawyer during the previously described court proceeding. 

After filing an emergency petition for writ of certiorari, the case was removed from state court to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama on October 4, 2013. On the same day, the petitioner filed an amended complaint, seeking declaratory relief.  Another indigent detainee filed a similar suit after he was taken into custody to serve a 54 day sentence for his inability to pay his traffic fees. Cleveland v. City of Montgomery, 2014 WL 6461900, at *1 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). On October 28, 2013,  the petitioner filed a motion to consolidate both cases. On November 12, 2013, petitioners amended their complaint and additionally sought injunctive relief.  Judge Mark E. Fuller granted the motion to consolidate both cases on November 14, 2013. 
 
Discovery began on December 23, 2013. During discovery, a similar case raising comparable claims,  Mitchell v. City of Montgomery, was filed. 2014 WL 6461900, at *1 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). The court in Mitchell v. City of Montgomery entered a preliminary injunction that ordered the City of Montgomery to submit a comprehensive set of judicial procedures to implement for the collection of future fines. On May 14, 2014, petitioners motioned to have limited participation in the Mitchell v. City of Montgomery hearing regarding the proposed judicial procedures. 2014 WL 6461900, at *2 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). On May 27, 2014, Judge Fuller granted the petitioners’ motion in part and denied it in part. Judge Fuller determined that the petitioners were only permitted to participate in the Mitchell hearings orally and through ancillary briefings to provide perspective on the legal sufficiency of the City’s proposed plan. Cleveland v. City of Montgomery, 300 F.R.D. 578, 581 (M.D. Ala. May 27, 2014). 

Following the petitioners' participation, all parties decided to engage in private mediation to create judicial procedures that would satisfy federal and state-law requirements. 2014 WL 6461900, at *2 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). On August 28, 2014, both parties submitted a joint motion to approve the proposed settlement agreement. In the initial agreement, both parties submitted an agreement to pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys fees and provide a list of basic premises and procedures that the Montgomery Municipal Court would abide by with regards to indigent defendants unable to pay any court-ordered monies, including fines, court costs, or restitution. The parties filed an amended joint motion for entry of agreed settlement order on September 12, 2014. The amended motion included a joint brief in support and requested that the court issue three declarations: <blockquote> (1) Under the current status of the law,  the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983), regarding incarceration for non-payment, and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S.Ct. 2507, 180 L.Ed.2d 452 (2011), regarding notice, apply in municipal-court proceedings, and that, to the extent applicable in a particular case, the judges of the Montgomery Municipal Court are legally required to follow them.
(2) that the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the constitutional principles set out in Bearden, regarding incarceration for non-payment, and Turner, regarding notice. In Bearden, the Supreme Court held that, under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause, a trial court cannot “automatically revok[e] probation because [a] petitioner could not pay his fine, without determining that petitioner had not made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay or that adequate alternative forms of punishment did not exist.” 461 U.S. at 662.
(3) the proposed judicial procedures facially comply with the requirements of the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution, §§ 13, 64, and 225 of the Alabama Constitution, and Rule 26.11 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. </blockquote>2014 WL 6461900, at *3-5 (M.D. Ala. Nov 17, 2014). Judge Myron H. Thompson submitted an opinion granting the parties’ joint motion for entry of agreed settlement order and subsequent final judgment on the docket on November 17, 2014. The case is closed.

The complaint was originally filed in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama and then transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, where it was consolidated with a similar case. In the amended complaint, petitioners alleged that the imprisonment orders violated their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. Petitioners sought remedy through injunctive and declaratory relief. In 2014, the parties reached a settlement that provided new judicial procedures for the Municipal Court to follow regarding indigent defendants and nonpayment. It also included three declarations, most importantly, it declared that the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S. Ct. 2507 (2011) applied to municipal court proceedings, and awarded plaintiff's attorney fees. The case closed in November 2014.

Nature of the Action This is a civil rights action brought under 42 U C. 1983 and the United States Constitution for violations and threatened violations of the rights of the Plaintiff to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, to be free from arbitrar and capricious Departent of Correction procedures and protocols in violation ofthe Fift and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and to be free from deliberate indifference ofthe Defendants toward Plaintiffs health and safety in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nPlaintiff, Terrck Terrell Nooner, is an Arkansas prison inmate who is under a sentence of death. By statute, Arkansas employs lethal injection as its method of execution. The Defendants and the Arkansas Deparment of Correction (hereinafter ""ADC"") have designed a procedure for carng out Arkansas\' statutory method of execution that purorts to induce death only after a condemned prisoner has been rendered unconscious and unable to experience pain. In reality, however, the policies and practices devised by the Defendants and the ADC unecessarly risk conscious suffering and extreme pain durng execution and deliberately ignore and are indifferent to the health and safety of condemed prisoners, in violation of Plaintiffs civil rights guaranteed by 42 U. C.\n1983 and the rights conferred by the Fift, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Plaintiff seeks equitable and injunctive relief. Ths lawsuit does not challenge the fact of the Plaintiffs sentence of death, nor does it challenge the constitutionality of Arkansas statute requiring execution by lethal injection II. Jurisdiction and Venue This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1331 (federal question); 1343 (civil rights violations); 2201 (declaratory relief); and 2202 (furter relief).\nVenue is proper under 28 U.S C. 1391(b)(1) and 1391 (b)(2) because all Defendants reside withn this distrct and a substantial portion of the events giving rise to this claim have occured and wil occur within this distrct as par of the offcial business of the Departent of Correction.\nIII. The Parties Plaintiff Terrck Terrell Nooner is a United States Citizen and resident of the State of Arkansas. He is curently a prisoner under the supervision of the Arkansas Deparent of Correction, ADC Number SK 926, awaiting the execution of a death sentence that was imposed by the Pulaski County Circuit Court in \n1993\nMr. Nooner is held in the Varer Supermax Unit of the Arkansas Deparent of Correction in Grady, Arkansas. Mr.\nNooner does not have a scheduled execution date; when an execution date is scheduled according to ADC policy, Mr. Nooner wil be transferred to the Cummins Unit, also in Grady, Arkansas. The execution wil take place at the Cummins Unit.\nDefendant Lar Norrs is the Director of the Arkansas Deparent of Correction.\nPursuant to state statute, Mr. Norrs determines the substances to be uniformly administered and the procedures to be used in any execution of an Arkansas prisoner and he and/or his assistants conduct each execution. Defendant Gaylon Lay is the Warden of the ADC Cumins Unit where the death chamber is located and Plaintiffs execution wil be cared out. Warden Lay is the head of the chain of command for control during each execution. Defendant Wendy Kelly is the Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs of the Arkansas Departent of Correction. Pursuant to established ADC procedure, the Deputy Director or her designee is responsible for obtaining the chemicals that are used to execute condemned prisoners and for establishing and maintaining intravenous access to the prisoner for the purose of administering the lethal injection.\n10. Defendant John Byus is the Administrator of Correctional Medical Services for the Arkansas Deparment of Correction.\n11. Defendants Unkown Executioners are the officers, agents, employees, and successors in offce, along with those acting in concert with them, of the Arkansas Deparent of Correction who wil assist in carng out the executions of Plaintiff. Plaintiff does not yet know the identities of the Unkown Executioners.\n12. Defendants are acting under color of State law in establishing and designng the ADC execution policies and protocol and wil act under color of State law in selecting and administering to Plaintiff chemicals in amounts, in combinations, and by methods that wil unnecessarly risk conscious suffering and pain in the execution of a sentence of death and which are deliberately indifferent to the health, welfare, and safety of Plaintiff VI. Statement of Facts\n13. Lethal injection has been promoted as a peaceful, dignfied and humane way to induce death, akin to euthanzing a pet a single injection, immediate unconsciousness, no strggling or movement, with death occurrng withn seconds. The reality in Arkansas however, is often quite different.\n14. Ronald Gene Simmons was executed by the State of Arkansas on June 25,\n1990. The administration ofthe lethal chemicals began at 9:02pm. Between 9:02 and 9:04pm according to an eyewitness, Mr. Simmons appeared to nod off into unconsciousness.\nHowever at 9:05pm he called out Oh! Oh!\' and began to cough sporadically as though he might be having difficulty breathing. During the next two minutes, he coughed slightly, approximately 20 times, each cough heaving his stomach slightly and causing the gurney to shake a little.""l Mr. Simmons became stil at 9:07pm, after which his face and arm turned first blue and then purple. An ADC employee twice appeared to adjust the tube in Mr. Simmons\' ar and not until 9:19pm was Mr. Simmons pronounced dead by the coroner.\n15. Rickey Ray Rector was put to death in Arkansas on January 24,\n1992. The execution ars took one hour and 9 minutes to complete, during which time Mr. Rector s hands and were punctured 10 separate times by ADC personnel searching for a suitable vein in which to place the ar. line and finally a deep incision, a ""cut-down was made in his The curtains between the execution chamber and the witness room remained closed during the 50 minutes it took to place the line, but witness heard Mr. Rector s loud moans as his skin was repeatedly pierced. Witnesses also heard the sound of skin slapping skin as ADC personnel apparently tred to raise a vein, prompting one witness to 1 Bil Simmons Stoic Murderer Meets His Fate by Quiet Means ARNSAS DEMOCRAT June 26, 1990, at 2 Sonja Clinesmith Moans Pierced Silence During Wait ARNSAS DEMOCRAT GAZETTE, January 26, 1992, at say (tJhey re going to beat him to death. ""\'3 Even once the line was secured and the curtains opened, the ordeal for Mr. Rector was not over. The flow oflethal chemicals began at 9:50pm, and for two minutes Mr. Rector looked to witnesses as though he was nodding off to sleep. However, one observer noted that Mr. Rector said I\'m getting dizzy,\'\'\' two minutes after the execution began. Then at 9:55pm Rector s lips moved rapidly as ifhe was drawing shallow breaths. His lips stopped moving a minute later.\nMr. Rector stil was not pronounced dead; at 1 0:06pm a witness noted that a heart monitor at the head of the guey appeared to be flat-lining, only to then see another jump"" and then ""another flutter.""6 Death was finally pronounced at 0:09pm.\n16. On May 7, 1992, Steven Douglas Hil was executed. His execution began at 9:02pm.\nHis eyes closed one minute later, but shortly afterwards he had what witnesses described 9:04pm and Mr. Hil was pronounced dead at 9:10pm.\n17.

When they could not do they asked Ms. Riggs if they could insert the catheters into her wrists, and she consented. The execution then proceeded. However, a minute after the drugs had purortedly begu to flow into her body, Ms. Riggs was stil vocalizing. Witnesses heard her say ""I love you, my babies.\n18. More of the 26 individuals who have been executed by lethal injection by the State of Arkansas may have suffered agonies during the execution procedure, while their suffering was hidden from observers by the total paralysis induced by the ADC\' s decision to use a neuromuscular blocking agent, namely Pancurium Bromide, as one of the chemicals administered during the procedure.\nSee Paragraphs 33- 42- infra incorporated by reference as if fully set fort herein.\n19. Unless modified, the policies and practices followed by the ADC, which are the same today as were used in the executions of Mr. Simmons, Mr. Rector, Mr. Hil and Ms.\nRiggs, wil unnecessarly place Plaintiff at risk of suffering the same excruciating, tortous death as was experienced by Mr. Simmons, Mr. Rector, Mr. Hil and Ms. Riggs.\nArkansas Lethal Injection Legislation\n20. In 1983 the Arkansas State Legislature enacted a statute prescribing that ""(tJhe punshment of death is to be administered by a continuous, intravenous injection of a lethal quantity of an ultra-short-acting barbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic agent until the defendant\'s death is pronounced according to accepted standards of medical practice."" Ark. Code An. 5- 617(a)(1). Ths legislation mandated g Cathy Frye Riggs, Mother who Kiled her Children, Put to Death by State ARNSAS DEMOCRAT GAZETTE, May 3 2000, at IB.\nexecution by this method for all defendants whose capital crimes were committed after\n21. The statute prescribes no specific drugs, dosages, drug combinations, maner of intravenous line access, or certifications, training, or licensure for those who participate in executions. All of the details for carrng out executions are left up to the Director of the \nADC\nArk. Code An. 9 5- 617(a)(2)(""The Director of the Deparment of Correction shall determine the substances to be uniformly administered and the procedures to be used in any execution How Executions Are Performed in Arkansas\n22. On information and belief, executions by lethal injection in Arkansas are performed in the following way:\n23. The condemned prisoner is strapped to a guey in the execution chamber. His head is completely immobilized by two pieces of plastic, which press against the sides of his face ars like bookends, and a tight leather strap across his forehead. His are spread at angles away from his body, and each hand is strapped to a board that protrdes from each side of the guey. A leather breastplate is held in place by a strap across his chest, straps ruing over each shoulder and a strap across his waist. Another strap rus across his thighs.\nFinally, leather shackles are placed around his anles and then fastened to the guey, immobilizing his lower legs.\nADC employees insert two intravenous lines into the condemned prisoner and attach an electrocardiogram monitor. The execution protocol states only that the Defendant Deputy Director of Health and Correctional Programs, or her designee shall have catheters placed in each arm or other appropriate areas."" This simple statement in actuality refers to a significant medical procedure that can be fraught with problems and complications. The typical site for obtaining intravenous access is the area ofthe antecubital fossae, or elbow folds. However, such access is not always obtainable and other, increasingly invasive procedures may be the only methods available. Despite this fact the execution protocol fails to provide any further guidance as to how intravenous access is to be secured. No procedures govern which insertion point wil be selected the circumstances under which an alternate insertion point wil be selected, which alternate site wil be selected or the qualifications of the person or persons who wil perform surgical procedures such as insertion of subclavian lines or cut-downs.\nWhen the lines are in place, the curtain across the window that divides the execution chamber from the witness room is lifted. A section of the IV lines is visible, and can be seen runnng from the condemned prisoner s body, draped across the floor ofthe chamber and passing through a hole in a glass window that leads to a separate control room where the two executioners wait. Extended lines are required in order to stretch into the control room. Last statements are made, and then the Warden orders the execution to begi.\n26. The two lay-executioners then begi attaching and plunging up to eight hand-held plastic syrnges in a complicated sequence prescribed by the ADC protocol. First one drug, then a saline flush, then two syrnges of the next drug, another saline flush, and then up to three syrnges of a third drug. It is not known who, if anyone, directs the sequence of drug administration for the executioners or how they divide the varous tasks between them.\n27. The drugs purortedly administered are: Thiopental (to cause unconsciousness); Pancuronium Bromide (to cause paralysis and to stop all movement including respiration); 10 and Potassium Chloride (to stop the hear).\n28. The putative drugs dosages are:\n2 g Thiopental; 10- 15cc Normal Saline; 50 mg Pancuronium Bromide; 50 mg Pancuronium Bromide; 10- 15cc Normal Saline; 50 meqs (miliequivalents) Potassium Chloride; 50 meqs Potassium Chloride; 50 meqs Potassium Chloride.\n29. When the prisoner no longer exhibits any signs of life, the Warden summons the coroner into the death chamber to pronounce death.\n30. Ths process recklessly subjects condemned prisoners to multiple signficant and utterly unnecessary risks that they wil be torted to death. The Risks of ADC\' s Chosen Lethal Injection Process\n31. The risks associated with the ADC\' s chosen execution process include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(a) First, in violation ofthe applicable medical standard of care regarding the use of painful drugs such as Potassium Chloride, the process fails to employ properly trained and skiled persons to carr out the necessar induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.\nThopental is also known as Sodium Pentothal or Sodium Thiopental and wil be referred to as Thiopental in this Complaint. 10 Pancuronium Bromide is also known by a trade name, Pavulon.\n(b) Second, the arrangement ofthe execution chamber, the condemned prisoner, the control room and all involved equipment is such that, even if properly trained persons were employed to induce and maintain an appropriate level of anesthesia, they would be physically unable to perform that function adequately. (c) Thrd, the process arbitrarly and unnecessarly uses drugs and drug dosages that create signficant risks that condemned prisoners wil suffer severe and completely unnecessar pain during execution.\nBecause the Drugs Selected by the Director to Cause Death Are Painful Qualified Persons Must be Employed to Create and Maintain IV Access to Ensure Adequate Anesthesia.\n32. The paricular drugs selected by the Director of the ADC to cause death in an execution by lethal injection cause severe physical pain when administered to the human body. When a concentrated dose of Potassium Chloride is injected intravenously it feels like a fire traveling through the vein to the heart. Death by Potassium Chloride poisoning is known to be so excruciating that the American Veternar Medical Association A VM"") prohibits the use of Potassium Chloride as the sole agent of euthanasia and, if it is to be used at all, mandates that it only be used after the subject has reached a surgical plane of anesthesia.\n33. Pancuronium Bromide is a neuromuscular blocking agent. When administered it paralyzes all voluntar muscles, including those necessar for breathing. Respiration is impossible. The drug in effect bures the recipient alive in a chemical tomb, where he is fully concious but unable to signal distress and unable to breathe, and eventually dies by asphyxiation. Death by asphyxiation involves intense, visceral pain and has, as a method of execution, been ruled unconstitutional as violative of the Eighth Amendment.\n34. The risks associated with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents are well known in the medical profession. The A VMA prohibits the use of neuromuscular blocking agents in combination with the barbiturate anesthetics on animals. Lethal injection can be humane only if an anesthetic is administered which induces unconsciousness before neuromuscular blockers stop respiration or Potassium Chloride is injected.\nAdministration of anesthesia requires proficiency at achieving and maintaining access, because the potential sources of error are many. For example:\n(a) catheters must be inserted such that the tip is inside a vein and does not penetrate through the vein wall into tissue. If a catheter is incorrectly placed, the drugs flowing through the lines can infitrate the tissue surounding the catheter rather than correctly entering the vein, thus impeding the delivery of the drug to the brain.\n(b) Once inserted, the catheters are connected with extensive tubing to fluid bags. All mechancal components of the system must operate correctly for the drugs to be correctly delivered, but errors commonly occur:\ntubing sometimes leaks or becomes disconnected, or the drugs are introduced to the system in the wrong direction, preventing the drugs in the line from reaching the patient in the intended concentrations, or from reaching the patient at all.\n(c) Upon information and belief, ADC employs unqualified persons to create access for executions. The protocol adopted by the Director states that the Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs, or her designee, shall insert the intravenous infusion device into the prisoner; the protocol has no requirements that such persons be trained to do so. Such persons are not competent administer drugs intravenously and are not expert in the process of inserting and maintaining catheters. Once the execution commences, no one monitors the catheters leaving open the possibility that disconnected or clogged during the process.\ncatheters can become loose (d) In the event that ADC employees cannot achieve access via a peripheral vein in a hand or ar, the ADC is wiling to create venous access through the invasive and painful processes of inserting a percutaneous central line (tunneling under the skin to reach the subclavian or central vein) or performing a surgical cut-down (where a vein is exposed by incision). Because these technques of venous access require much more skill and training and are far more invasive than peripheral vein access, they are normally performed only in highy equipped emergency rooms or operating theaters.\n(e) The ADC protocol fails to specify who has performed these procedures in the past (and there has been at least one subclavian central line and at least one cut- down performed) or who wil perform them in the futue, if necessar, and failed to guantee that those performing such procedures wil have the requisite training to protect condemed inates from unnecessar pain. Ths is especially risky given that it is not always possible to predict that there wil be difficulty obtaining peripheral access until attempts to establish such access are underway.\n(f) Arkansas uses two lay-executioners to attach and plunge eight handheld syrnges, labeled only by number, in a complicated sequence in order to deliver the deadly drugs. The use of untrained persons to label, attach and plunge syrnges risks error in the sequence and rate of drug administration. Potential line failures are also unguarded against because the executioners canot observe the site and monitor the condition of the catheter for problems that may develop such as infiltrations and blowouts and are not trained to interpret and react appropriately to signs such as pressure feedback on the lines.\nTraining and experience in drug administration are essential to ensuring that the execution is a humane process free from gratuitous and unnecessar pain. The ADC\' personnel and executioners are not properly trained to administer intravenous drugs.\nThe Particular Chemical Cocktail Chosen by the Director Creates an Unnecessary Risk of Conscious Suffering During Execution\n37. The Director of the ADC has arbitrarly selected thee drugs that, in the dosages combinations, and procedures used, unnecessarily risk subjecting the prisoner to an excruciatingly painful, tortous death.\n38. The first drug, Thopental, is an ultra-short acting barbituate which acts to depress the central nervous system to produce unconsciousness and anesthesia. Thiopental derives its utility in surgical procedures from its rapid onset and rapid redistribution through the body at surgical doses. Typically, Thiopental is used in the induction phase of anesthesia to temporarily anesthetize patients for suffcient time to, for example, intubate the trachea.\n39. If it is necessar to maintain a patient in a surgical plane of anesthesia for longer than just a few minutes, physicians tyically use drugs other than Thopental. If Thiopental is going to be used not only to induce, but also to maintain, a surgical plane of anesthesia, a qualified person must be present to continually monitor the patient to ensure that the Thiopental has been correctly administered and is maintaining the patient in a state of unconsciousness.\n40. The ADC protocol does not provide for any person, much less a properly trained individual, to monitor the plane of anesthesia during execution.\n41. The Director of the ADC has arbitrarly and needlessly selected a dose of Thiopental of only 2 grams. Other jursdictions in the United States typically employ considerably larger doses of Thiopental than are used in Arkansas. For example, California administers 5 grams of Thiopental. The lower the dose of Thiopental used, the greater the risk that errors in preparation or administration of the drug wil result in inadequate anesthesia. For example, if a problem arses and half of a 5 gram dose does not reach its target, the prisoner stil receives\n2. 5 grams, itself a large quantity. If, however, such an error occurs with the administration of a 2 gram dose, the prisoner receives only 1 gram a small enough quantity to risk consciousness in some condemned prisoners during the course of the execution. There is no legitimate reason for selecting a dose of Thiopental of only 2 grams.\n42. The second drug, Pancuronium Bromide, is a neuromuscular blocking agent. Neuromuscular blocking agents are used clinically to induce skeletal muscle relaxation for purposes such as facilitating tracheal intubation or suppressing spontaneous respiration.\n43. Neuromuscular blocking agents must be administered with great care and skil because they have no effect on consciousness or the ability to perceive pain. Moreover, the paralysis induced in the patient by the drug wil prevent anyone, even a person with advanced medical training, from ascertaining whether a patient is awake and capable of experiencing pain. Therefore, administration must be accompaned by adequate anesthesia.\n44. The effect of neuromuscular blocking agents in immobilizing patients and masking external indications of their pain is well known. Patients who have been adminstered neuromuscular blocking agents with inadequate anesthesia have been conscious during surgery and have reported terrfyng and tortous experiences where they were alert experiencing pain, yet utterly immobilized and unable to signal their distress.\n45. The consequences of erroneous administration of neuromuscular blocking agents is so profound that at least eighteen states have baned by statute the use of such drugs in the euthanasia of animals. The A VM never permits the use of neuromuscular blocking agents in combination with barbituate anesthetics on anmals. In short, the ADC has settled on a protocol and procedure to kil the State s condemned prisoners that is considered too risky and dangerous for the euthanasia of pets. There is no need to risk the conscious suffocation of these prisoners as a result of the administration of neuromuscular blocking agents. Other drugs are available to satisfy Arkansas\' statutory requirement for a ""paralytic agent"" that do not affect respiration. Using these alternate drugs would eliminate the risk that a condemned prisoner wil consciously asphyxiate.\n46. The third drug, Potassium Chloride, contains essential blood ions and is tyically administered medically in trace amounts as a necessar electrolyte. While a certain potassium level is important for normal cardiac electrcal activity, a rapid increase in blood concentration of potassium causes cardiac arrest. Injection of concentrated potassium activates sensory nerve fibers, causing severe pain as the drug travels though the venous system. There is universal medical agreement that, without anesthesia, an injection of a potassium chloride overdose would be excruciating.\n47. The American Veterinary Medical Association is so confident that death by Potassium Chloride wil cause unnecessar suffering that it prohibits its use as a euthanasia agent unless the practitioner administering the Potassium Chloride has the skil and training to assure that the subject to be euthanized has reached a surgical plane of anesthesia.\n48. The Arkansas statute does not require the administration of Potassium Chloride; the ADC has arbitrarly and needlessly added the drug to the protocol and it has thereby increased the risk that executions wil be agonizingly painful.\nThe Defendants and the ADC Knew, Or Should Have Known, That Their Procedure Involves the Risk of, and has Resulted In, Conscious Suffering, Yet Have Failed to Correct the Execution Protocol to Minimie That Risk\n49. The Defendants and the ADC knew, or should have known, that their execution process is flawed in ways that risk causing conscious suffering but they have deliberately ignored those risks and failed to make practicable modifications to the process. The Defendants and the ADC have, or should have been, aware since the commencement of executions by lethal injection that properly obtained and maintained access is essential to a humane procedure free from gratuitous, unnecessar pain, but they have nevertheless continued to employ unqualified personnel to perorm this crucial par of the procedure.\n50. The Defendants and the ADC knew, or should have known, since the commencement of executions by lethal injection that, in light of the painful drugs that the Director has opted to use, careful, skilled monitoring of the prisoner throughout the execution to ensure continued maintenance of a surgical plane of anesthesia is necessar to ensure a humane procedure free from gratuitous, unecessar pain. Nevertheless, the Defendants and the ADC have neither provided for such monitoring by adequately trained personnel, nor altered the design of the execution chamber and equipment to render adequate monitoring physically possible.\n51. The Defendants and the ADC knew, or should have known, since the commencement of executions by lethal injection that, drugs other than neuromuscular blocking agents or can serve the statutory requirement of paralytic agents without risking that the prisoner wil slowly, consciously asphyxiate and be unable to signal his distress, and that drugs other than the excruciating painful Potassium Chloride can be utilzed to induce cardiac arest. The Defendants and the ADC have nevertheless continued to employ these drugs notwithstanding their simultaneous failure to ensure adequate anesthesia..\n52. The Defendants and the ADC knew, or should have known, these facts because of the documented instances of botched executions that they have performed, including those of Rickey Ray Rector Ronald Gene Simmons, Steven Hil and Chrstina Riggs.\nSee Paragraphs 14- 17, supra incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. They knew, or should have know, of these facts because measured postmortem Thopental blood concentrations, in some past cases, canot be reconciled with consistent administration of Thopental and, in some cases, are inconsistent with antemortem unconsciousness. The sum of the available execution data witness reports, postmortem Thopental levels, execution duration, weight, and other data) indicates that the ADC protocol has resulted in a high frequency of failure to effectively anesthetize condemed prisoners for the duration of their executions.\n53. Botched executions involving unecessar conscious suffering are the inevitable result of a protocol cobbled together in secret by people who are not qualified to conduct what is essentially the surgical induction of anesthesia. The ADC protocol is flawed at nearly every turn in that it: (1) uses unqualified personnel to insert catheters; (2) uses dangerous and unecessar drugs like neuromuscular blockers) in a reckless manner; (3 fails to take steps to assure that a surgical plane of anesthesia and an actual state of unconsciousness are achieved and continue for the duration of the execution before administering painful drugs; and (4) administers a dose of Thiopental that is unnecessarly dangerously low.\n54. The consequence of the ADC protocol is that many people are suffering when they are executed in Arkansas. They are suffering for more that the transitory period necessarly attendant to any death. People are suffering for prolonged periods as result of completely avoidable problems in protocol and procedure. It is possible to conduct execution by lethal injection in a maner that both complies with Arkansas statute and is humane but the Defendants and the ADC have arbitrarly, capriciously, and unnecessarly devised a protocol for carng out executions by lethal injection that fails to do so.\nVII. Claims\n55. By subjecting Plaintiff to an arbitrar, capricious and irrational method of execution that creates an unecessar and signficant risk of inflicting agonizing and prolonged pain, and by designng and administering a process under which they wil inject Plaintiff with chemicals in amounts, combinations, and in accordance with a protocol that unecessarly risks conscious suffering and pain in the execution of a sentence of death, Defendants deprive Plaintiff of his rights under the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution to be free from cruel and unusual punshment and to be free from arbitrar and capricious processes.\n56. By subjecting Plaintiff to an arbitrar, capricious, and irrational method of execution that creates an unecessar and signficant risk of inflicting agonizing and prolonged pain Defendants, with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs serious medical needs, violate Plaintiffs right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and the unnecessar and wanton inflction of pain in violation of the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nVIII.\nPrayer for Relief\n57.

DEFENDANTS\nBRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS A. Exhaustion Terrick Nooner, filed his complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and he challenges the protocol used in Arkansas executions. Even if this is a cognizable claim under §1983, which defendants deny, I Nooner\'s complaint nevertheless must still be dismissed for the I There is currently pending before the United States Supreme Court, in the case of Hill v. McDonough, USSC 05-8794, the issue whether, under Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S.\n637 (2004), a challenge to a particular protocol the State plans to use during the execution process constitutes a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983. The resolution of this issue will have an immediate and potentially conclusive effect on the pending proceedings. Hill was orally argued on April 26, 2006, and, given the Supreme Court\'s usual practice and procedure, a decision will likely be rendered no later than June 26, 2006, the final day of the Court\'s current term.\nsimple reason that he has not exhausted his available state administrative remedies under the Arkansas Department of Correction\'s grievance procedure. In fact, he has not only failed to exhaust, he has also failed to even commence such proceedings.\nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Act) imposes limits on the scope and duration of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, including a requirement that, before issuing such relief, an inmate must exhaust available state administrative remedies before bringing a § 1983 action challenging the conditions of his confinement. 101 Stat.\n1321-74,42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.). Although the Act provides for injunctive relief, it also includes a requirement that, before issuing such relief, ""[a] court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on... the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief."" 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1); accord, § 3626(a)(2). In fact, the Act mandates that a district court ""shall,"" on its own motion, dismiss ""any action brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title... if the court is satisfied that the action is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."" § 1997e(c)(1). See also, Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004).\nNooner is required to provide proof that he exhausted all administrative remedies before he can bring a § 1983 action. ""Congress has mandated exhaustion,"" eliminating the courts\' discretion to excuse exhaustion. Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731 739, 741 (2001). See also Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516 (2002) (prisoners who claim denial of their federal rights while incarcerated must meet Section 1997e(a)\'s exhaustion requirement before commencing a civil rights action.) Likewise, the Eighth Circuit, discussing Booth and Porter, has held that administrative remedies must be exhausted before an inmate files a § 1983 action. Johnson v. Jones, 340 FJd 624, 627-628 (8th Cir. 2003). ""If exhaustion was not completed at the time of filing, dismissal is mandatory."" Id. at\n627. Further, the plaintiff is required to file ""a proper grievance against all defendants."" Jones v. Norris, 310 F.3d 610, 612 (8th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added).\nIt is clear that the United States Supreme Court has determined that a prisoner must exhaust his claims before filing a § 1983 lawsuit. As the Supreme Court explained in Porter, supra, the rationale for the exhaustion requirement is to allow prison officials the time and opportunity to review and address complaints internally before the prisoner is allowed to initiate a federal § 1983 claim. Porter at 524-25. In addition, the Eighth Circuit has held that when there is a failure to exhaust as to any claim set out in the complaint, the entire action must be dismissed. Graves v. Norris, 218 F.3d 884 (8th Cir. 2000). ""When mUltiple prison condition claims have been joined, as in this case, the plain language of § 1997e(a) requires that all available prison grievance remedies must be exhausted as to all of the claims."" Id. at\n884. ""The statute\'s [42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a)] requirements are clear: If administrative remedies are available, the prisoner must exhaust them."" Chelette v. Harris, et aI., 229 F.3d 684, 688 (8th Cir. 2000). Because Nooner has failed to exhaust his remedies, his complaint must be dismissed.\nB. Statute of Limitation Nooner was convicted and sentenced to die by lethal injection in\n1996. His direct appeal and post-conviction proceedings in state court were all concluded in 1999, and whatever stays of executions were entered in connection with those proceedings automatically terminated then. Rule 10(c) of the Arkansas Rules of Appellate Procedure Criminal provides for the dissolution of any stay upon affirmance on direct or postconviction review. No stay of execution was ever entered in connection with Nooner\'s federal habeas corpus proceedings, so Nooner has been the potential subject of execution since\n1999. Lastly, the Arkansas Department of Correction has used lethal injection in all executions performed since 1983 by law. See Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617.\nCongress did not prescribe a specific statute of limitation for actions brought under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983. The controlling limitation period for such an action is, therefore, the most appropriate one provided by state law. Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 462 (1975). In Arkansas, § 1983 claims are subject to the 3-year limitation found in Ark. Code Ann. § 16-56-105. See Weston v. Bachman, 282 F.2d 202 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 824 (1983); Whittle v. Wiseman, 463 F.2d 1128 (8th Cir. 1982). Since Nooner has know from the date of his death sentence in 1996 that he would be executed by lethal injection, defendants contend this current action is time barred by § 1983 \'s 3-year statute of limitations.\nEven if Arkansas\' 5-year statute of limitations under Ark. Code Ann. § 16-56-115 applied to Nooner\'s current action, that limitations period, too, had run long before Nooner filed his current § 1983 action. See Glasscoe v. Howell, 431 F.2d 863 (8th Cir. 1970) (action against Arkansas State Police officers for alleged deprivation of civil rights could be covered by either Arkansas\' 3-year or 5-year statute oflimitation).\nC. Laches As previously stated, lethal injection has been the method of execution in Arkansas since\n1983. Since 1983, the protocol used for executions has basically remained unchanged. Nooner has been under a sentence of death by lethal injection since his conviction ten years ago, and a total of sixteen executions have been carried out during those ten years. Nevertheless, Nooner waited until he had exhausted his state challenges to his sentence, including his post-conviction challenges, and one complete round of federal habeas2 before challenging the State\'s execution protocol.\nThe doctrine of laches precludes a lawsuit when a plaintiff is responsible for a unreasonable and unexcused delay in asserting his claim, resulting in prejudice to the defendant. Baker v. Baker, 951 F.2d 922, 980 (8th Cir. 1991); Goodman v. McDonnell Douglass Corporation, 606 F.2d 800, 804 (8th Cir. 1979); cert. denied, 446 U.S. 913 (1980). Whether the doctrine of laches should apply in a particular cause of action is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. Goodman, 606 F.2d at\n840. The equitable doctrine of laches should be used to reach ""a just result."" EEOC v. Liberty Loan Corp., 584 F.2d 853,856 (8th Cir. 1978), (citing Albemarle Paper Company v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405,424-25 (1975». In examining the unreasonable and unexcused delay prong of the laches standard, the court considers ""both the length of the delay and the plaintiffs reasons for the delay."" Whitfield v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 820 F.2d 243, 253 (8th Cir. 1987).\nNooner\'s delay in challenging the State\'s protocol is both unreasonable and unexcused. He had the means and reason to make this challenge ten years ago. The delay has also prejudiced the defendants in responding to various allegations. Nooner has provided select quotes from newspaper articles from alleged eyewitnesses to past executions as a means to support an otherwise unsupported opinion that the present 2 Nooner\'s petition for certiorari was pending before the United States Supreme Court when the current complaint was filed but certiorari has since been denied.\nprotocol might cause undo pain and suffering. Even if defendants could locate and produce eyewitnesses3 to and/or participants in past executions, the passage of time would make such testimony less than reliable, and therefore, less helpful to the court. ""[T]he \'eleventh hour\' tactic used by counsel in this matter is not consistent with a search for truth and justice."" Bolder v. Delo, 985 F.2d 941 (8th Cir. 1993).\nD. Successive Habeas Corpus Petition Nooner\'s complaint is a habeas corpus petition in every sense but name. This Court should dismiss the § 1983 complaint on the grounds that Nooner is attempting to circumvent the prohibition against successive habeas corpus petitions under Gomez v. United States District Court, 503 U.S. 653 (1992); Lomchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314 (1996) (interpreting Gomez to mean that ""habeas rules would apply even if a § 1983 [was] also a proper vehicle [for the] claim.""). ""Section 1983 must yield to the more specific federal habeas statute, with its attendant procedural and exhaustion requirements, where an inmate seeks injunctive relief challenging the fact of his conviction."" Nelson, 541 U.S. at\n643. Such claims fall within the ""core"" of habeas corpus and are, thus, not cognizable when brought pursuant to §\n1983. ld.\nFederal courts cannot allow prisoners to circumvent the limitation of28 U.S.C. § 2244(b) by attaching labels other than ""successive application"" to their pleadings. See Gonzalez v. Crosby, U.S. 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2647-48 (2005); Williams v. Hopkins, 135 F.3d 333, 336 (8th Cir. 1997) (relying on McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467 (1991) in holding that, regardless of this label, a last minute request for equitable relief is 3 Willis Sergeant and M D. Reed, the wardens who had direct supervision and responsibility for all but the two most recent executions in the past ten years, have both retired and are no longer employed by the Arkansas Department of Correction.\nthe functional equivalent of a habeas application. Challenges that have as their express goal to delay execution of that sentence, are in fact challenges that seek to interfere with the sentence itself, and thus, are properly construed as a petition for habeas corpus). In re Sapp, 118 FJd 460, 462 (8th Cir. 1997); Williams V Hopkins, 130 F.3d at 336; Felker v. Turpin, 101 F.3d 95, 96 (11 th Cir. 1996). The law is clear on this point; a district court simply cannot entertain a second or successive habeas petition in the first instant no matter how the petition may be styled. See Norris v. Nance, 429 F Jd 1194 (8th Cir. 2005) (order vacating a stay of execution and dismissing § 1983 application that constituted functional equivalent of a second or a successive habeas petition).\n/sl Joseph V.

Civil Action No. 5:06-cv-00110-SWW LARRY NORRIS, et al., Defendants \nRESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS\nOn May 1, 2006, Plaintiff, Terrick Terrell Nooner, initiated the instant action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the constitutionality of the lethal injection protocol selected and used by Defendants for executions in the State of Arkansas. On May 19, 2006, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss, [Document 131, and Brief in Support thereof, [Document 141, wherein they urge this Court to dismiss the action under Fed R. Civ P. 12(h). None of the four grounds upon which Defendants urge dismissal has merit, and the Motion should accordingly he denied.\nA motion to dismiss under Fed R. Civ P. 12(b) should he denied ""unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief."" Schmedding v. Tnemec Co., 187 F.3d 862, 864 (8th Cir. 1999). See also Mattes v. ABC Plastics Inc., 323 F.3d 695 (8th Cir. 2003). A complaint is to be construed liberally and in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, thereby rendering dismissal appropriate only ""in the unusual case in which a plaintiff includes allegations that show on the face of the complaint that there is some insuperable bar to relief."" Schmeddirzg, 187 F.3d at 864, (citing Branzlet v. Wilson, 495 F.2d 714, 716 (8th Cir. 1974)). Accordingly, a party seeking to dismiss a complaint under Fed R. Civ P. 12(b) bcars a heavy burden, one that the Dcfcndants here have failed to meet.\nI. DEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO MEET THEIR BURDEN OF PLEADING AND PROVING THE AFFlRMATIVE DEFENSE OF FAILURE TO EXHAUST ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES A. Defendants Have Failed To Plead, Much Less Prove, Facts Sufficient To Establish A Failure To Exhaust In their Motion and Brief in Support, Dcfendants first assert that Mr. Nooncr\'s Complaint should be dismissed based on an alleged failurc Lo comply with the requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (""PLRA""), 42 U.S.C. 5 1997e(a), that a prisoner cxhaust available administrative remedies bcfore filing suit in federal court. (Motion at 2; Brief at 1-3.) Defendants urge the Court to grant the Motion on this ground because Mr. Nooner ""is required to provide proof [sic] that he exhausted all administrative remedies before he can bring a 5 1983 action,"" and has not done so (Motion at 2.) To the contrary, failure to exhaust available administrative remedies under the PLRA is an affirmative defense under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c), and Defendanls have the burden of pleading and proving it. Foulk v. Charrier, 262 F.3d 687, 697 (8th Cir. 2001)(citing Massey v. Helman, 196 F.3d 727, 735 (7th Cir. 1999)).\' See also Nerness v. Johnson, 401 Since thc Eighth Circuit followed the Seventh Circuit in its dccision in Foulk in 200 1, its position has been adoptcd by a majority of the circuit courts of appeal who havc F.3d 874, 876 (8th Cir. 2005)(same). Bare and conclusory allcgations of lack of exhaustion are insufficient to mcet this burdcn. Wheeler v. Prince, 3 18 F.Supp.2d 767, 771 (E.D.Ark. 2004).\nDefendants\' submissions contain nothing but the broad, conclusory allegation that Mr. Nooner has failed to commence or completc proccedings under the Arkansas Department of Correction\'s grievance procedure. (Brief at 2.) It is important to note that the PLRA requires exhaustion of only thosc administrative remedies that are ""available"" to the plaintiff. See Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002)(""No such action shall be brought... until such administrative remedies as are available are cxhaustcd"")(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a)((emphasis added)). Defendants fail to plead any facts whatsoever to establish that there was an administrative remedy available to Mr. Nooner, either under the prison grievance procedure or otherwise, or to show the steps that Mr. Nooner was required, and supposedly failed, to take. See, e.g., Freenzaiz v. Snyder, 2001 W L 515258 (D.Del.)(denying motion for summary judgment on grounds of alleged non-exhaustion where defcndants failed to show that there was an actual administrative remedy available for plaintiff to exhaust).\nThis glaring omission is undoubtedly attributable to the fact that there indeed was addressed the question. See Anderson v. XYZ Correctional Health Services Inc., 407 F.3d 674, 677 (4th Cir. 2005); Wyatt v. Terhune, 3 15 F.3d 1108, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003); Casanova v. DuBois, 289 F.3d 142, 147 (1st Cir. 2002); Ray v. Kertes, 285 F.3d 287, 295 (3d Cir. 2002). Only the Tenth and Sixth Circuits have held that the plaintiff is responsible for pleading exhaustion. See Steele v Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 355 F.3d 1204, 1209 (10th Cir. 2003); Brown v. Toombs, 139 F.3d 1102, 1104 (6th Cir. 1998)(per curiam).\nno administrative procedure available to Mr. Nooner to seek redress of the claims that form the basis for the instant action. See Section I. B, infra. Regardless of the reason for thc inadequacy of the pleading, however, the deficiency precludes this Court from granting the Motion to Dismiss on the ground of failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the PLRA.\nB. There Was No Administrative Remedy Available to Mr. Nooner Because The ADC Inmate Grievance Procedure Lacks Authority To Provide Any Relief Or Take Any Action On His Claims a. Only the Director of the ADC Has the Authority to Change the Lethal Injection Protocol and H e I-Ias No Role in the ADC\'s Administrative Grievance Process There was in fact no administrative remedy available for Mr. Nooner\'s claims because the only individual who has the authority to alter the lethal injection protocol, the Director of the Department o f Corrections, takes no part in the A D C Inmate Grievance Procedure. As noted above, the PLRA requires exhaustion of such administrative remedies as are available to the prisoner. 42 U.S.C. 5 1997e(a) (1994 ed., Supp. V). The United States Supreme Court addressed the meaning of the phrase ""as are available"" under the PLRA in Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 736 (2001) Mr. Booth, a Pennsylvania prison inmate, filed a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983 seeking monetary damages for an incident involving excessive force by corrections officers Id. at\n734. The Pennsylvania prison\'s grievance procedure provided for review of claims of excessive force, but it had no policy for recovery of money damages Id\nMr. Booth argued that, because the grievance procedure was incapable of providing the monetary damages he sought, there was no administrative remedy available to exhaust Id. at 735 Before interpreting the meaning of availability in this context, the Court carefully framed the issue before it:\nThe meaning of the phrase ""administrative remedies... available"" is the crux of the case, and up to a point the parties approach it with agreement. Neither of them denies that some redress for a wrong is presupposed by the statute\'s requirement of an ""available"" ""remedy""; neither argues that exhaustion is required where the relevant administrative procedure lacks authority to provide any relief or to take any action whatsoever in response to a complaint. The dispute here, then, comes down to whether or not a remedial scheme is ""available"" where, as in Pennsylvania, the administrative process has authority to take some action in response to a complaint, but not the remedies action an inmate demands to the exclusion of all other forms of redress.\nId. at\n736. The Court recognized that a grievance system that affords the inmate no possibility of relief leaves the administrative officers with ""no authority to act on the subject of the complaint, leaving the inmate with nothing to exhaust."" Id. at n.4. See also Abney v. McGinnis, 380 F.3d 663, 667 (2d Cir. 2004)(""To be \'available\' under the PLRA, a remedy must afford \'the possibility of some relief for the action complained of""\')(citing Booth, 532 U S. at 738). Because the Pennsylvania prison\'s administrative process had authority to take at least some action in response to Mr. Booth\'s complaint, the Court held that a grievance procedure was, in fact, ""available"" to Mr. Booth for purposes of the PLRA\'s exhaustion requirement Id. at 739 Quite the opposite is true for Mr Nooner. The essence of Mr. Nooner\'s claims is that the particular method of execution by lethal injection that Defendants have adopted and propose to employ subjects him to a substantial risk of suffering excruciating pain and torture during his execution that is gratuitous and unnccessary in violation of the Constitution. Under Arkansas law, the only person who has thc authority to act on a complaint about the protocol and to order that changcs be made to it is Defcndant Larry Norris, Director of the Arkansas Department of Correction. See Ark. Code Ann. 5 5-4- 617(a)(2)(""The Director of the Department of Correction shall determine the substances to be uniformly administered and the procedures to be used in any execution""). The statute is unequivocal, and does not even permit the Director to delegate this function to a subordinate under his supervision.\nHowever, the Director has no role in the ADC Inmate Grievance Procedure, which is administered entirely by other ADC staff who have no such authority. The procedure, which is set forth in ADC Administrative Directive 04-01, has three steps: informal resolution, grievance to wardcn and finally appeal to the deputylassistant director of ADC. According to the Administrative Directive, ""[tlhe DeputyIAssistant Director will respond in writing to the inmate concerning the decision within 30 working days. This is the final level for the appeal process."" Id. at 9 IV.G.5. (emphasis added). The Directive goes on to state explicitly: ""The Director of the Department of Correction is not routinely involved in the Inmate Grievance Procedure. No appeals should be sent to the Director."" Id. (emphasis added).\nThe Administrative Directive notes that the Director may choose to intervene in the grievance process at his discretion, id., but there is no procedure for seeking redress from the Director for any complaints of any nature. Because there is no individual involved in any stage of the grievance process who has the lawful authority to respond to or provide any relief for his challenge to the ADC\'s lethal injection protocol, Mr. Nooner had no administrative remedy to exhaust. Booth, 532 U.S. at 736 n.4. See also Brown v. Crawfovd, 408 F.3d 1072, 1030-31 (8th Cir. 2005)(Byc, J., dissenting from denial of motion for stay of execution)(noting that plaintiff had no administrative remedy available to exhaust because director of department of corrections, the only person empowered to change lethal injection protocol, played only limited appellate role in prison grievance process).\nh Mr. Nooncr\'s execution under the lethal injection protocol chosen by the Director is an anticipated event and therefore is non-grievable by the ADC\'s Administrative Grievance Process If a plaintiff\'s complaint is deemcd ""non-grievablc"" and excluded from thc administrative grievance process on that basis, the plaintiff has no administrative remedy for the complaint and therefore nothing to exhaust under the PLRA. See, e.g., Fveenzan 1). Snyder, 2001 WL 5 15258 (D.Del.)(finding no administrative remedy available to plaintiff because his claims were non-grievable under the prison system); Mulliizs V. Snzitlz, 14 F.Supp.2d 1009, 1012 (E.D.Mich. 1998)(same); Torrence v. Pesaizti, 239 F.Supp.2d 230, 234 n.4 (D.Conn. 2003)(ordering further briefing and evidence on question of whether plaintiff\'s claim is a non-grievable issue under applicable Administrative Directive and thus had no remedies which may be exhausted); Mavtilz v. Crall, 2006 W L 515530 at *9 (W.D.Ky.)(noting that if issucs are designated non-grievablc, no grievance mechanism is available and there is no exhaustion barrier to filing suit) Mr. Nooner\'s objection to the Defendant\'s lethal injection protocol is just such a claim. The ADC Inmate Grievance Procedure provides inmates in its custody with a procedure for the resolution of ""complaints, needs, and other problems."" Ark. Dep\'t of Corr Admin. Directive 04-01 § I. (Feb. 1, 2004). The procedure is available to address a variety of prisoner complaints, but expressly excludes those issues designated as ""nongrievable matters"" from administrative review Id. at § activities which may occur in the future)."" Id. at 3 III.E.6.\nMr. Nooner\'s claim, that his execution in accordance with the unconstitutional lethal injection protocol selected by the Director will likely subject him to gratuitous pain and suffering, is a quintessential example of an ""anticipated event."" Mr. Nooner has not suffered any harm yet; rather, he seeks to prevent that harm before it occurs because he will obviously have no remedy or redress once his execution is underway. Thus there can bc little qucstion that Mr. Nooner\'s claim falls squarely into the category of anticipated events, thereby rcndering his complaint a non-gricvablc matter under Ark Dep\'t of Corr Admin. Directive 04-01 § III.E.6. The Department of Correction\'s grievance procedure is therefore unavailable to him for this reason, also, and so there is no requirement under the PLRA that he attempt to exhaust the procedure.\nC. There Was No Administrative Remedy Available to Mr. Nooner Because He Is Prevented From Appropriate Use of the Grievance Process By His Debilitating Mental Illness Even if the Inmate Grievance Procedure was generally available to A D C inmates to seck redress of claims regarding the lethal injection protocol, the Procedure is not available to Mr. Nooner becausc he is prevented from effcctivcly utilizing thc process by his severe mcntal illness and incompctence. One of the prominent symptoms of Mr. Nooner\'s mental illness is a fixed delusional system that prevents him from rccognizing the rcality of his own impending execution, much less comprehending that filing a prison grievance could be nccessary to avoid a tortuous and agonizing death Mr. Nooner\'s incompetence would thus excuse him from exhausting any otherwise availablc administrative mechanism.\nThe PLRA\'s phrase ""such administrative rcmedies as are available"" mcans those administrative remedies that are ""immediately utilizable"" by and ""accessible"" to the inmate. Days v. Johnson, 322 F.3d 863, 867 (5th Cir. 2003); accord Miller v. Novris, 247 F3d 736, 740 (8th Cir. 2001)(applying the same dictionary definition of the term ""available"" to interpret the PLRA\'s language ""as are availahle"")(citations omitted). In Days, a Texas prison inmate filed suit against prison officials under 42 U.S.C. 5 1983 prior to submitting a written complaint to the prison\'s gricvance officer. Days, 322 F.3d at\n866. The court found that a wrist injury prevented Mr. Days from filing a timely gricvance request, and gricvance officers wcre inattcntivc to his oral requcsts for rclicf, thereby rendering any gricvance procedure inaccessiblc to him Id. at 866-867. The Fifth Circuit recognized that ""one\'s personal inability to acccss the grievance system could render thc system unavailable"" for purposes of thc PLRA\'s exhaustion requircment Id. at 867 (citing Ferrington v. Louisiaiza Dep \'t of Correctioizs, 315 F.3d 529 (5th Cir. 2002)).\nGiven his illjury and his subsequent attempts to access the grievance process, the court held that Mr. Days had exhausted the administrative remedies that were available to him Id. at\n868. See also Pavey v. Conley, No. 05-2004, slip op. at 15-17 (7th Cir Fcb. 1, 2006)(where inmate\'s broken arm prevented him from completing grievance form and grievance officers were unwilling to provide assistance in the matter, administrative remedies were unavailable to the inmate and exhaustion was excused).\nHere, Mr. Nooner suffers from an disability much more severe than a broken wrist Mr. Nooner suffers from schizophrenia Dr. Xavier Amador, Ph.D, an adjunct professor of Clinical Psychology at Columbia University with extensive experience with individuals with schizophrenia, has concluded that Mr. Nooner meets the criteria for a diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Disorganized Type Mr. Nooner\'s most prominent symptoms are disordered thought and speech, and bizarre, fixed delusions. In 2002, at a hearing on Mr. Nooner\'s competency to waive his rights to federal habeas corpus review, Dr. Richart DeMeir, clinical psychologist at the Federal Bureau of Prisons Medical Center in Springfield, testificd that Mr. Nooner was mentally ill to the point of incompetency.2 According to Dr. DeMeir, Mr. Nooncr\'s disorder is characterized by severe thought disorder and fixed, long-standing delusions. H e manifested scvere disorganization of speech, which was rambling and illogical. His thoughts were irrational, rarely tied together in a way that could be understood. He was unable to provide any logical or rational explanation for his desire to waive his appeals, insisting that he does not want to die but wants to have his execution scheduled because he believes that this will lead to his exoneration by the clemency board. He exhibited numerous delusions that were so convoluted that Dr. DeMeir was unable to cxplain them Dr. DeMeir explained that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to feign such disordered speech; he did not know of anyone, even psychologists, who could successfully do so.\nMr. Nooner\'s delusions prevent him from understanding that his execution is imminent. They prevent him from realizing that he will die according to the Arkansas Department of Correction\'s lethal injection protocol, which creates a substantial and unnecessary risk that he will be fully conscious and in agonizing pain for the duration of the execution process. Sadly, the delusions prevent him from knowing that the Constitution provides a remedy for such cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly, Mr. Nooner is unable to utilize the prison\'s grievance procedure to seek redress of his claims, and no administrative remedy is availablc to him. C Miller, 247 F.3d at\n740. (where the allegations contained in prisoner\'s complaint averred that prison officials prevented him from utilizing the grievance process, administrative remedies were unavailable for purposes of the PLRA). Therefore, the PLRA\'s exhaustion requirement is inapplicable to Mr. Nooner.\nD\nMr. Nooner Has Substantially Complied With The PLRA\'s Exhaustion Requirement In light of the inability of anyone other than the Director of the ADC to provide redress for Mr. Nooner\'s claim, and Mr. Nooner\'s own inability to pursue the established Inmate Grievance Process, undersigned counsel undertook to inform the Director o f Mr. Nooner\'s claim and provide him with an opportunity to respond by contacting the Director on Mr. Nooner\'s behalf. These efforts have resulted in substantial compliance with the PLRA\'s administrative exhaustion requirement sufficient to satisfy the statutory provision. See Nyhuis v. Reno, 204 F.3d 65, 77-78 (3rd Cir. 2000)(""we note our understanding that compliance with the administrative remedy scheme will be satisfactory i f it is substantial"")(eiting Miller v. Tanner, 196 F.3d 1190, 1194 I 1 th Cis. 1999)); Freeman v. Snyder, 2001 W L 515258 at *8 (D.Del.)(findingthat plaintiff substantially complied with PLIIA\'s exhaustion requirement where he made repeated oral requests to be moved to a different cell prior to assault, receivcd conflicting information about the proper procedure, and was unable to timely file a grievance after the assault due to injury).\nOn April 21, 2006, undersigned counsel wrote to the Defendant Larry Norris, Director o f the Arkansas Department o f Correction, informing him o f Mr. Nooner\'s incompetence and his inability to use the inmate grievance procedure as a means o f protecting his legal interests. Counsel\'s letter advised the Director o f Ms. Nooner\'s claim that the current procedure for executions by lethal injection creates a substantial risk that Mr. Nooner will not be properly anesthetized for the duration o f his impending execution, thereby subjecting him to an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational method o f execution in violation o f the United States Constitution. A t the conclusion o f the letter, counsel requested that the Director modify the execution process to comply with accepted standards of medical care and relevant provisions of the Arkansas state statute. Counsel also provided a phone numbcr and address and invitcd Mr. Norris to call with any questions or requests for further information Mr. Norris accepted delivery of the letter from the Federal Express carrier on April 24, 2006.\nIn keeping with the Department of Correction\'s Administrative Directive, counsel should have received a response within three working days of receipt of the letter Ark. Dep\'t of Corr Admin. Directive 04-01 § IV.E.S.(declaring that inmates will receive a response to informal grievance rcquests within 3 working days or within 24 hours if the request qualifies as an emergency). However, after five working days had passed from Mr. Norris\'s receipt of the letter, undersigned counsel had still received no response. Counsel thcreafter filed the instant action on May I, 2006.\nfiling suit under \n42. U.S.C. 5\n1983. Undersigned counsel\'s effort satisficd thc concerns that lead to thc enactment of the PLRA, for the Director, the only person with authority to act on the complaint, was ""afforded... time and opportunity to addrcss [thc] complaint[] internally before... the initiation of a federal case."" Poiater 1). Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 525 (2002). Additionally, on May 26,2006, following commencement of the instant action, undersigned counscl finally received a response to her letter to Defendant Norris, in the form of a letter from Assistant Attorney General Joseph V. Svohoda, indicating that Defendant Director Norris received counsel\'s letter and asked the Attorney General to respond. The letter reads in relevant part:\nWhile Mr. Norris is aware that several states\' protocol has been, and some currently are, the subject of litigation, he believes the protocol used currently insures the necessary anesthetization for the duration of the execution procedure and satisfies Constitutional requirements. (Letter from Joseph Svoboda to Julie Brain, Dated May 25, 2006.) The quotcd passage indicates that Defendant Director Norris has considered the merits of Mr. Nooner\'s claim and rcsolvcd thc issue adversely to Mr Nooner. The only conccivablc avcnue for redrcss of the claim has thcreforc been exhausted \n11. BECAUSE MR. NOONER\'S EXECUTION HAS ONLY RECENTLY\nBECOME IMMINENT, NEITHER THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS NOR THE DOCTRINE OF LACHES BARS THIS ACTION Contrary to Defendants\' assertions, (Brief at 3-4), Mr. Nooner\'s claim is not subject to a statute of limitation because his Complaint seeks only declarative and injunctive relief. It is well settled that where, as here, a plaintiff seeks only equitable remedies, the plaintiff\'s claim is subject only to the doctrine of laches and not to a statute of limitations. Goodman v. McDoimell Douglas, 606 F.2d 800, 805 (8th Cir. 1979)(citing Holmbevg v. Avnzbrechf, 327 U.S. 392, 396 (1946)).\nunreasonable Id. In any event, it is clear under either a laches o r a statute of limitations analysis that Mr. Nooner diligently and timely prosecuted the instant action as soon as it became ripe for review.\nIn his Complaint, Mr. Nooner does not attack the constitutionality of execution by lethal injection in general, but rather objects to the specific procedure that thc Defendant Director of the Department of Correction currently uses to carry out executions by lethal injection Mr. Nooner could not know with any degree of confidence exactly which procedure he would be subject to until his execution became imminent, at which time the likelihood that the Defendants would suddenly changc their procedure and render his challenge moot became d e minimis. Under a statutory scheme such as that in place in Arkansas, which places the entire authority for determining the details of the lethal iujection protocol in the Director of the Department of Correction as an administrative matter, the precise drugs, dosages, combinations and procedures are subject to change at thc whim of the Director at any time. See Ark. Code Ann. 5 5-4-617(a)(2)(""The Director of the Department of Correction shall determine the substances to b e uniformly administered and the procedures to be used in any execution"").\nNot only is the protocol subject to change administratively, judicial action may potentially lead to dramatic changes in the procedures to which a condemned person is subject. See, e.g.,Morales v. Hiclcmarz, 415 F.Supp.2d 1037, 1047 (N.D Cal. 2006) (conditionally denying preliminary injunction if State will agree to change lethal injection protocol to one that uses barbiturates only or one that includes monitoring by person trained in general anesthesia); Bvown v. Beck, 445 F.3d 752, 753-54 (4th Cir. 2006)(Michael, J., dissenting)(describing district court\'s approval of change in North Carolina\'s lcthal injection protocol to include usc of bispcctral indcx monitor to monitor consciousness) Indeed, Arkansas\'s statute provides for automatic substitution of electrocution as the manner of execution in the event that lethal injection is deemed unconstitutional per sc, see Ark. Code Ann. S 5-4-617(b), and so not only the specific procedures but even the overall means of causing death is potentially subject to change. See also Fierro v. Gomez, 77 F.3d 301, 309 (9th Cir. 1996)(holding that California\'s practice of conducting executions by lethal gas violates Constitution; method of execution thereafter changed to lethal injection, see Cal. Penal Code Ann. §3604(b)(West Supp. 1996)).\nUnder such circumstances, a challenge to a particular execution protocol cannot be deemed ripe for adjudication until the plaintiff\'s execution is imminent. Cooey v. Tufi, 2006 WL 1207982 (S.D.Ohio)(\'""[T]he statute of limitations on claims raising specific challenges to a method of execution, but otherwise conceding that the execution can be carried out in a constitutional manner if the specific challenges arc addressed, begins to run when the execution bccomcs imminent and the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the facts giving rise to his specific challenges.\'... This Court has rcasoncd that those two conditions are met when the plaintiff has exhausted all of his state and fedcral avcnues of relief, i.e., when thc United Statcs Supreme Court denies certiorari in the plaintiff\'s habeas corpus proceedingsM)(quotingprevious order o f court) Such a rule is consistent with established fcdcral law governing accrual of claims for relief. See, e.g., Slaaten v. Uttited States, 990 F.2d 1038 (8th Cir. 1993)(""A claim \'accrues\' when the plaintiff knows or reasonably should know both the existencc and cause of the injuryV)(citingUnited States v. Kubviclc, 444 U.S. 11 I 121-23 (1979)). Indeed, a contrary rule would potentially lead to multiplc challenges to multiple methods and procedures over many years, none of which the plaintiff would ultimately be subjected to, in order to cnsure that the true claim is timely. Such unncccssary and pointless consumption of judicial rcsourccs is contrary to ends of justicc.\nThe imminence of Mr. Nooner\'s execution was realized April 26, 2006, whcn Mr. Nooner\'s pctition for writ of certiorari was scheduled for conference by thc United States Suprcme Court for May 11,\n2006. Counsel for Mr. Nooner reasonably predicted that the writ of certiorari would be denied May 15,2006, and as a rcsult, counscl immediately began final preparation of the Complaint in the instant case. On May 1,2006, counsel filed the instant suit to prevent Mr. Nooner from being subject to the unconstitutional execution procedures currently in place at the Arkansas Department of Corrcction. Thc action was thus initiated even before certiorari was actually denied, which occurred as anticipated on May 15,\n2006. Far from an 11th hour attempt to manipulate and abuse the system, thcn, the instant action is a good-faith effort to movc as promptly and expeditiously as possible to protect Mr. Nooner\'s constitutional rights \n111\nMR. NOONER\'S CLAIM IS PROPERLY BROUGHT UNDER\n42 U.S.C. 5 1983 AND IS NOT THE EQUIVALENT OF A\nPETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\nMr. Nooner\'s Complaint does not challenge the legality of his conviction or sentcncc, nor does it seek to prcvcnt thc statc from executing him in a lawful manncr Mr. Nooncr\'s challenge to the mcthod of execution to which the Defendants\' intcnd to subject him is thus indistinguishable from the challenge that the Supreme Court deemed to be proper under 42 U.S.C. 5 1983 in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004). In Nelson, the Court distinguished between a challenge to the fact of a conviction or the duration of a sentence, which properly sounds in habeas corpus, and a claim relating solely to conditions of confinement, which is an appropriate basis for a 1983 action.\nId. at \n643\nMr. Nelson\'s claim fell into the latter catcgory, thc Court found, bccause it challenged the particular execution proccdurc chosen by the defendants, namely a ""cut- down."" Id. at 644.) That particular method was unnecessary, for it was not mandated by the applicable state statute and, as Mr. Nelson conceded, other, constitutional mcthods were available Id. at\n645. Because the Defendants could go forward with the execution notwithstanding the plaintiff\'s claim simply by altering their method of causing death, the suit did not necessarily imply the invalidity of the plaintiff\'s sentence and was thercfore The Supreme Court was thus not required to decide the broader question of whether a challenge to a particular categoty of execution methods, such as lethal injection per se or electrocution, similarly was available under 5 1983 and not required lo be brought in habeas. Id.\nat\n644. That question need not detain this Court either, given that Mr. Nooner\'s claim also challenges only the particular procedure chosen and does not allege that lethal injection per se is unconstitutional. However, if the Court were inclined to rule adversely to Mr. Nooner on this point it would be appropriate to first await the issuance of the Supreme Court\'s opinion in Hill v. Crosby, 126 S.Ct. 1189 (2006), due to be dccided prior to the conclusion of the Term on June 30, 2006, in which the Supreme Court is expectcd to decide the larger issue.

Likewise, Mr. Nooner\'s claim that the particular combination of drugs, dosages and conditions of administration prescribed or overlooked by the protocol chosen by Defendants and set forth in Administrative Directive 96-06 is properly brought undcr 5\n1983. The Arkansas state statute requires only that death be caused by ""a continuous intravenous injection of a lethal quantity of an ultra-short-acting barbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic agent."" Ark. Code Ann. 5 5-4-617(a)(l). All decisions regarding the particular drugs that will bc chosen, the dosages in which they will be administered and the procedures and conditions under which they will be introduced into the prisoner\'s vein are expressly the responsibility of Defendant Norris Ark. Code Ann. 5-4-617(a)(2)(""The Director of the Department of Correction shall determine the substances to be uniformly administered and the procedures to be used in any execution"").\nPlaintiff has expressly alleged that alternative methods of causing death by lethal injection, which do not engender foresecable, utterly unnecessary risks of gratuitous pain and suffering, arc available. Accordingly, Defendants remain able to proceed with the execution by alternative, humane means. The instant action seeks only to prohibit the execution of Mr. Nooner in accordance with the current protocol, under which he is subject to exactly those unconstitutional risks.

Civil Action No. 5:06-cv-00110-SWW-JFF LARRY NORRIS, et al., Defendants.\nAPPLICATION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION Plaintiff, Don William Davis, is under a sentence of death Mr. Davis moved to intervene in the instant action on May 4, 2006, and the Court granted the Motion on May 26,\n2006. In the interim, on May 11, 2006, the Governor of the State of Arkansas scheduled Mr. Davis’ execution to take place on July 5, \n2006\nMr. Davis seeks preliminary injunctive relief to prevent Defendants from executing him by their proposed means of lethal injection pending the resolution of this action Mr. Davis alleges that the Arkansas Department of Correction’s lethal injection protocol, as described in Administrative Directive 96-06, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it creates a substantial and unnecessary risk that Mr. Davis will be fully conscious and in agonizing pain for the duration of the execution process This application for a preliminary injunction is made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, and Mr. Davis is entitled to the relief he seeks under Eighth Circuit precedent. Mr.\nDavis will sustain irreparable harm if injunctive relief is not granted preventing the Defendants from conducting his execution in accordance with Administrative Directive 96-06 Mr. Davis is likely to prevail on the merits of the underlying action and the balance of hardships weighs decidedly in his favor. This application is based on the Complaint, the following memorandum of points and authorities and the attached exhibits, including the declaration of Dr. Mark Heath which sets forth the specific deficiencies in the Defendants’ lethal injection protocol \nI. INTRODUCTION\nDon William Davis, a death row inmate, is scheduled to be executed by the Arkansas Department of Correction by means of lethal injection. A rapidly growing body of evidence, including medical evidence, eyewitness observation and veterinary studies, persuasively demonstrates that the particular lethal injection protocol chosen by Defendant Norris risks, and has repeatedly resulted in, inmates failing to receive adequate anesthesia and remaining conscious during the administration of the lethal drugs. Without adequate anesthesia, the inmate experiences first slow suffocation and then the extraordinarily painful activation of the sensory nerve fibers in the walls of the veins that is caused by potassium chloride. Given the significant danger under the current protocol that he will be subjected to this excruciating pain and torture, Mr. Davis seeks to prevent the Defendants from executing him in this manner.\nAdministrative Directive 96-06 calls for the use of three drugs in succession: first, Sodium Pentothal, an ultrashort-acting barbiturate that under ideal conditions will cause the inmate to lose consciousness; second, Pancuronium Bromide, a neuromuscular blocking agent that paralyzes the muscles and has no apparent purpose other than to make the execution appear peaceful to witnesses; and finally, Potassium Chloride, which induces cardiac arrest.\nAdministrative Directive 96-06 also establishes the conditions under which these drugs are administered. It directs that specified dosages of the drugs be administered remotely, in the absence of trained personnel and with no monitoring of the inmate’s condition once the procedure is underway. The combination of using these particular drugs, in these dosages and under these conditions, creates a serious risk that the drugs, particularly the critically important Sodium Pentothal, will not be properly administered. Administration errors could result, and demonstrably have resulted, in inmates retaining consciousness and suffering severe pain and torture during their executions.\nThus, Mr. Davis’s suit is not premised on the possibility that some unforeseen error or unavoidable accident might cause him to be aware and in excruciating pain during his execution. Nor does he claim that execution by lethal injection is unconstitutional per se, regardless of the manner in which it is accomplished. On the contrary, he alleges that the significant risk of a botched and inhumane execution is an entirely foreseeable consequence of the particular conditions unnecessarily imposed by, and the failings of, Administrative Directive 96-06. It is surely unconstitutional for the State to choose an execution protocol that creates a significant risk of inflicting gratuitous suffering and excruciating pain Mr. Davis therefore requests that the Court enjoin the Defendants from executing him by means of lethal injection as it is currently administered under Administrative Directive 96-06 \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nIn 1992, Don William Davis was convicted in the Circuit Court of Benton County, Arkansas, of Capital Murder, Burglary and Theft of Property in connection with the October 12, 1990, shooting death of Jane Daniel at her home in Rogers. The jury thereafter sentenced Mr.\nDavis to death. The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentence on direct appeal in 1993, see Davis v. State, 863 S.W.2d 259 (Ark. 1995), and affirmed the denial of state post-conviction relief in 2001, see Davis v. State, 44 S.W.3d 726 (Ark. 2001).\nMr. Davis filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas on April 1,\n2002. Chief Judge Jimm Larry Hendren denied the petition in full on January 28, 2004, and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed on September 14,\n2005. See Davis v. Norris, 423 F.3d 868 (8th Cir. 2005). The Supreme Court denied Mr. Davis’ motion for permission to file a petition for certiorari out of time on April 17, 2006.\nPlaintiff Terrick Terrell Nooner filed the Complaint in the instant action on May 1, \n2006\nMr. Davis thereafter moved to intervene as a plaintiff on May 4,\n2006. While that Motion was pending before this Court, on May 11, 2006, Governor Mike Huckabee announced that he had scheduled Mr. Davis’s execution for July 5,\n2006. The Court granted leave for Mr. Davis to intervene on May 26, 2006.\nCurrently pending before this Court is Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, filed on May 19,\n2006. Plaintiffs filed their Response in Opposition to that Motion on June 2, \n2006\nIII. ARGUMENT\nIn moving for a preliminary injunction, Mr. Davis seeks only to preserve the status quo while he litigates his constitutional claims Mr. Nooner and Mr. Davis are both likely to succeed on the merits of this action, and Mr. Davis will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of temporary relief. It is also in the public interest to grant temporary relief because doing so will allow the important question of the constitutionality of Administrative Directive 96-06 to be fully and accurately resolved on the merits and will avoid an inhumane, unconstitutional execution. This action was timely brought and the balance of equities so favors Mr. Davis that both justice and controlling precedent require that the Court preserve the status quo until the merits of the matter can be determined.\nA. THE LEGAL STANDARD In order to decide whether a preliminary injunction is appropriate, the Court must consider “(1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of balance between this harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other parties litigant; (3) the probability that movant will succeed on the merits; and (4) the public interest.” Dataphase Systems, Inc v. C L Systems, Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981)(en banc). The necessary showing of likelihood of success depends upon the balance of threatened harms; accordingly, “where the movant has raised a substantial question and the equities are otherwise strongly in his favor, the showing of success on the merits can be less.” Id. at\n113. In the context of a capital case, where the movant is under a death sentence and the issuance of a preliminary injunction will have the effect of delaying a scheduled execution, the Court must also take into account any unnecessary delay on the part of the prisoner in bringing his claim. Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649-650 (2004); Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. (2006). The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals performed this weighing of the equities in the functionally identical case of Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095, 1097 (8th Cir. 2006). See also Taylor v. Crawford, No. 06-1397 (8th Cir. February 1, 2006)(en banc)(Order granting stay of execution). Plaintiff Taylor filed an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 challenging Missouri’s lethal injection protocol on substantially the same grounds that Mr. Davis has challenged Arkansas’ procedure. See Taylor, 445 F.3d at\n1096. As here, while the action was pending the state scheduled Mr. Taylor’s execution Id. at\n1097. The district court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the execution from proceeding before the merits of the action had been determined Id. A panel of the Eighth Circuit initially reversed and ordered that an immediate, truncated hearing be conducted to allow the execution to proceed on schedule, id., but on the subsequent appeal the en banc court granted rehearing and stayed Mr. Taylor’s execution, id. at 1098.\nUpon reconsideration the panel affirmatively acknowledged that the plaintiff’s interest in having an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his claims prior to his execution was “equally [as] strong” as the State’s interest in the prompt execution of its judgment Id. at\n1096. The court inquired of the parties how much time they would need to complete the discovery and evidentiary hearing that had previously begun, and ultimately granted the 60 days that plaintiff’s counsel requested Id. at\n1098. This decision, then, stands for the proposition that a plaintiff who timely files a properly-pled \nB. PLAINTIFF IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS\n1. Plaintiff’s Claim Is Cognizable Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 The Complaint does not challenge the legality of Mr. Davis’ conviction or sentence, nor does it seek to prevent the state from executing him by lethal injection in a lawful manner. Any doubt that Mr. Davis’ claim is therefore properly brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 was removed this morning by the United States Supreme Court which announced its decision in Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. (2006). In accordance with its previous opinion in Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004), the Court held that a claim challenging a method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment that “would not necessarily prevent the State from executing him by lethal injection,” is proper under § 1983 and need not be brought in habeas. Hill, Slip Op. at\n5. As is clear from the Complaint, the instant lawsuit is just such an action Mr. Davis and Mr. Nooner have specifically alleged that there are readily available alternative methods of execution by lethal injection that would both comport with state law and pass constitutional muster. They bring this action simply to ensure that they are put to death in a humane manner.\n2. Arkansas’ Lethal Injection Protocol Violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments Because it Carries a Tremendous Risk of Unnecessary Pain During Executions The Eighth Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the imposition of cruel and unusual punishments. U.S Const. Amend VIII. The prohibition includes the “infliction of unnecessary pain in the execution of the death sentence.” Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 463 (1974); see also Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 173 (1976)(holding that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain”).\nBecause it is impossible to determine with certainty before the fact whether a particular inmate will suffer unnecessary pain during his execution, the question of whether a particular execution procedure will inflict unnecessary pain is fundamentally an inquiry as to whether the inmate is “subject to an unnecessary risk of unconstitutional pain or suffering.” Cooper v. Rimmer, 379 F.3d 1029, 1033 (9th Cir. 2004)(emphasis added); Fierro v. Gomez, 77 F.\nOf course, any medical or quasi-medical procedure inherently carries a risk that a mistake or accident might cause unforeseen pain. Thus, the Eighth Amendment does not require executioners to eliminate all possible risk of pain or accident from their execution protocols. See Resweber, 329 U.S. at 464; Campbell, 18 F.3d at\n687. A risk of pain becomes unnecessary, however and unconstitutional when experience with the execution procedure demonstrates that there are foreseeable problems that will result in the inmate suffering intense pain that alternative procedures do not engender.\nThe assessment of the risks associated with a particular procedure is not static. Over time, our knowledge of the workings of the human body increases, technology advances, new information comes to light and old information is more thoroughly understood and interpreted. Accordingly, methods of execution are developed, refined and abandoned. Execution by hanging, firing squad, gas chamber and electric chair, once standard, have all become virtually obsolete with the passage of time. If a State opts to utilize capital punishment, the a. The Protocol Is Old And Was Ill-Conceived At The Outset Legislation directing a change in the method of execution from electrocution to lethal injection was passed in Arkansas in\n1983. As it does to this day, the statute left all decisions regarding the particular chemicals to be injected and the administration procedures to be employed to the discretion of the Director of the Department of Correction. See Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617(a)(1983). The legislation originally proposed contained a provision directing the Director of the Department of Correction to consult with the State Medical and Pharmacy Boards before making the determination of which substances should be administered and what procedures should be followed. See Doug Smith, Pharmacy College’s Dean Resents Role in Execution Thrust Unasked on School, ARKANSAS GAZETTE, March 5, 1983, at as the consulting Agency Id. The legislation containing this provision passed, but the College of Pharmacy was outraged. Dean Larry D. Milne was vocal in his opposition to involving his institution in the execution process, id., and virtually the entire faculty signed a petition objecting to the legislation, see May Not Sign Injection Bill, Clinton Says, ARKANSAS GAZETTE, March 12, 1983, at Similarly, the Texas protocol upon which the Arkansas procedure was apparently modeled was designed by lay corrections officials with no medical knowledge. Louisiana is another state that looked to Texas when it came time to figure out how to execute someone by lethal injection. When the chief legal counsel of the Louisiana Department of Corrections consulted with the warden of the Texas Department of Corrections responsible for executions about the “medical portion” of the Texas protocol, she was told:\n‘[T]hat the only thing that mattered was that the guy ended up dead and that he wasn’t worried too much about the amount of medicine. He had certainly used the same types of medicine, but that he wasn’t totally concerned about the amounts or what it may or may not do. They ended up dead, and that’s all he was worried about. The rest of our conversation with him tracked that same thing. He was not terribly concerned about policy, procedure, or who did what, when, where. Just so the right result happened.’ So Long as They Die: Lethal Injections in the United States, 18 Human Rights Watch 1(G) at 1617 (2006)(Exhibit 6). The Department of Correction has used the protocol adopted in this ad hoc, unscientific manner for all executions by lethal injection conducted in Arkansas, and still uses that same procedure. See Motion to Dismiss at 4 [Document 13](“Since 1983, the protocol used for executions has basically remained unchanged”).\nb. The Protocol Arbitrarily Selects Painful Drugs And Fails To Ensure Adequate Anesthesia During Their Administration As noted above, the Arkansas lethal injection statute, Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617, requires only that the chemicals administered to cause death include an ultra-short-acting barbiturate and a chemical paralytic agent. The choice of drugs and drug dosages is made by Defendant Norris Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617(a)(2)(“The Director of the Department of Correction shall determine the substances to be uniformly administered and the procedures to be used in any execution”). The drugs and dosages chosen by Defendant Norris, in order of administration, are as follows:\n1. 2 g Sodium Pentothal;\n2. 10-15cc Normal Saline;\n3. 50 mg Pancuronium Bromide;\n4. 50 mg Pancuronium Bromide;\n5. 10-15cc Normal Saline;\n6. 50 meqs (milliequivalents) Potassium Chloride;\n7. 50 meqs Potassium Chloride;\n8. 50 meqs Potassium Chloride. ADC Administrative Directive 96-06 (Exhibit 1). The first drug, Sodium Pentothal, is an anesthetic, intended to rapidly induce unconsciousness. The second active drug, Pancuronium Bromide, is a neuromuscular blocking agent that causes complete paralysis. Finally, Potassium Chloride is introduced to cause cardiac arrest. Potassium Chloride is a salt that naturally occurs in trace amounts in the human body. In large quantities, however, such as the 100 meqs called for by Administrative Directive 96-06, it not only causes the heart to stop beating but also causes excruciating pain as it travels through the circulatory system. The drug activates the sensory nerve fibers of the insides of the veins as it courses through the body from the injection site to the heart, causing a sensation that has been likened to fire scorching along the vessels. See Exhibit 7 at 12 (Declaration of Dr. Mark Heath). The neuromuscular blocking agent Pancuronium Bromide stops all movement, including that necessary to breathe. The drug has no effect, however, on consciousness or the ability to perceive pain. If a prisoner is conscious when this drug is administered, he will feel the visceral pain and distress of slow suffocation, much like as if he were drowning or being crushed to death Id. at\n15. Having made the choice to administer two drugs that cause excruciating pain and agony, a choice that was not required by either statute or practical considerations, the ADC can fulfill its responsibility under the only if it ensures that the prisoner is adequately anesthetized at the time that those drugs are administered. In order to ensure that the prisoner does not feel pain a surgical plane of anesthesia, or that level of anesthesia that prevents conscious perception of noxious stimuli of the magnitude of surgical procedures, must be achieved and maintained throughout the execution procedure. However, the drug that the ADC has chosen to induce anesthesia, administered in accordance with the procedures under which the ADC has chosen to administer it, is an exceedingly inferior choice for the task and fails to provide the necessary assurance of adequate anesthesia.\ni. Sodium Pentothal is an Ultra-Short-Acting Barbiturate Unsuitable for use as Sole Anesthetic Agent for Executions, Especially in the Dose Used by the ADC Sodium Pentothal is an ultra-short-acting barbiturate that is used for certain specific purposes in surgical anesthesia. Its effect has a rapid onset and then a rapid recovery; the patient becomes unconscious very quickly after the drug is introduced, and the effects begin to wear off very soon thereafter. Sodium Pentothal is therefore ideal for the provision of anesthesia during intubation at the beginning of surgery, for example, because it induces deep anesthesia rapidly but if there are problems with the intubation the patient will regain consciousness and the ability to breathe independently very quickly. See Exhibit 7 at 24-25 (Declaration of Dr. Heath).\nThe reasons for the drug’s utility in certain surgical contexts, however, are also reasons why Sodium Pentothal is decidedly inappropriate for use as the sole anesthetic agent during a lethal injection procedure Id. at 26-27. Although the Arkansas protocol calls for a dose of the drug that is large enough to be lethal if properly administered, any problems with the delivery of the full dose engender the serious risk that the inmate will receive an insufficient amount of the drug to induce a deep enough plane of anesthesia, or to maintain that degree of anesthesia throughout the execution process. In short, if the inmate does not receive the full amount of Sodium Pentothal, and there are many reasons why that can and apparently does happen, the anesthetic effect may wear off too quickly and the inmate may be conscious and suffering during the remainder of the procedure.\nThe ADC’s protocol unnecessarily enhances these risks by its arbitrary and unnecessary adoption of 2 grams as the does of Sodium Pentothol to be administered, as distinguished from the 3 grams or 5 grams that is typically given in other jurisdictions that conduct executions by lethal injection. See, e.g., Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095, 1097 (8th Cir. 2006)(noting that Missouri’s lethal injection protocol calls for 5 grams of sodium pentothal); Morales v. Hickman, 438 F.3d 926, 928 (9th Cir. 2006)((noting that California’s lethal injection protocol calls for 5 grams of sodium pentothal); Cooey v. Taft, 2006 WL 1207982 at 4 (noting that Ohio’s lethal injection protocol calls for 2 grams of sodium pentothal, less than the 5 grams called for by California and the 3 grams used by North Carolina). Although concerns about the selection of this particular drug apply regardless of the size of the dose of sodium thiopental that is prescribed under the protocol, the ADC’s arbitrary decision to administer only 2 grams unduly decreases the margin of error and the increases the risk that inadequate anesthesia will be achieved.\nThe level of anesthesia, if any, achieved in each individual inmate depends on the amount that is successfully administered, although other factors such as the inmate’s weight and sensitivity/resistance to barbiturates are also important. Many foreseeable situations exist in which human or technical errors could result in the failure to successfully administer the intended dose. If error occurs that results in the prisoner receiving only half of a 5 gram dose, the prisoner will still receive 2.5 grams and adequate anesthesia will likely occur despite the error. If the same error occurs and the prisoner receives only half of a 2 gram dose, however, the risks of inadequate anesthesia and conscious suffering are significant. Exhibit 7 at 27 (Declaration of Dr. Heath) Additionally, the ADC’s protocol fails to even require that additional Sodium Thiopental be available in the execution chamber in the event that problems with delivery of the dose are detected and more of the anesthetic agent is determined to be necessary. Because of its instability, the drug is distributed in powder form and must be placed into solution before it may be injected Id. at 27 (a). Administrative Directive 96-06 fails to require even that extra Sodium Pentothol powder be on hand, much less extra syringes of the drug already mixed into solution, and so in the event that execution personnel were to detect signs of inadequate anesthetic depth or possible consciousness once the execution process was under way, the protocol ensures that there is nothing they could do about it. As noted, the circumstances under which a failure to achieve and maintain adequate anesthesia may occur are many, varied and common.\nii. Obtaining IV Access for Execution Purposes Requires Training and Skill that ADC Execution Personnel Lack Establishing peripheral intravenous access to an inmate to facilitate the administration of the lethal drugs called for by Administrative Directive 96-06 is a complex and risky medical procedure that should only be performed by properly medically trained and qualified personnel. The process is fraught with the potential for error. Under the best of circumstances, it is vital that the iv set-up be assembled properly and securely. The set-up consists of multiple parts and pieces of tubing, which may leak or otherwise fail to permit the unobstructed flow of chemicals into the inmate’s circulatory system if not correctly attached. See Exhibit 7 at 27(e) (Declaration of Dr. Heath).\nThe tourniquet that is applied to facilitate access to the peripheral vein must be removed once iv access is achieved; failure to do so will obstruct the flow of the anesthetic agent into the inmate’s body. See Id. at 27(k). There is reason to believe that the executioners have failed to remove the tourniquet in at least one execution conducted by the ADC; the Medical Examiner’s report of the autopsy of Darrell Richley states that the tourniquet was still present on Mr. Richley’s arm when his body was received at the morgue following his execution. See Exhibit 8 (Medical Examiner’s Report of Autopsy Darrell Richley). A similar problem may occur due to placement of the extensive restraining straps that the ADC uses to tie the inmate down to the gurney. See Exhibit 7 at 27(l)(Declaration of Dr. Heath).\nIt is critical that the catheter be inserted into the vein in precisely correct fashion in order to ensure that the full dose of the anesthetic drug is delivered into the inmate’s circulatory system. If the catheter is inserted incorrectly, the drug will go into the tissue surrounding the vein rather than into the vein itself. See id. at 27(f). This condition, known as infiltration, is not uncommon Id. Uncorrected, it will result in a failure of the anesthetic to reach the central nervous system and a failure to render the inmate unconscious Id. Once properly inserted, the catheter must be adequately secured with tape or by other means, or else it may shift and result in infiltration Id. at 27(j).\nEven finding a suitable peripheral vein into which the catheter may be placed can be a medically complex and difficult endeavor. See, e.g., Exhibit 9 (Post-Mortem Photograph of Riley Noel). Due to a variety of conditions, including obesity, prior intravenous drug use, corticosteroid treatment and even just naturally small or deep veins, obtaining peripheral iv access may be difficult or even impossible Id. at\n36. The very nature of the execution process may exacerbate this problem, because the autonomic manifestations of the anxiety associated with impending death include constriction or narrowing of the veins Id. at 41.\nIn the event that peripheral iv access proves impossible to obtain, most States’ protocols call for the use of dramatically more medically complex, risky and invasive procedures such as a cut-down, which entails making a deep incision into the inmate’s skin in order to access a vein that is not accessible from the surface, or a central line, which requires insertion of the catheter into a large vein such as the subclavian vein in the chest or the femoral vein in the groin. Indeed, both of these procedures have been conducted in Arkansas by the ADC. See Exhibits 10, 11, 12 (Post-mortem Photographs of Ricky Ray Rector); Exhibit 13 (Autopsy Report of Ricky Ray Rector); Exhibits 14, 15, 16 (Post-mortem Photographs of Clay Smith); Exhibit 17 (Autopsy Report of Clay Smith).\nDespite the complexity of and risks associated with these types of procedures, see Exhibit 7 at 36-41(Declaration of Dr. Heath), and their demonstrable necessity in at least two of the last 26 executions in Arkansas, Administrative Directive 96-06 fails to set forth any procedures whatsoever governing the use of these techniques. The protocol fails to specify who will decide if such measures are necessary, to prescribe how they are to be conducted or to set forth the qualifications required of the personnel who will actually perform them. Given the nature of the procedures it is unacceptable that they be performed by anyone except for medically trained personnel possessed of adequate skill and experience, but the protocol fails to require any particular knowledge or ability at all iii. Maintenance of Adequate Anesthesia Throughout the Execution Process Requires Training and Skill that ADC Execution Personnel Lack Even once peripheral iv access has been established and the catheters are properly inserted, there are still a large number of problems that may arise that may interfere with the proper delivery of anesthesia. It is critical, therefore, that the inmate be closely monitored by medically trained and experienced personnel throughout the execution process in order to detect problems as they occur and ensure that the inmate is maintained on a sufficiently deep plane of anesthesia. See Exhibit 7 at 31-32 (Declaration of Dr. Heath). Even most qualified nurses and paramedics are not trained in the use of ultrashort-acting barbiturates; these drugs are used only by anesthesiologists and a very select group of nurses who have obtained significant experience in intensive care units and as nurse anesthetists Id. at\n30. Training equivalent to that of an anesthesiologist or a CRNA is minimally required in order to ensure that an execution using the drugs and procedure selected by Defendant Norris is humane Id. However, the ADC’s protocol fails to provide for any monitoring of the inmate during the execution process, much less monitoring by individuals competent in the provision of general anesthesia.\nErrors and problems are potentially rife beginning at the stage of preparation of the lethal drugs. Sodium Thiopental is unstable in solution, and is therefore distributed by the manufacturer in powder form. Before it may be injected intravenously, the powder must be mixed with liquid, a process that requires knowledge of pharmaceuticals and familiarity with terminology and abbreviations Id. at 27(a). Administrative Directive 96-06 provides no guidance to execution personnel on this issue, stating only that “the powder be dissolved in ‘the least amount of clear diluent possible to attain complete, clear suspension.’” Id. No instructions are given as to how much fluid that might be or how the person performing the mixing should determine how much to use or how success has been achieved. Id.\nThe ADC’s protocol requires that, once mixed, the drugs be placed in a series of numbered syringes Id. at 27(b); Exhibit 19 (Photograph of Syringes). No other indication of the contents of the syringes is placed on them, which means that if a drug is erroneously placed in a syringe of the incorrect number, the error is likely to go undetected and the drugs will be administered in the wrong order Id. Such labeling is far below the appropriate medical standard of care and would never be permitted in the clinical context. Administration of the drugs in the wrong order may also result from the fact that each syringe is a separate unit that must be attached in series to the iv setup by hand. Exhibits 20, 21, 22 (Photographs of Syringes and IV Tubing). The protocol wholly fails to guard against the possibility that the executioner might select the incorrect syringe, to provide for monitoring of the inmate to ensure that such an error is immediately detected if it occurs, or to prescribe the steps to be taken if such a situation is detected. See Exhibit 7 at 27(c)(Declaration of Dr. Heath) If the lethal drugs are administered in the wrong order a range of negative consequences may ensue. Several of the numbered syringes are supposed to contain saline solution to be administered between drugs in order to flush the iv lines of all traces of the preceding agent. Of primary importance is the fact that, if mixed with Pancuronium Bromide outside of the body, Sodium Pentothol will precipitate, i.e. solids will form in the solution, impairing or preventing delivery of the full dose of anesthetic agent. Hence, if error in the selection of syringes results in the introduction of Pancuronium Bromide before the line has been flushed with saline solution, inadequate anesthesia may result. The ADC’s lethal injection protocol requires that the executioners who inject the lethal drugs into the iv set up be located in a room that is apart from the execution chamber where the inmate is placed on the gurney, separated by a window with a hole in it for the iv lines to pass through. Exhibit 23 (Photograph of Execution Chamber). Because of the distance between the inmate and the executioners that this procedure necessitates, extended iv tubing is required. The introduction of extra length and components to the iv set-up not only increases the number of sites where leakage may occur, see Exhibit 7 at 27(e)(Declaration of Dr. Heath), but also increases the risk that the tubing may coil or kink.\nEven when properly placed initially, the tip of an iv catheter may migrate during the course of the execution so that it is outside of the vein at the time of the introduction of the anesthetic agent and infiltration occurs. See Exhibit 7 at 27(g)(Declaration of Dr. Heath). Although the catheter appears to be securely and properly placed, too, the process of inserting it may weaken or damage the vein wall such that the vein ruptures when the administration of the lethal drugs begins Id. at 27(h). This risk is increased by the fact that inexperienced, untrained personnel may exert excessive pressure on the syringe plungers, increasing the velocity of the administration of te drug and consequently the pressure that is placed on the vein walls Id. Indeed, excessive pressure on the plunger can lead to tearing or rupture of the vein even in the absence of damage caused by the initial insertion of the catheter Id. at 27(i).\nBecause of each of these potential problems and more, constant, close monitoring of the inmate’s plane of anesthesia throughout the execution process by individuals who are properly trained and skilled in anesthesiology is indispensable. And yet, the Defendants’ protocol fails to provide for any monitoring at all once the execution is underway, much less monitoring by personnel who have the requisite knowledge and experience to detect and rectify any problems that may arise them.\niv. Even if ADC Personnel Were Qualified to Administer IV Anesthesia, the Use of Pancuronium Bromide and the Physical Arrangement of the Execution Chamber Preclude Effective Monitoring Not only does the ADC’s lethal injection protocol fail to provide for monitoring of the inmate by persons qualified in assessing anesthetic depth, it calls for a physical arrangement of inmate and executioners that would unnecessarily hinder effective monitoring even if it were attempted. As noted, the protocol requires that the executioners who inject the lethal drugs into the iv set-up be located in a room that is apart from the execution chamber where the inmate is placed on the gurney, separated by a window with a hole in it for the iv lines to pass through. Exhibit 23 (Photograph of Execution Chamber). The persons who control the administration of the drugs, then, are the furthest away of any execution chamber personnel and their line of sight to the inmate is impeded. See Exhibit 7 at 27(e)(Declaration of Dr. Heath). The distance entirely precludes the close monitoring of the diagnostic signs of anesthetic depth that are constantly checked during surgical procedures d. The Risk of Torture and Pain Created by Administrative Directive 96-06 Has Been Realized in Executions in Arkansas and Elsewhere There is now ample evidence that Administrative Directive 96-06 has caused some inmates executed in Arkansas to experience unnecessary pain and suffering during their executions. Both execution records and witnesses\' accounts of these executions provide evidence that is indicative of continued consciousness following the purported administration of the sodium pentothal. A dose of Sodium Pentothal of Ronald Gene Simmons was executed by the State of Arkansas on June 25,\n1990. Exhibits 24, 25, 26 (Post-mortem Photographs of Ronald Gene Simmons). The administration of the lethal chemicals began at 9:02pm. Exhibit 27 (Medical Examiner’s Consultation and Investigation Form Ronald Gene Simmons). Between 9:02 and 9:04pm, according to an eyewitness, Mr. Simmons appeared to nod off into unconsciousness. However, “at 9:05pm he called out ‘Oh! Oh!’ and began to cough sporadically as though he might be having difficulty breathing. During the next two minutes, he coughed slightly, approximately 20 times, each cough heaving his stomach slightly and causing the gurney to shake a little.” Bill Simmons, Stoic Murderer Meets His Fate by Quiet Means, ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT, June 26, 1990, at According to Dr. Heath, the typical reaction to the administration of sodium pentothal is yawning, drawing one or two deep breaths, or visibly exhaling so that the cheeks puff out. Exhibit 7 at\n44. (Declaration of Mark Heath M.D.) Obviously, audibly vocalizing is not consistent with unconsciousness. Also, irregular heaving of the chest is not consistent with the depression of the central nervous system caused by sodium pentothal Id. Rather, chest heaving is indicative of labored respiratory activity, which in turn strongly suggests that Mr. Simmons was conscious, and indeed may have been laboring against the paralyzing effect of the pancuronium bromide. Id.\nJust under two years later, on January 24, 1992, Rickey Ray Rector was put to death in Arkansas. The execution took one hour and 9 minutes to complete, during which time Mr. Rector’s hands and arms were punctured no less than 10 separate times by ADC personnel searching for a suitable vein in which to place the IV line. Exhibits 10, 29, 30, 31 (Post-mortem Photographs of Ricky Ray Rector); Exhibit 13 (Autopsy Report of Ricky Ray Rector) The catheter was finally inserted into a vein in Mr. Rector’s hand, Exhibits 32, 33, 12, but not before a deep incision, a “cut-down,” was made in his arm, Exhibits 10, 11,\n12. The curtains between the execution chamber and the witness room remained closed during the 50 minutes it took to place the IV line, but witnesses heard Mr. Rector’s loud moans as his skin was repeatedly pierced. Sonja Clinesmith, Moans Pierced Silence During Wait, ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT GAZETTE, January 26, 1992, at Even once the IV line was secured and the curtains opened, the ordeal for Mr. Rector was not over. The flow of lethal chemicals began at 9:50pm, Exhibit 36 (Medical Examiner’s Consultation and Investigation Form Ricky Ray Rector), and for two minutes Mr. Rector looked to witnesses as though he was nodding off to sleep. However, one observer noted that Mr. Rector said “‘I’m getting dizzy,’” two minutes after the execution began. Joe Farmer, Rector, 40, Executed for Officer’s Slaying, ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT GAZETTE, January 25, 1992, at Death of Rector, Witnesses Listen, Wait Beyond Curtain, ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT GAZETTE, January 26, 1992, at On May 7, 1992, 25 year old Steven Douglas Hill was executed. Exhibit 38 (Declaration of Charles L. Carpenter, Jr.); Exhibits 39, 40 (Post-mortem Photographs of Steven Hill). His execution began at 9:02pm. Exhibit 41 (Medical Examiner’s Consultation and Investigation Form Steven Douglas Hill). His eyes closed one minute later, but shortly afterwards he had what witnesses described as “a ‘seizure,’ arching his back with his cheeks popping out.” Andy Gotlieb and Linda Satter, Hill Dies by Injection for ‘84 Police Killing, ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT GAZETTE, May 8, 1992, at 17A (Exhibit 42.) He was visibly “gasping for air,” and even though he was strapped down to the gurney “his chest was heaving against the wide belt that covered his chest.” Exhibit 38 at 8 (Declaration of Charles L. Carpenter, Jr.). The seizure ended at 9:04pm and Mr. Hill was pronounced dead at 9:10pm.\nChristina Riggs, the first woman to be put to death in Arkansas in over 150 years, was executed on May 2,\n2000. The procedure was delayed for 18 minutes while ADC personnel struggled in vain to insert the IV line into her elbows. Exhibit 46 (Medical Examiner’s Consultation and Investigation Form Christina Riggs). When they could not do so, they asked Ms. Riggs if they could insert the catheters into her wrists, and she consented. Exhibits 47, 48 (Post-mortem Photographs of Christina Riggs). The execution then proceeded. However, a minute after the drugs had purportedly begun to flow into her body, Ms. Riggs was still vocalizing. Witnesses heard her say “I love you, my babies.” Cathy Frye, Riggs, Mother who Killed her 2 Children, Put to Death by State, ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT GAZETTE, May 3, 2000, at These accounts of Arkansas executions are “extremely troubling,” because they indicate “that there were problems associated with the administration of the chemicals that may have resulted in the prisoners being conscious during portions of the executions.” Beardslee v. Woodford, 395 F.3d 1064, 1075 (9th Cir. 2005). They are also part of a growing body of evidence that suggests that identical problems are recurring over and over again in jurisdictions throughout the country that utilize similar lethal injection protocols. See, e.g., Cooey v. Taft, 2006 WL 1207982 5 (“Plaintiff has demonstrated a stronger likelihood of success on the merits than the plaintiffs who preceded him, given the growing body of evidence calling Ohio’s lethal injection protocol increasingly into question. This Court cannot and will not turn a blind eye to the evidence presented in the cases of Brown v. Beck in North Carolina and Morales v. Hickman in California”).\nRecently, the execution of Joseph Lewis Clark by the State of Ohio demonstrated graphically and horrifically how an execution that appeared completely normal and routine at the outset can rapidly go horribly wrong. See Adam Liptak, Trouble Finding Inmate’s Vein Slows Lethal Injection in Ohio, NEW YORK TIMES, May 3, 2006 (Exhibit 43.) After searching for 22 minutes, execution personnel finally found a vein that they thought was suitable for inserting the IV catheter Id. However, three or four minutes after the flow of lethal drugs was started, Mr. Clark literally raised his head up off the gurney and informed his executioners that “[i]t’s not working.” Id. The vein had apparently collapsed; the execution team closed the curtain to the witness room and once again began searching for a usable site for the IV, a process that took another 30 minutes Id\nMr. Clark was not pronounced dead until 11:26am, almost an hour and a half after the ordeal began. Id.\nc. The Serious Risks Engendered by ADC’s Lethal Injection Protocol are Unnecessary and Unconstitutional Administrative Directive 96-06 both creates an unacceptable and unnecessary quantum of risk that the inmate will not be adequately anesthetized and therefore will suffer excruciating pain during his execution, and also fails utterly to account for these obvious contingencies and instruct personnel on how to react to or prevent them. In this respect, the lethal injection protocol is starkly different from the judicial hanging protocol that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld in Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 683 (9th Cir. 1994). Analogous to the risk that an inmate will be conscious and in excruciating pain during the lethal injection process, the State of Washington\'s judicial hanging procedure carried the risk that an inmate would die of asphyxiation, which is slow and painful, or decapitation, which mutilates the inmate\'s body, rather than dying within seconds as intended. See id. at 683.\nUnlike the ADC\'s lethal injection protocol, however, Washington\'s protocol carefully acknowledged the risks that it engendered and provided detailed procedures specifically designed to minimize them. Thus, as the court noted, Washington\'s protocol reflected medical opinions as to the manner in which different methods of hanging would kill inmates and which modes of causing death were the most humane Id. In order to avoid death by asphyxiation or decapitation, the protocol included detailed instructions on numerous factors that could affect the manner of death, including the diameter of the rope; the method of tying the knot; treating the rope with wax and boiling it to reduce elasticity; and the length of the drop in relation to body weight and the manner in which that length should be calculated Id. at 683-85. All of these instructions were the result of careful consideration of the available scientific and medical evidence. In light of the Washington protocol\'s ample provision for the risks of an inhumane death, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the risk of a botched execution was ""slight,"" and had been ""minimized as much as possible."" Id. at 687 n.17.\nIn contrast to Washington\'s protocol, it is impossible to detect in the version of Administrative Directive 96-06 currently available any attempt on the ADC\'s part to account for the problems that can and do arise during an execution by lethal injection. This failure is particularly egregious in light of the fact that simply having a qualified person verify, visually and tactically, that the inmate is indeed anesthetized following the administration of the sodium pentothal, would go a long way towards mitigating the risk of unnecessary pain. See Exhibit 7 at 32 (Declaration of Mark Heath M.D.) Moreover, the necessity for such monitoring may be obviated by the selection of alternative, equally effective anesthetic agents and by the use of one of the drugs capable of causing cardiac arrest that does not cause excruciating pain Id. at\n13. Yet it does not appear that the ADC has even considered these or any other means of lessening the gratuitous dangers created by its protocol. This egregious failure renders the significant risk of error truly unnecessary and unconstitutional Cf. Campbell, 18 F.3d at 687 n.17.\nC\nMR. DAVIS WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM IF A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION IS NOT GRANTED\nIf the State is not enjoined from executing him in accordance with Administrative Directive 96-06, Mr. Davis will likely suffer irreparable harm. Being forced to endure excruciating pain during the execution process clearly constitutes irreparable harm. See Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 482 (2d Cir. 1996)(holding that continued pain and suffering resulting from deliberate medical indifference is irreparable harm). As is clear from the foregoing, there is ample evidence that Defendants’ proposed method of execution carries a significant and unacceptable risk that Mr. Davis will indeed suffer that harm. The threat of harm is both “real and immediate,” and thus the situation is one that is “ripe for injunctive relief.” See Goff v. Harper, 60 F.3d 518, 521 (8th Cir. 1995). Moreover, Mr. Davis will have no retrospective remedy for the constitutional violation, as he will no longer be alive.\nD. THE BALANCE OF HARMS STRONGLY FAVORS MR. DAVIS In contrast, the harm to the State that will result from the entry of a preliminary injunction is slight. The State undoubtedly has a strong interest in the prompt execution of its judgments. The delay resulting from granting the temporary relief sought herein, however, will have little adverse effect upon that interest. See Gomez v US. Dist Ct. for Northern Dist. of Ca/., 966 F.2d 460,462 (9th Cir. 1992) (Noonan, J., dissenting from grant of writ of mandate) (“The state will get its man in the end. In contrast, if persons are put to death in a manner that is determined to be cruel, they suffer injury that can never be undone, and the Constitution suffers an injury that can never be repaired.”). The balance of harms tips sharply in favor of entering a preliminary injunction.\nE. GRANTING TEMPORARY RELIEF IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST Whether the State is executing its prisoners in a way that subjects them to an excruciatingly painful, torturous death is clearly a matter of vital public interest. The standards of decency and humanity in a society such as ours are gravely offended by such practices, and so it is affirmatively in the public interest to address and resolve the merits of the Plaintiffs’ claims in order to identify and put an end to unnecessary procedures that pose a risk of causing gratuitous suffering. Indeed, the citizens of the State of Arkansas, through their elected representatives, have expressly acknowledged the importance of conducting executions as humanely as possible by changing the method from electrocution to lethal injection as a result of the belief that the latter reduces unnecessary suffering. See Carol Matlack, House Votes Injection Bill, ARKANSAS GAZETTE, February 22, 1983, at infliction of unnecessary pain. As noted above, the claim does not become ripe for resolution until an execution is imminent but, if a preliminary injunction is not granted, the execution will necessarily take place before the issues can be adjudicated. In light of the importance of the questions involved, it is clearly in the public interest that temporary relief be granted in the instant case to solve this dilemma and permit a definitive determination of the merits to be made. “[T]he public interest only is served by enforcing constitutional rights and by the prompt and accurate resolution of disputes concerning those constitutional rights. By comparison, the public interest has never been and could never be served by rushing to judgment at the expense of a condemned inmate’s constitutional rights.” Cooey v. Taft, 2006 WL 1207982 at *6 (S.D.Ohio) \nF\nMR. DAVIS ENGAGED IN NO UNDUE DELAY IN BRINGING THIS ACTION\nMr. Davis diligently prosecuted his constitutional claims as soon as they became ripe for review. The fact that the State of Arkansas chose to schedule his execution while the lawsuit and his Motion to Intervene were still pending, and before the Court has had the opportunity to adjudicate his claims on the merits, in no way detracts from the propriety of according him temporary relief in order to facilitate that adjudication. A challenge to a specific execution procedure becomes ripe for adjudication only when it is clear that the challenger will in fact be subjected to that particular procedure, i.e. “when the execution becomes imminent and the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the facts giving rise to his specific challenges.” Cooey v. Taft, 2006 WL 1207982 at *3. These criteria are met when all state and federal legal challenges to the conviction and sentence have been exhausted and certiorari has been denied by the United States Supreme Court. Id.\nAccordingly, Mr. Davis moved to join the instant action on May 4, 2006, just 17 days after the United States Supreme Court denied his application to file a certiorari petition, only 3 days after Mr. Nooner filed the Complaint and even before his execution date was scheduled. Far from an 11th hour attempt to manipulate and abuse the system, then, the instant action is a good-faith effort to move as promptly and expeditiously as possible to protect Mr. Davis’s constitutional rights. Accordingly, the entry of the requested preliminary injunction is appropriate under Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637 (2004), and Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S.\n(2006)\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe purpose of this lawsuit is not to prevent the State from executing Mr Davis. It is to prevent it from executing him in a manner that subjects him to excruciating pain and torture that is gratuitous and unnecessary and in violation of the Constitution. To avoid the risk that his execution will be performed in such a manner, Mr. Davis is entitled to relief under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983. In order to allow him an opportunity to prove that entitlement, and to obtain an adjudication of the merits of his claims, Mr. Davis respectfully requests that the Court issue a preliminary injunction preventing Defendants from executing him by means of lethal injection under the protocol currently in effect in the State of Arkansas.\nRespectfully Submitted, By: /s/ Alvin Schay ALVIN SCHAY Ark.

 'Case 5:06-cv-00110-SWW Document 24 Filed 06/19/2006 P a g e 1 of 8 \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS PINE BLUFF DIVISION\nTERRICK TERRELL NOONER\nPLAINTIFF\nNo. 5:06CV001 I0 SWW LARRY NORRIS, Director, Arkansas Department of Correction; GAYLON LAY, Warden, Arkansas Department of Correction; WENDY KELLY, Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs; JOHN BYUS; Administrator, Correctional Medical Services, Arkansas Department of Correction; and OTHER UNKNOWN EMPLOYEES, Arkansas Department of Correction \nDEFENDANTS\nORDER\nTerrick Terrell Nooner (""Nooner""), a death row inmate, commenced this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5 1983, claiming that the chemical protocol and procedures used for carrying out execution by lethal injection in Arkansas amount to cruel and unusual punishment and an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational method of execution that violates the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Nooner seeks a declaration that the State\'s lethal injection procedurc is unconstitutional an injunction enjoining Defendants from carrying out the procedure in the future. On May 4,2006, Arkansas death row inmate Don William Davis (""Davis""), who is scheduled to be executed on July 5,2006,\' filed a motion to intervene. The Court permitted Davis to intervene as a party-plaintiff pursuant to Fed R\nCiv. P. 24(b)(2), with the understanding that he asserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as \'Nooner\'s execution date has not been set.\nC a s e 5:06-cv-00110-SWW Document 2 4 Filed 0611912006 P a g e 2 of 8 set forth in the complaint. Before the Court is Defendants\' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted (docket entry #13) and Plaintiffs\' responses in objcction (docket entries #20, #23). After careful consideration, and for the reasons that follow, the motion will be denied.\nIn deciding a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, all facts alleged in the complaint are assumed to be true. Doe v. Northwest Bank Minn., N.A., 107 F.3d 1297, 1303-04 (8""\' Cis. 1997). The complaint must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, McMorr-ow v. Little, 109 F.3d 432, 434 (8""\' Cis. 1997), and should not be dismissed unless it is clear beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts thereunder which would entitle him or her to relief. I-iafley v. Lohman, 90 F.3d 264, 266 (8""\' Cir. 1996). The Court may grant a motion to dismiss on the basis of a dispositive issue of law. Neitzke v. Williams,490 U.S. 3 19, 326 (1989).\nA motion to dismiss is not a device for testing the truth of what is asserted or for determining whether the plaintiff has any evidence to back up what is in the complaint. ACLU Foundation v. Burr, 952 F.2d 457,467 (D.C Cir. 1991). The issue is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the plaintiff is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\nId Thus, a motion to dismiss should be granted ""as a practical matter... only in the unusual case in which a plaintiff includes allegations that show on the face of the complaint that there is some insuperable bar to relief."" Frey v. Czty ofHerculaneum, 44 F.3d 667, 671 (8""\' Cis. 1995) (quoting Hishon v. King Spulding, 467 U.S. 69, 73 (1984)).\n11. Arkansas\' lethal injection statute provides:\nThe punishment of death is to be administered by a continuous intravenous injection of a lethal quantity of an ultra-short-acting barbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic agent until the defendant\'s death is pronounced according to accepted standards of medical practice Ark. Code Ann. 5-4-717(a)(l). The statute gives the Director of the Arkansas Department of Correction (""ADC"") the responsibility to determine the substances to be uniformly administered and the procedures to be used in any execution. See Ark. Code Ann. 5 5-4-617(a)(2).\nAccording to allegations in the complaint, executions by lethal injection in Arkansas are carried out as follows. First, the condemned prisoner is placed on a gurney in the execution chamber, and his head and appendages are immobilized. Next, ADC employees insert IV lines into the prisoner and attach an electrocardiogram monitor. Two lay-executioners begin ""attaching and plunging"" up to eight syringes in a complicated sequence prescribed by ADC protocol. First one drug, then a saline flush, then two syringes of the next drug, another saline flush, and then up to three syringes of a third drug. The drugs administered are: l\'hiopental, administered to cause unconsciousness; Pancuronium bromide, administered to cause paralysis and stop all movement including respiration; and Potassium chloride, to stop the heart. When the prisoner exhibits no sign of life, the warden summons the coroner to pronounce death.\nPotassium chloride bums intensely as it travels through the veins to the heart. Plaintiffs claim, for reasons set forth in the complaint, the foregoing procedure creates a risk of gratuitous infliction of unnecessary pain. According to Plaintiffs, it is possible to conduct execution by lethal injection in a humane manner that complies with Arkansas\' lethal injection statute.\nIn support of their motion to dismiss, Defendants assert that PlaintiffNooner2has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, his complaint must be dismissed as a unauthorized, successive petition for habeas corpus, and his claims are barred under the applicable statute of limitations and pursuant to the equitable laches doctrine. The Court will consider each argument.\nExhaustion The Prison Litigation Reform Act (""PLRA"") provides that, ""[nlo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983... by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted."" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). The PLRA\'s exhaustion requirement applies to all suits about prison life,\' and it requires prisoners to exhaust administrative processes before commencing suit in federal court. See Porter v. Nussle, 122 S Ct. 983, 988,992 (2002).\nDefendants assert that Nooner is required to ""provide proof that he exhausted all administrative remedies before he can bring a 5 1983 action."" The Court disagrees. The PL,RArs exhaustion requirement is not a heightened pleading requirement-a prisoner\'s failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense that the defendant has the burden to plead and to prove. See Nerness v. Johnson, 401 F.3d 874, 876 (8""\' Cir. 2005)(citing Foulkv.harrier, 262 F.3d 687, 697 (8th Cir. 2001)).\nAdministrative exhaustion is required even where a prison grievance process will not provide the type of relief sought by a prisoner. See Boofh v. Churner, 121 S Ct. 1818, (2001).\nclaims.\nArkansas\' chosen process for carrying out his death sentence as an ""inmate suit about prison life."" tlowever, a prisoner need only exhaust ""such administrative remedies as are available"" and exhaustion is not required when grievance officers have no authority to act on the subject of the complaint. See id. at 1823 n.4(""Without the possibility of some relief, the administrative officers would presumably have no authority to act on the subject of the complaint, leaving the inmate with nothing to exhaust.""). Arkansas law gives the Director of the ADC sole responsibility and authority for determining the substances to be administered and the procedures to be used in any execution. See Ark. Code Ann. 5-4-617(a)(2).\nNooner asserts that the ADC\'s inmate grievance process offers no available remedy because the grievance tribunal, which does not include the Director of the ADC, has no authority to take action with regard to his complaint. Nooner states that before he commenced this l a w s i t his attorney wrote Larry Norris, Director of the ADC, and advised him of the claims presented in this lawsuit. Nooner states that, on behalf of Director Norris, the Arkansas Attorney General responded as follows: ""While Mr. Norris is aware that several states\' protocol has been, and some currently are, the subject of litigation, he believes the protocol used currently insures the necessary anesthetization for the duration of the execution procedure and satisfies Constitutional requirements."" Docket entry #20(citing May 25, 2006 letter from Joseph Svoboda). Based on the evidence presently before the Court, the Court finds that Defendants have failed to show that Nooner has failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies.\nHabeas Corpus On June 12, 2006, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Hill v. McDonough,2006 WL, 1584710 (U.S. June 12, 2006) ruling that a Florida death row inmate, Clarence I-Iill, may use 42 U.S.C. 5 1983 as a vehicle to challenge the constitutionality of Florida\'s lethal injection protocol, which is similar to the three-drug injection protocol challenged in this lawsuit. Like Plaintiffs, Hill seeks to enjoin the State from executing him according to the three-drug protocol, and he claims that the Florida Department of Corrections could choose other means of lethal injection that would meet constitutional standards.\nThe Supreme Court reversed the Eleventh Circuit\'s determination that Hill\'s civil rights challenge to Florida\'s lethal injection protocol is the functional equivalent of an unauthorized, successive habeas petition. The Court noted that ifthe relief sought would foreclose Hill\'s execution, it might be proper to recharacterize his complaint as an action for habeas corpus. Id, at *7. Howcver, like Arkansas\' lethal injection statute, Florida law prescribes lethal injection as the State\'s method of execution, but it does not specify a specific protocol for lethal injection and leaves those details to the Florida Department of Corrections. See Fla Stat. Q:\n922.105(l)(stating that a death sentence ""shall be executed under the direction of the Secretary of Corrections or the secretary\'s designee""). Because Florida law does not specify a particular lethal injection protocol, the Supreme Court concluded that Hill\'s lawsuit left the State free to use an alternative lethal injection procedure. Thus, granting Hill injunctive relief could not be seen as barring execution of his sentence. Hll, 2006 WI, 1584710 at ""5. The same is true in this case, and 5 1983 is a proper vehicle for Plaintiffs\' claims. Laches Dismissal of a claim on the ground of laches, an affirmative defense, requires a showing of unreasonable and unjustified delay in bringing a claim, and material prejudice to the defendant as a result of the delay. See Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, Inc v. Scimed Lij2 Systems, Inc. 988 F.2d 1 157, 1161 (8""\' Cir. 1993). Defendants assert the defense in the context of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Rule 12(b)(6) confines a C a s e 5:06-cv-00110-SWW Document 24 Filed 06/19/2006 P a g e 7 of 8 court\'s inquiry to allegations set forth in the complaint, unless matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, in which case the motion is treated as one for summary judgment. See id. (""The strictures of Rule 12(b)(6), wherein dismissal of the claim is based solely on the complainant\'s pleading, are not readily applicable to a determination of laches.""). In this case, the allegations in the complaint do not confirm the existence of an unreasonable, inexcusable delay on the part of Nooner or Davis in commencing suit, or resulting prejudice to Defendants. Furthermore, Defendants provide no additional evidence to support their defense. The Court has no means, at this time, to determine whether Plaintiffs\' claims are barred by laches.\nStatute of Limitations The statute of limitations for 5 1983 actions is the forum state\'s statute of limitations for personal injury actions, which in Arkansas is three years. See Morlon I). Cily oflittle Rock, 934 F.2d 180, 182 (8""\' Cir. 1991). Although state law determines the limitations period for filing 5 1983 claims, federal law determines when a cause of action accrues. See While v. Gauri.son,70 F.3d 1276 (8""\' Cir. 1995) (unpublished table opinion). Under fcdcral common law, a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff ""discovers, or with due diligence should have discovered, the injury that is the basis of the litigation."" Union Pacific R Co. v.Beckham, 138 F.3d 325, 330 (8""\' Cir. 1998).\nDefendants propose that Nooner\'s cause of action accrued on the date his death sentence was imposed. Defendants state that Nooner was sentenced in 1996, but Nooner alleges, in the complaint, that his sentence was imposed in\n1993. Regardless of the actual sentencing date, the Court finds that the date Nooner was sentenced does not necessarily mark the date he discovered or should have discovered the State\'s specific lethal injection protocol and whether it carries a risk of unnecessary pain. The complaint does not show, on its face, when Plaintiffs\' cause of action accrued or whether their claims are time-barred under the applicable statutc of limitations Accordingly, dismissal on such grounds is not possible.\nFor the reasons stated, Defendants motion to dismiss (docket entry #13) is DENIED. IT IS SO ORDERED THIS 19""\' DAY OF JUNE, 2006.\n/s/Susan Webber Wright UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE'
 'IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS PINE BLUFF DIVISION\nTERRICK TERRELL NOONER, and \nDON WILLIAMS DAVIS\nPLAINTIFF INTERVENOR PLAINTIFF\nNo. 5:06CV00110 SWW VS.\nLARRY NORRIS, Director, Arkansas Department of Correction; GAYLON LAY, Warden, Arkansas Department of Correction; WENDY KELLY, Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs; JOHN BYUS; Administrator, Correctional Medical Services, Arkansas Department of Correction; and OTHER UNKNOWN EMPLOYEES, Arkansas Department of Correction \nDEFENDANTS\nORDER\nTerrick Terrell Nooner (“Nooner”) and Don Williams Davis (“Davis”), Arkansas death- row inmates, bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claiming that the protocol for carrying out execution by lethal injection in Arkansas violates the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the protocol is unconstitutional, and an injunction enjoining Defendants from carrying out future executions in accordance with the protocol.\nBefore the Court is Plaintiff Davis’s motion for a preliminary injunction (docket entry #21) asking the Court to stay his July 5, 2006 execution and permit him to litigate his constitutional claims. Defendants have responded (docket entry #28), and the matter is ready for decision. After careful consideration, and for the reason that follow, the Court concludes that the motion for a preliminary injunction should be granted.\nI. In 1992, Davis was convicted of capital murder, burglary, and theft of property and sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal,1 and his petition for post-conviction relief in state court was denied.2 On September 14, 2005, the Eighth Circuit affirmed denial of Davis’s petition for habeas relief,3 and on April 17, 2006, the United States Supreme Court denied Davis’s petition for a writ of certiorari.4 Plaintiff Nooner initiated this § 1983 action on May 1, 2006, and on May 4, 2006, Davis filed a motion to intervene as a party plaintiff. On May 11, 2006, Governor Mike Huckabee scheduled Davis’s execution for July 5,\n2006. On May 26, 2006, the Court granted Davis’s motion to intervene, and on June 16, 2006, Davis filed the present motion for a preliminary injunction. Arkansas’ lethal injection statute provides that the “punishment of death is to be administered by a continuous intravenous injection of a lethal quantity of an ultra-short-acting barbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic agent until the defendant\'s death is pronounced according to accepted standards of medical practice.” Ark. Code Ann. 5-4-17(a)(1). Arkansas law gives the Director of the Arkansas Department of Correction (“ADC”) the responsibility to determine the substances to be administered and the procedures to be used in any execution. See Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617(a)(2). The Director’s protocol for execution by lethal injection, set forth in ADC Administrative Directive 96-06 (“AD 96-06""), calls for the administration of three chemicals in the following order: (1) a 2-gram injection of sodium pentothal (also known as thiopental), administered to cause unconsciousness; (2) 2, 50milligram injections of pancuronium bromide, administered to cause paralysis; and (3) up to 3, 50-milliequivalent injections of potassium chloride, to stop the heart.5 Each injection is followed by a saline flush. According to AD 96-06, the injections are administered by way of control devices located in a control room, separate from the execution chamber. The control devices are connected, by extension tubing, to IV catheters inserted into each arm of the condemned inmate. The catheters are inserted by an “IV team” and the injections are administered by executioners, whose identities are kept secret. AD 96-06 contains no provision requiring that the IV team or executioners have any type of medical training or certification.6 Davis alleges that the State’s protocol creates a substantial risk that the first injection (2 grams of sodium pentothal) will fail to render him unconscious to the point that he will not experience intense pain and agony after the administration of pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride.\nDavis’s medical expert, Mark J S. Heath, M.D., a board-certified anesthesiologist and the Assistant Professor of Clinical Anesthesiology at Columbia University in New York City, states that the ADC’s lethal injection procedure creates medically unacceptable risks of inflicting excruciating pain and suffering. See docket entry #21, Ex. 1 (Heath Decl.),\n51. In his declaration, Dr. Heath explains that pancuronium bromide stops all movement, including that necessary to breathe, but it has no effect on the ability to feel pain, and potassium chloride burns intensely as it travels through the veins to the heart. Thus, if a condemned inmate is conscious when the pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered, he or she will feel the sensations of slow suffocation and excruciating pain.\nDr. Heath maintains that the ADC’s protocol creates an unacceptable risk that condemned inmates will be conscious for the duration of the execution procedure. He states that the protocol fails to comply with medical standards of care for inducing and maintaining anesthesia and the American Veterinary Medical Association’s standards for the euthanasia of animals Dr. Heath finds that the protocol fails to address several foreseeable situations in which human or technical error could result in the failure to successfully administer the 2-gram dose of sodium pentothal. Further, Dr. Heath opines that the protocol creates a substantial risk of unnecessary pain which is easily remedied.\nIn addition to Dr. Heath’s declaration, Davis submits the declaration of a witness to the 1992 execution of Steven Hill. The witness states: “Approximately 3-5 minutes after the IV fluid began to flow, I noticed Steven struggling to breathe. He was strapped down, but his chest was heaving.... He appeared to be gasping for air. Within another minute, he turned a bright red color and then lay completely still.” Docket entry #21, Ex.\n38. Davis also submits several newspaper articles containing eye-witness accounts of ADC executions which, according to Davis, indicate that inmates remained conscious and suffered pain during their executions. See docket entry #21, Exs. 28, 34, 37, 42, 45, 49.\nII. The factors to consider when deciding whether to grant or deny motions for preliminary injunctions include (1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of the balance between his harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other parties involved in the litigation; (3) the probability the movant will succeed on the merits; and (4) the public interest. See Dataphase Sys., Inc v. CL Sys., 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir. 1981). Additionally, a court considering a stay of execution must apply “‘a strong equitable presumption against the grant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring an entry of a stay.’” Hill v. McDonough, 2006 WL 1584710, at *8 (U.S. June 12, 2006)(quoting Nelson v. Campbell, 124 S Ct. 2117, 2126 (2004)). The Court finds that Davis has shown that he is personally under a threat of irreparable harm. If Davis remains or becomes conscious during the execution, he will suffer intense pain that will never be rectified. The Court further finds that the balance of potential harms favors Davis. If a stay is granted and Davis’s allegations prove true, he and others will be spared subjection to an unconstitutional execution procedure, and the State’s interest in enforcing death penalties in compliance with constitutional standards will be served. If, on the other hand, a stay is granted and Davis’s allegations are without merit, the State can carry out Davis’s execution without the specter that the ADC’s protocol carries an unreasonable risk of inflicting unnecessary pain. The State argues that the equities favor the State because Davis unjustifiably delayed bringing his claims. However, Davis moved to intervene in this case before the State set his execution date and shortly after he exhausted all means for challenging his conviction. The Court disagrees that Davis delayed pursuing his claims.7 Next, the Court must consider the probability that Davis will succeed on the merits.\nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits punishments repugnant to “‘the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society’” or those involving “‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.’” Estelle v. Gamble, 97 S Ct. 285, 290, 290 (1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 78 \nS\nCt. 590, 598 (1958)(first quote); Gregg v. Georgia, 96 S Ct. 2909, 2925 (1976) (second quote)).\nThe State contends that Davis has not shown that he might succeed on the merits because Dr. Heath’s declaration offers no information about the probability that Davis might experience unnecessary pain. However, Davis need not show a mathematical probability of success at trial The Eighth Circuit reversed the stay after concluding that the State’s interest in prompt execution of its judgment was not outweighed by the district court’s scheduling difficulties. The Eighth Circuit ordered that the case be reassigned to a district judge who could hear the case immediately “[i]n recognition of Mr. Taylor’s equally strong interest in having an evidentiary hearing on his claims prior to his execution.” Taylor, 445 F.3d at 1098-99. The district court followed the Eighth Circuit’s instructions and determined that Taylor’s claims had no merit. Taylor appealed, arguing that the district court, in its haste to make a decision before Taylor’s execution date, prevented him from calling medical witnesses. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit stayed Taylor’s execution, concluding that it asked the district court to do too much in too little time. The Court of Appeals stated, “In view of the existing record, the importance of the issue to this plaintiff as well as others, and the likelihood of recurrence of these identical issues in future Missouri death penalty cases, we remand for... a continuation of the hearing....” Taylor, 445 F.3d at 1099.\nbefore a stay can be granted. It is enough that Davis has raised serious questions that call for deliberate investigation. See Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 113 (“But where the balance of other factors tip decidedly toward movant a preliminary injunction may issue if movant has raised questions so serious and difficult as to call for more deliberate investigation.”).\nFinally, the Court finds that the public interest will be served if the Court holds an evidentiary hearing on Plaintiffs’ claims. Crime victims and the general public have an important interest in the timely enforcement of criminal sentences. However, failure to consider Davis’s allegations would ignore the equally important public interest in the humane and constitutional application of the State’s lethal injection statute.\nIII. For the reasons stated, Plaintiff Davis’s motion for a preliminary injunction (docket entry #21) is GRANTED. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the State of Arkansas is STAYED from implementing an order for the execution of Don William Davis until further notice from this Court. The Court will attempt to schedule an expedited hearing. The time of the hearing will depend on the Court’s schedule as well as the schedules of others involved. IT IS SO ORDERED THIS 26TH DAY OF JUNE, 2006.\n/s/Susan Webber Wright UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE'
 'IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS PINE BLUFF DIVISION\nTERRICK TERRELL NOONER\nPLAINTIFF\nNo. 5:06CV00110 SWW/JFF LARRY NORRIS, Director, Arkansas Department of Correction; GAYLON LAY, Warden, Arkansas Department of Correction; WENDY KELLY, Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs; JOHN BYUS; Administrator, Correctional Medical Services, Arkansas Department of Correction; and OTHER UNKNOWN EMPLOYEES, Arkansas Department of Correction \nDEFENDANTS\nORDER Plaintiff Terrick Terrell Nooner (“Nooner”), a death row inmate, brings this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that Arkansas’ lethal injection procedure and protocol amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational method of execution that violates the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Nooner seeks a declaration that the State’s lethal injection procedure is unconstitutional an injunction enjoining Defendants from carrying out the procedure in the future. Before the Court is a motion to intervene by Arkansas death row inmate Don William Davis (“Davis”). Nooner has no objection to intervention, see docket entry #3, 9, and Defendants have responded in objection to intervention (docket entry #9). After careful consideration, and for the reasons that follow, Davis will be permitted to intervene pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 24(b)(2).\nDavis, who is scheduled to be executed on July 5, 2006, seeks to intervene as of right, pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 24(a)(2) or, in the alternative, by permissive intervention under Fed R. Civ P. 24(b)(2). Pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 24(c), a motion to intervene “shall be accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.” No such pleading accompanies Davis’s motion. However, Davis states that if he is permitted to intervene in this case, rather than file a separate action, it will promote judicial economy. Based on this statement, the Court understands that Davis wishes to intervene as a party plaintiff and assert the same claims and seek the same relief as set forth in Plaintiff Nooner’s complaint.\nA party seeking intervention of right under Rule 24(a)(2) must establish (1) a recognized interest in the subject matter of the litigation, (2) the interest might be impaired by the disposition of the case, and (3) the interest will not be adequately protected by the existing parties. See Fed R. Civ P. 24(a)(2); see also South Dakota ex rel Barnett v. U.S Dept. of Interior, 317 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir. 2003).\nIn support of his application, Davis states that his interests will not be adequately represented by the existing parties because, unless he is permitted to intervene, his execution will go forward without regard to this proceeding. Defendants point out that Davis can protect his interest in the subject matter of this litigation by filing a separate lawsuit, which would warrant expedited treatment in light of his July 5 execution date. The Court agrees that, because Davis can protect his interest by way of a separate lawsuit, he is unable to establish that the disposition of this case will impair his interest. Accordingly, Davis is not entitled to intervention of right under Rule 24(a)(2).\nUnder Fed. Rule Civ P. 24(b)(2), upon timely application,1 anyone may be permitted to intervene “when an applicant’s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.” Davis meets this criterion. Additionally, the Court finds that Davis’s intervention will neither unduly delay nor prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. Accordingly, the Court will permit Davis to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2).2 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motion to intervene (docket entry #3) is GRANTED. Don William Davis is granted leave to intervene as a plaintiff in this action.\nIT IS SO ORDERED THIS 26TH DAY OF MAY,\n2006. /s/Susan Webber Wright UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE'

 'UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS\nPINE BLUFF DIVISION\nTERRICK TERRELL NOONER, et al., Plaintiffs v. Civil Action No. 5:06-cv-00110-SWW LARRY NORRIS, Director, Arkansas Department of Correction, et al., Defendants.\nRESPONSE TO PRO SE MOTION Comes now undersigned counsel, Julie Brain of the Arkansas Federal Public Defender Office, appointed counsel for Plaintiff Terrick Terrell Nooner, and respectfully submits this Response to Mr. Nooner’s pro se pleading, [Doc. 47], pursuant to this Court’s Order of December 15, 2006, [Doc. 49]. Counsel respectfully urges the Court to decline to consider Mr. Nooner’s pro se pleading, in accordance with its usual policy of rejecting motions filed pro se by parties who are represented by counsel, as it has on previous occasions. On May 1, 2006, Plaintiff, Terrick Terrell Nooner, through undersigned counsel, initiated the instant action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the constitutionality of the lethal injection protocol selected and used by Defendants for executions in the State of Arkansas. Since that time Mr. Nooner, who suffers from severe mental illness and has a lengthy history of filing voluminous, largely incomprehensible lawsuits and pleadings in the local, state and federal courts of Arkansas and Missouri, has filed a variety of pro se pleadings under the case number of the instant action and that of the associated appeal in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nFor example, on August 9, 2006, the Court received a document styled “Motion for Disclosure of Impeachment Evidence,” with a number of attachments in the form of documents relating to the Arkansas Department of Correction inmate grievance procedure. See Exhibit\n1. The pleading purported to request that Defendants “[p]roduce suspension of all alias employed federal officer’s [sic] in ADC if no medical photograph is made of my damaged penis for exhibit to court... [and] [p]roduce search and seizure by criminal court clerk of rape evidence on my penis.” Id. On two occasions the Court has formally instructed Mr. Nooner that he must pursue such claims in a separate lawsuit, [Doc.’s 38, 44], to no avail.\nOn August 21, 2006, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals received a pleading from Mr. Nooner entitled “Motion of Civil Action Complaint Against En Banc Justices of protective order to avoid medical photograph of my damaged penis.” Id. Most recently, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals received a pleading from Mr.\nNooner on December 18, 2006, that is styled “Motion for Voluntary Dismissal” and is similar to the pleading received by this Court. See Exhibit\n4. The Clerk of Court once again responded to Mr. Nooner, reminding him that he is represented by counsel and counsel must file all motions and pleadings in the appeal. Id.\nUndersigned counsel is in regular telephonic and in-person contact with Mr Nooner. Counsel last visited Mr. Nooner at the ADC Varner Unit on December 28, 2006, and had a very pleasant visit. To the limited extent that counsel is able to meaningfully communicate with Mr. Nooner regarding legal matters, counsel was able to ascertain that Mr. Nooner has no desire that the instant action be dismissed as to him per se. Rather, as is evident from many of Mr. Nooner’s actions and pleadings in this and many other cases that he has filed, his overriding goal is to seek redress for, and relief from, the physical harm that he perceives is being repeatedly inflicted on him by the staff of the ADC. As the courts routinely do not file these pro se motions, Mr. Nooner continues to seek court attention to what he perceives to be his ongoing mistreatment.\nMr. Nooner believes very strongly that he is being seriously and permanently injured by ADC staff in several ways. His chief complaint is that staff have damaged his penis, implanting a device with which they control his body, and that his repeated requests to have the damage photographed for purposes of litigation have been ignored. He also complains that staff are contaminating his food, and that a variety of people he is familiar with from the free world, including people from the neighborhood of Little Rock that he used to live in, are impersonating ADC correctional officers, appearing around him in the prison and raping him.\nMr. Nooner’s purpose in filing his pro se pleadings in this case, including the motion to which the Court directed undersigned counsel to respond, is to try to convince some court, somewhere, to listen to and act upon the only claims that are real to him and that make sense within the context of his delusional thought disorder. The urgency with which Mr. Nooner seeks to have his claims heard, and the fervor with which he believes in their merit, is completely understandable in the context of the psychotic disorder that he suffers and the particular fixed delusions that are caused by it. Undersigned counsel is actively seeking the opportunity to identify and diagnose Mr. Nooner’s condition in the context of another action, a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus which challenges the ADC’s refusal to allow counsel’s mental health professionals access to Mr. Nooner to evaluate his condition. See Nooner v. Norris, No. 5:96-cv-00495GH (E.D. Ark), appeal docketed, No. 06-3487 (8th Cir.). Counsel is unable to convey to Mr. Nooner that this Court, in this case, is unable to address the matters that are of concern to him, or that his interests will best be served by continuing to raise those concerns in separate lawsuits.\nThe proceedings in the instant case are reminiscent of the way in which Mr. Nooner’s mental illness interfered with his ability to comprehend the scope of the prior habeas corpus action in which his appointed counsel challenged his conviction and sentence of death. See Nooner v. Norris, 402 F.3d 801 (8th Cir. 2005). Before the district court, Mr. Nooner filed a pro se pleading apparently seeking to dismiss his habeas petition in its entirety and waive federal court review of his capital conviction and sentence Id. at 804.\nAn inquiry into his competency to waive his appeals, however, revealed that Mr. Nooner did not wish to “volunteer” for execution after all Id. at\n806. He had no desire to be executed, nor did he comprehend that withdrawing his petition might hasten his death; to the contrary, he had a delusional belief that “withdrawing his habeas petition would trigger a series of events (the setting of an execution date and his appearance before a clemency board) that would result in a ‘hidden or removed lawsuit’ that would exonerate him.” Id. The Eighth Circuit accordingly found that Mr. Nooner’s actions could not be deemed knowing and voluntary, and proceeded to adjudicate the merits of his petition. Id.\nA district court has no obligation to entertain pro se motions filed by a represented party. See, e.g., Abdullah v. United States, 240 F.3d 683, 686 (8th Cir. 2001); Taylor v. Dickel, 293 F.3d 427, 429 (8th Cir. 2002). In light of Mr. Nooner’s prolific history of filing pleadings pro se that are manifestations of his delusional beliefs and symptomatic of his severe mental illness, the Court should decline to entertain Mr. Nooner’s most recent pleading just as it has rejected his previous submissions.\nRespectfully submitted, JENNIFFER HORAN FEDERAL DEFENDER By: /s/ Julie Brain Julie Brain Assistant Federal Public Defender 1401 W.

 'IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS PINE BLUFF DIVISION\nTERRICK TERRELL NOONER, and \nDON WILLIAMS DAVIS\nPLAINTIFF INTERVENOR PLAINTIFF\nNo. 5:06CV00110 SWW VS.\nLARRY NORRIS, Director, Arkansas Department of Correction; GAYLON LAY, Warden, Arkansas Department of Correction; WENDY KELLY, Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs; JOHN BYUS; Administrator, Correctional Medical Services, Arkansas Department of Correction; and OTHER UNKNOWN EMPLOYEES, Arkansas Department of Correction \nDEFENDANTS\nORDER\nBefore the Court are pro se motions filed by Plaintiff Terrick Terrell Nooner (“Nooner”) for voluntary dismissal (docket entries #46, #55, #59), and responses by Federal Public Defender Julie C. Brain and Defendants (docket entries #52, #61, #63). After careful consideration, the Court finds that Nooner’s pro se motions should be denied.\nRepresented by Federal Public Defender Julie C. Brain, Arkansas death-row inmate Terrick Terrell Nooner commenced this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that the procedures and protocol used for carrying out execution by lethal injection in Arkansas are unconstitutional. Death-row inmates Don William Davis and Jack Harold Jones, Jr. sought and were granted leave to intervene as party-plaintiffs.1 Nooner has personally submitted several documents for filing that contain allegations which have no bearing on the issues in this case. Nooner alleges, for example, that prison employees have injured his penis and contaminated his food. By orders entered August 8, 2005 and December 13, 2006, the Court advised Nooner that it would take no action with regard to his pro se submissions and that if he wished to pursue additional claims, he must do so in a separate proceeding (docket entry #39, #44).\nOn December 14, 2006, the Court received a document from Nooner entitled “Motion of Voluntary Dismissal” in which he states: “I demand voluntary dismissal of this civil action or you produce the DNA blood test so I can exploit my digestion is infected because defendant spiked food.” Docket entry #46. Nooner has filed two amendments to his motion. In his most recent amendment, filed April 5, 2007, Nooner complains that Plaintiff Davis was permitted to intervene in this case without his consent and that Plaintiffs Davis and Jones have interfered with his mental evaluations.\nDefendants state they have no objection to Nooner’s motion. However, Federal Defender Brain asserts that that Nooner’s so-called motion for voluntary dismissal is simply another attempt by him to have the Court consider matters unrelated to this case. Attorney Brain reports that she is in regular contact with Nooner, and she has concluded that he has “no desire that the instant action be dismissed as to him per se.” Docket entry #52, at 3.\n/s/Susan Webber Wright UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE'
 'IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS PINE BLUFF DIVISION\nTERRICK TERRELL NOONER DON WILLIAM DAVIS JACK HAROLD JONES, JR.\nPLAINTIFF INTERVENOR-PLAINTIFF INTERVENOR-PLAINTIFF\nv\nNo. 5:06-CV- 110 SWW LARRY NORRIS, Director, Arkansas Department of Correction; GAYLON LAY, Warden, Arkansas Department of Correction; WENDY KELLY, Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs, Arkansas Department of Correction; JOHN BYUS, Administrator, Correctional Medical Services, Arkansas Department of Correction; and OTHER UNKNOWN EMPLOYEES, Arkansas Department of Correction \nDEFENDANTS\nBRIEF IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis is a civil rights lawsuit brought by three Arkansas prisoners who were convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The prisoners challenge the Arkansas protocol for lethal injection.\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint is replete with unsupported assertions, but at bottom the Complaint alleges that Arkansas’ three drug lethal injection protocol is unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Plaintiffs’ primary contention is that the protocol unreasonably risks subjecting the condemned prisoner to unnecessary pain. In particular, Plaintiffs contend that: (1) execution by lethal injection is essentially a surgical procedure and should be conducted according to the same approach used in hospitals for surgery; (2) anesthesiologists or comparable persons must be employed to carry out the execution procedures; (3) the amount of the first drug prescribed by the protocol to be given to the condemned prisoner is insufficient adequately to anesthetize the prisoner; and (4) the second and third drugs used for lethal injection result in unconstitutional pain. Each of these contentions is factually incorrect and/or legally insufficient and has already been rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\nArkansas’ lethal injection protocol uses the same three drugs prescribed by numerous other States that provide for execution by lethal injection. Challenges to the use of this three drug protocol have been rejected across the nation. In particular, Arkansas’ protocol is substantially identical to the protocol used by the State of Missouri. In June of 2007 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld Missouri’s protocol in response to a challenge by Missouri prisoners raising claims nearly identical to the ones in the instant suit. The Court of Appeals specifically held that the protocol did not violate the Constitution by subjecting condemned prisoners to an unreasonable risk of unnecessary pain noting that: (1) the protocol is designed to ensure a quick, painless death and “no State can carry out an execution in the same manner that a hospital monitors an operation;” (2) “there is no need for the continuing careful, watchful eye of an anesthesiologist or one trained in anesthesiology, whose responsibility... is to ensure that the patient will wake up at the end of the procedure;” (3) the dose of the first drug in the protocol to render the inmate unconscious is more than sufficient to anesthetize the inmate (the Missouri protocol calls for an amount of the first drug that is approximately 17 times the amount normally given as anesthesia for surgery; the Arkansas protocol calls for amount of the drug that is approximately 10 times the amount normally given for surgery); and (4) the risk of pain associated with the use of the second and third drugs in the protocol is too remote to be constitutionally significant. Taylor v. Crawford, 487 F.3d 1072, 1084-85 (8th Cir. 2007).\nSince the Supreme Court’s 2006 decision that prisoners could in some circumstances bring a Section 1983 suit to challenge the means of lethal injection, Hill v. McDonough, 126 S.Ct. 2096 (2006), courts across the country have heard and rejected challenges to the three drug protocol widely used by the states. See, e.g., Workman v. Bredesen, No. 07-5562, 2007 WL 1311330 (6th Cir. May 7, 2007), cert. denied, 127 S Ct. 2160 (2007)(upholding three drug protocol); Hamilton v. Jones, 472 F.3d 814 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S Ct. 1054 (2007)(same); Emmett v. Johnson, No. 3:07CV227, 2007 WL 1597783 (E.D.Va. Jun 01, 2007)(same). Most importantly, the Eighth Circuit’s decision upholding the Missouri protocol in Taylor in the face of the same challenges raised here is controlling precedent in this Circuit. Based on these precedents, and in light of the absence of any material dispute as to the applicable Arkansas protocol, Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law and their Motion for Summary Judgment should be granted.\nII. FACTS Arkansas administers the death penalty by lethal injection Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4617(a)(1). Under Arkansas law, the Arkansas Department of Correction (“ADC”) is responsible for executing felons who have been sentenced to death in the courts of this State Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617; see also Declaration of Larry Norris. Larry Norris has been the ADC’s Director since December 1993 and is responsible for the ADC’s overall operations. (Declaration of Larry Norris) As the ADC’s Director, Arkansas law requires Mr. Norris to determine the substances and procedures used during executions Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617(a)(2).\nOn or about June 26, 2007, and July 12, 2007, Mr. Norris consulted with Mark Dershwitz, M.D., Ph.D. to determine what changes, if any, to Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol would further reduce what Mr. Norris considered to be the already minimal possibility that a condemned inmate would experience unnecessary pain during an execution in the future. (Declaration of Larry Norris) Based on those consultations with Dr. Dershwitz, Mr. Norris’ own previous observations of lethal injection executions, and discussions that he had had over the years with other correctional professionals concerning lethal injection executions, Mr. Norris amended the ADC’s lethal injection protocol on July 16,\n2007. (Declaration of Larry Norris) The protocol requires that the Deputy Director or designee “be healthcare trained, educated, and/or experienced in matters related to the establishment and monitoring of IVs, the mixing and administration of lethal chemicals, and assessing the presence or absence of consciousness.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §I, 1) The protocol requires the Deputy Director or designee to have an intravenous infusion device placed in each arm, or other standard anatomical venous point of entry, of the condemned inmate and a solution of D5NS available for an infusion medium. Those person(s) engaged in this activity will be referred to as the IV Team and shall be healthcare providers who are qualified by training or credentials such as an emergency medical technician, nurse, or physician to initiate IV lines.\n(Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §II, 1) If a patent intravenous infusion site cannot be established, then the protocol requires the Deputy Director or designee to evaluate other possible infusion sites. All effort will be made to establish two (2) unrelated intravenous infusion sites. If one (1) patent infusion site is established, and a second site proves to be a futile effort, the Deputy Director, or designee, may direct the IV Team to suspend further action. In the case that no patent infusion site is established after reasonable attempts as determined by the IV Team, the Deputy Director, or designee will direct the IV Team to suspend further action and thereafter summon trained, educated, and experienced person(s) necessary to establish a primary IV line as a peripheral line or as a central venous line.\n(Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §II, 8) The protocol makes clear that “[e]very effort will be extended to the condemned inmate to ensure that no unnecessary pain or suffering is inflicted by the IV procedure. Standard practice of using a local anesthetic will be accommodated as necessary.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §II (emphasis omitted)).\nThe protocol employs a series of syringes to inject three chemicals in the following doses and order:\n• Syringe #7: 120 mEq of potassium chloride; • Syringe #8: 120 mEq of potassium chloride.\n(Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III IV, 1) After administration of Syringe #3, “the Deputy Director, or designee, will assess and monitor the condemned inmate’s lack of consciousness by using standard procedures as taught in basic life support or CPR courses, such as checking for movement, opened eyes, eyelash reflex, and response to verbal commands and physical stimuli.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.f) Only after the Deputy Director or designee determines that the condemned inmate is unconscious, and at least three (3) minutes have elapsed from starting Syringe #1, will the remaining chemicals be administered. (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.f) If the Deputy Director or designee determines that the condemned inmate is still conscious after administration of Syringe #3, then the protocol requires that the contents of back up syringes be injected in the secondary or alternative IV line as follows:\n• Syringe #B1: 1.5 grams of sodium pentothal; • Syringe #B2: 1.5 grams of sodium pentothal; • Syringe #B3: 50cc of normal saline. (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.f) “Once the Deputy Director, or designee, determines that the condemned inmate is unconscious, and at least three (3) minutes have elapsed from starting Syringe #B1, all remaining chemicals will be administered to the unconscious inmate in numerical sequence into the secondary or alternative IV line; Syringe #4 through Syringe #8.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.f) “Throughout the lethal chemical infusion process, the Deputy Director, or designee, will closely monitor the infusion site for evidence of infiltrate, vein collapse, or other challenge to the patency of the infusion site.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.i) If the Deputy Director or designee suspects a problem, he “will direct reduction of lethal chemical flow rate or redirect chemical to secondary site.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, § III, 2.i(1)) “If a singular infusion site is suspected to be compromised, chemical flow rate will be reduced. If problem persists, the: (a) administration procedure will be ceased; (b) curtain to death chamber will be closed; (c) IV Team summoned, and infusion site problem corrected.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, § III, 2.i(2)) The protocol further requires that If all efforts to re-establish patent infusion site fail, the Deputy Director, or designee, will direct the IV Team to suspend further action and trained, educated, and experienced person(s) necessary to establish a primary IV line as a peripheral line or as a central venous line will be summoned to facilitate an IV infusion site. (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.i(3)) “When the infusion compromise is corrected, the IV Team and the summoned person(s) will be excused, the curtain reopened, and the lethal injection procedure continued.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.i(4)) The protocol calls for the use of a cardiac monitor to be used to display heart function. (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.h) “When all lethal chemical syringes have been administered, and a flat-line is observed for a minimum of three (3) to five (5), three-second sweeps on the cardiac monitor, the Coroner shall be summoned for purpose of pronouncing death.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.h) A condemned inmate who is administered a 3,000 mg dose of thiopental sodium will be rendered unconscious, and not experience pain or suffering, for the time period necessary to complete the execution. (Declaration of Mark Dershwitz, M.D., Ph.D., 6 A 3,000 mg dose of thiopental sodium would render most people unconscious within 60 seconds from the time the injection of thiopental sodium begins. (Declaration of Mark Dershwitz, M.D., Ph.D., 10) By the time all 3,000 mg of thiopental sodium solution are injected more than 99.9999999% of the population would be unconscious. (Declaration of Mark Dershwitz, M.D., Ph.D., 10) There is an exceedingly small risk that a condemned inmate to whom the lethal injection protocol in Arkansas is properly administered would experience any pain or suffering associated with the administration of lethal doses of pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. (Declaration of Mark Dershwitz, M.D., Ph.D., 16) The application of the protocol for the administration of lethal injection results in the condemned inmate undergoing a rapid, painless, and humane death, and furthermore the inmate will not experience any unnecessary pain or suffering. (Declaration of Mark Dershwitz, M.D., Ph.D., 17) As a result, Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol does not present a substantial foreseeable risk of the wanton infliction of pain and the Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW Summary judgment is to be “rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed R. Civ P. 56(c). The initial burden is on the moving party to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact requiring the trier of fact to resolve the dispute in favor of one party or the other. Celotex Corp v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986). An issue of fact is material only if the fact could affect the outcome of the case under governing law. Anderson, 477 U.S. at\n248. The non-moving party must establish that there is a genuine issue of material fact in order to survive a motion for summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Matsushita Elec Indus. Co., Ltd v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86 (1986). To establish the existence of a genuine issue, the non-moving party must produce “specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Fed R. Civ P. 56(e); Matsushita, 475 U.S. at\n587. The mere existence of some disputed factual issues will not defeat a summary judgment motion where the disputed issues are not genuine issues of material fact. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247-48. A disputed issue is genuine if the evidence could lead a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-moving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.\nIV. ARKANSAS’ LETHAL INJECTION PROTOCOL DOES NOT PRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL FORESEEABLE RISK OF THE WANTON INFLICTION OF\nPAIN AND IS CONSTITUTIONAL IN ALL RESPECTS. Arkansas has broad discretion to determine the procedures for conducting an execution. See Taylor, 487 F.3d at 1084 (quoting McKenzie v. Day, 57 F.3d 1461, 1469 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1104 (1995). By statute, Arkansas has authorized Defendant Larry Norris to exercise this wide discretion Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617(a)(2). On July 16, 2007, Mr. Norris exercised it and adopted the lethal injection protocol that is currently in place in this State. “The whole point of [Arkansas’] protocol is to avoid the needless infliction of pain, not to cause it.” Taylor, 487 F3d at 1085 (quoting Workman v. Bredesen, 486 F.3d 896, 907 (6th Cir. 2007). In Taylor v. Crawford, a condemned Missouri inmate alleged that that State’s lethal injection protocol created a significant risk that he would experience the wanton infliction of pain because if the first chemical, thiopental, did not sufficiently anesthetize him, he would feel pain caused by the third chemical, potassium chloride, but would not be able to indicate that he was experiencing pain because of the paralyzing effects of the second chemical, pancuronium bromide. Id., 487 F.3d 1072, 1074 (8th Cir. 2007). The Plaintiffs make virtually identical claims in this lawsuit.\nAfter an evidentiary hearing, the district court ruled that Missouri’s protocol, which at that time had not been reduced to writing, was unconstitutional Id. at\n1078. Pursuant to an order from that court, Missouri submitted a written protocol that is very much like the one that is in effect in Arkansas today. The court ruled that that protocol was unconstitutional because, among other things, it did not require a physician with training in anesthesia to mix the chemicals and did not require the monitoring of anesthetic depth Id. at\n1078. Missouri sought reconsideration, which was denied, and appealed. Id.\nOn June 4, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and held that Missouri’s written lethal injection protocol did not violate the Eighth Amendment Id. at\n1085. The court explained that a State’s lethal injection procedure does not violate that Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment unless it involves “a substantial foreseeable risk of the wanton infliction of pain.” Id. at\n1082. The risk of an accident is not a factor in that determination. Id., 487 F.3d at\n1080. Indeed, the court left no doubt that the “risk of accident cannot and need not be eliminated from the execution process in order to survive constitutional review.” Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Eighth Circuit further emphasized that the courts must focus on the procedure as written and ask whether it inherently involves a substantial risk of the wanton infliction of pain Id. “The Constitution does not require the use of execution procedures that may be medically optimal in clinical contexts.” Id. at 1085 (citing Hamilton v. Jones, 472 F.3d 814, 816 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S.Ct. 1054 (Jan. 8, 2007)). What could be done to update or improve the protocol is not the appropriate inquiry Id. (citing Abdur’ Rahman v. Bredesen, 181 S.W.3d 292, 309 (Tenn. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S Ct. 2288 (2006). “Where the ‘procedures are reasonably calculated to ensure a swift, painless death,’ they are ‘immune from constitutional attack.’” Id. (quoting McKenzie v. Day, 57 F.3d 1461, 1469 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1104 (1995).\nThe Plaintiffs’ allegations that Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol creates an unnecessary risk that they will experience the wanton infliction of pain are unfounded for several reasons. First, the protocol requires the individuals who establish the IV lines to be “healthcare providers who are qualified by training or credentials such as an emergency medical technician, nurse, or physician to initiate IV lines.” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §II, 1) Moreover, the Deputy Director or designee “shall be healthcare trained, educated, and/or experienced in matters related to the establishment and monitoring of IVs[.]” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §I, 1) Thus, Arkansas’ protocol, like Missouri’s, requires that the IV lines be started by qualified individuals.\nSecond, Arkansas’ protocol requires the Deputy Director or designee to “closely monitor the infusion site for evidence of infiltrate, vein collapse, or other challenge to the patency of the infusion site” and to take appropriate action if a problem is suspected. (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §III, 2.i) As stated in the preceding paragraph, this individual must be “healthcare trained, educated, and/or experienced in matters related to the establishment and monitoring of IVs[.]” (Declaration of Larry Norris, Ex. A, §I, 1) Arkansas’ protocol, like Missouri’s, requires that the IV lines be monitored by a qualified individual.\nThird, like Missouri’s protocol, Arkansas’ ensures that condemned inmates are unconscious before the pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered. Arkansas’ protocol calls for the injection of 3,000 mg of thiopental sodium before the other two chemicals are injected. This dose would render most people unconscious within 60 seconds from the time the injection of thiopental sodium began. By the time all 3,000 mg of thiopental sodium solution are injected more than 99.9999999% of the population would be unconscious. Even though a condemned inmate who is administered a 3,000 mg dose of thiopental sodium will be rendered unconscious, and not experience pain or suffering, for the time period necessary to complete the execution, the protocol contains the additional safeguard of requiring the Deputy Director or designee to assess and monitor the inmate’s lack of consciousness after administration of Syringe #3. The protocol requires that this person be healthcare trained, educated, and/or experienced in assessing the presence or absence of consciousness. The pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride will be injected only if the Deputy Director of designee determines that the condemned inmate is unconscious, and at least three minutes have elapsed from the beginning of the administration of Syringe #1.\nIf the Deputy Director or designee determines that the inmate is still conscious after the first three syringes have been administered, then the protocol requires that a back-up dose of sodium pentothal and an additional saline flush be administered. The remaining chemicals may not be injected until after the Deputy Director or designee determines that the condemned inmate is unconscious and at least three minutes have elapsed from the start of the administration of the back-up dose of sodium pentothal. Consequently, the risk that a condemned inmate to whom Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol is properly administered would experience any pain or suffering associated with the administration of lethal doses of pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride is exceedingly small. The application of the protocol for the administration of lethal injection results in the condemned inmate undergoing a rapid, painless, and humane death, and furthermore the inmate will not experience any unnecessary pain or suffering.\nAs written, Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol is substantively similar in all material respects to the Missouri protocol that the Eighth Circuit upheld in Taylor v. Crawford, 487 F.\nany unnecessary pain or suffering. Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol completely satisfies the Constitution, so the Court should grant summary judgment in favor of the Defendants.\nRespectfully submitted, \nDUSTIN\nMcDANIEL Attorney General BY: Ark.\n323 Little (501) /s/ C.

 'United States Court of Appeals \nFOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\nTerrick Terrell Nooner, Appellee, Don William Davis, Intervenor-Appellee v. Larry Norris, in his official capacity as Director, Arkansas Departm ent of Correction; Gaylon Lay, in his official capacity as Warden, Arkansas Department of Correction, Cummins Unit; Wendy Kelly, in her official capacity as Deputy Director of Health and Correctional Programs, Arkansas Department of Correction; John Byus, in his of ficial capacity as Administrator, Correctional Medical Services, Arkansas Department of Correction; DOES, 1-50, unknown executioners, in their official capacities as employees and/or agents of the Arkansas Department of Correction, Appellants.\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.\nSubmitted: March 15, 2007 Filed: July 9, 2007 Before COLLOTON, HANSEN, and GRUENDER, Circuit Judges.\nHANSEN, Circuit Judge.\nThe district court granted Don WilliamDavis a preliminary injunction staying his execution to perm it him to litigate the constitutionality of Arkansas\' s lethal injection protocol in a suit brought pursuant o 42 U.S.C. §\n1983. In this interlocutory appeal, see 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), theAppellants (collectively, ""the State"") contend that the district court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.1 We agree, and accordingly we reverse the judgm ent of the d istrict court, dissolve the preliminary injunction it imposed, and vacate the stay of execution it entered.\nI.\nIn 1993, the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed Mr. Davis\'s conviction for capital murder and his sentence of deat h by lethal injection, Davis v. State 863 S.W.2d 259 (Ark. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1026 (1994), and in 2001, affirmed the denial of his petition for postconviction relief, Davis v. State, 44 S.W.3d 726 (Ark. 2001). In 2005, we affirmed the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254, seeDavis v. Norris, 423 F.3d 868 (8th Cir. 2005), and the Supreme Court rejected his untimely petition for certiorari on April 17, 2006.\nOn May 4, 2006, Mr. Davis filed a m otion to intervene as a party plaintiff in this § 1983 action, which Terrick Nooner originally filed on May 1,\n2006. The lawsuit challenges Arkansas\'s three-chemical lethal injection protocol, asserting that the State\'s protocol creates a significant risk of inflicting severe pain in the administration of the death sentence, and that the State\'s use of this protocol demonstrates deliberate indiff erence to the plaintiffs\' serious medical needs. Specifically, the complaint alleges that the State\'s protocol presents a risk of error in administering the drugs that could result in inadequate anesthetization, creating a substantial risk that the first in jection (two grams of sodium thiopental) will fail to render him unconscious, leaving himparalyzed by the second chemical (pancuronium bromide), and suffering severe pain by the subsequent administration of the third chemical (potassium chloride). Additiona lly, the com plaint references four prior executions alleged to have been ""botched."" The district court granted Mr. Davi s\'s motion to intervene on May 26,\n2006. Before that ruling was filed, however, the governor had set an execution date of July 5, 2006, for Mr Davis\nMr. Davis then sought a preliminary injunction to stay his impending execution by means of the current protocol. The State resisted, arguing that the claim was not likely to succeed on the merits and that the public interest and principles of equity, including unjustified delay in bringni g the claim, weighed heavily against the grant of an injunction. The di strict court rejected these arguments and granted the preliminary injunction on June 26, 2006, staying Mr. Davis\'s execution. The State filed this appeal.2 \nII.\n""We generally review a district court\'s decision to stay execution for an abuse of discretion."" Roberts v. Norris, 415 F.3d 816, 819 (8th Cri. 2005) (citing Bowersox v. Williams, 517 U.S. 345, 346 (1996)). ""A district court abuses its discretion when it applies an incorrect legalstandard."" Lauer v. Barnhart, 321 F.3d 762, 764 (8th Cir. 2003). After carefully considering the record and the standards used by the district court, we conclude that the district co urt abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction and stay of execution. See Taylor Corp v. Four Seasons Greetings, LLC, 403 F.3d 958, 967 (8th Cir. 2005) (""An abuse of discretion occurs when the district court bases its decision on an erroneous application of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact."").\nA stay of execution is anequitable remedy, and an inmate challenging a state\'s lethal injection protocol through a § 1983 action is not entitled to a stay of execution as a matter of course. Hill v. McDonough, 126 S Ct. 2096, 2104 (2006); Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 649 (2004). The Supreme Court reemphasized in Hill that ""inmates seeking time to challenge the ma nner in which the State plans to execute them must satisfy all of the requirem ents for a stay, including a showing of a significant possibility of success on themerits."" 126 S Ct. at 2104; seealso Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.S. 880, 895 (1983) (requiring a ""significant possibility"" of success and ""a likelihood that irreparable harm will result"" absent a stay). The Court also noted in Hill that ""equity must be sensitive to the State\'s strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference from the federal courts."" 126 S Ct. at\n2104. Fina lly, in this c ontext, a court ""must also apply \'a strong equita ble presumption against the grant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\'"" Id. (quoting Nelson, 541 U.S. at 650). In other words, ""before granting a stay, a district court must consider not only the likelihood of success on the merits and the relative harms to the parties, but also the extento which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim which counsels ag ainst the entry of an equitable rem edy. Nelson, 541 U.S. at 649-50.\nThe district court rejected the State\'sassertion of unnecessary delay, finding no delay at all and therefore not applying the presum ption against the grant of a stay, which arises when the claim could have been brought in time to consider the merits without requiring a stay. The district court found it was sufficient that Mr. Davis had moved to join this suit ""before the State set his execution date and sh ortly after he exhausted all means for cha llenging his conviction."" (Appe llants\' Add. at 5.) We conclude that this is not the correct standard for determining delay in this context.\nOnce a state inmate\'s sentence of death has become final on direct review in the state\'s courts,3 there is no im pediment to filing a § 1983 action challenging the constitutionality of a state\'s lethal injection protocol as long as lethal injection is the established method of execution, the protocol is known, and no state administrative remedies are available. See Gomez v \nU. S\nDist. Court for the N Dist. of Calif., 503 U.S. 653, 653-54 (1992) (criticizing a n inmate for bringing a § 1983 m ethod of execution claim (challenging lethal gas) shortly before his execution date when the claim was not raised earlier but ""could have been brought more than a decade ago""); see also Jones v. Allen 485 F.3d 635, 640 (11th Cir.) (finding that there was no reason for waiting until 2006 to challenge lethal injection where the inm ate\'s conviction became final on direct review in 1988, and the legislature adopted lethal injection in 2002 while the inmate\'s habeas petition was pending), cert. denied, 127 S Ct. 2160 (2007); Cooey v. Strickland 479 F.3d 412, 421-22 (6th Cir. 2007) (finding that because a § 1983 challenge to a lethal injection protocol must accrue at some point before the time when the lethal injection protocol is actually imposed, ""it stands to reason that the next most appropriate accrual date [is] upon conclusion of direct review in the state court or the expriation of time for seeking such review,"" and noting that the accrual date must be adjusted if lethal injection was not adopted until some later date); Smith v. Johnson, 440 F.3d 262, 263 (5th Cir. 2006) (noting the Fifth Circuit holds that a method of execution challenge ""\'may be filed any time after the plaintiff\'s conviction has become final on direct review\'"") (quoting Neville v. Johnson, 440 F.3d 221 (5th C ir. 2006)). But see Nelson, 541 U.S. at 650 (noting that other limitations may apply to an inmate\' s ability to bring a § 1983 claim such as limitations imposed by the Prison Litigati on Reform Act of 1995, ""requir[ing] that inmates exhaust available state adm inistrative remedies before bringing a § 1983 action challenging the conditions of their confinement""). For purposes of this case, the State acknowledged during oral argument that an Arkansas inmate can challenge the lethal injection protocol immediately after direct review.\n""[A] death sentence cannot begin to be craried out by the State while substantial legal issues [concerning the conviction or sentence] remain outstanding."" Barefoot, 463 U.S. at\n888. Upon completion of collateral review, however, the State is free to set an execution date, and there is a strong likelihood that any challenge to the lethal injection protocol brought thereafter will be interrupted by the establishm ent of an execution date. See Calderon v. Thom pson, 523 U.S. 538, 556 (1998) (""A State\' s interests in finality are compelling when a federal court of appeals issues a mandate denying federal habeas relief.""); Jones, 485 F.3d at 639-40 n.2 (noting that ""[a]s a matter of common sense, completion of collateral review eliminates the last possible obstacle to execution,"" making it likely that an execution date will ""be set promptly upon completion of collateral review""). At that point, there can be no doubt that execution is imminent, and this imminency weighs against the grant of a stay where the inmate has delayed unjustif iably in bringing a challenge to the lethal injection protocol. See Cooey, 479 F.3d at 419 (stating that waiting until ""the point of imminency plus exhaustion of federal collateral remedies adds a significant period of delay... and disrupts the fni al yet vital balance betweenstate and federal relations""). The Supreme Court has clearly set forth ""a strong equitable presumption against the grant of a stay where a clai m could have been brought at such a tim e as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay."" Nelson, 541 U.S. at 650; see Jones, 485 F.3d at 639-40 n.2 (""Waiting tofile suit until the Supreme Court has denied certiorari review of an inmate\'s federal habeas petition... is simply too late to avoid the inevitable need for a stay of execution."").\nThe proper inquiry, therefore, ""is whether [Mr. Davis] could have brought his claim \'at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.\'"" Jones, 485 F.3d at 641 (quoting Nelson 541 U.S. at 650.) The district court did not give proper consideration to this inquiry. Our review of the record reveals that direct review of Mr. Davi s\'s conviction and sentence was completed in 1994, well over a decade before he challenged the lethal injection protocol. Lethal injection has been the primary method of execution in Arkansas since 1983, and the written protocol document challenged here has been in existence since 1996, with no allegation that the protocol has been altered at any time. See White v. Johnson, 429 F.3d 572, 574 (5th C ir. 2005) (c oncluding that a § 1983 c hallenge to the lethal injection procedure brought after waiting six years on death row was dilatory when the same procedure had been in place the entire time). The complaint refers to four prior allegedly ""botched"" executions to demonstrate the State\'s knowledge of failures in the protocol, but three of these had already occurred before the conclusion of Mr. Davis\'s direct review in\n1994. The otheroccurred in May of 2000, approximately six years before Mr. Davis attempted to bring this claim Mr. Davis at no time attempted to raise this claim during the tim e his state postconviction or federal habeas proceedings were pending, and he offe rs no justification for waiting until 2006 to challenge the protocol. See Neville, 440 F.3d at 223 (finding it im proper to grant equitable relief where no excuse was offered for the delay) Mr. Davis\'s delay gives rise to the equitable presum ption against a stay in this case, and he has offered no basis for overcomi ng that strong presum ption. See Gomez, 503 U.S. at 653-54 (vacating a stay of execution due to ""abus ive delay"" for which there was ""no good reason,"" and refusing to consider a challengeto a method of execution which, at least according to the dissent, had considerable merit); Smith, 440 F.3d at 263 (affirming the dismissal of a § 1983 complaint challenging lethal injection and denying a motion for stay where the inmate failed to provide a reasonable justification for not filing the claim until nine years after his direct appeal had been final); White, 429 F.3d at 574 (not deciding whether inmate had stated a claim because ""\'even if he does, he is not entitled to the equitable relief he seeks\' due to his dilatory filing"" (quoting Harris v. Johnson, 376 F.3d 414, 417 (5th Cir. 2004)).\nMr. Davis argues that his case is controlled by this court\'s recent opinion in Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095 (8th Cir. 2006), because Taylor was allowed to proceed with the merits of his claim where he brought suit after completing habeas review and before an execution date had been set. Mr.Davis, however, overlooks the fact that the issue of unjustified delay by the inmate was not raised or litigated in Taylor. While we noted in Taylor that the inmate had filed suit over six m onths before the death warrant was issued, id. at 1096-97, this reference served only to emphasize the district court\'s failure to move the case to a hearing. A prompt hearing on the merits in that case could have resolved the issue before an execution date was set, eliminating the need for a stay. Anydelay on Mr. Taylor\'s part was never raised. Consequently, the Taylor opinion does not inform our decision as to Mr. Davis\' s unjustified delay in bringing his claim.\nNor do we believe that the Supreme Court\'s recent decision in Panetti v. Quarterman, No. 06-6407, 2007 WL 1836653 (June 28, 2007), is applicable to Mr. Davis\'s case. Panetti deals with mental competence to be executed, a condition of the mind which may not manifest itself until solate a time that a stay becomes necessary in order to evaluate properlythe asserted mental deficiency. That cannot be said about an execution protocol which, as we ha ve pointed out, has been long known and unchanged in its imp lementation for years, thereby permitting an evaluation of its constitutionality without the necessity of the issuance, in effect, of an eleventh hour stay.\nIII. Because the district court failed to applythe correct legal standard, we reverse the district court\'s grant of a prelimin ary injunction, and we vacate the stay of execution it issued in this case.\nMichael E.

Civil Action No. 5:06-cv-00110-SWW LARRY NORRIS, et al., Defendants.\nPLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT Come now Plaintiffs, Terrick Terrell Nooner, Don William Davis and Jack Harold Jones, by and through counsel, and respectfully submit their Response in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment I. INTRODUCTION “[S]ummary judgments should be cautiously invoked so that no person will be improperly deprived a trial of disputed factual issues.” Arkansas Right to Life v. Butler, 983 F Supp. 1209, 1215 (W.D Ark. 1997), aff’d 146 F.3d 558 (8th Cir.1998). It is “an extreme remedy which should be sparingly employed.” Giordano v. Lee, 434 F.2d 1227, 1230 (8th Cir. 1970). “Summary judgment is a lethal weapon, and courts must... beware of overkill in its use.” Brunswick Corp v. Vineberg, 370 F.2d 605, 612 (5th Cir. 1967). A “series of Supreme Court decisions” indicate that “summary judgment may not be appropriate in complicated and important litigation.” 10B CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER, MARY K. KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE CIVIL § 2732 (3d ed. 2007). See, e.g., Kennedy v. Silas Mason Co., 334 U.S. 249, 256 (1948) (warning against using 10B WRIGHT MILLER, supra, at § 2732.2. See, e.g., Arkansas Right to Life, 983 F Supp. at 1215 (denying summary judgment in part because, “in cases premised on alleged violations of a person’s constitutional rights, summary judgment may be inappropriate”).\nWhether or not a moving party meets its summary judgment burden, a court may always deny summary judgment in its discretion. See McClain v. Meier, 612 F.2d 349, 356 (8th Cir. 1979) (“[A] district court in passing on a Rule 56 motion performs what amounts to what may be called a negative discretionary function. The court has no discretion to Grant a motion for summary judgment, but even if the court is convinced that the moving party is entitled to such a judgment the exercise of sound judicial discretion may dictate that the motion should be Denied, and the case fully developed.”); see generally Jack H. Friedenthal Joshua E. Gardner, Judicial Discretion to Deny Summary Judgment in the Era of Managerial Judging, 31 HOFSTRA L REV. 91, 104 (2002) (“The majority of federal courts have held that judges have discretion to deny a motion for summary judgment, even if the parties\' submissions would justify granting the motion. The First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Federal Circuits have each adopted this view.”) The general principles outlined above counsel denial of Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment in this case. More specifically, the Defendants’ Motion should be denied on two independent grounds. First, it is premature in that it is based upon facts that only came into existence 11 days ago and Plaintiffs have had no opportunity for discovery. Second, even on the record as it currently stands, there are numerous genuine issues of material fact which preclude the entry of summary judgment \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nPlaintiffs are Arkansas prisoners under sentence of death. On May 1, 2006, Plaintiff Terrick Terrell Nooner, by and through undersigned counsel, filed suit under 28 U.S.C. § 1983, complaining that Defendants’ proposed means of executing him constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it creates a substantial and unnecessary risk that Mr. Nooner will be fully conscious and suffer torturous pain for the duration of the execution process. [Doc. 1] Mr. Nooner’s Complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that the Defendants’ lethal injection protocol is unconstitutional and also seeks to permanently enjoin them from carrying out their unconstitutional protocol Id. at 57–61.\nOn May 4, 2006, Plaintiff Don William Davis moved to intervene in this action. This Court granted his Motion on May 26,\n2006. Defendants moved to dismiss the action, and that Motion was denied by this Court on June 19,\n2006. [Doc. 24.] Meanwhile, Mr. Davis sought, (Appl Prelim. Inj.) [Doc. 21], and then on June 26 was granted, a preliminary injunction staying his imminent execution, (Order) [Doc. 29]. In its Order granting the stay of Mr. Davis’s execution, this Court held that the evidence and arguments presented by Mr. Davis satisfied the requisites for a stay. Specifically, this Court found (1) that there was a threat of irreparable harm to Mr. Davis, (2) that the balance of the equities favored Mr. Davis, (3) that there was a probability that the Plaintiffs would succeed on the merits, and (4) that the public interest would be served by staying Mr. Davis’s execution to permit deliberate litigation of his claims Id. at 5–7. In addition, this Court held (5) that the State’s proffered defense of inexcusable delay lacked merit. Id.\nDefendants immediately moved to vacate the stay in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. This was denied on July 13,\n2006. See Nooner v. Norris, No. 06-2748 (8th Cir. July 13, 2006) (unpublished order). On July 20, 2006, Defendants informed the Eighth Circuit that they intended to take an appeal from this Court’s stay of execution notwithstanding the Eighth Circuit’s denial of their Motion to Vacate. Defendants filed their opening brief in the Eighth Circuit on September 25, 2006; Mr. Davis responded on January 2, 2007; and Defendants replied on January 17,\n2007. Oral argument was held before the Eighth Circuit on March 15, 2007.\nOn July 9, 2007, a panel of the Eighth Circuit reversed Mr. Davis’s stay of execution. (Op. at 9) [Doc. 65]. Notably, the Court of Appeals did not question this Court’s holding that Mr. Davis had satisfied the ordinary requisites for a preliminary injunction and stay, i.e., irreparable harm, favorable equities, likelihood of success, and service of the public interest. Rather, the Eighth Circuit held—based upon the demonstrably flawed assumptions that Defendants’ 1996 written lethal injection protocol was still in effect, and that Mr. Davis had long had notice of that protocol—only that the state’s “unreasonable delay” defense to a stay of execution was valid as against Mr Davis. While this case pended in the Eighth Circuit, the third Plaintiff, Jack Jones was granted leave to intervene. [Doc. 42.] The day after this case returned from the Eighth Circuit to this Court, on July 10, 2007, Plaintiffs moved for expedited discovery so that this case could be resolved on the merits prior to Plaintiffs’ execution. Plaintiffs served the Defendants with requests for production and with interrogatories on July 12 and July 13, respectively. Defendants purported to “agree that this case should be expeditiously resolved,” [Doc. 65], but nonetheless opposed Plaintiffs’ request for expedited discovery. [Doc. 76.] On July 17, 2007, Defendants moved for summary judgment [Doc. 73], proffering “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” [Doc. 74, Ex.2] as the basis for their Motion. “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” is a new written lethal injection protocol that Defendants created on the day prior to filing for summary judgment. Notwithstanding the obvious exigencies in this case, Defendants have to date not produced any documents or answered any interrogatories in response to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests, which Defendants have now had for eighteen days \nIII. ARGUMENT\nA. SUMMARY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE DENIED AS PREMATURE UNDER FED\nR. CIV\nP. 56(F) BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TIME FOR INVESTIGATION AND RESEARCH INTO DEFENDANTS’ BRAND NEW WRITTEN LETHAL INJECTION PROCEDURE.\nDefendants cannot be permitted simultaneously to change suddenly many material facts involved in this complex litigation and to end the case summarily. Summary judgment should not be granted where it may be the result of unfair surprise. See Bennett v. City of Eastpointe, 410 F.3d 810, 817 (6th Cir. 2005); Clorox v. Proctor Gamble, 228 F.3d 24, 31 (1st Cir. 2000); Macklin v. Butler, 553 F.2d 525, 529 (7th Cir. 1977). In considering a motion for summary judgment, courts have a duty to “ensure... that neither side in a dispute [has] unfairly surprise[d] the other with evidence that the other has not had time to consider.” Orsi v. Kirkwood, 999 F.2d 86, 91 (4th Cir. 1993).\nGranting summary judgment on the basis of evidence created and disclosed by the Defendants simultaneously with their Motion for Summary Judgment would constitute unfair surprise. The Defendants surprise attack in this regard represents a valid reason justifying any failure of proof under Rule 56(f). To prevent the Defendants from gaining an unfair advantage by moving for summary judgment and springing a rewritten protocol upon Plaintiffs at the same time, Plaintiffs must be permitted more time to conduct investigation and research in light of “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure.” Cf. Walters v. City of Ocean Springs, 626 F.2d 1317, 1321 (5th Cir. 1980) (“Rule 56(f) may apply... where the opposing party has not been able to locate a witness, or having located him has been unable to secure an affidavit from him and has not had time to take his deposition....”) As attested in the attached Affidavit of Julie Brain, Ex. 1, Plaintiffs need to conduct further research and investigation into “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,” including consulting with multiple additional experts. Plaintiffs believe that such research and investigation will lead to additional genuine issues of material fact with respect to whether Defendants’ execution procedure engenders unnecessary risks of inflicting pain and suffering.\nWhile Plaintiffs firmly believe that further investigation and research would reveal the forgoing, they simply have not had time to obtain admissible evidence in this regard because they did not have access to “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” until eleven days ago. In sum, the Defendants’ surprise creation and disclosure of a newly rewritten lethal injection protocol excuses any failure of proof that this Court may discern under Rule 56(f) and precludes the entry of summary judgment.\nB. SUMMARY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE DENIED AS PREMATURE UNDER FED\nR. CIV\nP. 56(f) BECAUSE DISCOVERY HAS YET TO BE CONDUCTED Defendants’ Motion is premature and should be denied because the discovery process has not even begun in this matter and consequently Plaintiffs have not had a reasonable opportunity to present all available facts in support of their Opposition. “As a general rule, summary judgment is proper ‘only after the nonmovant has had adequate time for discovery.’” Iverson v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co., 172 F.3d 524, 530, (8th Cir. 1999) (quoting In re TMJ Litigation, 113 F.3d 1484, 1490 (8th Cir. 1997)). See also Celotex Corp v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) (summary judgment appropriate when, “after adequate time for discovery,” party fails to establish existence of essential element of party’s case as to which he bears burden of proof); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 257 (1986) (plaintiff must present affirmative evidence to defeat proper motion for summary judgment “as long as the plaintiff has had a full opportunity to conduct discovery”).\nIndeed, the very text of Rule 56 presumes that a party will have had access to discovery before being forced to respond to a motion for summary judgment. Rule 56(c) states that the court should consider, inter alia, the “depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file” in assessing whether summary judgment is appropriate. See also Boyd v. Wexler, 275 F.3d 642, 647 (7th Cir. 2001) (criterion for summary judgment assumes that there will have been “evidence gathered in discovery”).\nFed R. Civ P. 56(f) expressly provides for the denial of summary judgment motions if the nonmoving party has not had an opportunity to make full discovery. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 326.1 The purpose of this Rule is to guard against the improvident dismissal of valid claims 1 Rule 56(f) provides: Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify his opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be pursuant to premature summary judgment motions, and thus it “‘should be applied with a spirit of liberality.’” United States v. Casino Magic Corp., 293 F.3d 419, 426 (8th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (quoting 10B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.\nengenders unnecessary risks of inflicting pain and suffering. Defendants have developed their procedures and conducted these executions largely in secret, shielded from public access, and have taken the position that the information that Plaintiffs seek is exempt from disclosure under the State’s Freedom of Information Act Id. Accordingly, Defendants’ request for summary judgment based upon their own version of the facts surrounding their conduct of executions, made without affording Plaintiffs an opportunity to formally discover evidence that may cast doubt on that version, is plainly premature and should be denied.\nIn a related filing, [Doc. 76] (Defendants’ Response to Nooner’s Motion for Expedited Discovery), Defendants criticize Plaintiffs for failing to propound discovery requests during the time in which the matter was before the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on Defendants’ appeal of this Court’s Order granting a stay of execution to allow consideration of the merits of the action. Plaintiffs note that they were not permitted to commence the discovery process until the parties conferred pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 26(f), see Fed R. Civ P. 26(d), that by Local Rule the Rule 26(f) conference is scheduled by the issuance of an Initial Scheduling Order, Local Rule 16.1, and no such order ever issued in this case.\nIn any event, regardless of one’s view in hindsight of how Plaintiffs should have proceeded, on July 17, 2007, Defendants issued a brand new written lethal injection procedure. See Doc. 74-3 (“Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure Rev. 7-16-2007). Only on that date, then, could Plaintiffs begin to discover the facts relevant to the procedure in accordance with which Defendants currently intend to put them to death. Indeed, if Plaintiffs had conducted discovery procedures prior to the issuance of the current document, a whole new round of procedures would have been required following the change of written protocol. In no sense, then, can Plaintiffs be said to have had an adequate opportunity to discover all of the facts essential to their opposition to summary judgment.\nPlaintiffs have complied with the technical requirements of Rule 56(f). As noted, accompanying this Response is the Affidavit of Julie Brain, counsel for Plaintiff Terrick Terrell Nooner. Ex.\n1. The Affidavit details the information Plaintiffs need to respond adequately to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, explains why that information is likely to produce a genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment, and provides adequate reasons why such information cannot be presented at this time. See FED \nR. CIV\nP. 56(f). For the forgoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgement should be denied as premature.\nB. EVEN ON THE EXISTING RECORD THERE ARE NUMEROUS GENUINE ISSUES OF MATERIAL FACT THAT DISENTITLE DEFENDANTS TO JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW.\n1. There Are Numerous Genuine Issues of Material Fact Even on the record as it stands, prior to any discovery being conducted, this case is replete with genuine issues of material fact that preclude the entry of summary judgment. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), a moving party may prevail on a motion for summary judgment only if it “show[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” A fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome” of a case. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A dispute about that fact is “genuine,” and summary judgment “will not lie,” where “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Id. At this stage, the issue need not be resolved in the party’s favor; “all that is required is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties’ differing versions of the truth at trial.” Id. at 248–49.\nIn considering motions for summary judgment, courts must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Carrington v. City of DeMoines, Iowa, 481 F.3d 1046, 1050 (8th Cir. 2007). In other words, summary judgment should not be granted if there is “the slightest doubt” about the truth of moving party’s version of any material fact. Clausen Sons v Theo. Hamm Brewing, 395 F.2d 388, 389 (8th Cir. 1968); Armco Steel v. Realty Inv., 273 F.2d 483, 484 (8th Cir. 1960) (“A genuine issue of fact exists for the purpose of avoiding a summary judgment whenever there is the slightest doubt as to the facts.”); see Williams v. Thomson Corp., 383 F.3d 789, 791 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding that “the district court correctly applied the summary judgment standard by resolving all doubt in [the nonmoving plaintiff’s] favor”). All inferences from the facts must also be drawn in favor of the nonmovant. Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Telleconnect v. Ensrud, 55 F.3d 357, 359 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding that the nonmoving party gets “the benefit of every doubt and every favorable inference”).\nIn this case, it is plain that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for Plaintiffs based on the expert opinions of Mark J.S. Heath, M.D., alone. Accordingly, there is a genuine issue of material fact and summary judgment must be denied. The fundamental question of fact at issue in this lawsuit is whether the Defendants’ lethal injection procedure subjects Plaintiffs to a substantial risk of unnecessary pain and suffering during the execution process. If, as Plaintiffs contend, the procedure does present such an unnecessary risk, the procedure violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief they seek.\nSee Taylor v. Crawford, 487 F.3d 1072, 1079 (8th Cir. 2007) (Taylor III) (holding that an execution procedure is unconstitutional where it “involves an unnecessary risk of causing the wanton infliction of pain”); Morales v. Tilton, 465 F. Supp.\nPlaintiffs’ highly qualified expert witness, Dr. Heath, unequivocally states in his Declaration his opinion, held to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the Defendants’ chosen procedure for lethal injection executions indeed subjects Plaintiffs to a substantial and wholly unnecessary risk of enduring excruciating pain and suffering. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt.\n18. Defendants, of course, dispute the validity of Dr. Heath’s conclusions. See Doc. 75 at 13-14 (averring that Arkansas’ procedure “ensures that condemned inmates undergo rapid, painless, and humane deaths without experiencing any unnecessary pain or suffering). They also present the Declaration of their own expert witness, Dr. Dershwitz, in support of their position. [Doc. 74-4.] Nevertheless, “the plaintiff, to survive the defendant’s motion, need only present evidence from which a jury might return a verdict in his favor. If he does so, there is a genuine issue of fact that requires a trial.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at\n257. Plaintiffs’ presentation of the Declaration of Dr. Heath, without more, indubitably satisfies this standard.\nIndeed, a case involving conflicting opinions of expert witnesses on the ultimate issue is a quintessential example of a matter that is inappropriate for summary judgment. See Pachl v. Seagren, 453 F.3d 1064, 1072 (8th Cir. 2006) (district court erred in granting summary judgment in the face of conflicting expert opinions). See also Triple Tee Golf v. Nike, 485 F.3d 253, 264 (5th Cir. 2007) (expert report created genuine issue of material fact); Phillips v. Cohen, 400 F.3d 388, 399 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that “competing expert opinions” present a “classic” case of when a trial of fact is required); Harris v. Provident Life, 310 F.3d 73, 79 (2d Cir. 2002) (district court erred in granting summary judgment where there were “conflicting expert reports presented”); Chevron USA v. Cayetano, 224 F.3d 1030 (9th Cir. 2000) (expert affidavit created genuine issue of material fact); Michaels v. Avitech, 202 F.3d 746, 752 (5th Cir. 2000) (battle of the experts precludes summary judgment). Accordingly, there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the procedures by which Defendants intend to execute the Plaintiffs involves a substantial risk of unnecessary pain, and so summary judgment must be denied.\nWithin this ultimate factual dispute, there are innumerable subsidiary genuine issues of material fact bound up in this case. As set forth in detail in the accompanying Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts as to Which a Genuine Issue Exists to be Tried, (“Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt.”), at issue in this case is not simply the bare terms of Defendants’ new written document, “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,” but all aspects of the procedure by which they intend to execute Plaintiffs. The issue of whether that procedure engenders an unconstitutional risk of inflicting unnecessary pain and suffering cannot be resolved simply by determining what it is Defendants say they are going to do, the fact finder must also ascertain the likelihood that Defendants will actually be able to successfully perform executions humanely. See Morales v. Tilton, 465 F. Supp.\nconcerning how a protocol is “actually administered in practice”). This requires consideration of all available evidence, such as the conduct of past executions, the qualifications, competency and fitness of the personnel responsible for those executions, the changes to the procedure that have been made in response to past problems and aspects of the procedure that have not been committed to writing such as the physical layout of the execution chamber. See id.\nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants have demonstrated on multiple occasions in the past that they are unable or unwilling to reliably perform executions humanely and without inflicting unnecessary pain and suffering. For example, 3-5 minutes after administration of the lethal chemicals began during the execution of Steven Hill in 1992, when Mr. Hill should have already been unconscious, witnesses observed Mr. Hill struggling to breathe. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt.\n6. His chest was visibly heaving against the restraints that had been placed on his body and he appeared to be gasping for air. Id.\nThe death of Ronald Gene Simmons on June 25, 1990 is a dramatic example of an execution that went horribly wrong. For the first two minutes after the drugs began to be administered, Mr. Simmons appeared to witnesses to nod off into unconsciousness as expected Id. But then, however, three minutes into the process, Mr. Simmons cried out: “Oh! Oh!” Id. He then began to cough sporadically, as though he was having difficulty breathing Id. Over the next two minutes he coughed about 20 times, each cough causing his stomach to heave and the gurney to shake Id\nMr. Simmons finally stopped moving 5 minutes after the injection of the lethal chemicals began Id. He was apparently still not dead, however. Witnesses observed Defendant John Byus adjust the IV catheter in Mr. Simmons arm, fiddle with the tube hanging from the IV bag and then again touch the IV tube in Mr. Simmons’ arm Id. It was not until 9:18 pm, 16 minutes after the lethal drugs first began to flow, that the Coroner entered the chamber to pronounce Mr. Simmons dead. Id.\nThe execution of Rickey Ray Rector, on January 24, 1992, took a total of one hour and nine minutes to complete Id. Not only was the IV access horribly and painfully botched, resulting in 10 separate puncture wounds and then a deep incision being cut into Mr. Rector’s arm while Mr. Rector moaned in pain throughout, id., but even after an IV infusion was established, things still did not go as they were supposed to. As with Ronald Gene Simmons, for the first two minutes after administration of the lethal drugs began, Mr. Rector appeared to go to sleep Id. Thereafter, however, Mr. Rector spoke, stating that he was getting dizzy. 5 minutes into the execution, witnesses observed Mr. Rector’s lips begin moving rapidly, as if he was drawing shallow breaths Id. His lips continued moving that way for a minute Id\nMr. Rector’s heart did not stop beating until 19 minutes after the execution began. Id.\nTo be sure, the Constitution does not require that the risk of unforeseen accident be eliminated from the execution process. Taylor, 2007 WL 1583874 *7 (quoting Campbell v. Wood, 18 F.3d 662, 687 (9th Cir. 1994)). But when particular problems are entirely predictable based upon past occurrences, and those responsible fail to take readily available steps to modify their procedure in a way that would rectify and prevent those problems, that failure rises to the level of a constitutional violation. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have utterly failed to learn the lessons of experience and promulgate a procedure that is adequate to prevent recurrence of the horribly botched executions that they have performed in the past.\nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants have failed to ensure that any of the various members of the execution team have minimally sufficient qualifications, training and experience to be able to perform their jobs competently and humanely. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. 6-8,\n10. See Morales, 465 F. Supp.\nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants have failed to institute a procedure for gaining IV access that is adequate to prevent a repeat of the horrific execution of Rickey Ray Rector. “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” places no limit upon the number of skin punctures that may be performed in the attempt to obtain subcutaneous IV access, paving the way for another inmate to endure the 10 separate wounds that were inflicted upon Mr Rector. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. 6–8. Defendants have failed in this regard despite the fact that standard EMS protocols typically call for 2 or 3 attempts only. Even more disturbingly, “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” fails to prohibit the use of a cut-down procedure in the event that subcutanous IV access proves difficult. This is the procedure that was utilized on Mr. Rector after he had been punctured 10 separate times, and resulted in the deep incision into the flesh of his arm. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. 6–8. There could never be any medical justification for using this method of securing IV access during an execution. See id.\n“Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” makes clear that Defendants contemplate using inserting central lines in cases in which peripheral IV access is not established. Indeed, Defendants have performed at least one such procedure in the past. See id.\n8. The document does not, however, ensure that the person(s) who will perform this complex, risky, surgical procedure are minimally qualified and competent to do so, or that they have the necessary equipment on hand to not only perform the procedure but also to appropriately respond to common complications if they arise. See id.\nPlaintiffs contend that the physical layout and conditions of the execution chamber, and the method of labeling the syringes of lethal chemicals, coupled with the use of untrained lay executioners to push the drugs into the inmate’s system, is tantamount to a recipe for disaster and grossly and needlessly increases the risk that the inmate will not receive the benefit of a full dose of anesthetic prior to the administration of the excruciating painful drugs. Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. 10,\n12. Plaintiffs further contend that Defendants’ failure to incorporate any meaningful monitoring of the inmate’s anesthetic depth prior to administering those painful drugs falls so far below the applicable standard of care as to be reckless. Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt.\n11. Defendants’ failure to discern the difference between the required surgical plane of anesthesia and mere unconsciousness, together with their belief that anesthetic depth can be successfully monitored using techniques taught in CPR classes, evince their fundamental lack of understanding of what is at stake here. Id.\nThe provisions of “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” that pertain to situations in which problems with the patency of the IV infusion site are suspected once the execution is underway are so inadequate and misguided that they invite the occurrence of the problems that plagued perhaps the most horrifying known lethal injection execution ever conducted, that of Angel Diaz by the State of Florida in\n2006. The document fails to ensure meaningful monitoring of the IV insertion sites adequate to detect problems that may be developing, not only because of the lack of qualification of the individual charged with performing the monitoring, but also because of its failure to require constant surveillance or to ensure that the sites are in clear sight at all times. Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. 12.\nWorse yet, “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” directs the execution team to respond to problems that are identified first by reducing the flow rate of the lethal chemicals, and thereafter by switching to the secondary site. The first of these actions is an utterly inadequate contingency plan, and the second is incredibly dangerous and potentially disastrous. See id. If a problem with the first infusion site prevents proper administration of the full dose of Sodium Pentothal, and the Pancuronium Bromide and Potassium Chloride are thereafter administered through a second, patent IV infusion site, the inmate will be insufficiently anesthetized and will suffer the agony of suffocation and the burning pain of the Potassium Chloride, while all the while paralyzed and unable to move or communicate distress. See id.\nPlaintiffs further contend that Defendants’ failure to institute a rigorous standardized training procedure for all execution personnel and strict performance criteria for each team member significantly and unnecessarily increases the risk of botched, inhumane executions. Even if personnel selected for the execution team were possessed of adequate professional medical qualifications, which Plaintiffs dispute, extensive training for the particular procedure of killing a condemned inmate by lethal injection, not a part of any medical, nursing or EMT school curriculum, is still required. See id.\n18. See also Morales, 465 F. Supp.\nPlaintiffs also contend that Defendants’ failure to institute a screening process to evaluate all potential execution team members’ skill, competence, professionalism, mental stability, honesty and integrity significantly and unnecessarily increases the risk of botched, inhumane executions. No such screening is contemplated by ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure."" Nor have Defendants’ instituted a review process to evaluate and reevaluate all potential execution team members’ fitness to continue to participate in executions.\nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants’ failure to institute a reliable record-keeping procedure to allow verification of the amounts of anesthesia used in each execution and to ensure that the anesthetic agent Sodium Thiopental is properly dispensed, controlled and monitored significantly and unnecessarily increases the risk of botched, inhumane executions. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt.\n18. No such record-keeping is contemplated by ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure."" Rather than taking available steps to amend their lethal injection procedure in ways that will reduce the risk of inhumane executions, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants have changed their procedure in ways that actually make it more likely that excruciating pain and suffering will be inflicted. Defendants have admitted that, prior to the issuance of ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure"" on July 16, 2007, their lethal injection procedure required that the Deputy Director or designee meet with the condemned inmate approximately 7 days prior to the scheduled execution to determine whether the inmate’s physical condition might present problems for the establishment of IV access. See Doc. 28\n6. ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure"" requires no such meeting.\nPrior to the issuance of ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,"" Defendants’ lethal injection procedure required that the Deputy Director or designee mix the lethal chemicals and prepare the syringes “under the direct supervision of a licensed, practicing pharmacist.” See Doc. 28\n8. ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure"" requires only that the Deputy Director or designee supervise the mixing and syringe preparation; the document requires no minimum qualifications or training whatsoever of the person(s) performing the actual mixing and syringe preparation and removes entirely the involvement of a licensed, practicing pharmacist.\nPrior to the issuance of ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,"" Defendants’ lethal injection procedure required that the Deputy Director or designee retain control and custody of the lethal injection drug box from the moment it is sealed until he delivers it personally to the executioners in the execution chamber. See Doc. 28\n9. In contrast, ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure"" requires only that the Deputy Director or designee transfer the box to the institutional vault in the Cummins Unit, and thereafter the drugs are to be delivered by person(s) unknown at an unspecified time to the execution chamber. There is no requirement that the box be delivered by these person(s) to the executioners; it would be perfectly consistent with the terms of the document for the person(s) to leave the box unsupervised in the chamber.\nPrior to the issuance of ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,"" Defendants’ lethal injection procedure required that the members of the IV Team be “either a [sic] Emergency Medical Technician, a Licensed Practical Nurse, a Registered Nurse or a Medical Doctor.” See Doc. 28\n10. As of June 22, 2006, the IV Team member was an EMT certified at the highest level, that of paramedic, who had been practicing in excess of 27 years. In contrast, ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure"" requires only that the individual(s) be “healthcare providers,” a term that is not otherwise defined, and suggests but does not require even the qualifications of even a basic EMT or a nurse.\nPrior to the issuance of ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,"" Defendants’ lethal injection procedure required that the Deputy Director or designee be in constant direct wireless communication with the executioners in the control room. See Doc. 28\n15. ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure"" requires no such wireless communication, and in fact makes no provision for communication of information between any of the execution team members.\nPrior to the issuance of ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,"" Defendants’ lethal injection procedure required that the execution personnel who would insert a central line if one was deemed necessary be a “surgical team headed by a licensed surgeon.” See Doc. 28\n16. As of June 22, 2006, the surgical team leader was a Diplomat withe the American College of Surgeons and had been a licensed, practicing surgeon for over 15 years Id. In contrast, ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure"" requires only that the individual(s) be “trained, educated, and experienced.” No minimum qualifications or expertise whatsoever are required.\nPrior to the issuance of ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,"" Defendants’ lethal injection procedure no longer permitted the use of a cut-down procedure to obtain intravenous access.” See Doc. 28 23 n.5. ""Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure, however, not only does not prohibit the use of a cut-down, it permits “trained, educated, and experienced” individuals, with no minimum qualifications or expertise whatsoever, to perform such a procedure. All in all, Plaintiffs contend, Defendant’s procedure for putting humans to death fails to even satisfy the veterinary standard of care for the euthanasia of animals. Both the decisions to use Potassium Chloride and Pancuronium Bromide, and the administration of those dangerous, painful drugs without the provision of meaningful monitoring of anesthetic depth, violate veterinary standards and, indeed, would result in criminal liability in some states if used on animals. See, e.g., Fla Stat. § 828.058; Ga. Code Ann. § 4-11-16; Me Rev\nStat. Ann., tit. 17, § 1046; Md. Code Ann., Criminal Law, § 10-611;\nN.Y Agric. Mkts Law § 374; Tenn. Code Ann. § 44-17-303; 510 Ill Comp\nStat. 70/16 (second violation is a felony); Mo Rev\nStat. § 578.012;\nS.C. Code Ann. § 47-3-440; Tex. Health Safety Code Ann. § 821.056.\nPlaintiffs contend that, separately and cumulatively, these deficiencies and failings in Defendants’ lethal injection procedure create an unacceptable risk that Plaintiffs will suffer excruciating and wholly unnecessary pain and suffering during their executions. Each therefore constitutes a genuine issue of material fact that requires that Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment be denied.\n2. The Decision of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in Taylor Does Not Control the Outcome of This Case Defendants contend that the Eighth Circuit’s decision in Taylor entitles them to summary judgment. Their reliance on Taylor is misplaced, for the facts of the instant case differ from those at issue in Taylor in several crucial respects.2 Defendants’ summary judgment papers first 2 Plaintiffs note additionally that Mr. Taylor has petitioned the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for rehearing by the en banc court, and the court has taken the unusual step of requiring a response to the petition by Defendant Crawford et al. Taylor v. Crawford, No. 06-3651 (8th Cir.) It is thus not yet clear whether the panel opinion in Taylor actually represents the law of of all neglect to mention that the Taylor litigation was resolved on the merits only after extensive discovery, a full-dress bench trial, and findings of fact, all of which were ordered by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. See Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095, 1099 (8th Cir. 2006) (Taylor I) (remanding so that the parties could engage in “further discovery” and so a full evidentiary hearing could be held). Furthermore, when the state changed its protocol after Taylor I, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded for yet further fact development. See Taylor v. Crawford, 457 F.3d 902, 904 (8th Cir. 2006) (Taylor II).\nAfter these proceedings had concluded, and Missouri’s lethal injection procedure had been fully aired out, the Court of Appeals determined that Mr. Taylor had failed to meet his burden of proving that a constitutional violation had occurred. Specifically, the court stated that: “We have very carefully examined the entire record, and we find no evidence to indicate that any of the last six inmates executed suffered any unnecessary pain that would rise to an Eighth Amendment violation.” Taylor III, 487 F.3d at\n1085. See also id. at 1075 (“In each of the past six executions, however, death occurred in five minutes or less from the time the first chemical was administered, and there was not a scintilla of evidence that any prisoner ever suffered any pain other than what was necessary to acquire access to the prisoner’s circulatory system through the insertion of the needed intravenous lines”). The court took pains to emphasize that its decision was based upon the record as a whole. Taylor III, 487 F.3d at 1075–77 (recounting the trial testimony at length); id. at 1083 (basing its judgment not only on the state’s written protocol but also on the rest of “the record in this case”). Only in light of this record, in the absence of evidence that any prior executions had been botched, did the Eighth this circuit. 23 Circuit uphold the constitutionality of Missouri’s lethal injection protocol on its face. The record in Taylor thus stands in stark contrast to the record in the instant case, which, Plaintiffs contend, shows that at least three executions conducted by the Defendants in the past have resulted in excruciating pain and suffering being inflicted upon the condemned inmates. See Morales v. Hickman, 415 F.Supp.2d 1037, 1043-45 (N.Cal. 2006) (noting that record included evidence of problems with prior executions such as “evidence from eyewitnesses tending to show that many inmates continue to breathe long after they should have ceased to do so” which was “evidence of a kind that was not presented in... earlier cases”). While the Eighth Circuit found no evidence that the Taylor Defendants had demonstrated their incompetence by failing to reliably conduct executions humanely, here we have evidence that Ronald Gene Simmons was crying out in pain and gasping for breath long after he should have been unconscious. (Simmons Dec.) Here we have evidence that Rickey Ray Rector was punctured 10 separate times before a gash was cut in his arm, and that thereafter he was conscious and vocalizing when he should have been under general anesthesia. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. 6,\n18. We also have evidence that Steven Hill was struggling for breath and moving as if he was having a seizure during his execution. See id.\nIn the face of such strong evidence of the adverse consequences of their prior incompetence, Defendants’ failure to institute and reliably implement a lethal injection procedure that ensures that their future executions are properly conducted creates not a risk of “accident,” Taylor III, 487 F.3d at 1080, but a predictable likelihood that past will be prologue. See Morales v. Tilton, 465 F.Supp.2d 972, 979 (N.D Cal. 2006) (“the record in this case... is replete with evidence that in actual practice [California’s lethal injection protocol] does not function as intended. The evidence shows that the protocol and Defendant’s implementation of it suffer from a number of critical deficiencies”). The analysis that must be conducted in the instant case to determine whether Defendants’ procedure engenders an unnecessary risk of pain and suffering is thus quite different than the analysis employed by the circuit in Taylor.3 Plaintiffs’ contentions that Defendants have seriously botched several executions in the past, and have multiply failed to institute or implement a lethal injection procedure that adequately guards against the recurrence of similar incidents in the future, are genuine issues of material fact that can only be resolved at a trial following full discovery.\nNotably, even a side by side comparison of Defendants’ “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” with the written protocol adopted by Missouri in Taylor demonstrates that summary judgment is inappropriate here.4 Defendants’ document suffers from a number of serious deficiencies that the Missouri protocol avoids, and so the comparison is anything but favorable to Defendants. The Missouri protocol calls for the administration of 5 grams of Sodium Thiopental; “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” calls for only 3 grams. Although 3 A contrary approach would lead to absurd results. If the inquiry were limited to parsing the bare terms of the written protocol no matter how strong the evidence of demonstrated problems with implementation, a State’s lethal injection procedure could be ruled constitutional even if, for example, the executioners openly admitted to routinely omitting the use of the prescribed anesthetic drug altogether Cf. Morales v. Tilton, 465 F. Supp.2d 972, 979 (N.D Cal. 2006) (“As it has from its inception, the resolution of this case thus turns on a single factual question: whether [California’s lethal injection protocol], as implemented, provides constitutionally adequate assurance that condemned inmates will be unconscious when they are injected with pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride) (emphasis added).\n4 Plaintiffs in no way mean to suggest that if Defendants altered their written document to track word for word the protocol adopted by Missouri, summary judgment would be appropriate. To the contrary, in light of Defendants’ demonstrated history of failures of implementation, substantial genuine issues of fact would remain regarding their ability to implement any newly minted written procedure.\nPlaintiffs do not dispute that a properly administered 3 gram dose of Sodium Thiopental would result in a surgical plane of anesthesia, the lower the dose that Defendants use, the greater the likelihood that, if problems arise and only a fraction of the dose actually reaches the inmate’s brain, the inmate will be conscious and suffering during the execution procedure. (Heath Dec 2006.) The Eight Circuit noted with approval in Taylor III that Dr. Doe I, the doctor in charge of mixing the chemicals and inserting the IVs in past executions who had been revealed to have dyslexia and to have unilaterally lowered the dose of anesthetic on occasion, would not be participating in future executions. Taylor III, 487 F.3d at 1075,\n1082. In this case, Plaintiffs contend that Defendant John Byus is the leader of the execution team and has been for all past lethal injection executions, including those known to have been badly botched. Defendant Byus was participating in executions as recently as 2004, when he presided over the execution of Charles Singleton, see Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. 6, and there is no reason to believe that Defendants do not intend for him to continue to do so in the future.\nIn Missouri, the protocol requires that he lethal chemicals be mixed by a person qualified as a physician, a nurse or a pharmacist. Taylor III, 487 F.3d at\n1082. “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,” in contrast, requires no minimum level of qualifications of the person who will perform the mixing. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt.\n10. The mixing is supposed to occur under the supervision of the Deputy Director or designee, but that person in turn is not required to have any minimum level of qualifications either. See id. This is not an insignificant difference; the concentrations of Sodium Thiopental used for executions are different from any of those utilized in clinical settings and thus mixing the drug requires the exercise of pharmaceutical knowledge and not simply following the instructions on the package. See id. The individual responsible for obtaining IV access under the Missouri protocol is required to be either a physician, a nurse, or an EMT, specifically an EMT Intermediate or an EMT Paramedic. Taylor III, 487 F.3d at\n1082. Under “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,” the IV Team member(s) are not required to have any minimum qualifications at all; they need only be “healthcare providers,” a term which is otherwise undefined. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt.\n7. The document cites physician, nurse or EMT by way of examples of individuals who would satisfy the requirement for a healthcare provider, but stops short of requiring any of these qualifications. The document further does not refer to the level of qualification of any EMT who might be employed, leaving open the possibility that the role may be filled by an EMT-Basic, who is unqualified under Arkansas State law to perform any procedure that is invasive of the body such as an IV insertion. See id. 7.\nThe Missouri protocol instructs the medical person, who as noted must be either a physician, a nurse, an EMT Intermediate or an EMT Paramedic, to assess the inmate’s consciousness using “standard clinical techniques.” Taylor III, 487 F.3d at\n1084. This assessment is performed by the unqualified Deputy Director or designee under “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure” and is limited to “procedures as taught in basic life support or CPR courses.” See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt. 11.\nThe Missouri protocol includes a special section outlining requirements for documenting the use and non-use of the lethal chemicals, to ensure that the dosages that are intended to be administered during each execution are in fact used for that purpose. Taylor III, 487 F.3d at 1082-83. Recordation of “the chemicals given, the order in which they are given, and the quantities of chemicals used and discarded” is expressly required, and “[a]ny deviations from the written protocol must be promptly reported to the department director.” Id. at\n1083. This is important; if there are no checks and balances in place to ensure that the chemicals are properly handled, drugs such as Sodium Thiopental “an addictive controlled substance,” Morales v. Tilton, 465 F. Supp.\nFinally, the Missouri protocol specifically guards against the potentially catastrophic consequences of using one IV line to administer the anesthetic and another to push the Pancuronium Bromide and Potassium Chloride. The protocol states that: “When the secondary line is used for thiopental, it is also used for the remaining chemicals.” Taylor v. Crawford, No. 2:05-cv-04173-FJG (W.D. Mo.) [Doc. 198-2 at E.4.] This provision thus guards against the disastrous possibility, left wide open in contrast by “Attachment C Lethal Injection Procedure,” that the anesthetic Sodium Thiopental will be administered through the primary IV insertion site, infiltration will occur at that site and the full dose will fail to reach the inmate’s brain, and then the Pancuronium Bromide and Potassium Chloride will be administered through the secondary, fully functional IV. See Plaintiffs’ Rule 56.1 Stmt.\n12. If that happens, the inmate will be inadequately anesthetized and will experience excruciating pain and agony throughout the administration of the second and third chemicals. See id \nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should find that this case involves multiple genuine issues of material fact that preclude the entry of summary judgment and should deny Defendants’ Motion.\nRespectfully submitted, \nJENNIFFER HORAN FEDERAL DEFENDER\nBy: /s/ Julie Brain Julie Brain Assistant Federal Public Defender 1401 W.

 ""IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS PINE BLUFF DIVISION\nTERRICK TERRELL NOONER, and DON WILLIAMS DAVIS and \nJACK HAROLD, JONES, JR.\nPLAINTIFF INTERVENOR PLAINTIFF INTERVENOR PLAINTIFF\nLARRY NORRIS, Director, Arkansas Department of Correction, et al.\nDEFENDANTS\nFRANK WILLIAMS, JR.\nconsolidated with \nPLAINTIFF\nLARRY NORRIS, Director, Arkansas Department of Correction, et al.\nDEFENDANTS\nORDER\nFour Arkansas death row inmates bring this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging the constitutionality of the State’s protocol for execution by lethal injection. Before the Court is (1) Defendants’ second motion for summary judgment (docket entries #128, #129, #130), Plaintiffs’ response in opposition (docket entries #135, #137, #138, #139), and Defendants’ reply (docket entry #140). Also before the Court is Defendants’ motion to lift the stay of execution of Plaintiff Davis’s death sentence (docket entry #131), Davis’s response in opposition (docket entry #136), and Defendants’ reply (docket entry #141). After careful consideration, and for the reasons that follow, summary judgment will be entered in Defendants’ favor, and Davis’s stay of execution will be dissolved.\nI. On May 1, 2006, Plaintiff Terrick Terrell Nooner (“Nooner”) commenced this action, claiming that the State’s lethal injection protocol presents an unnecessary risk of conscious suffering and extreme pain, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment prohibited under the Eighth Amendment. The Court permitted Don William Davis (“Davis”) to intervene as party plaintiff, and thereafter Governor Mike Huckabee scheduled Davis’s execution. The Court granted Davis a stay of execution in order to permit him to litigate his challenge to the lethal injection protocol. Defendants appealed the stay, and while that appeal was pending, the Court permitted Jack Harold Jones to intervene as a party plaintiff. Additionally, the Court consolidated with this case a separate action filed by Frank Williams, Jr., also challenging Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol. On July 9, 2007, the Eighth Circuit vacated Davis’s stay of execution, concluding that this Court applied the incorrect standard for determining whether Davis had unnecessarily delayed bringing his claim. Governor Mike Beebe scheduled execution dates for Nooner and Jones, and both inmates moved for a stay of execution in this case. Nooner also moved for a stay of execution in a separate habeas proceeding.\nOn September 10, 2007, United States Chief District Judge J. Leon Holmes granted Nooner a stay of execution for the purpose of allowing him to pursue a claim joined in the aforementioned habeas proceeding. On September 11, 2007, this Court denied Nooner’s and Jones’s motions for stays filed in this case, finding that in light of the Eighth Circuit’s opinion in Taylor v. Crawford, 487 F.3d 1072 (8th Cir.2007), Plaintiffs have little chance of success on the merits. The Court also found that Nooner and Jones unnecessarily delayed bringing their claims.\nJones and Nooner appealed from the order denying their motions for stays in this case,1 and Jones petitioned the Eighth Circuit for a stay of execution. In support of his motion, Jones cited the United States Supreme Court’s grant of certiorari in Baze v. Rees, 217 S.W.3d 207 (Ky. 2006), cert. granted, – U.S.—, 2007 WL 2850507 (U.S Oct. 3, 2007), a case involving an Eighth Amendment challenge to Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol. Jones also argued that, even under existing law, this Court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a stay. See Appellant’s Motion for Stay of Execution Jones v. Norris, No. 07-3165 (8th Cir Sept. 30, 2007).\nOn October 11, 2007, the Eighth Circuit entered a one-sentence order granting Jones’s motion for a stay of execution. The State filed an application with the Supreme Court to vacate the stay, and the Supreme Court entered a one-sentence order denying the application.\nWhile Jones’s application for a stay of execution was pending before the Eighth Circuit, Governor Beebe set Davis’s execution for November 8,\n2007. On October 22, 2007, Davis filed a motion for a stay of execution in this case. Finding no rational basis for granting a stay of execution for Jones and denying the same for Davis, the Court granted Davis’s motion for a stay. On November 9, 2007, the Court stayed all proceedings in this case pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Baze, and on November 14, 2007, the Eighth Circuit stayed Jones’s and Nooner’s appeal pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Baze and ruling on a petition for certiorari in Taylor v. Crawford, 487 F.3d 1072 (8th Cir. 2007).\nOn April 16, 2008, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Baze, upholding Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol, see Baze v. Rees, — U.S. —, 128 S.Ct. 1520 (2008 and on April 21, 2008, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in Taylor v Crawford. See Taylor v. Crawford, 487 F.3d 1072 (8th Cir.2007), cert. denied, 128 S Ct. 2047 (2008). On May 21, 2008, the Court reopened this case, and on May 22, 2008, the Eighth Circuit vacated the stay of proceedings in Nooner’s and Jones’s appeal of this Court’s decision to deny their motions for stays.\nII. Since 1983, Arkansas’ lethal injection statute has provided that the “punishment of death is to be administered by a continuous intravenous injection of a lethal quantity of an ultra-shortacting barbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic agent until the defendant's death is pronounced according to accepted standards of medical practice.” Ark. Code Ann. m§ 5-4617(a)(1). Arkansas law gives the Director of Arkansas Department of Correction (“ADC”), Larry Norris (“Norris”), the responsibility to determine the substances to be administered and the procedures to be used in any execution. See Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617(a)(2). Arkansas’ lethal-injection protocol calls for the administration of three chemicals, each followed by a saline flush, in the following amounts and order: (1) 3 grams of sodium thiopental, administered to cause unconsciousness; (2) 100 milligrams of pancuronium bromide, administered to cause paralysis; and (3) 240 milliequivalent of potassium chloride, administered to stop the heart. Injections are administered by way of injection devices located in a control room that is separated from the execution chamber by a wall that contains an observation window. The injection devices are connected, by extension tubing, to intravenous (“IV”) catheters inserted into each arm, or other anatomical venous points of entry, of the condemned inmate. The catheters are inserted by an IV team, and the injections are administered by executioners.\nSince the initiation of this lawsuit, Norris has twice amended the ADC’s lethal injection protocol in an effort to reduce what he considers a minimal possibility that a condemned inmate would experience unnecessary pain during an execution and to reduce existing practices to writing. See docket entry #74, Attach. #1 (July 16, 2007 Norris Dec.), docket entry #129, Attach. #1 (May 27, 2008 Norris Dec.).\nThe current protocol, like the original, makes the ADC Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs (“Deputy Director”), or his designee, responsible for carrying out or supervising several aspects of the procedure. The protocol states: “Unless otherwise stated, the Deputy Director, or the designee, shall be healthcare trained, educated, and/or experienced in matters related to the establishment and monitoring of IVs, the mixing and administration of lethal chemicals, and assessing the presence or absence of consciousness.” (ADC Administrative Directive 08-28, Attach. C, Sec. I.1.) The protocol provides that members of the IV team must be certified or licensed individuals--emergency medical technicians (“EMT’s”), nurses, physician assistants, or physicians--with at least two years of professional experience.\nRegarding the preparation of lethal chemicals, the protocol provides that the Deputy Director, or the designee, “shall verify as to type and concentration, and thereafter supervise the mixing or reconstituting of the [lethal-injection] chemicals in such a manner as will meet lethal injection requirements[2] and in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.” (ADC Administrative Directive 08-28, Attach. C, Sec. I.2.) The mixed chemicals are then transferred to syringes labeled with numbers that correspond to the order in which they are administered. The syringes are placed in box, which is secured and conveyed to the Cummins Unit. The protocol provides that the Deputy Director, or designee, “shall maintain personal, physical custody of the lethal injection drug box and physically convey the box to the Cummins Unit for secure storage in the institutional vault until such time as it is delivered to the execution chamber for use.” (ADC Administrative Directive 08-28, Attach. C, Sec. I.3.) \nSYRINGE LABELED/ MARKED\nCONTENTS\nBack up syringes:\nSodium Pentothal, 3.0 grams (two (2) syringes of 1.5 grams in 60 cc) Normal Saline, 50 cc each Pancuronium Bromide, 100 mg (two (2) syringes of 50 mg in 50 cc) Potassium Chloride, 240 mEq (two (2) syringes of 120 mEq in 60 cc) \n#B1/B2 #B3\nSodium Pentothal, 3.0 grams (two (2) syringes of 1.5 grams in 60 cc) Normal Saline, 50 cc On the evening of the execution, the executioners, under the supervision of the Deputy Director or his designee, enter the injection room prior to the execution and inventory the lethal injection drug box to ensure that all lethal chemicals are accounted for and that infusion devices are ready.\nPrior to the time set for execution, the condemned inmate is removed from a holding cell, strapped to a gurney, and transported to the execution chamber. The Deputy Director or his designee affixes cardiac monitor leads to the condemned inmate, and the gurney is positioned in manner that allows the Deputy Director or his designee and the executioners to directly observe the condemned inmate’s face and IV infusion sites.\nSection II of the protocol covers the IV set-up procedure and provides that the Deputy Director, or his designee, shall have the IV team place an IV infusion device (catheter) in each arm, or other standard anatomical venous point of entry, of the condemned inmate. After insertion of IV lines, an IV setup is inserted into the outlet of a bag of infusion medium containing dextrose 5 percent normal saline solution (D5NS). Two set-ups are prepared in this manner. Next, tubing for both set-ups is connected to the receiving port of 2, 3-way injection devices located in the control room. Tubing is then connected to discharge ports on the injection devices and connected to the IV insertion cites, and the tubing is cleared of air and made ready for use.\nOnce infusion of D5NS has been assured, the IV devices are secured. The IV sets run at a slow rate and are ready for the insertion of syringes containing the lethal chemicals. The amended protocol requires that the Deputy Director, or his designee, “shall ensure that the cardiac monitor is ‘on’ and functioning properly and maintain observation of IV infusion(s) to ensure that the rate of flow is uninterrupted.” (ADC Administrative Directive 08-28, Attach. C, Sec. II.7.) The amended protocol mandates: “NO FURTHER ACTION shall be taken until the prearranged signal to start the injection of lethal chemicals is given by the Warden.” (ADC Administrative Directive 08-28, Attach. C, Sec. II.7.) In the event that a patent IV infusion site cannot be established, the amended protocol requires the following action:\n[T]he IV Team shall be directed by the Deputy Director, or designe e, to evaluate other possible infusion sites. All effort will be made to establish two (2) unrelated intravenous infusion sites. If one (1) patent infusion site is established, and a second site proves to be a futile effort, the Deputy Director, or designee, may direct the IV Team to suspend further action. In the casethat no patent infusion site is established after reasonable attempts as determined by the IV Team, the Deputy Director, or designee will direct the IV Team to suspend further action and thereafter summon trained, educated, and experienced person(s) necessary to establish a primary IV line as a peripheral line or as a central venous line. (ADC Administrative Directive 08-28, Attach. C, Sec. II.8.) The amended protocol provides:\nEVERY EFFORT WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE CONDEMNED INMATE TO ENSURE THAT NO UNNECESSA RY PAIN OR SUFFERING IS INFLICTED BY THE IV PROCEDURE. STANDARD PRACTICE OF USING A LOCAL ANESTHETIC WILL BE ACCOMMODATED AS NECESSARY.\nSection III of the protocol covers the injection procedure and provides that the 3-way injection device facilitates the movement of fluid from the D5NS bag and allows introduction of lethal chemical. A valve directs which fluid enters the IV set up. When the signal to commence is given by the Warden, the executioners administer the lethal chemicals under the direction of the Deputy Director, or his designee, as follows:\na. Syringe #1 (containing sodium thiopental) shall be inserted into the designated receiving port of the 3-way control device.\nb. The flow of IV solution will be interrupted by moving the 3-way valve assembly towards the IV solution receiving port c. The contents of Syringe #1 shall commence with a steady even flow of the lethal chemical. Only a minimum amount of force will be applied to the syringe plunger d. When the contents of Syringe #1 have been injected, the three-way valve assembly will be moved so as to shut off the infusion of lethal chemical and resume infusion of IV solution e. Syringe #1 will be replaced by Syringe #2 and the procedure described in subparagraphs a-d for Syringe #1 will be repeated. This process will be repeated for all subsequent syringes. Following the administration of the first three syringes (2 injections of 1.5 grams of sodium thiopental, followed by a saline flush) the Deputy Director or his designee “will assess and monitor the condemned inmate’s lack of consciousness by using standard procedures as taught in basic life support or CPR courses, such as checking for movement, opened eyes, eyelash reflex, and response to verbal commands and physical stimuli.” (ADC Administrative Directive 08-28, Attach. C, Sec. III.2.f.). Once the Deputy Director or his designee determines that the condemned inmate is unconscious, and at least three minutes have elapsed from starting Syringe #1, all remaining chemicals will be administered to the unconscious inmate in numerical sequence, Syringe #4 through Syringe #8. The protocol provides that if the Deputy Director determines that the condemned inmate remains conscious following the administration of Syringe #3, the back-up syringes of sodium thiopental and a repeat normal saline wash shall be administered into the secondary or alternative IV line. Thereafter, once the Deputy Director, or his designee, determines that the condemned inmate is unconscious, and at least three minutes have elapsed from starting Syringe #B1, all remaining chemicals will be administered to the unconscious inmate in numerical sequence into the secondary or alternative IV line; Syringe #4 through Syringe #8. The protocol requires that a cardiac monitor be used to display heart function. When all lethal chemical syringes have been administered, and a flat-line is observed for a minimum of three to five, three-second sweeps on the cardiac monitor, the Coroner shall be summoned for purpose of pronouncing death.\nThroughout the infusion process, the Deputy Director or his designee “will closely monitor the infusion site for evidence of infiltrate, vein collapse, or other challenge to the patency of the infusion site.” (ADC Administrative Directive 08-28, Attach. C, Sec. III.2.i.) If a problem is suspected, the Deputy Director, or his designee, will direct reduction of lethal chemical flow rate or redirect chemical to secondary site.\nThe amended protocol requires the following actions when an infusion site is suspected to be compromised: First, the chemical flow rate will be reduced. If problem persists, the administration procedure will be ceased; the curtain to death chamber will be closed; the IV Team will be summoned, and infusion site problem corrected. If all efforts to re-establish patent infusion site fail, the Deputy Director or his designee will direct the IV Team to suspend further action and a “trained, educated, and experienced person [or persons]” necessary to establish a primary IV line as a peripheral line or as a central venous line will be summoned to facilitate an IV infusion site. (ADC Administrative Directive 08-28, Attach. C, Sec. III.2.i.) When the infusion compromise is corrected, the IV Team and the summoned person(s) will be excused, the curtain reopened, and the lethal injection procedure continued.\nIII. The parties agree that unless thiopental is properly administered, a condemned inmate will suffer pain upon administration of potassium chloride, and will be unable to demonstrate his suffering because of the paralyzing effect of pancuronium bromide. Plaintiffs do not dispute that proper administration of 3 grams of sodium thiopental will ensure that they feel no pain after the administration of pancuronium bromide and potassium bromide. However, they contend that Arkansas’ protocol subjects them to cruel and unusual punishment because inadequate procedures, poor facilities, and unqualified personnel create a substantial risk that injections of sodium thiopental will not be successfully delivered, and they will feel the agonizing effects of the final two chemicals. Plaintiffs also assert that the protocol subjects them to painful venous access procedures.\nDefendants assert that pursuant to the standard set forth in Baze v. Rees and the Eighth Circuit’s opinion in Taylor v. Crawford, Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol passes examination under the Eighth Amendment, and they are entitled to summary judgment.3 In Taylor v. Crawford, 487 F.3d 1072 (8th Cir.2007), cert. denied, 128 S.Ct. 2047 (2008), the Eighth Circuit interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed R. Civ P. 56(c). As a prerequisite to summary judgment, a moving party must demonstrate “an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party’s case.” Celotex Corp\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). Once the moving party has properly supported its motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must “do more than simply show there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec Indus. Co v. Zenith Radio Corp., \n475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).\nThe non-moving party may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleading but must “come forward with ‘specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.’” Id. at 587 (quoting Fed R. Civ P. 56(e)).\n“[A] genuine issue of material fact exists if: (1) there is a dispute of fact; (2) the disputed fact is material to the outcome of the case; and (3) the dispute is genuine, that is, a reasonable jury could return a verdict for either party.” RSBI Aerospace, Inc v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 49 F.3d 399, 401 (8th Cir. 1995).\nupheld Missouri’s lethal injection protocol. The Court emphasized that the proper focus when evaluating an execution protocol under the Eighth Amendment is not the risk of accident, but “whether the written protocol inherently imposes a constitutionally significant risk of pain.” Taylor, 487 F.3d at\n1080. The Court stated: “If [a] protocol as written involves no inherent substantial risk of the wanton infliction of pain, any risk that the procedure will not work as designated in the protocol is merely a risk of accident, which is insignificant in our constitutional analysis.” Id. (citing Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459, 464 (1947)).\nMissouri’s protocol uses the same three-chemical sequence as prescribed by Arkansas’ protocol, but Missouri requires a 5-gram dose of sodium thiopental. Although the ADC’s protocol calls for only 3 grams of sodium thiopental, Plaintiffs’ expert, Mark J S. Heath, an anesthesiologist, acknowledges that 2 grams of sodium thiopental, if properly administered, would be more than sufficient to cause unconsciousness. (6/11/2006 Heath Dec. 26.) Missouri’s protocol requires that a physician, nurse, or pharmacist prepare the lethal chemicals, which are injected by non-medical employees. Arkansas’ protocol requires that the person supervising the preparation of lethal chemicals, the Deputy Director or his designee, be trained, educated, or experienced in matters related to mixing of lethal chemicals and that he or she ensures that the manufacturer’s instructions are followed. See Baze, 128 S Ct. at 1533(approving similar guidelines regarding the mixing and reconstitution of lethal chemicals).\nThe Missouri and Arkansas protocols both require that IV insertions be accomplished by medical personnel–a physician, nurse, or EMT. Both protocols require confirmation, following administration of thiopental, of the condemned inmate’s lack of consciousness. Both protocols call for administration pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride only after it is determined that the inmate is unconscious, and only after the expiration of three minutes from the time administration of sodium thiopental begins. Arkansas’ protocol further requires that throughout the infusion process, the Deputy Director or his designee shall closely monitor the infusion site for evidence of problems. Both protocols provide for back-up syringes of sodium thiopental, to be administered though the secondary or alternative IV line if needed. Both protocols provide that if a peripheral IV site cannot be established, a peripheral or central venous primary IV line will be establish by a person with the training, education, and experience necessary for the procedure.\nThe Eighth Circuit concluded that the only inherent risk in Missouri’s written procedure came from the risk of inadequate anesthetization. However, the Court concluded that Missouri’s protocol, which this Court finds to be substantially similar to Arkansas’, “renders any risk of pain far too remote to be constitutionally significant.” Taylor, 487 F.3d at 1085.\nIn Baze v. Rees, 128 S.Ct. 1520 (2008 the Supreme Court upheld Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol against an Eighth Amendment challenge. Kentucky’s protocol, like Arkansas’, involves the injection of 3 grams of sodium thiopental, followed by injections of pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. The protocol mandates that members of the IV team, who site and insert the IV lines, be certified medical assistants, phlebotomists, EMT’s, paramedics, or military corpsmen with at least one year of professional experience. The protocol further requires that the execution team, including the IV team, participate in 10 practice sessions per year, which includes a walk through of the execution procedure and siting IV catheters into volunteers.\nUnder Kentucky’s protocol, the IV team has up to one hour to establish both primary and secondary peripheral intravenous sites in the arm, hand, leg, or foot of the inmate. Kentucky’s execution facilities, similar to Arkansas’, consist of an execution chamber and a control room, separated by a one-way window Id. at\n1528. The lethal drugs are administered remotely from the control room through IV tubing Id. If the warden and deputy warden, who are positioned in the execution chamber with the prisoner, determine through visual inspection that the prisoner is not unconscious within 60 seconds following the delivery of the sodium thiopental, a new 3-gram dose of thiopental is administered before injecting the pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride Id. Additionally, the warden and deputy warden watch for signs of infiltration or problems with the IV catheters or tubing Id. at 1534.\nIn a plurality opinion announcing the judgment of the Court, Chief Justice Roberts began by recognizing that capital punishment is constitutional, and “[i]t necessarily follows that there must be a means of carrying it out.” Baze, 128 S Ct. at\n1529. He noted that “[s]ome risk of pain is inherent in any method of execution-no matter how humane-if only from the prospect of error in following the required procedure,” and “the Constitution does not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain in carrying out executions.” Id.\nAccording to the standard set forth in the plurality opinion, to constitute cruel and unusual punishment prohibited under the Eighth Amendment, an execution method must present a “substantial” or “objectively intolerable” risk of serious harm. Baze, 128 S Ct. at\n1531. The plurality acknowledged that failing a proper dose of sodium thiopental, a condemned inmate would experience suffocation from the administration of pancuronium bromide and pain from the injection of potassium chloride. Baze, 128 S.Ct. at\n1533. However, a risk of future harm qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment only if the conditions presenting the risk are “‘sure or very likely to cause needless suffering and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers.’” Baze, \n128 S\nCt. at 1530-31 (citing Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33, 34-35, 113 S. Ct.\n2475(1993)). In light of built-in safeguards included in Kentucky’s written protocol, particularly the requirement that members of the IV team have at least one year of professional experience, the plurality concluded that any risk of pain and suffering during administration of the final chemicals was not so substantial or imminent as to amount to an Eighth Amendment violation.\nBaze, 28 S.Ct. at 1534.\nSpeaking to whether the plurality’s standard would resolve cases involving challenges to three-drug protocols used in other states, Chief Justice Roberts stated:\nA stay of execution may not be granted on the grounds asserted here [4] unless the condemned prisoner establishes that the State’s lethal injection protoc ol creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain. He m ust show that the pain is substantial whe n compared to the known alternatives. A state with a lethal injection protocol substantially similar to the protocol w e uphold today w ould not create a risk that meets this standard.\nBaze, 128 S Ct. at 1537.\nDefendants assert that Plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they are under a substantial or objectively intolerable risk of harm because Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol is substantially similar to the Missouri protocol upheld in Taylor and “even stronger” than Kentucky’s protocol upheld in Baze. Plaintiffs argue that Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol differs from the protocols upheld in Taylor and Baze because it (1) fails to prohibit a cut-down procedure; (2) permits the insertion of a central venous line by individuals who are not qualified to perform the procedure; (3) fails to prohibit intracardiac infusion; (4) causes gratuitous and unnecessary pain and suffering as demonstrated by past executions in Arkansas; (5) fails to provide for an adequately qualified IV team; (6) fails to provide for adequate facilities; (7) fails to provide for adequate monitoring of IV infusion sites; and (8) contains a potentially disastrous back-up plan. The Court will consider each argument separately.\n1. Cut-Down Procedure A newspaper article covering the execution of Rickey Ray Rector in 1992 states that Rector, who was 298 pounds and had compromised veins, moaned as he underwent numerous attempts to establish a peripheral IV line. Before a catheter was successfully placed in a vein on the top of Rector’s right hand, the IV team attempted to gain access to a vein by performing a cut-down procedure on Rector’s right arm. Rector’s post-mortem photographs show nine needle marks on his arms and hands and a two-inch wide incision on the inside of his right arm. See docket entry #137, Exs. ##15-22. Plaintiffs assert that Arkansas’ protocol constitutes cruel and unusual punishment because it does not specifically preclude the possibility of using the “brutal, medically unacceptable” cut-down procedure endured by Rector. In Nelson v. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 124 S Ct. 2117 (2004), the Supreme Court permitted a death row inmate to bring a § 1983 action challenging the use of a cut-down procedure that would be applied to him because of his particular physical condition–severely compromised veins Dr. Heath, the plaintiff’s expert witness in Nelson, attested that the cut-down procedure is painful and dangerous and that in light of less invasive means of venous access, namely percutaneous central line placement, there is no valid reason to employ the cut-down procedure. See Nelson, 541 U.S. at 646, 124 S Ct. at \n2124\nDr. Heath described a cut-down procedure as making a deep incision through the skin, connective tissue, and underlying layers of fat and muscle until the region surrounding a large vein is reached. See Nelson v. Campbell, 286 F. Supp.\nPlaintiffs provide no evidence that they will be subject to a cut-down procedure as described by Dr. Heath in Nelson. Previously, Arkansas’ protocol contained a specific provision permitting a cut-down procedure to gain venous access. See docket entry #139, Ex. #30 (ADC Administrative Directive 05-43, Attach. C, Sec. II.8). The current protocol contains no such provision, there is no evidence that the ADC has employed a cut-down procedure since Rector’s execution in 1992, and Plaintiffs do not contend that their physical conditions will present difficulties in obtaining venous access. Furthermore, the ADC’s chief deputy director, Ray Hobbs, testifies that in the event that an incision is necessary in order to gain venous access, it will be made by a licensed physician and will not go through muscle tissue. Docket entry #140, Attach.\nThe Court finds no evidence that Arkansas’ current protocol subjects them to the type of cut-down procedure at issue in Nelson, and apparently performed on Rector in\n1992. The Court further finds that if the IV team is unable to establish a peripheral IV site percutaneously, it would not amount to cruel and unusual punishment for a physician to make an incision necessary to gain access to a vein. See Baze, 128 S Ct. at 1530-31 (citing Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33, 34-35, 113 S Ct. 2475, explaining that to constitute cruel and unusual punishment the conditions presenting a risk must be sure or very likely to cause needless suffering and give rise to sufficiently imminent dangers).\n2. Qualifications of Persons Performing Central Line Placement Plaintiffs assert that this Court must decide “whether the Constitution permits Defendants to employ a person or persons of undetermined credentials, experience, and competence to insert central lines during executions.” Docket entry #135, at\n10. Missouri’s protocol, upheld in Taylor v. Crawford, provides: “Medical personnel may insert the primary IV line as a peripheral line or as a central venous line (e.g. femoral, jugular, or subclavian) provided they have appropriate training, education, and experience for that procedure.” Defs.’ Resp. to Court Order of Sept. 12, 2006, Ex. A, Taylor v. Crawford, (W.D Mo. 2006)(No. 05-4173-CV-C-FJG). Arkansas’ protocol similarly requires that IV team members be licensed or certified healthcare providers, such as physicians, nurses, or emergency medical technicians, with at least two years of professional experience. The protocol further provides that if a problem develops with an infusion site and efforts to re-establish a patent infusion site fail, “trained, educated, and experienced persons necessary to establish a primary IV line as a peripheral line or as a central venous line will be summoned to facilitate an IV infusion site.” (ADC Lethal Injection Protocol, revised 05/22/08, Sec. III.i.3.). Plaintiffs contend that the foregoing language is “vacuous verbiage that in no way protects the condemned inmate from being subjected to butchery at the hands of incompetent personnel.” (07/30/07 Heath Dec., 24.) In response to Plaintiffs’ charge, Defendants submit the following affidavit testimony of ADC official Ray Hobbs:\nDays prior to the scheduled execution, the condem ned inmate is exam ined and evaluated for possible IV infusion sites. If it appears during that examination that it will be dif ficult to establish an IV line on the day of the execution, then the condemned inmate is asked to allow a central venous line to be established prior to the execution. If the condemned inmate consents, then a licensed physician who is credentialed to establish a central venous line performs that procedure in a clinical setting before the scheduled execution. Suchadvance procedures have not required the use of an incision in the past. Docket entry #140, Attach. Hobbs further t estifies that the ADC “interprets, understands, and intends” that if it is necessary to establish a central venous line during an execution, the procedure will be conducted by a licensed physician who possesses the necessary credentialsI.d. The Court finds that Arkansas’ protocol adequately requires that qualified medical personnel carry out central line placement in the event that the procedure is necessary.\n3. Intracardiac Infusion Plaintiffs state that Defendants have contemplated using an intracardiac infusion procedure during lethal injection executions, which they assert is an extraordinarily dangerous procedure involving the insertion of a large needle directly into heart muscle. By affidavit, Chief Deputy Director Hobbs testifies: “an intracardiac infusion will not be performed during any further lethal injection execution carried out by the ADC.” Docket entry #140, Attach. The current protocol contains no provision calling for intracardiac infusion, and based on Hobbs’ affidavit, the Court finds that the ADC will not use the procedure in carrying out a death sentence. Accordingly, the Court finds no genuine issues of material fact on this issue.\n4. Past Executions In Baze, the Supreme Court noted that only one Kentucky prisoner had been executed since the Commonwealth adopted the lethal injection procedure, and no problems were reported in connection with that execution. See Baze, 128 S Ct. at\n528. Arkansas, however, has conducted 27 executions by lethal injection, and Plaintiffs contend that four of those executions were “botched” and “likely... excruciatingly and unconstitutionally torturous for the prisoner involved.” (Plfs.’ Resp. at 3.) Dr. Heath acknowledges that 2 grams of sodium thiopental (1 gram less than the dose mandated by the ADC’s protocol) if properly administered into the bloodstream, “would be more than sufficient to cause unconsciousness and, eventually, death, if no resuscitation efforts were made....” (6/11/2006 Heath Dec. 26.) However, Dr. Health states that his research indicates that executions have occurred where the full dose of sodium thiopental listed in the protocol was not fully and properly administered.\nAccording to Dr. Heath, witness accounts and execution records regarding the executions of Arkansas death row inmates Ronald Gene Simmons, Rickey Ray Rector, Steven Hill, and Christina Riggs “are indicative of problems with the administration of lethal drugs and raise concerns that adequate anesthesia may not be being reliably provided.” (6/11/2006 Heath Dec. 48.) Dr. Heath repeats the following information from a newspaper article5 containing a reporter’s personal account of the 1990 execution of Ronald Gene Simmons, the first person to be executed in Arkansas by lethal injection:\nThe administration of lethal chemicals began at 9:02 p.m. Between 9:02 and 9:04 p.m. according to eyewitnesses, Mr. Sim mons appeared t o nod off into unconsciousness. However, at 9:05 p.m. he called out “Oh! Oh!” and began to cough as though he m ight be having difficulty breathing. During the next two minutes, he coughed approximately 20 times. With each cough his stomach heaved slightly and the gurney to which he was strapped shook Mr. Simmons became still at 9:07 p.m., after which his face and armturned first blue and then purple. An ADC employee twice appeared to adjust the IV tube in Mr. Simmons’ arm, and not until 9:19 p.m. was Mr. Simmons pronounced dead by the coroner.\n(6/11/2006 Heath Dec. 43.) Docket entry #82, Ex. #5, 43.\nDr. Heath opines that Simmons’s initial vocalizations and coughing were inconsistent with “the induction of a surgical plane of anesthesia by sodium thiopental.” (6/11/2006 Heath Dec. 44.) He states that the typical reaction to the administration of sodium thiopental is yawning and drawing one or two deep breaths. (Id.) Regarding the execution of Rickey Ray Rector in 1992, Dr. Heath summarizes the following “first-person account from the Associated Press” set forth in a newspaper article:\nThe medical team secured the tubes to Rector about 9:40 p.m. and the dark curtain opened 10 minutes later. Rector was strapped to a gurney, a white sheet covered him from his feet to his lower lip.\nThe murderer moved his lips, but he could not be heard through the gla ss. Prison officials later said Rector’s last words were: “I got baptize d and saved.” Lockhart gave the order to begin the lethal dripabout 9:50 p.m., 50 minutes behind schedule.\nRector blinked his eyes slowly. He ol oked like a man nodding off to sleep for about two minutes when he closed his eyes for good.\nAbout 9:55 p.m., Rector’s lips moved rapidly–as if he was drawing shallow breaths. His lips stopped moving a minute later. He didn’t move again.\nAt 10:06 [a witness] looked at what appearedto be a heart monitor at the head of the gurney. “It looks like it’s flat-lining,” he sa id. “Oh, there was a jum p. There’s another flutter.” Two minutes later, he said, “there’s not anything moving in that monitor at all. It’s straight across.” Docket entry #137, Ex. #11. John Jewell, an attorney who represented Rector and witnessed his execution, testifies by declaration that Rector’s executioners had difficulty establishing an IV site, and he heard Rector telling the executioners where they could get access to a vein. Docket entry #82, Ex. 23,\n8. Jewell states: “Even once the IV was in place, the rest of the procedure still took another ten minutes or more.... It was a horrible experience.” Id., \n9\nDr. Heath repeats information contained in a declaration by attorney Charles L Carpenter, who represented Steven Douglas Hill and witnessed Hill’s lethal injection execution in\n1992. Carpenter states his observations as follows: Approximately 3-5 m inutes after the IV fluid began to flow, I noticed Stephen struggling to breathe. He was strapped down, but his chest was heaving against the wide belt that covered his chest. He appeared to be gasping for air. Within another minute, he turned a bright red color and thenlay completely still. It was another 2-3 minutes before he was pronounced dead. Docket entry #82, Ex. #6,\n8. Plaintiffs also submit a copy of a newspaper article about Hill’s execution with a headline that reads: “This time, execution goes smoothly.” Docket entry #82, Ex. #7. As for the 2000 execution of Christina Riggs, Dr. Heath states that the procedure was delayed for 18 minutes while ADC personnel “struggled” to insert the IV line into her elbows. (06/11/07 Heath Dec., 47.) He states that “a minute after the drugs had purportedly begun to flow into her body, Mr. Riggs was still vocalizing. Witnesses heard her say, “I love you my babies.” (06/11/07 Heath Dec., 47.). According to Dr. Heath, the preceding record of past executions in Arkansas “provide evidence that is indicative of continued consciousness following the purported administration of sodium pentothal.” (06/11/07 Heath Dec., 42.) Even assuming that Simmons, Rector, Hill, and Riggs were conscious for more than one minute after the administration of sodium thiopental began, the record contains no evidence to support Plaintiffs’ theory that Arkansas’ current protocol subjects them to a substantial risk that they will be conscious during the administration of pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride.\nThe record contains no evidence regarding the rate at which lethal chemicals were injected during past executions or when the last two chemicals were administered. Furthermore, unlike the protocols in place when the so-called “botched” executions took place, the ADC’s current protocol specifically requires that the last two chemicals are administered only after the Deputy Director determines that the inmate is unconscious and three minutes have passed from the time that administration of sodium thiopental begins. Compare docket entry #21, Ex. #1 (ADC Administrative Directive dated 05/23/1996, Attach. C) and docket entry #138, Ex. #30 (ADC Administrative Directive dated 11/23/05, Attach. C) with docket entry #129, Ex. A (ADC Lethal Injection Protocol, Revised May 22, 2008).\nThe Court finds that the evidence presented regarding lethal injection executions that occurred in the past fails to demonstrate that Arkansas’ current protocol exposes Plaintiffs to an objectively intolerable risk of pain. See Baze, 128 S Ct. at 1537(citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 826 and n.9, 114 S Ct. 1970)(stating that what the Eighth Amendment prohibits is wanton exposure to objectively intolerable risk, not simply the possibility of pain).\n5. IV Team Qualifications Plaintiffs assert that “members of the IV Team in Arkansas are not required to have qualifications and experience that even approach those of the IV team members in Kentucky.” Docket entry #135, at 20.6 Like Kentucky’s protocol, Arkansas’ requires that IV team members be certified or licensed EMT’s, nurses, physician assistants, or physicians. Furthermore, Kentucky’s protocol requires that IV team members have one year of professional experience, and Arkansas requires at least two years of professional experience. Despite these similarities, Plaintiffs assert that Arkansas’ protocol falls short because it contains no specific requirement that IV team members have experience placing and monitoring IV catheters.\nIn Taylor, the Eighth Circuit held that Missouri’s protocol adequately requires that trained medical personnel carry out each medial step of the lethal injection procedure. See Taylor, 487 F.3d at\n1084. Similar to Arkansas’ protocol, Missouri’s requires that only a physician, nurse, or emergency medical technician insert intravenous lines, and it contains no specific training guidelines for members of the execution team. The Court finds that the absence of language requiring specific training and practice for members of the IV team does not render Arkansas’ execution procedure cruel and unusual. See Taylor, 487 F.3d at 1084(“Absent some specific disqualifying characteristic of the chosen medical personnel, we would be hard pressed to say that a physician, a trained nurse, or a licensed pharmacist is not qualified to mix the chemicals.”)\n6. Facilities Plaintiffs contend that Arkansas’ execution chamber is “poorly designed and inadequately lit, and the physical apparatus used by the executioners to administer the lethal drugs is so likely to result in the drugs being administered in the wrong order and other errors as to render its use reckless.” Docket entry #135, at\n22. Plaintiffs’ specific criticisms of the facilities are that the placement of the execution gurney will not enable executioners to see problems that develop in the IV infusion sites or any signs that the prisoner is inadequately anesthetized; the execution chamber is too small; the lighting in the injection room is dim, which hinders the executioner’s view of syringes; and the syringes are inadequately labeled.7 Plaintiffs provide no evidence that Arkansas’ execution facilities subject them to a substantial or objectively intolerable risk of serious harm. See Baze, 128 S Ct. at 1537(stating that risks suggested by petitioners, such as improper mixing of chemicals, cannot remotely be characterized as “objectively intolerable”.) The Eighth Amendment does not require medically optimal facilities, and the Court finds that Arkansas’ protocol contains adequate safeguards that make up for the physical separation of the condemned inmate and the executioners and other alleged imperfections.\n7. Monitoring of IV Infusion Sites Plaintiffs maintain that the current ADC protocol “allows for no monitoring of the IV sites during the execution because those sites, along with the rest of the inmate’s body with the exception of his head, are completely covered with a sheet for the duration of the process.” Docket entry #135, at\n25. According to Plaintiffs, the protocol “fails to guarantee that the Deputy Director or designee will do anything more than occasionally lift the corner of the sheet to look at the IV sites, if that.” Id.\nContrary to Plaintiffs’ assertion, the protocol specifically instructs: “Throughout the lethal chemical infusion process, the Deputy Director, or designee, will closely monitor the infusion site for evidence of infiltrate, vein collapse, or other challenge to the patency of the infusion site.” (ADC Lethal Injection Procedure, Revised 05/22/08, Sec. III.2.i.).\nIn support of the charge that the Deputy Director will shirk his duty to closely monitor the infusion site, Plaintiffs submit a post-mortem photograph of Steven Hill, showing his lifeless body covered by a sheet. The Court finds that the photograph provides no evidence that Defendants will deviate from the monitoring procedures mandated by the written protocol. The Court finds that Arkansas’ requirement that the Deputy Director closely monitor the infusion site sufficiently addresses the risk of IV problems that might develop during the lethal injection procedure.8\n8. Back-Up Plan Plaintiffs assert that the protocol presents a substantial risk that a terrible series of events will occur because it does not require a second dose of sodium thiopental “when the decision is made to redirect the flow to the backup IV site mid-execution.” Docket entry #135, at\n27. Plaintiffs envision the following chain of events: If the prisoner receives enough of the drug to render him temporarily unconscious, the execution will appear to be going smoothly when Defendant Byus performs his rudimentary consciousness checks, although in fac t the dose that the inm ate has received is insufficient to achieve a surgical plane of anesthesia and to ensure that it is maintained through the duration of the execution. If the problem that has been developing with the IV site is thereaf ter discovered and the flow of the remaining two chemicals is diverted to the back up site, the prisoner will receive full doses of pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride following only a partial, inadequate dose of anesthesia. Docket entry #136, at\n27. The record does not support a finding that the foregoing scenario is even possible. First, the written protocol provides that if the Deputy Director or his designee determines that the inmate remains conscious after the administration of sodium thiopental, the back-up syringes of sodium thiopental “shall be administered into the secondary or alternative IV line.” (ADC Lethal Injection Procedure, Revised 05/22/08, Sec. II.8.) Second, the protocol provides that if a problem is suspected with the primary IV site, the Deputy Director will direct reduction of the chemical flow rate or redirect “lethal chemical to the secondary or alternative site.” (ADC Lethal Injection Procedure, Revised 05/22/08, Sec. III.2.i(1)(emphasis added)). Chief Deputy Director Hobbs testifies: “The ADC interprets, understands, and intends for the term ‘lethal chemical’ to include the backup doses of the first lethal chemical [sodium thiopental], as well as the extra saline flush. Therefore, Section III.2.i(1) requires the back up syringes of sodium [thiopental] and saline flush to be administered before the administration of any remaining pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride.” Docket entry #140, Attach. In light of Hobbs’ testimony, the Court finds no support for Plaintiffs’ claim that “the protocol does not direct the administration of a second dose of anesthetic when the decision is made to redirect the flow to the backup IV site mid-execution.” In conclusion, the Court finds that Arkansas’ lethal injection protocol is substantially similar to the protocols approved in Taylor and Baze. The Court further finds that Plaintiffs have failed to come forward with evidence that Arkansas’ protocol for execution by lethal injection subjects them to a constitutionally significant risk of pain. Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\nIV. Given the Court’s decision that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment, Davis has no reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of his claim.9 Additionally, as previously stated, the Eighth Circuit has ruled that Davis unjustifiably delayed bringing his claim under § 1983, and that alone disqualifies him for a stay of execution. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendants’ motion to lift the stay of execution of Davis’s death sentence. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendants’ motion for summary judgment (docket entry #128) is GRANTED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants’ motion to dissolve Don William Davis’s stay of execution (docket entry #131) is GRANTED. The stay of execution granted by the Eighth Circuit as to Plaintiff Jones and the stay of execution granted by Chief Judge Holmes as to Plaintiff Nooner are still in place.\n/s/Susan Webber Wright UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE""

 'United States Court of Appeals \nFOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\nTerrick Terrell Nooner, Appellant, Don William Davis; Jack Harold Jones, Jr., Intervenor Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. Larry Norris, in his official capacity as Director, Arkansas Department of Correction; Gaylon Lay, in his official capacity as Warden, Arkansas Department of Correction, Cummins Unit; Wendy Kelly, in her official capacity as Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs, Arkansas Department of Correction; John Byus, in his official capacity as Administrator, Correctional Medical Services, Arkansas Department of Correction; in their official capacities as employees and/or agents of the Arkansas Department of Correction, Appellees, Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.\nFrank Williams, Jr., Appellant, v. Larry Norris, in his official capacity as Director, Arkansas Department of Correction; Gaylon Lay, in his official capacity as Warden, Arkansas Department of Correction, Cummins Unit; Wendy Kelly, in her official capacity as Deputy Director for Health and Correctional Programs, Arkansas Department of Correction; John Byus, in his official capacity as Administrator, Correctional Medical Services, Arkansas Department of Correction; in their official capacities as employees and/or agents of the Arkansas Department of Correction, Appellees.\nSubmitted: September 24, 2009 Filed: February 8, 2010 Before MELLOY, GRUENDER and BENTON, Circuit Judges.\nGRUENDER, Circuit Judge.\nTerrick Terrell Nooner, Don William Davis, Jack Harold Jones and Frank Williams, Jr. (collectively, “the Inmates”) were each convicted of capital murder in Arkansas. Their convictions have been affirmed, their petitions for post-conviction relief have been denied, and they await execution by the State of Arkansas. In this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 lawsuit against Larry Norris, Director of the Arkansas Department of Correction, and other corrections employees (collectively, “the ADC”), the Inmates challenge the constitutionality of Arkansas’s protocol for execution by lethal injection. The district court1 granted the ADC’s motion for summary judgment, and the Inmates now appeal. For the following reasons, we affirm.\nI. BACKGROUND\nNooner filed his lawsuit on May 1,\n2006. Davis a nd Jones filed m otions to intervene as party plaintiffs, which the district court granted on May 26, 2006, and December 1, 2006, respectively. On August 9, 2007, the district court ordered the case consolidated with a similar lawsuit filed by Williams on July 11, 2007.\nOn June 26, 2006, the district court granted Davis a prelim inary injunction, staying his execution. The ADC appealed and on July 9, 2007, we vacated the preliminary injunction and stay of execution. Nooner v. Norris, 491 F.3d 804, 806 (8th Cir. 2007). The next day, the Inmates sought discovery for the first time by filing a motion for expedited discovery. The district court denied the Inmates’ motion for expedited discovery on August 9, 2007, butthe ADC nevertheless produced more than 300 pages of docum ents in response. The ADC moved for sum mary judgment, arguing that the Inmates had failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact about the constitutionality of Arkansas’s lethal injection protocol. The Inm ates sought shelter under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), claiming that they lacked access to the facts necessary to oppose the ADC’s motion for summary judgment and that they needed further discovery.\nBefore the district court ruled on the ADC’s motion for summary judgment, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Baze v. Rees 552 U.S. 945 (2007), a case challenging the constitutionalityof Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol. Accordingly, the district court denied the ADC’s motion for summary judgment without prejudice and stayed and administratively terminatedthe Inmates’ lawsuit pending the outcome in Baze.\nThe Supreme Court issued its decision in Baze on April 16, 2008, upholding Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol. 553 U.S. 35, 128 S Ct. 1520 (2008). The Inmates successfully moved to reopen their case on M ay 15,\n2008. The A DC amended its lethal injection protocol on May 22, 2008, and m oved for sum mary judgment on June 4,\n2008. The Inmates opposed this motion but did not renew their request for a continuance to obtain further discovery under Rule 56(f). On August 5, 2008, the district court granted the ADC’s motion for summary judgment.\nUnder Arkansas law, the Director of theADC is responsible for determining the policies and procedures followed by the ADC to execute pirsoners by lethal injection Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617(a)(4). The parties refer to the set of execution instructions he has developed—and revised—as the Arkansas lethal injection protocol.\nRay Hobbs, Chief Deputy Director of the ADC, submitted an affidavit (“the Hobbs affidavit”) dated July 28, 2008, stating that he was authorized to m ake statements about the protocol on behalf of the ADC. The Inm ates have not argued that Hobbs acted ultra vires in subm itting this affidavit, and the ADC specifically stated at oral argument that it considers th e statements in the Hobbs affidavit to be binding on the ADC. Because the ADC may am end the protocol at the Director’s discretion, see Ark. Code Ann. § 5-4-617, we accept the Hobbs affidavit as a written addendum to the May 22, 2008 protocol.\nUnder the protocol, the ADC’s Deputy Di rector for Health and Corr ectional Programs is primarily responsible for supervising executions. The Deputy Director must be “healthcare trained, educated, and/ or experienced in m atters related to the establishment and m onitoring of IVs, the mixing and adm inistration of lethal chemicals, and assessing the presence or absence of consciousness.” The protocol allows a designee to perform the functions of the Deputy Director, but the designee must meet the sam e qualifications. If needed, the Deputy Director provides an orientation for the executioners before each execution. She also selects the IV team, which is responsible for establishing intravenous infusion sites in condem ned prisoners. Each member of the IV team must have at least two years of professional experience as an emergency m edical technician, nurse, physician assistant or physician.\nArkansas administers the same combin ation of lethal chemicals to execute prisoners that at least thirty other statesuse: sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. See Baze, 128 S Ct. at 1527 (plurality opinion). 2 Before each execution, the Deputy Director is responsible for ensuring that the lethal chemicals are mixed properly and transferred to conspicuously numbered syringes that are secured in a carrying case.3 \nSYRINGE LABELED/ MARKED CONTENTS\n#1/#2 Sodium Pentothal, 3.0 grams (two (2) syringes of 1.5 grams in 60 cc) #3/#6 Normal Saline, 50 cc each 4#/#5 P a n c u r o n i u m B r o m i d e 1 0 0 m g t w o 2 syringes of 50 mg in 50 cc) Arkansas executes condem ned prisoners in an execution cham ber that is adjoined by a witness roomand a control room. There is a large window between the execution chamber and the witness room that can be covered by a curtain. From the control room, the executioners can see into the execution chamber through a one-way mirror. The protocol directs the Deputy Driector to bring the condemned prisoner into the execution chamber strapped to a gurney, which is positioned directly in front of the one-way mirror so that the Deputy Director and the executioners can observe the IV infusion sites and t he prisoner’s face throughout the execution. The Deputy Director affixes cardiac monitor leads to the prisoner and then summons the IV team.\nThe IV team establishes two independent IV infusion sites, preferably one in each of the prisoner’s arms. If two sites cannotbe established, the protocol directs the Deputy Director to dism iss the IV team and “sum mon trained, educated, and experienced person(s) necessary to establish a primary IV line as a peripheral line or as a central venous line.” After the infu sion sites are established, the IV team connects the IV lines to the control r oom with extension tubing, allowing the executioners to administer the lethal ch emicals from the con trol room. When the warden authorizes the executioners to begininjecting the lethal chemicals, the curtain between the execution chamber and the witness room is opened.\nThe executioners first inject two syringes containing three gram s of sodium pentothal, a barbiturate, into the primary IV line. The protocol requires the Deputy Director to wait at least three minutes af ter the executioners be gin the injection of sodium pentothal before directing the executioners to administer the contents of the #7/#8 Potassium Chloride, 240 mEq (two (2) syringes of 120 mEq in 60 cc) Backup Syringes #B1/B2 Sodium Pentothal, 3.0 grams (two (2) syringes of 1.5 grams in 60 cc) #B3 Normal Saline, 50 cc remaining syringes. During this time, the protocol instructs the Deputy Director to use standard m edical techniques, “such as checking for m ovement, opened eyes, eyelash reflex, and response to verbal commands and physical stimuli,” to verify that the prisoner has been rendered com pletely unconscious. After three m inutes have elapsed and the Deputy Director verifies that the prisoner is completely unconscious, the protocol instructs the executioners to inject a syringe of normal saline to flush the IV line, followed by two syrni ges containing 100 mg of pancuronium bromide, which paralyzes the prisoner’s muscles and stops respiration. Atfer injecting another syringe of saline, the executioners administer two syringes containing 240 mEq of potassium chloride, which induces cardiac arrest.\nThe protocol requires the Deputy Director to monitor the primary IV infusion site continuously and to reduce the flow of lethal chemicals or redirect them to the alternate infusion site if she suspects a problem. The curtain between the witness room and the execution cham ber is closed if an infusion problem develops but otherwise remains open during the adm inistration of lethal chem icals. After the cardiac monitors display a flat-line, a coroner is sum moned to pronounce death. Prison officials then close the curtain to the witness room and escort the witnesses from the building.\nThe Inmates argue that the district courtabused its discretion in finding that the case is ripe for sum mary judgment. They also argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the ADC becausethe record establishes genuine issues of material fact about whether Arkansas’slethal injection protocol is unconstitutional.\nII. DISCUSSION\nThe Eighth Am endment, applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits cruel and unusual execution procedures. See Baze, 128 S Ct. at\n1530. Challenges to the constitutionality ofa state’s lethal injection procedures are cognizable under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983. Hill v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 573, 576 (2006).\n“We begin with the principle... th at capital punishment is constitutional.” Baze, 128 S Ct. at 1529 (citingGregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 177 (1976) (plurality opinion)). “It necessarily follows that there must be a means of carrying it out.” Id. “[T]he Constitution does not demand the avoidance of all risk of pain in carrying out executions.” Id. To establish a violation of the Eighth Amendment, an execution procedure must be “‘sure or very likely tocause... needless suffering,’ and give rise to ‘sufficiently imminent dangers.’” Id. at 1531 (quoting Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33-34 (1993)). “[T]o prevail on sucha claim there must be a ‘substantial risk of serious harm,’... that prevents pr ison officials from pleading that they were ‘subjectively blameless for purposes of the Eighth Am endment.’” Id. (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 842, 846 and n.9 (1994) ). “The m ere fact ‘an execution method may result in pain, either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death,’ does not am ount to an Eighth Am endment violation.” Clemons v. Crawford, 585 F.3d 1119, 1125 (8th Cir. 2009) (quotingBaze, 128 S Ct. at 1531). The Supreme Court “has never invalidated a State’s chosen procedure for carrying out a sentence of death as the infliction of cruel and unusual punishm ent.” Baze, 128 S Ct. at 1530.\nIn Taylor v. Crawford, we reviewed a facial challenge to the constitutionality of Missouri’s lethal injection protocol. 487 F.3d 1072, 1085 (8th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 553 U.S. 128 S Ct. 2047 (2008). Wdeetermined that the constitutionality of Missouri’s protocol “depends upon whether the protocol as written would inflict unnecessary pain, aside from any considerati on of specific intent on the part of a particular state official.” Id. at\n1081. Accordingly, we focused on the written protocol to determine whether it “presents a substantial risk of inflicting unnecessary pain,” id. at 1080, and we held that Missouri’s proot col did not violate the Eighth Amendment, id. at 1085.\nAfter our decision in Taylor, the Suprem e Court upheld Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol in Baze. 128 S Ct. at\n1526. The Court’s opinion was fractured, and no opinion com manded a m ajority of th e Justices. However, a three-Justice plurality concluded, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts, that a lethal injection protocol m ust create a “substantial risk of serious harm ” to be unconstitutional Id. at 1531 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842). FollowingBaze, no federal appellate court has invalidated a lethal injection protocol under the Eighth Amendment. Cooey v. Strickland 589 F.3d 210, 221 (6th Cir. 2009) (collecting cases).\nIn Clemons v. Crawfo rd, we relied on Baze to hold that eight condem ned prisoners in Missouri could not “support anEighth Amendment claim” because they had not “alleged a sufficiently substantia l risk of serious harm ” in challenging Missouri’s implementation of its protocol. 585 F.3d at 1127-28; see also Harbison v. Little, 571 F.3d 531, 535 (6th Cir. 2009) (“ChifeJustice Roberts’s plurality opinion [in Baze] is controlling.”), petition for cert. filed, U.S.L.W. (U.S Nov. 23, 2009) (No. 09-7777); Emmett v. Johnson 532 F.3d 291, 298 n.4 (4th Cir. 2008) (concluding that the plurality opinion “represents the co ntrolling opinion of the Court”). In this case, we are called on todecide whether the Arkansas lethal injection protocol violates the Eighth Am endment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by subjecting the Inmates to a substantial risk of serious harm.\nA. Ripeness of Summary Judgment Motion As a preliminary matter, however, the Inmates argue that their case is not ripe for summary judgment. We review the distrcit court’s determination that a case is ripe for summary judgment for abuse of discretion. Nolan v. Thompson, 521 F.3d 983, 986 (8th Cir. 2008).\n“Discovery does not have to be completed before a court can grant summary judgment, but summary judgment is properonly after the nonmovant has had adequate time for discovery.” In re TMJ Implant Prods Liab. Litig., 113 F.3d 1484, 1489-90 (8th Cir. 1997) (internal citations omitted). The record shows that the Inm ates had adequate time to conduct discovery. This lawsuit was initially filed on May 1, 2006, but the Inmates did not request discovery for more than fourteen months, when they sought expedited discovery. The Inmates attribute this fourteen-month delay to the district court’s failure to enter a scheduling order, which they assert is normally the starting point for discovery in Arkansas. As the district court correctly noted, however, the “lack of a scheduling order did not prevent counsel fromconferring and developing a discovery plan as requiredunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f); nor did it prevent Nooner from requesting th at the Court enter a scheduling order.” Nooner v. Norris, No. 5:06-cv-001100, 2007 WL 2301221, at *3 (E.D Ark\nAug. 9, 2007) (unpublished) (footnote omitted) (citing Nickens v. White, 622 F.2d 967, 971 (8th Cir. 1980)).\nIn any event, the Inmates sought shelter under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) on July 30, 2007, claiming that withoutdiscovery they lackedthe facts necessary to oppose the ADC’s initial motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, the ADC voluntarily produced m ore than 300 pages of documents to the Inm ates. On November 9, 2007, the district court stay ed and adm inistratively terminated the lawsuit pending the Suprem e Court’s decision in Baze. Af ter the district court reopened this case on May 21, 2008, the ADC filed a second m otion for summary judgment. In opposing the ADC’s motion, the Inmates did not renew their request for a continuance to obtain furt her discovery under Rule 56(f). 4 Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the case is ripe for summary judgment. See In re TMJ Implant Prods Liab. Litig., 113 F.3d at 1490 (“If a party opposing a summary judgment motion does not seek shelter under Rule 56(f) or otherwise ask for a continuance, a court generally does not abuse its discretion in granting sum mary judgment based on the record before it.” (citing Wallace v. Dorsey Trailers Se., Inc., 849 F.2d 341, 344 (8th Cir. 1988))); Ballard v. Heineman, 548 F.3d 1132, 1136 (8th Cir. 2008) (“The district court does not abuse its discretion by denying further discove ry ‘where the nonm oving party is not deprived of a fair chance to respond to the summary judgment motion.’” (quoting Nord v. Kelly, 520 F.3d 848, 852 (8th Cir. 2008))).\nB. Summary Judgment Turning to the m erits, “[w]e review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same standards applied by the district court.” Schoolhouse, Inc v. Anderson, 275 F.3d 726, 728 (8th Cir. 2002) (citing Iowa Coal Mining Co v. Monroe County 257 F.3d 846, 852 (8th Cir. 2001)). “Sum mary judgment is proper where the evidence, when viewed in thelight most favorable to the nonmoving party, indicates that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgm ent as a m atter of law.” Davison v. City of Minneapolis, 490 F.3d 648, 654 (8th Cir. 2007) (quotingHughes v. Stottlemyre, 454 F.3d 791, 796 (8th Cir. 2006)). We must affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment unless a reasonable fact finder, viewing the evidence in the light m ost favorable to the Inmates, could return a verdict in their favor. See Prosser v. Ross, 70 F.3d 1005, 1009 (8th Cir. 1995). The Inmates contend that summary judgment was improper with respect to eight issues. We examine each in turn.\n1. The Risk of Remaining Conscious The combination of lethal chemicals that Arkansas and at least thirty other states use to execute prisoners has been designed to cause as little pain as possible. See Baze, 128 S Ct. at 1527 n.1 (noting that “inmoving to lethal injection, the States were motivated by a desire to find a mo re humane alternative to then-existing methods”). “The proper administration of [sodium pentothal] ensures that the prisoner does not experience any pain associated with the paralysis and cardiac arrest caused by the [pancuronium bromide] and [potassium chloride].” Id. at\n1527. In this case, the Inmates have not challenged the opinion of the ADC’s expert witness, Dr. Mark Dershwitz, that within sixty seconds of the injection of all three gram s of sodium pentothal “more than 99.9999999% of the population would be unconscious.” However, it is also undisputed that if th e other chemicals were administered to a prisoner while still conscious, he would fee“lan excruciating burning sensation as [the potassium chloride] travels through his veins to induce a heart attack, and yet he would be unable to indicate that he is experiencing pain due to the paralyzing effects of the second chemical, pancuronium bromide.” See Taylor, 487 F.3d at 1074.\nThe Arkansas protocol contains several safeguards to ensure that the sodium pentothal is adm inistered properly and that the pris oner has been rendered fully unconscious before the pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride are injected. The protocol requires the Deputy Director towait three minutes after the injection of sodium pentothal before directing the executioners to adm inister the rem aining chemicals. During this time, the Deputy Di rector must verify that the prisoner is unconscious by using “standard procedures for assessing consciousness as required by medical paraprofessionals, such as checking for movement, opened eyes, eyelash reflex, and response to verbal com mands and physical stim uli.” If the prisoner remains conscious after the injection of thesodium pentothal, the protocol requires the Deputy Director to direct the executioners to inject the back-up doses of sodium pentothal into the secondary IV line. Fi nally, the protocol requires the Deputy Director to continuously monitor the IV infusion sites throughout the execution and to suspend the flow of lethal chemicals if she suspects a problem.\nThe Inmates argue that evidence about four previous executions in Arkansas establishes a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the protocol creates a substantial risk of serious harm. In particular, they assert that the ADC “botched” the executions of Ronald Gene Sim mons on June 25, 1990; of Rickey Ray Rector on January 24, 1992; of Steven Douglas Hillon May 7, 1992; and of Christina Riggs on May 2,\n2000. In the light most favorable to the Inmates, the record shows that each of these condemned prisoners exhibited signs of consciousness within three minutes of the injection of sodiumpentothal. Thus, according tothe Inmates, these executions create a genuine issue of material fact about whether the current protocol sufficiently ensures that they will be fully unconsci ous before the pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered.\nWe emphasized in Taylor that when reviewing theconstitutionality of a state’s lethal injection protocol we review the current protocol as written. See 487 F.3d at 1080 (“The focus of our inquiry is whetherthe written protocol inherently imposes a constitutionally significant risk of pain.”). Moreover, we held that if the written protocol is not unconstitutional on its face, “any risk t hat the [lethal injection] procedure will not work as designated in th e protocol is merely a r isk of accident, which is insignificant in our constitutional analysis.” Id. The plurality in Baze similarly stated that “an isolated m ishap alone does not give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation, precisely because such an event, while regrettable, does not suggest cruelty.’” 128 S Ct. at 1531 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842).\nThe Inmates correctly point out that the record does not contain the lethal injection protocols in place at the time Simmons, Rector, Hill and Riggs were executed. According to the Inmates, this creates a genuine issue of material fact about whether the ADC has engaged in a “seriesof abortive” execution attempts despite the safeguards required by the current protocol because it is possible the previous protocols contained the same safeguards. Although the record does not identify or describe the protocols in place at the tim e of the four previous executions, it does contain lethal injection protocols datedMay 23, 1996, and November 23,\n2005. These protocols lacked m any of the safeguards required by the current protocol. For instance, the 1996 protocol did not require ADC officials to monitor the IV infusion sites, and it did not contai n a contingency plan for addressing infusion problem s. Neither the 1996 nor the 2005 protocol required ADC officials to pause between the administration of sodium pentothal and pancuronium bromide to determine whether the prisoner is unconscious, nor did they require the preparation or administration of back-up syringes of sodium pentothal. The current protocol is much more thorough than these earlier protocols and, as di scussed above, contains procedures that sufficiently protect prisoners from remaining conscious during the injection of the pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride Cf. Harbison, 571 F.3d at 536-37 (upholding the Tennessee lethal injection protocol despite the state’s decision to reject a review com mittee’s recommendation to adopt procedures for assessing consciousness after the administration of sodium pentothal).\nThe Inmates urge us to ignore the safeguards in the current protocol and find that there is a genuine issue of material fact about whether the protocols that governed the executions carried out in 1990, 1992 and 2000 contained safeguards that were not part of the 1996 and 2005 protocosl. We reject this argument. The possibility that the ADC removed significant safeguards in 1996 and 2005, only to reinstate them in the May 22, 2008 protocol, is so unlikely that it am ounts to little m ore than pure speculation. See Schmidt v. City of Bella Villa, 557 F.3d 564, 571 (8th Cir. 2009) (“[S]ummary judgment will not be reversed on the basis of speculation, conjecture, or fantasy.” (citing Potman v. Unity Health Sys., Inc., 348 F.3d 732, 733-34 (8th Cir. 2003))). Under the current protocol, “any ri sk that [Arkansas’ s lethal injection] procedure will not work as designated... is merely a risk of accident, which is insignificant in our constitutional analysis.” Taylor, 487 F.3d at 1080.\nWe hold that the Inmates’ evidence of previous executions does not establish that the Arkansas protocol creates a substantial risk of serious harm that the Inmates will remain conscious after the administration of the sodium pentothal.\n2. Intracardiac Infusion The Inmates argue that the record establishes a genuine issue of material fact about whether the ADC plans to use “intracardiac infusion” in future executions. In this context, intracardiac infusion refers to a potentially painful procedure whereby lethal chemicals are injected directly into a chamber of the heart with a large needle. The November 23, 2005 version of the protocol authorized this procedure as a last resort, but the May 22, 2008 version does not mention it. Nevertheless, the Inmates claim that the ADC plans to use this procedure under the current protocol based on a July 18, 2008 newspaper article in which ADC spokeswoman Dina Tyler is reported to have said that the ADC could start a line directly to a condemned prisoner’s heart if necessary. The ADC argues that this article is hearsay and cannot be relied on to oppose summary judgment.\nWe have held that “only evidence that would be adm issible at trial m ay be relied upon to counter a moti on for summary judgment.” Sokol Assocs., Inc v. Techsonic Indus., Inc., 495 F.3d 605, 611 n.4 (8th Cir. 2007) (citingShaver v Indep. Stave Co., 350 F.3d 716, 723 (8th Cir. 2003)). The Inm ates argue that Tyler’s statement is admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2) as a non-hearsay admission of a party opponent. This argument fails to distinguish Tyler’s statement from the newspaper article containing the st atement. Newspaper articles are “rank hearsay.” See Miller v. Tony Susan Alamo Found. 924 F.2d 143, 147 (8th Cir. 1991). Even if Tyler’s statem ent is viewed as a non-hearsay adm ission of a party opponent, the newspaper article reporting the statement is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and is not covered by any hearsay exception. Therefore, the article’s description of Tyler’s statem ent about intracardiac infusion “cannot be admitted for its truth.” See United States v. Santisteban, 501 F.3d 873, 878-79 (8th Cir. 2007).\nEven assuming the newspaper article is admissible evidence, the Inmates would still fail to establish a genuine issue of material fact about whether the ADC plans to use intracardiac infusion in future executions. The Hobbs affidavit flatly states that “intracardiac infusion will not be perform ed during any future lethal-injection execution carried out by the ADC.” The a ffidavit is dated July 28, 2008, ten days after the newspaper account of Ty ler’s statement. Because we treat the Hobbs affidavit as a binding written addendumto theprotocol, we conclude that it supersedes Tyler’s statement.\n3. Central line placement If the IV team cannot establish IV access thr ough traditional methods, the protocol authorizes the Deputy Direct or to summon “trained, educated, and experienced person(s)” to establish a central venous line byinserting a catheter in the femoral, jugular or subclavian vein. TheInmates argue that this “vague, standardless provision... places no meaningful restrictions whatsoever upon who may perform this dangerous procedure” and that the protocol therefore authorizes unqualified personnel to establish such lines. We rejecthe Inmates’ argument. “[I]t is imperative for the State to employ personnel who are properly trained to competently carry out each medical step of the [let hal injection] procedure.” Clemons, 585 F.3d at 1128 (quoting Taylor, 487 F.3d at 1084). The protocol’s requirements satisfy this standard. Moreover, the Hobbs affidavit clarifies thatany attempt to place a central venous line will be performed by “a licensed physician who is credentialed to establish” such lines.5 The Inm ates have not established a genuine issue of m aterial fact about whether they face a substantial risk of serious harm from the placement of central venous lines by unqualified ADC personnel.\n4. Cut-down procedure The Inmates argue that the protocol authorizes ADC personnel to use a “cutdown” procedure if they are unable to obtain intravenous access by other m ethods. They define a cut-down as “an incision into the prisoner’s flesh deep enough to expose the vein for direct insertion of the needle and catheter.” The Inm ates characterize the procedure as “brutal, agonizing” and “barbaric.” They point to the 1992 execution of Rickey Ray Rector as evidence that future prisoners will be “subject to the procedure that led to [h is] torturous death.” In that instance, ADC personnel were unable to establish infu sion sites through traditional m ethods and eventually made a two-inch incision i n Rector’s arm. Rector reportedly groaned periodically during the ADC’s attempts to establish intravenous access. The Inmates argue that this evidence suggests that theyface a substantial risk of serious harmfrom a cut-down procedure.\nAlthough the current protocol does no t expressly authorize a cut-down procedure, the ADC acknowledges that it m ight be necessary to m ake incisions on some prisoners to establish IV access. Howveer, the Hobbs affidavit clarifies that any such incision would be m ade by a licen sed physician who is properly qualified to carry out the procedure. Moreover, the protocol states that all attempts to obtain IV access must avoid unnecessary pain by us ing local anesthetic as necessary. 6 The Inmates have not argued, nor does the record establish, that an incision made under these conditions rises to the level of seriousharm. Accordingly, weconclude that the Inmates have failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact about whether they face a substantial risk of serious harm from a cut-down procedure Cf. Cooey, 589 F.3d at 228 (noting that the Sixth Circuitupheld Tennessee’s lethal injection protocol even though it expressly authorizes a physician to use a cut-down procedure to gain IV access as a contingency plan).\nEVERY EFFORT WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE CONDEMNED INMATE TO ENSURE THAT NO UNNECESSARY PAIN OR SUFFERING IS INFLICTED BY TH E IV PROCEDURE. STANDARD PRACTICE OF USING A LOCAL ANESTHETIC WILL BE ACCOMMODATED AS NECESSARY.\n5. IV Team Qualifications The Inmates argue that the ADC does notrequire its IV team members to have qualifications and experience comparableto those required by the Kentucky protocol upheld in Baze. The Baze plurality stated that Ken tucky has instituted “im portant safeguards” to ensure that the lethal ch emicals used in its executions are properly administered. 128 S Ct. at\n1533. Specifically, Kentucky’s protocol requires each member of its IV team to h ave at least one year of professional experience as a phlebotomist, emergency medical technician, paramedic, certified medical assistant or military corpsman Id. The plurality noted that the current members of Kentucky’s IV team insert IV catheters on a daily basis and that the Kentucky protocol requires the IV team to engage in at least ten practice sessions each year Id. at 1533-34. But the plurality made clear that the “most significant” of Kentucky’s safeguards was the requirement that each member of the IV team have at least one year of professional experience Id. at 1533.7 The Arkansas protocol goes even further than the Kentucky protocol by requiring IV team members to have at least two years of professional experience as Kentucky has put in place several important safeguards to ensure that an adequate dose of sodium thiopental is delivered to the condem ned prisoner. The most significa nt of these is the written protocol’s requirement that members of the IV team must have at least one year of professional experience as a certified m edical assistant, phlebotomist, EMT, paramedic, or military corpsmen.\nBaze, 128 S Ct. at 1533 (emphasis added).\nan emergency medical technician, nurse, physician assistant or physician. The record does not show how often the current members of the IV team establish IV lines, but the two-year professional experience requirement ensures that IV team members are qualified and competent to insert IV catheters. Moreover, the Inmates are wrong to suggest that “no training of the IV Team members whatsoever is conducted” in Arkansas. The protocol does not include a specific schedule for practice execution sessions, but that does not mean such practice sessions do not take place. Indeed, the protocol outlines a procedure for conducting practice execution sessions and requires the IV team to “initiate intravenous infusion devices” during each practice session. We conclude that the required qualifications for IV teammembers in Arkansas under the current protocol are substantially si milar to the requirem ents of the Kentucky protocol upheld in Baze. See 128 S Ct. at 1537 (observing that a state “with a lethal injection protocol substantially sim ilar to” Kentucky’s protocol would be constitutional).\nThe Inmates also argue thatthe Deputy Director is not qualified to supervise the IV team. They argue that the protocol’s requirement that the Deputy Director be “healthcare trained, educated, and/or experienced” is vague. This argument ignores other relevant language in the sam e sentence, which in full states that the Deputy Director must be “healthcare trained, educated, and/or experiencedin matters related to the establishment and monitoring of IVs.” (Emphasis added.) The Inm ates also argue that the Deputy Director m ust hold the same “credentials, qualifications and competencies” as the members of the IV team. We reject this argument. The Deputy Director supervises the IV team and m onitors the infusion sites, but she d oes not personally establish any of the IV lines a nd is not a member of the IV team. The qualifications required by the protocol ensurethat the Deputy Director is sufficiently competent to perform her supervisory role.8 Because the Inmates have not presentedsufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact about whether they face a substantial risk of serious harm as a result of any deficiencies in the training or experience of the ADC’s IV team or its Deputy Director, summary judgment was proper on this issue.\n6. Infusion Site Monitoring The Inmates contend that the Arkansas protocol subjects them to a substantial risk of serious harm by failing to provide for adequate monitoring of the IV infusion sites. The sole piece of evidence they provide in support of this argument is a postmortem photograph of Steven Hill, which shows his entire body—except his head and hands—covered with a sheet. The Inm ates argue that this photograph creates a genuine issue of m aterial fact about whether the protocol prevents adequate monitoring of the IV infusion sites by authorizing the ADC to cover condem ned prisoners with sheets during their executions.\nThe Baze plurality noted that in Kentucky “the presence of the warden and deputy warden in the execution chamber with the prisoner allows them to watch for signs of IV problems.” 128 S Ct. at 1534(emphasis added). The Kentucky protocol does not specifically require anyone to monitor the infusion sites, however. See Appellants’ App. at 528-44; see also Harbison, 571 F.3d at 538 (concluding that visually monitoring IV lines “by video camera and through a one-way window” does not violate the Constitution).\nThe Arkansas protocol expressly requi res the Deputy Director to “directly observe the... IV infusion site(s)” and to “closely monitor” these sites “throughout of experience as an emergency room technician, licensed practical nurse, Assistant Infirmary Administrator, Supervisor of Medical Services, and Adm inistrator of Medical and Dental Services.\nthe lethal chemical infusion process.” This requirement necessarily precludes ADC personnel from fully covering condem ned prisoners with sheets before they are pronounced dead. Moreover, the post-mortem photograph of Hill is not probative of whether the IV infusion sites were visibl e during his execution. Thus, the Inm ates have failed to establish a genuine issue of m aterial fact about the adequacy of infusion-site monitoring under the protocol. See Gregory v. Rogers, 974 F.2d 1006, 1010 (8th Cir. 1992) (“A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to avoid summary judgment.” (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986))).9\n7. Contingency Plan If the Deputy Director suspects there is a problem with an infusion site, the protocol requires her to “directreduction of lethal chemicalflow rate or redirect lethal chemical to the secondary or alternativ e site.” The Inmates argue that this contingency plan creates a substantial ri sk of ser ious harm because the Deputy Director might order the executioners to adm inister the syringes of pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride to the secondary IV site without injecting additional doses of sodiumpentothal and normal saline. In other words, the Inmates contend that the protocol authorizes the Deputy Director to administer pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride to a prisoner who is not fully unconscious. This argument erroneously assumes that pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride are the only two “lethal chemicals” administered under the protocol. The Inm ates’ own expert asserted that “[t]wo grams of sodium thiopental is a massive, and potentially lethal, dose”;10 the Arkansas protocol calls for the injection of three gram s of sodium pentothal Cf. Cooey v. Strickland, 589 F.3d at 216, 219 (upholding the Ohio lethal injection protocol, which relies exclusively on a five-gram dose of sodium pentothal to execute prisoners). Indeed, the protocol clearly lists sodium pentothal among the “lethal chemicals” used during executions. The ADC’s decision to characterize sodium pentothal as a lethal chem ical indicates that it intends all of the chemicals listed in the protocol to be redirected to the secondary IV site.\nThe Inmates’ argument again ignores the protocol’s requirem ent that the Deputy Director ensure the prisoner is fully unconscious before directing the executioners to administer the pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. The protocol also requires her to adm inister the back-up doses of sodium pentothal if necessary to render the prisoner com pletely unconscious. These requirem ents necessarily prohibit injecting pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride into the secondary IV line before the prisoner is fully unconscious. Moreover, the Hobbs affidavit clarifies that the ADCinterprets the protocol to require “the back-up syringes of sodium pentothal and saline flush to be administered before the administration of any remaining pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride,” if the need arises for the Deputy Director to redirect the flow oflethal chemicals during an execution. We conclude that the Inmates have failed to create a genuine issue of material fact about whether the protocol’s contingency plan subjects them to a substantial risk of serious harm Cf. Emmett, 532 F.3d at 306 (upholding Virginia’s lethal injection protocol despite the lack of an explicit requirement to administer a back-up dose of sodium pentothal if it is necessary to inject additional doses of pancuronium bromide or potassium chloride).\n10Sodium pentothal is also known as thiopental. Baze, 128 S Ct. at 1527.\n8. The Adequacy of the Execution Facility The Inmates argue that the ADC’s ex ecution facility subjects them to a substantial risk of serious harm because the execution cham ber is poorly lit, the control room is too small, the syringes are inadequately labeled, and the executioners are not positioned to properly observe the IV infusion sites. The Inm ates rely on eleven photographs in the record to suppor t this argument, none of which create a genuine issue of m aterial fact about the adequacy of the exec ution facility. The photographs show that the syringes are clearly labeled with large num bers and arranged in the carrying case in numerical order. The photographs reveal little, if anything, about the size of the control room, the viewpoint of the executioners, or the adequacy of the lighting. Based on these photographs aol ne, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the ADC’s execution facility subjects the Inmates to a substantial risk of serious harm, and summary judgment was therefore appropriate. See Dush v. Appleton Elec Co. 124 F.3d 957, 963 (8th Cir. 1997) (“To avoid the entry of [summary] judgment, it is incumbent upon the nonmoving party to support its case with ‘more than a scintilla of evidence.’” (quotingF.D.I.C v. Bell, 106 F.3d 258, 263 (8th Cir. 1997))).\nC. Summary We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Inmates’ case is ripe for sum mary judgment. Based on our review of Arkansas’s lethal injection protocol, we conclude that it is designed “to avoid the needless infliction of pain, not to cause it.” See Taylor, 487 F.3d at 1085 (quoting Workman, 486 F.3d at 907). Moreover, it is substan tially similar to—and perhaps even m ore thorough than—the Kentucky protocolupheld by the Supreme Court in Baze, see 128 S Ct. at 1537, and the Missouri protocol we upheld in Taylor, see 487 F.3d at\n1085. The Inmates have failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact about whether the Arkansas protocol subjects them to a substantial risk of serious harm. On this record, we hold that the protocol does not violate the Eighth Amendment and that the district court appropriately granted the ADC’s motion for summary judgment \nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.']",CJ-AR-0001,"[ENTITYCHAIN] May 1, 2006 | Arkansas Department of Correction | 42 U.S.C. § 1983 | Eastern District of Arkansas ||| Federal Public Defender | Arkansas | potassium chloride ||| Arkansas Department of Corrections ||| May 4, 2006 ||| A few days later | July 5 of that year ||| May 26 | district court | Susan Webber Wright ||| June 16 | second plaintiff ||| Wright | June 26 ||| four days later ||| Department of Correction ||| § 1983 ||| June 19, 2006 ||| November 22, 2006 ||| December 1, 2006 ||| July 7, 2007 | United States Court of Appeals | Eighth Circuit ||| July 17, 2007 ||| Missouri ||| 2007 ||| August 5, 2008 ||| August 29, 2008 ||| February 8, 2010 | U.S. Court of Appeals ||| Court of Appeals | Kentucky | Supreme Court ||| November 10, 2010 | United States Supreme Court ||| 2017 ||| April 24, 2017 [SUMMARY] On May 1, 2006, an inmate awaiting execution at the Supermax Unit of the Arkansas Department of Correction filed this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Represented by the Federal Public Defender, the inmate claimed that the procedures used to carry out lethal injections in Arkansas—specifically the use of potassium chloride in the lethal cocktail of drugs—risked unnecessary conscious suffering in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief against the execution practices employed by the Arkansas Department of Corrections (ADC). He did not challenge his sentence or challenge the use of lethal injection. 

On May 4, 2006, a second death row inmate in Arkansas moved to intervene. A few days later, his execution was scheduled for July 5 of that year. On May 26, the district court (Judge Susan Webber Wright) allowed him to intervene as a plaintiff. 

On June 16, following his addition to the case, the second plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from carrying out executions in accordance with the lethal injection protocol. At the hearing on the motion, a medical expert testified that the state's lethal injection procedure created medically unacceptable risks of inflicting pain and suffering. Judge Wright granted the motion on June 26, noting that the plaintiff had not delayed in filing to intervene because he had had to wait to exhaust all of his appeals. The order granting the preliminary injunction stayed the State of Arkansas from implementing the order for execution of the second plaintiff. And four days later, the defendants appealed.

In the midst of ruling on the preliminary injunction appeal, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint, arguing that the plaintiff could not state a claim. First, they argued that the plaintiff had not exhausted all of the remedies available to him under the Department of Correction’s grievance policy. Second, the claim fell outside the statute of limitations for § 1983 actions. Judge Wright disagreed and denied the motion to dismiss on June 19, 2006. 

On November 22, 2006, a third death row inmate sought to intervene. On December 1, 2006, Judge Wright granted the motion. 

On July 7, 2007 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the preliminary injunction granted by the district court and vacated the stay of execution issued to the second plaintiff. The Court of Appeals found that the district court abused its discretion in granting the stay of execution and the preliminary injunction. Because the inmate could have brought his § 1983 claim before it was necessary to grant a stay, the district court exceeded the scope of its power to grant the preliminary injunction. 491 F.3d 804.

On July 17, 2007 the defendants filed for summary judgment. They argued that Arkansas's lethal injection protocol was substantially identical to the protocol used by the state of Missouri, which was upheld against constitutional challenge by the Eighth Circuit in <i>Taylor v. Crawford</i>, 487 F.3d 1072 (8th Cir. 2007). In their reply to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs argued that they had not been provided with the opportunity to engage in discovery, and that a significant number of genuine issues of material fact remained even without discovery. 

On August 5, 2008 the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dissolved the stay of execution. The district court relied on the Eighth Circuit's approval of Missouri's lethal injection protocol, which the court found was sufficiently similar to Arkansas' protocol. The district court found that the plaintiffs had failed to come forward with evidence that Arkansas' protocol for execution by lethal injection ""subject[ed] them to constitutionally significant risk of pain.""

On August 29, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an appeal. On February 8, 2010 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's summary judgment for the defendants. The Court found that Arkansas' protocol was substantially similar to Missouri's protocol upheld by the Court of Appeals and to Kentucky's protocol upheld by the Supreme Court.

On November 10, 2010, the United States Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari. At the time of this writing, the original plaintiff had not been executed. The second plaintiff was granted a stay in 2017. The third plaintiff was executed on April 24, 2017. The case is now closed.

Plaintiffs, \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT AND JURY TRIAL DEMAND\nWilliam Montgomery, in his official capacity as County Attorney of Maricopa County; Maricopa County; Treatment Assessment Screening 19 Center, Inc., Defendants.\nOVERVIEW\n1. The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office (MCAO) and the Treatment 23 Assessment Screening Center (TASC) jointly operate a possession of marijuana 24 diversion program1 that penalizes the poor because of their poverty.\n27 1 This diversion program is referred to in the Complaint as “the possession of marijuana diversion program,” “the marijuana diversion program,” and “the program.”\n2. In a “diversion” program, participants undergo a period of supervision 2 and must meet certain requirements to avoid criminal prosecution and conviction.\n3. The programs are generally “a functional equivalent of a sentence to 4 pretrial probation... and [are] staffed with paraprofessionals overseeing individuals in 5 what [is] in effect a probationary-type of supervision and control.”2\n4. In principle, the programs are “intended to relieve overburdened courts 7 and crowded jails, and to spare low-risk offenders from the devastating consequences 8 of a criminal record.”3\n5. But in Maricopa County, they serve another purpose: to make money for 10 those who operate the program, including the MCAO.4\n6. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO collected nearly $15 million in revenue 12 by diverting threatened prosecutions to TASC.5\n7. The length of time a person spends in the diversion program and whether 14 the person ultimately completes the program and avoids felony criminal prosecution 15 depends on whether she can pay the program’s required fees.\n17 2 S\nRep\nNo. 93–1021, at 36–37 (1974) (describing the operation of two pretrial diversion programs).\n18 3 Shalia Dewan Andrew W.

In order to complete the program and avoid felony criminal prosecution, 2 participants in the marijuana diversion program must pay a fee of $950 or $1000.\n9. Participants must also pay $15 or $17 for drug and alcohol tests up to 4 three times each week.\n10. The program is two-tiered: people who meet program requirements— 6 completing a three-hour drug education seminar and routine drug and alcohol testing— 7 and are wealthy enough to pay the program fees complete the program in 90 days and 8 are no longer subject to felony criminal prosecution.\n11. But participants who cannot pay the program fees are forced to stay in the 10 program for at least six months or until they can pay off the money owed to MCAO and 11 TASC, even if they have satisfied every program requirement other than payment.\n12. During the “pay-only”6 period, participants are subject to all of the 13 diversion program’s requirements.\n13. These requirements include reporting to a TASC location, as often as 15 three times per week, so that the participant’s urine can be collected and tested.\n14. Participants who remain on diversion solely because of their inability to 17 pay program fees must also continue to pay $15 or $17 each time they are required to 18 submit to a drug and alcohol test.\n15. The perverse result is that poor people are ultimately charged more 20 money—potentially hundreds of dollars more—than are similarly situated participants 21 who can afford to pay to finish the program in 90 days.\n24 6 “Pay-only” refers to a period of criminal supervision during which the person is 25 supervised only because she has not paid all of her debt. This “extremely muscular form of debt collection,” which “masquerades as supervision,” is becoming 26 increasingly common. Human Rights Watch, Profiting from Probation: America’s ‘Offender Funded’ Probation Industry (Feb. 5, 2014), https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/02/05/profiting-probation/americas-offender- 28 funded-probation-industry.\n16. They also remain subject to felony criminal prosecution during the 2 additional time they are forced to remain in the diversion program.\n17. In addition, participants are not allowed to complete certain program 4 requirements if they cannot afford to pay for them.\n18. For example, if a participant cannot pay the $15 or $17 fee for a drug and 6 alcohol test, she is not allowed to take the required test at all.\n19. Therefore, if a participant reports for a drug and alcohol test without the 8 required fee, she will be turned away and can be referred for felony prosecution for 9 failing to complete a mandatory drug and alcohol test.\n20. In other words, an unpaid drug and alcohol test is a failed test.\n21. If a participant misses too many drug and alcohol tests—even if she 12 missed them solely because she could not afford to pay for them—she will be failed out 13 of the diversion program and prosecuted for felony possession of marijuana.\n22. MCAO and TASC enforce these policies even when they know that 15 diversion participants are poor or even homeless, and even when they know that 16 participants are sacrificing basic necessities to pay fees.\n23. Diversion participants who alert TASC employees that they cannot afford 18 the required fees are told that they will be failed from the program if they do not pay 19 and to do whatever it takes to get the money.\n24. For example, Plaintiff Marc Pascale is a 60-year-old man with 21 degenerative disc disease, which has left him physically unable to work.\n25. TASC refused to waive his program and drug and alcohol testing fees 23 even after he repeatedly told them that he could not afford to pay the fees.\n26\nMr. Pascale’s case manager repeatedly told him to borrow money to pay 25 the fees or else he would fail the program, lose the money he had already paid in 26 program and drug and alcohol testing fees, and be prosecuted for felony criminal 27 possession of marijuana.\n27. Plaintiff Taja Collier emailed her case manager at TASC to tell her that 2 she was homeless and could not afford to pay for drug and alcohol testing.\n28\nMs. Collier’s case manager responded that if she did not test, she would 4 be issued a notice of violation and her case would be sent back to court, where she 5 would be prosecuted for felony criminal possession of marijuana.\n29. As a result, Ms. Collier sold her blood plasma to pay for drug and alcohol 7 tests.\n30. Plaintiffs bring this civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to 9 redress violations of Named Plaintiffs’, class members’, and Plaintiff Collier’s rights 10 under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\n31. Named Plaintiffs Deshawn Briggs and Mark Pascale, as well as the class 12 members whose interests they represent, seek monetary damages against Defendants 13 for violation of these rights.\n32. Plaintiff Taja Collier seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief on her 15 own behalf.\nPARTIES\nPlaintiffs\n33. Plaintiff Deshawn Briggs is a 28-year-old African American man. He is 19 a resident of Maricopa County, Arizona Mr. Briggs spent six months in Defendants’ 20 marijuana diversion program solely because he was unable to pay the program fees 21 within 90 days. He represents himself and a class of similarly situated people subject to\n34. Plaintiff Marc Pascale is a 60-year-old white man. He is a resident of 24 Maricopa County, Arizona Mr. Pascale spent more than seven months in Defendants’ 25 marijuana diversion program solely because he was unable to pay the program fees in 26 90 days. He represents himself and a class of similarly situated people subject to\n35. Plaintiff Taja Collier is a 21-year-old African American woman. She is 2 a resident of Maricopa County, Arizona Ms. Collier was willing to meet all diversion 3 requirements, but she could not afford to pay for drug and alcohol testing, particularly 4 during a month when she was homeless and sleeping in parks. After Ms. Collier could 5 not afford to pay for several drug and alcohol tests, she was failed out of the diversion 6 program and was prosecuted for felony possession of marijuana Ms. Collier was 7 prosecuted for felony marijuana possession and was once again diverted into 8 Defendants’ program Ms. Collier brings this suit on her own behalf.\nDefendants\n36. Defendant Bill Montgomery is the elected County Attorney for 11 Maricopa County, Arizona. Defendant Montgomery is the chief official responsible for 12 the enforcement and prosecution of felonies within Maricopa County. Defendant 13 Montgomery is also responsible for operating and administering the deferred 14 prosecution programs in Maricopa County. Defendant Montgomery is the final 15 policymaker for Maricopa County on matters relating to diversion programs, including 16 the marijuana diversion program at issue in this lawsuit. He is sued in his official 17 capacity.\n37. Defendant Maricopa County, Arizona7 is a political subdivision formed 19 and designated as such pursuant to Title 11 of the Arizona Revised Statutes. Defendant 20 Maricopa County can sue and be sued in its own name. Maricopa County is liable for 21 the practices and policies of Defendants Montgomery and TASC. The County has and 22 continues to acquiesce in the administration of the TASC drug diversion program, 23 including the marijuana diversion program at issue in this lawsuit.\n38. Defendant Treatment Assessment Screening Center (“TASC”) is a 25 private, non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona.\n27 7 Defendant Montgomery, in his official capacity, acts on behalf of and is the final policymaker for Maricopa County with respect to the conduct described in this 28 lawsuit. If this is correct, naming Maricopa County as a defendant is redundant. 6 1 Defendant TASC has contracted and continues to contract with MCAO to operate, 2 administer, and supervise the marijuana diversion program at issue in this lawsuit.\n3 Defendant TASC supervises all people whose prosecutions for simple possession of 4 marijuana have been diverted. Defendant TASC acts under the color of law in its 5 administration and supervision of the County’s marijuana diversion program.\nJURISDICTION\n39. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Constitution of the 8 United States. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n40. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). All Defendants’ official 11 places of business are located within this District. The events giving rise to the claims 12 occurred in this District.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n14 I. Defendants’ Unlawful Policies Marijuana Possession Prosecutions in Maricopa County\n41. In Arizona, possession of any amount of marijuana—even trace 17 amounts—can be prosecuted as a felony.8\n42. Defendant County Attorney Bill Montgomery has aggressively opposed 19 legalization measures as well as efforts to reduce simple possession of marijuana to a 20 misdemeanor.\n24 8 See Ariz Rev. Stat Ann. § 13-3405(B)(1) (providing that possession of “an amount 25 of marijuana not possessed for sale having a weight of less than two pounds is guilty of a class 6 felony”). Arizona is the only state in the nation where any amount of 26 marijuana, no matter how small, can draw a felony charge. See Jacon Sullum, Explaining His Cannabis Conversion, John Boehner Cites a Marijuana Myth, Reason (Apr. 12, 2018), http://reason.com/blog/2018/04/12/explaining-his-cannabis- 28 conversion-john/print.\n43. In 2016, Defendant Montgomery successfully advocated against the 2 passage of Proposition 205, a ballot initiative that would have made recreational 3 marijuana use legal in Arizona.\n44. Defendant Montgomery made numerous public statements and 5 participated in public debates attacking the initiative and advocating for its failure.\n45. During a public debate on marijuana legalization, Defendant 7 Montgomery told a Vietnam veteran, who admitted to using medical marijuana for back 8 pain and occasional recreation use, “I have no respect for you. … [Y]ou’re an enemy.”\n46. Defendant Montgomery has also worked to narrow Arizona’s medical 10 marijuana laws.\n47. For example, when Defendant Montgomery learned that doctors were 12 able to stop a five-year-old’s seizures by using a marijuana extract, he threatened the 13 child’s parents with felony prosecution, arguing that extracts were not covered by the 14 state’s medical marijuana allowance.9\n48. Drug possession charges represent an overwhelming proportion of the 16 charges filed by MCAO.\n49. Possession of marijuana is the MCAO’s most commonly prosecuted 18 offense; it amounts to approximately 15 percent of total prosecutions.10\n50. And more broadly, more than 45 percent of MCAO’s prosecutions are for 20 drug possession.11 23 9 Evan Wyloge, Court Rules Medical Marijuana Patients Can Use Extracts, Ariz.\nCapitol Times (Mar. 22, 2014), https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2014/03/22/az24 medical-marijuana-patients-can-use-cannabis-extract-court-rules-bill-montgomery.\n25 10 See Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, 2016 Annual Report, at 43, available at https://www.maricopacountyattorney.org/ArchiveCenter/View-File/Item/88.\n26 The year 2016 is the most recent for which MCAO has published this charging data. 11 Id. (calculated by adding the percentage of the total offenses charged represented 28 by each type of drug charge listed).\n51. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO made nearly $15 million from diverting 2 threatened prosecutions to TASC.12 The Possession of Marijuana Diversion Program\n52. For most people who are arrested in Maricopa County for simple 5 possession of marijuana, the only way to avoid a felony criminal prosecution is to 6 complete the diversion program offered by MCAO.\n53. To operate, administer, and supervise participants in the program, MCAO 8 has contracted with TASC, a private non-profit company.\n54. More than 15,000 people participated in MCAO and TASC’s marijuana 10 diversion program between 2011 and 2017.13\n55. Over that same time period, the marijuana diversion program accounted 12 for approximately three quarters of TASC’s total intakes for drug diversion.14\n56. People arrested for simple possession of marijuana or marijuana 14 paraphernalia can enter the diversion program either before or after criminal charges 15 are filed.\n57. People who enter into the marijuana diversion program post-filing have 17 charges filed against them prior to enrolling in the program.\n58. The charges are suspended while the person completes the program.\n59. If the person successfully completes the program, MCAO dismisses the 20 case.\n23 12 Cassidy, supra note\n4. 13 See id. (providing the number of participants who enrolled in the program between 24 2011 and 2015); Letter from Bill Montgomery, County Attorney, Maricopa County, 25 to Elizabeth Ortiz, Executive Director, Arizona Prosecuting Attorneys’ Advisory Council (Aug. 8, 2017) (providing the number of participants who enrolled in the 26 program from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017). 27 14 See Cassidy, supra note 4; Letter from Bill Montgomery, County Attorney, Maricopa County, to Elizabeth Ortiz, Executive Director, Arizona Prosecuting 28 Attorneys’ Advisory Council (Aug. 8, 2017). 9\n60. If the person fails to complete the program, MCAO reinstates 2 prosecution.\n61. People can also enter the program before any criminal charges are filed 4 in court.\n62. People who enter the marijuana diversion program pre-filing are sent a 6 letter from MCAO.\n63. The letter informs the person that she is facing class 6 felony charges and 8 offers two options: criminal prosecution or the TASC marijuana diversion program.\n64. The letter warns, “If convicted of a class 6 felony, you could receive a 10 maximum sentence of 2 years in prison and a maximum fine of $150,000 plus 80% 11 surcharge.”\n65. The letter also warns that a class 1 misdemeanor conviction could result 13 in “a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a maximum fine of $2,500.00 plus 14 80% surcharge.”\n66. The threats in this letter are false.\n67. Under Arizona law, jail or prison time is prohibited for a first or second 17 offense of simple possession of marijuana.\n68. Instead, for people in this category, the law requires drug treatment and a 19 maximum penalty of probation. See Ariz Rev\nStat. § 13-901.01(A), (D), (H)(1).\n69. The pre-filing diversion program generally only includes people with no 21 prior convictions.\n70. Accordingly, the vast majority of people who receive the pre-filing letter 23 threatening jail time are ineligible to be jailed as a matter of state law.\n71. The letter’s representation that its recipients could be fined $150,000 plus 25 an 80% surcharge are false as well.15 27 15 A person convicted of possession of marijuana can be fined $750 or three times the value of the marijuana involved. See Ariz Rev\nStat. § 13-3405(D). $150,000 is the 28 maximum fine allowable for any felony. See Ariz Rev\nStat. § 13-801(a). No person 10\n72. After delivering these false threats, the letter explains the basic 2 requirements of the marijuana diversion program and provides a deadline and contact 3 information to sign up for the program.\n73. If a person in the pre-filing category completes the diversion program, 5 MCAO will not file charges against her.\n74. Failing the program results in criminal prosecution.16\n75. Participants who do not complete the diversion program and whose cases 8 are prosecuted have little hope of avoiding felony criminal prosecution and conviction 9 because people who enroll in the marijuana diversion program—whether pre- or post- 10 filing—are first required to sign a statement admitting their guilt.\n76. A TASC employee tells participants exactly what to write in the statement 12 of facts.\n77. The following information must be written into the statement:\na. Date and location of the offense;\nb. The full name of the substance possessed;\nc. That the participant possessed a usable amount of the substance; and d. The facts of the offense, which must read, “the [name of the drug] was found in [where the drug was found] in my possession.”\n78. This signed statement of facts can be used against a person if she fails to 20 complete the marijuana diversion program and is criminally prosecuted. See State v. 21 Gill, 391 P.3d 1193, 1197 (Ariz. 2017) (holding that a written admission contained in 22 a statement of facts obtained by a TASC representative was admissible at trial).\n24 accused of a crime involving $150,000 worth of marijuana would be eligible for 25 TASC. 16 When a person in the pre-filing group fails diversion, the prosecutor will file 26 charges in the case. When a person in the post-filing group fails diversion, the prosecutor will move to reinstate the prosecution. As a matter of policy, practice, and custom, for both pre- and post-filing participants, TASC sends the participant a final 28 warning letter before the participant is failed from the program.\nThe Cost of Avoiding Prosecution\n79. Once enrolled in the marijuana diversion program, the requirements for 3 the pre- and post-filing participants are the same.\n80. For both groups of participants, avoiding prosecution costs money.\n81. To complete the program, all participants must:\na. Pay program fees—$950 or $1000—in full;\nb. Pay for and pass routine drug and alcohol tests for 90 days; and c. Complete a three-hour drug education seminar.\n82. The mandatory $950 or $1000 program fee includes:\na. A $150 admission fee;\nb. A $650 “drug fund” fee;\nc. A $150 TASC fee; and d. A $50 booking fee, which applies only to participants who were arrested and booked.\n83. All of these fees must be paid in person by debit card or with a money 16 order.\n84. Participants are not allowed to pay by any other means, including with 18 credit or cash.\n85. Defendants require that participants pay the $150 admission fee at the 20 program orientation.\n86. If a participant is unable to pay the $150 admission fee at orientation 22 because she cannot afford it, Defendants allow her to pay $75 at orientation and the 23 other $75 during the program.\n87. If a participant is allowed to attend orientation without making a payment 25 up front, she may be told to return with the money the same day or be failed from the 26 program and face felony prosecution.\n88. In addition to the $950 or $1000 in fees, participants must pay to take 2 drug and alcohol tests at TASC.\n89. Each drug and alcohol test costs $15 or $17, depending on the method of 4 payment.\n90. Participants are called to drug test at least once—and often multiple 6 times—each week.\n91. Records obtained as part of the preliminary investigation for this lawsuit 8 revealed that participants may be required to test as many as nine times per month.\n92. Thus, on top of the $1000 in program fees, diversion participants pay at 10 least $60—but up to $153—each month for drug and alcohol tests.\n93. Participants who complete the three program requirements—including 12 full payment of fees—within 90 days are deemed to have successfully completed the 13 program and are no longer subject to felony criminal prosecution.\n94. However, as a matter of policy, practice, and custom, people who cannot 15 afford to pay the program fees in full within 90 days are not released from the 16 program—even if they meet program requirements and have never tested positive for 17 marijuana (or any other drug, including alcohol).\n95. Instead, participants who cannot afford to pay these fees must remain in 19 the supervision program for a minimum of six months.\n96. If these participants are not able to pay the program fees by the end of six 21 months, they must remain in the program until they do.\n97. Defendants do not assess a person’s ability to pay before refusing to 23 consider her for program completion after 90 days solely because she has not finished 24 paying the required fees.\n98. Nor do Defendants assess a person’s ability to pay before they require her 26 to remain on diversion until all fees are paid.\n99. People who are forced to stay on diversion solely because they cannot 2 afford to pay program fees must continue to submit to one or more drug and alcohol 3 tests weekly—under the threat of criminal prosecution.\n100. The stalls in which participants submit urine for drug alcohol testing 5 frequently include glass panels so that a TASC employee can watch participants while 6 they urinate.\n101. In at least one TASC location, the bathroom where participants submit 8 urine for testing includes multiple mirrors so that a TASC employee can watch the 9 participant urinate from multiple angles.\n102. Participants who remain on diversion solely because they could not pay 11 to complete the program must also complete all of the requirements attendant to the\n103. For example, these participants must call TASC every day—or consult a 14 phone application—seven days a week, to determine whether they are required to report 15 to a TASC location during a certain time period that day so that TASC can collect and 16 test their urine.\n104. If a participant does not call daily, this can be counted as a missed drug 18 and alcohol test and she can be sanctioned, which could potentially result in felony 19 prosecution.\n105. Participants are also not permitted to drink “excessive amounts of fluids,” 21 since doing so can dilute a urine sample.\n106. People who remain on diversion because they cannot afford to pay 23 program fees are also still forced to pay $15 or $17 for each drug and alcohol test.\n107. As a result, these participants may ultimately have to pay hundreds of 25 dollars more than people wealthy enough to pay the $950 or $1000 program fee within 26 90 days—in addition to remaining subject to felony criminal prosecution for months 27 longer.\nDefendants’ Refusal to Waive Fees for the Poor\n108. As a matter of policy, practice, and custom, Defendants do not reduce or 3 waive the $950 or $1000 program fee for any person, regardless of financial 4 circumstances.\n109. Defendants contend that they allow for reductions of drug and alcohol 6 testing fees to $7 instead of $15 per test for participants who cannot afford them—but 7 these reductions are almost never granted in practice.\n110. At the outset, Defendants do not assess participants’ ability to pay before 9 charging them in full for tests.\n111. But even when Defendants are aware that a participant is indigent and 11 unable to pay without sacrificing basic necessities, Defendants require the participant 12 to pay the full $15 or $17 to test.\n112. One TASC employee interviewed by investigators for undersigned 14 counsel stated that reduced drug and alcohol testing fees are reserved for people who 15 can demonstrate that they have basically zero income.\n113. Another TASC employee explained that fee reductions are “very 17 difficult” to get and that “it rarely happens.”\n114. As one TASC employee explained, drug and alcohol testing is “strictly 19 fee for service.”\n115. When participants tell TASC case managers that they are struggling to 21 pay, the case managers recommend they borrow money from friends or family because 22 they will be failed from the program and prosecuted if they do not pay.\nDefendants Do Not Allow Participants to Take Drug and Alcohol Tests Unless They Pay for Them\n116. As a matter of policy, practice, and custom, Defendants do not allow 26 diversion participants to take the program’s mandatory drug and alcohol tests unless 27 they can pay for them at the time of the test.\n117. As a result, poor people are forced to extend their time on the program 2 for failing to take mandatory drug and alcohol tests—solely because they could not 3 afford to pay for them.\n118. People who cannot afford to take drug and alcohol tests may also fail the 5 program altogether.\n119. Missed drug and alcohol tests are counted as “violations”—even when a 7 person only missed the test because she could not afford to pay for it.\n120. A person who accrues too many of these violations will be failed by 9 TASC and referred to the MCAO for prosecution.\n121. When this happens, a person faces felony prosecution solely because of 11 her inability to pay.\n122. No one at TASC assesses a person’s ability to pay before referring her for 13 prosecution because she did not pay for drug and alcohol tests.\n123. Nor does anyone at MCAO assess ability to pay before prosecuting 15 people who have failed diversion solely because of their inability to pay for drug and 16 alcohol tests.\nThe “User-Funded” Model\n124. Defendants MCAO and TASC advertise the diversion program as “user- 19 funded.”\n125. According to MCAO, “user-funded” means that “the [person entering the 21 program] typically bears the costs of the initial assessment and the assigned treatment.”\n126. A brochure published by MCAO describing its felony pretrial diversion 23 programs notes that “defendants … bear the costs of the program.”17\n127. Defendant TASC’s website explains that the diversion program “is fully 25 funded by the clients we serve.”18 17 Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, Felony Pretrial Intervention Program (2018). 18 Diversion, TASC, http://www.tascsolutions.org/tasc-services/diversion (last visited 28 Aug. 22, 2018).\n128. Defendant TASC is responsible for collecting fees from the people 2 enrolled in the diversion program.\n129. Defendant TASC keeps a portion of the money it collects.\n130. The $650 “drug fund fee” that Defendant TASC collects from each 5 participant is deposited to MCAO.\n131. MCAO does not publicly disclose how it spends the money it receives 7 from the program.\n132. In addition to collecting fees, the Contract between Defendants MCAO 9 and TASC makes Defendant TASC responsible for most of the day-to-day operations 10 of the possession of marijuana diversion program.\n133. This includes administering drug and alcohol tests, tracking participants’ 12 attendance and participation, and determining whether a participant has completed the 13 program requirements.\n134. MCAO’s duties under the Contract are to assess the appropriateness of 15 referrals to the program and to send qualified participants to Defendant TASC.\n135. The Contract does not require the MCAO to pay Defendant TASC any 17 money.\n136. Instead, the Contract provides that the program’s participants alone will 19 pay Defendant TASC, and “no public monies will be expended pursuant to [the 20 Contract].”19\n137. The Contract does provide that, “[a]t his option, the County Attorney may 22 utilize monies accumulated in the Drug Diversion Fund to satisfy the costs associated 23 with this agreement if the participant is indigent and unable to pay the costs associated 24 with the … diversion program.”20 27 19 MCAO TASC, Behavior Specific Adult Diversion Program Contract, at 1 (Mar. 22, 2016, effective through Sept. 30, 2018).\n28 20 Id. 17\n138. But there is no requirement that MCAO make such payments. 21\n139. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO made nearly $15 million in fees from 3 participants in the marijuana diversion program.22\n140. Defendant TASC has also benefited financially from operating the 5 marijuana diversion program.\n141. Defendant TASC’s net assets were approximately $18 million in 2016.23\n142. In 2014, TASC paid its CEO $281,165 and its former CEO $963,358.24 Plaintiffs Class Representatives Deshawn Briggs and Mark Pascale\n145. Class representatives Deshawn Briggs and Mark Pascale were both 13 required to remain in the pretrial diversion program for more than double the time 14 required of similarly situated (but wealthier) participants solely because they were 15 unable to pay program fees.\n146. Plaintiff Deshawn Briggs was arrested for simple possession of marijuana 17 in December 2015.\n147\nMr. Briggs had no prior criminal record\n148. He was not addicted to marijuana.\n149. On or around January 13, 2016, Mr. Briggs received a letter from MCAO.\n150. The letter stated that he had two options with respect to his marijuana 22 arrest: he could face prosecution and conviction with a punishment of two years in jail 24 21 The Contract states, “[U]nder no circumstances is the County liable for any fees or 25 costs related to [the] Contract.” Id. 22 Cassidy, supra note 4.\n24 See IRS Form 990, filed by TASC for 2014, at\n7. 25 See IRS Form 990, filed by TASC for 2015, at 7.\n1 and a fine of up to $150,000 plus an 80% surcharge—or he could participate in the 2 TASC pretrial diversion program.\n151. The claims in the letter Mr. Briggs received were false.\n152. Because this was Mr. Briggs’ first offense, under Arizona law, he could \n153\nMr. Briggs also did not face a $150,000 fine.\n154\nMr. Briggs did not know that he could not receive jail time for conviction 8 of marijuana possession since it was his first offense.\n155. He also did not know that he could not be fined $150,000.\n156\nMr. Briggs chose to participate in the pretrial diversion program because 11 he did not want to go to jail and thought the diversion program was the only way to 12 avoid two years of incarceration and a six-figure fine.\n157\nMr. Briggs followed the instructions given in the letter and contacted 14 TASC to enroll in the program.\n158. A TASC employee told Mr. Briggs to appear for orientation and bring a 16 $150 intake fee.\n159. At the orientation, a TASC employee informed Mr. Briggs of the program 18 requirements and fees.\n160. The TASC employee told Mr. Briggs that he would have to submit to and 20 pass random drug and alcohol tests for 90 days, complete a three-hour drug education 21 class, and pay his program fees of $1000 in full within that 90-day period.\n161. The TASC employee told Mr. Briggs that the program would either last 23 for 90 days or six months.\n162. The employee told him that if he tested clean, attended the class, and paid 25 his program fees in full, then he would complete the program in 90 days.\n163. If he did not complete any of the three requirements in the first 90 days, 2 including payment of fees in full, he would have to stay in the program for an additional 3 three months or be prosecuted for a felony.\n164. The TASC Employee did not ask Mr. Briggs whether he would be able 5 to pay the program and drug and alcohol testing fees.\n165\nMr. Briggs was told to sign a “statement of facts” as a condition of entry 7 into the program.\n166. The statement of facts stated that Mr. Briggs possessed a usable quantity 9 of marijuana.\n167\nMr. Briggs did not consult with an attorney before signing the statement 11 because he could not afford one.\n168. Because of this, Mr. Briggs believed that if he failed to meet the 13 program’s requirements—including paying the necessary fees—he would go to jail.\n169\nMr. Briggs passed all of his drug tests during the first 90 days of the 15 program.\n170. During that time period, Mr. Briggs was required to report for drug and 17 alcohol testing up to three times each week.\n171\nMr. Briggs was forced to pay each time he reported for a drug and alcohol 19 test, even though he was struggling to pay for basic necessities.\n172\nMr. Briggs also completed the required three-hour drug education 21 seminar during his first 90 days on the program.\n173. However, in that first 90 days, Mr. Briggs could not afford to pay the 23 $1000 fee.\n174. At the time, Mr. Briggs worked part time at a Walmart, where he made 25 $10 an hour.\n175. His monthly pay was less than $1000.\n176\nMr. Briggs also has disabilities caused by spinal meningitis that limit his 2 ability to work.\n177. During the first 90 days of the program, Mr. Briggs was only able to pay 4 $421 toward the $1000 balance.\n178\nMr. Briggs made those payments in small installments.\n179. He paid one $75 installment toward his $150 orientation fee on February\n180. He paid the second installment on April 14, 2016.\n181. On that same date, Mr. Briggs paid another $95 toward his balance.\n182. On May 5, 2016, Mr. Briggs paid $170 toward his balance.\n183. On May 11, 2016, he paid another $16.\n184. During that same time period, Mr. Briggs paid approximately $195 for\n185. Despite meeting all other program requirements, Mr. Briggs was not 15 considered for program completion because he had not paid the $1000 fee in full.\n186. Instead, Mr. Briggs was required to remain on diversion, and remained 17 subject to felony criminal prosecution.\n187\nMr. Briggs was also required to report to drug and alcohol testing once to 19 three times each week.\n188. After the first 90 days on the program, Mr. Briggs reported for and passed 21 15 drug and alcohol tests.\n189. These additional drug and alcohol tests cost Mr. Briggs approximately \n190\nMr. Briggs also continued to make payments against his balance.\n191. On June 16, 2016, Mr. Briggs paid $170.\n192. On July 14, 2016, he paid $70.\n193. On August 18, 2016, he paid $50.\n194. Finally, on August 25, 2016, Mr. Briggs paid a final installment of $275.\n195. When Mr. Briggs made this final payment, a TASC employee told 3 Mr. Briggs that had successfully completed the program and that he should return to 4 the TASC office the next day to receive his certificate of completion.\n196\nMr. Briggs returned to the TASC offices the following day and received 6 a certification of completion from TASC.\n197. Plaintiff Mark Pascale is a 60-year-old man.\n198\nMr. Pascale lives in Maricopa County, Arizona with his 15-year-old son, 9 for whom he is the sole provider.\n199\nMr. Pascale is disabled; he suffers from degenerative disc disease in his 11 neck and back.\n200. To manage his symptoms, Mr. Pascale takes an anti-epileptic drug, an 13 anti-convulsant drug, and morphine every day.\n201. Because of his illness, Mr. Pascale has been physically unable to work 15 since 2008.\n202. That year, Mr. Pascale filed for bankruptcy.\n203\nMr. Pascale’s only stable source of income comes from federal disability 18 benefits.\n204\nMr. Pascale also receives nutritional assistance benefits and, in the past, 20 has received assistance from government programs to pay his utility bills.\n205. In May 2017, a police officer found a small amount of marijuana in 22 Mr. Pascale’s car.\n206\nMr. Pascale was not arrested, but he received a criminal summons in the 24 mail in October 2017, stating that he was being charged with possession or use of 25 marijuana, a class 6 felony.\n207. At his first court appearance, Mr. Pascale agreed to enroll in the 27 marijuana diversion program.\n208\nMr. Pascale was not addicted to marijuana.\n209\nMr. Pascale attended an orientation for the program on November 21, \n210\nMr. Pascale could not afford to pay the $150 application fee that TASC 5 requires at orientation.\n211. A TASC employee agreed to allow Mr. Pascale to pay $75 up front 7 instead of $150 to attend the orientation.\n212. The remaining $75 was added to Mr. Pascale’s bill, and he was required 9 to pay it before he could complete the diversion program.\n213. During the orientation, a TASC employee told Mr. Pascale that he could 11 complete the program in 90 days if he did not fail any drug and alcohol tests and paid 12 all required fees in full.\n214. When Mr. Pascale reported for his first mandatory drug and alcohol test, 14 he told his case worker at TASC that he could not afford to pay the $950 in program 15 fees.27\n215. He also told her that he could not afford to pay $15 or $17 for drug and 17 alcohol testing weekly or multiple times each week.\n216\nMr. Pascale’s case worker told him that there was no way to waive or 19 reduce the program fees.\n217. However, she explained, his drug and alcohol testing fees could 21 potentially be reduced to $7 per test instead of $15 per test.\n218. The case worker gave Mr. Pascale a financial information form to 23 complete.\n219. On the form, Mr. Pascale marked that he was disabled and worked zero 25 hours per week.\n28 27 Because Mr. Pascale was not arrested, he did not have to pay the $50 booking fee. 23\n220. He listed his income as $920 per month, explaining that he received 2 disability benefits.\n221. The case worker told Mr. Pascale that he did not qualify for reduced drug 4 and alcohol testing fees because he owned a computer and was paying for internet 5 service, which are “luxuries.” \n222\nMr. Pascale therefore had to pay the full $15 for each required drug and 7 alcohol test.\n223. These payments, made out of his disability income, made it difficult for 9 Mr. Pascale to pay for basic necessities for himself and his son, including food, shelter, 10 medication, and clothing.\n224\nr. Pascale was tested at least once per week, but as often as three times 12 per week.\n225. At least once each month, Mr. Pascale would be asked to submit to 14 additional drug and alcohol testing because he had tested positive for opiates due to the 15 prescription medications he takes.\n226\nMr. Pascale had provided his case worker with information and 17 documentation about the prescription medications that he takes (including morphine), 18 but even so, she ordered the extra testing.\n227\nMr. Pascale had to pay for these additional tests as well.\n228\nMr. Pascale frequently emphasized to his case worker that he did not have 21 the money to pay for drug and alcohol tests.\n229. The case worker told Mr. Pascale that he had to pay in order to be tested 23 and suggested he borrow money.\n230\nMr. Pascale often skipped paying bills to keep up with the fees.\n231. After 90 days had passed, Mr. Pascale had met all non-monetary program 26 requirements and had never failed a drug and alcohol test.\n232. He had not, however, finished paying the $950 he owed in program fees.\n233. As a result, Mr. Pascale was required to remain on diversion until all of 2 the fees were paid.\n234. During this time, he was still required to submit to and pay for drug and 4 alcohol testing up to three times each week.\n235\nMr. Pascale made his final payment—and submitted to and passed his 6 final drug and alcohol test—on June 29, 2018, more than seven months after he had 7 entered the program.\n236. When Mr. Pascale told his case worker that he had paid his program fees 9 in full, she told him that he had successfully completed the program and issued a 10 certificate of completion dated July 5, 2018.\nIndividual Plaintiff Taja Collier\n237. Plaintiff Taja Collier is a 21-year-old African American woman.\n238. On October 7, 2016, Ms. Collier was riding in a car with friends when the 14 car was pulled over by a police officer for making an improper turn.\n239. The officer searched the car’s occupants and found a small cylinder in 16 Ms. Collier’s purse that contained trace amounts of marijuana.\n240. The amount of marijuana in the container was so small that the police 18 officer did not weigh it.\n241\nMs. Collier was placed under arrest for possession of marijuana.\n242\nMs. Collier had no prior criminal record.\n243\nMs. Collier was not addicted to marijuana.\n244. In early Spring 2017, Ms. Collier received a letter from MCAO.\n245. The letter gave her two choices: she could face felony charges for 24 marijuana possession, or she could agree to participate in the TASC diversion program.\n246. The letter warned Ms. Collier that if convicted, she could be sentenced to 26 two years in jail and a fine of up to $150,000, plus an 80% surcharge.\n247. These threats were false.\n248. Because this was Ms. Collier’s first offense, under Arizona law, she could\n249. Nor was Ms. Collier eligible for a $150,000 fine.\n250. But Ms. Collier believed the threats in the letter.\n251. She decided to enroll in the TASC diversion program because she did not 6 want to be fined $150,000 or spend two years in prison.\n252. At the time of her arrest, Mr. Collier was a sophomore at Central Arizona 8 College, where she studied social work.\n253. Central Arizona College is located in Casa Grande, Arizona, which is 10 almost an hour away from Phoenix.\n254. When Ms. Collier learned that the TASC diversion program required 12 drug and alcohol testing in Phoenix multiple times each week, she decided she could 13 not go back to college while she was on the TASC program.\n255\nMs. Collier did not have a car or money to make such a long trip so 15 frequently.\n256. She had to stop attending school and move to Phoenix in order to 17 participate in the diversion program.\n257\nMs. Collier was told that she would need to pay $150 at the orientation in 19 order to start the program.\n258. She planned to start the program on June 22, 2017.\n259. That week, however, Ms. Collier realized she would not be able to come 22 up with the $150 required to start the program.\n260\nMs. Collier had recently started a job working part-time at a Target.\n261\nMs. Collier made around minimum wage and worked approximately 16 25 hours per week.\n262. However, she had not yet received her first paycheck.\n263\nMs. Collier called TASC’s main office to tell them that she could not 2 afford to pay the $150 fee.\n264. No one called her back.\n265. At 6:51 a.m. on the morning her orientation was set to begin, Ms. Collier 5 sent an email to the general email address for the possession of marijuana diversion 6 program.\n266. The email read, “Hi, my name is Taja Collier. I called the office to 8 reschedule my appointment 2 days ago and have not received a call back. I left a 9 message for the corporate office and nod [sic] I'm sending this email. I had an 10 appointment today at 8:45 and I do not have 150 because I get my first check next week.\n11 I do not want my file sent back to the court system.”\n267. Later the same day, Ms. Collier reached a TASC employee by phone and 13 rescheduled her orientation for July 6, 2017.\n268. Several days later, however, on June 25, 2017, Ms. Collier learned that 15 she would not be paid until after July 9, 2017.\n269\nMs. Collier wrote again to the email address for the possession of 17 marijuana diversion program and informed TASC that she needed to reschedule the 18 orientation for after she got paid.\n270. A TASC employee rescheduled Ms. Collier’s orientation for July 13,\n271. The employee did not tell her that she could start the program even if she 22 did not pay.\n272. The employee also did not tell her that she could apply for a fee waiver 24 or a fee reduction.\n273. On July 13, 2017, Ms. Collier paid $150 to TASC and attended the 26 mandatory orientation.\n274. Shortly after her orientation, Ms. Collier was informed by the case 2 manager that had been assigned to her that she had to submit to a drug and alcohol test 3 and that she had to pay for the test in order to take it.\n275\nMs. Collier was willing to take the mandatory test, but she could not 5 afford the $15 or $17 fee to pay for it.\n276\nMs. Collier again emailed the address for the possession of marijuana 7 diversion program.\n277. In her email, Ms. Collier pleaded: “I won't be able to come up with the 9 fee money until next Friday. I keep calling [my case manager] to figure out what my 10 next steps should be. Is there anyway [sic] I can change case managers or get some 11 assistance?”\n278. No one responded to the email.\n279. Nor did anyone call Ms. Collier to follow up.\n280. Ultimately, Ms. Collier could not take the test because she could not 15 afford to pay for it.\n281. To pay for her drug tests going forward, Ms. Collier began to sell her own 17 blood plasma whenever she was called to test.\n282. Whenever Ms. Collier would learn that she had a drug test, she would 19 schedule a blood plasma sale so that she could pay for the test.\n283\nMs. Collier made $20 to $35 each time she sold her blood plasma.\n284. However, according to the blood plasma center’s rules, a person is only 22 allowed to sell blood plasma twice each week.\n285. Therefore, weeks when Ms. Collier was called to drug test more than 24 twice were especially difficult for her to manage.\n286. After she sold her blood plasma, Ms. Collier often felt fatigued and dizzy, 26 like she couldn’t breathe or might black out.\n287. But she continued to sell her blood plasma because it was the only way 2 she could pay for the drug tests.\n288\nMs. Collier told her case manager at TASC that she sold her blood plasma 4 to pay for drug tests.\n289. The case manager never told her that she could take the tests without 6 paying for them at the time of the test.\n290. The case manager also never told her that she could apply for a reduced 8 fee.\n291. At times, even after selling her blood plasma, Ms. Collier could not afford 10 to take drug and alcohol tests at TASC.\n292. When this happened, Ms. Collier could not take required drug and alcohol 12 tests because she was not allowed to test if she could not pay for it.\n293. Instead, Ms. Collier would try to contact her case manager to tell her that 14 she could not afford to pay to test.\n294. Frequently, Ms. Collier’s case manager would not answer her phone or 16 respond to emails, and Ms. Collier would try to reach her by calling TASC’s corporate 17 office.\n295. In September 2017, Ms. Collier became homeless.\n296. She remained homeless for approximately one month.\n297. While she was homeless, Ms. Collier slept in public parks.\n298. On September 20, 2017, Ms. Collier emailed her case manager.\n299. She explained, “I have been homeless for the passed [sic] week so money 23 has been really tight. … It has been really tough.” \n300\nMs. Collier also told her case manager in the email that she planned to 25 start Job Corps and that she would be able to pay for drug and alcohol tests once she 26 started.\n301\nMs. Collier’s case manager responded five days later.\n302. In her email, the case manager replied:\n“Sorry to hear that you are going through this. I am hoping things get better for you. I also noticed that since you are on your FINAL NOTICE, any missed test past this point will result in program termination. So I am happy to hear that you are going to do whatever is possible to test next time you are required to test. Good Luck and hope everything works out for you.”\n303. Again, the case manager did not suggest that Ms. Collier could take the 8 tests without paying for them.\n304. Nor did she invite her to apply for a reduced fee.\n305. Shortly after this exchange, Ms. Collier was issued another violation 11 because she did not take drug and alcohol tests solely because she could not afford to 12 pay for them.\n306. On October 10, 2017, TASC reported to MCAO that Ms. Collier had 14 failed the diversion program.\n307. In its reasons for failing Ms. Collier, TASC listed that Ms. Collier had not 16 submitted to mandatory drug and alcohol tests.\n308. As described above, Ms. Collier did not take these tests solely because 18 she could not afford to pay for them.\n309. TASC also stated that Ms. Collier was being failed because she had not 20 paid the required TASC fee and had not paid the required drug fund assessment fee.28 22 28 In addition, TASC stated that Ms. Collier had not attended the program’s 23 mandatory seminar. However, participants are required to take this seminar before they can successfully complete the program; they are not required to take it at a 24 specific time Ms. Collier would not have been failed from the diversion program 25 solely because she had not yet completed the seminar. The only other reason TASC provided for failing Ms. Collier was that she did not respond to a non-compliance 26 letter she received on August 7,\n2017. But Ms. Collier was in contact with her case manager after receiving this letter and explained that she could not afford to pay for drug and alcohol tests. In addition, TASC does not have a policy, practice, or custom 28 of failing diversion participants who do not respond to a letter.\n310. On December 8, 2017, MCAO filed felony charges against Ms. Collier 2 for possession of marijuana.\n311\nMs. Collier’s preliminary hearing was on January 22, 2018.\n312. On that same date, Ms. Collier agreed to re-enroll in the TASC possession 5 of marijuana diversion program.\n313\nMs. Collier’s prosecution was suspended for two years to allow her to 7 complete TASC.\n314\nMs. Collier knew that she would struggle to pay for diversion.\n315. But she decided to re-enroll because—based on the false threats in the 10 letter that she received from MCAO—she believed that she would go to jail if she did 11 not complete diversion.\n316. To re-enter the program, Ms. Collier was again required to pay the $150 13 admissions fee.\n317\nMs. Collier paid $148 toward that amount on March 13, 2018.\n318\nMs. Collier paid the remaining $2 on May 24, 2018.\n319. Since that time, Ms. Collier has made payments of between $8 and $20.\n320\nMs. Collier still must pay $667 to TASC before she can complete the 18 program.\n321\nMs. Collier is still required to submit to drug and alcohol testing—at $15 20 or $17 per test—one to three times each week.\n322. TASC still will not allow Ms. Collier to complete drug and alcohol tests 22 unless she pays for them.\n323\nMs. Collier therefore continues to sell her blood plasma whenever she 24 knows she is going to be drug tested so that she can pay for the tests.\n324. On August 17, 2018, Ms. Collier sent an e-mail to her case manager.\n325\nMs. Collier wrote:\n“Tasc has really been putting a big strain on my pockets. … I am very concerned that I will end up homeless again trying to sacrifice rent for tasc as this is putting Me [sic] in a bad space. I have been donating plasma whenever I have to test to get the money I need to pay for it, but I am afraid it is affecting my health. I am willing to test whenever I'm required but I cannot afford the fees. Is there anyway [sic] that I can test without having to pay for it?” \n326\nMs. Collier’s case worker replied, “You have to pay for the program in 7 order to complete the program. I understand that this is cost effective [sic] but in order 8 for you to have you [sic] felony dismissed with prejudice you will have to complete all 9 program requirement [sic] which includes paying all fees associated with the 10 program.”29 \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n327. The named Plaintiffs bring this case as a class action pursuant to Rules 13 23(a) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n328. The Class is defined as: All people who, since August 23, 2016, and until 15 the trial of this case, (1) were enrolled in the marijuana diversion program operated by 16 Defendants TASC and MCAO; (2) satisfied all program requirements in the first 90 17 days of the program other than payment of program fees; and (3) were not considered 18 for successful completion after 90 days solely because they were unable to pay the 19 required fees.\n329. The class members are readily ascertainable: the names and relevant 21 records of the class members are in Defendants’ possession.\nNumerosity: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(1)\n330. On information and belief, the Class includes at least several hundred 24 members.\n27 29 In her response, the case worker also suggested that Ms. Collier could apply for insurance to alleviate the costs of one of the mandatory treatment classes. This would 28 do nothing to relieve the costs of program fees or the fees for drug and alcohol tests. 32\n331. During the 2017 fiscal year (July 1, 2016 through July 30, 2017), there 2 were 2687 admittances to the possession of marijuana diversion program.\n332. The marijuana diversion program has maintained similar numbers of 4 admittances in its last several years of operation.\n333. Therefore, there were likely at least 2500 admittances in the 2018 fiscal 6 year.\n334. Thus, if even a small percentage of the people admitted to TASC since 8 August 23, 2016 meet the requirements for the Class, the Class would number in the 9 hundreds.\n335. Moreover, on information and belief, a large majority of those arrested 11 and prosecuted for marijuana possession in Maricopa County are deemed indigent for 12 the purposes of appointment of counsel.\nCommonality: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(2)\n336. The Class members’ claims raise common issues of fact and law.\n337. Those common questions include, but are not limited to:\na. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of refusing to consider diversion participants for program completion after 90 days and beyond solely because they cannot afford to pay the required fees, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nb. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who have not paid the required fees to remain on diversion supervision until they have done so, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nc. Whether Defendants’ diversion extension policies (in subparagraphs (a) and (b)) violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;\nd. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who remain on diversion solely due to inability to pay to continue to submit to and pay for random drug and alcohol tests; and e. Whether Defendants’ policy of continuing this mandatory drug and alcohol testing for participants who remain on the diversion program solely due to inability to pay violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nTypicality: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(3)\n338. The Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of 11 the Class, and they have the same interests in this case as all other members of the Class 12 that they represent.\n339. The determination whether the Defendants’ scheme of policies, practices, 14 and customs is unlawful in the ways alleged will determine the claims of the named 15 Plaintiffs and every other class member.\nAdequacy: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(4)\n340. Named Plaintiffs are capable of fairly and adequately protecting the 18 interests of the Class because Named Plaintiffs do not have any interests antagonistic 19 to the Class.\n341. There are no known conflicts of interest among class members, all of 21 whom have a similar interest in vindicating the constitutional rights to which they are 22 entitled.\n342. Plaintiffs’ counsel are experienced in civil rights litigation and have 24 successfully litigated a number of civil rights class action cases.\n343. Many of those cases, like this one, involve unconstitutional penalties 26 based solely on wealth status.\nFed R. Civ P. 23(b)(3)\n344. Class treatment under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate because the common 3 questions of law and fact overwhelmingly predominate in this case.\n345. For every Named Plaintiff, as well as for the members of the Class, this 5 case turns on what the Defendants’ policies and practices are and on whether those 6 policies are lawful.\n346. The common questions of law and fact listed above are dispositive 8 questions in the case of every member of the Class.\n347. Moreover, the question of liability can therefore be determined on a class- 10 wide basis.\n348. To the extent that individual damages will vary, they will vary depending 12 in large part on the amount of time that a person was subjected to the unlawful scheme 13 and the amount of money coerced from them.\n349. Determining damages for individual class members can thus typically be 15 handled in a ministerial fashion based on easily verifiable records in the Defendants’ 16 possession.\n350. If need be, individual hearings on class members’ specific damages based 18 on special circumstances and particular hardships caused by Defendants’ scheme can 19 be held after class-wide liability is determined.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nCount One: Wealth-Based Discrimination in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Pascale on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against all Defendants for damages; and by Plaintiff Taja Collier on her own behalf against Defendant TASC for injunctive relief.\n27 and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of subjecting diversion 1 participants to longer terms of diversion supervision, which include in-person reporting, 2 drug and alcohol testing requirements, and increased payments, solely because of their 3 inability to pay fees associated with the program.\n352. This policy, practice, and custom of penalizing individuals based solely 5 on wealth status violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 6 Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n8 and custom, Plaintiffs have suffered violations of their constitutional rights and thus are 9 entitled to compensatory damages for their injuries.\n11 involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.\n12 Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover punitive damages—in addition to \n356\nMs. Collier seeks to enjoin Defendant TASC from forcing her to remain 17 on diversion solely because she cannot afford to pay the fees necessary to successfully 18 complete the diversion program.\n19 Count Two: Unreasonable Searches and Seizures in Violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments Pascale on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against all Defendants for damages; and by Plaintiff Taja Collier on her own behalf against Defendant TASC for injunctive relief.\n25 and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of requiring urinalysis to test for 26 drug and alcohol consumption for individuals who remain on the marijuana diversion 27 program solely because they were unable to pay the required fees.\n358. This policy, practice, and custom violates the right to be free from 2 unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S.\n3 Constitution.\n5 and custom, Plaintiffs have suffered violations of their bodily liberty and integrity and 6 are entitled to compensatory damages for their injuries.\n360. Defendant TASC’s actions were knowing, willful, deliberate, and 8 malicious, and involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutional 9 rights. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover punitive damages—in addition to\n362. Plaintiff Collier therefore requests that this Court enjoin Defendant TASC 14 from requiring her to take drug and alcohol tests solely because she cannot afford to 15 pay the fees necessary to successfully complete the diversion program.\nCount Three: Wealth-Based Discrimination in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 18 Brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by Plaintiff Taja Collier on her own behalf against all Defendants for damages and against Defendant TASC for injunctive relief.\n21 and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of not allowing participants in 22 Defendants’ diversion program to complete drug and alcohol tests unless those 23 participants can pay for them at the time of the test.\n364. Defendants, acting in concert under color of state law, also enacted, 25 enforced, and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of failing participants 26 from the program because those participants were not permitted to take drug and 27 alcohol tests solely because they were unable to afford them.\n365. These policies, practices, and customs penalized Plaintiff Collier based 2 solely on her wealth status in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n366. As a direct and proximate cause of Defendants’ unlawful policies, 5 practices, and customs, Plaintiff Collier suffered violations of her constitutional rights 6 and thus is entitled to compensatory damages for her injuries.\n8 involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiff Collier’s constitutional rights.\n9 Accordingly, she is entitled to recover punitive damages—in addition to compensatory 10 damages—against Defendant TASC.\n12 cannot afford to pay the program’s fees or the fees required to take drug and alcohol 13 tests.\n369. Plaintiff Collier therefore seeks to enjoin Defendant TASC from refusing 15 to allow her to take drug and alcohol tests solely because she is unable to pay for them.\n370. Plaintiff Collier also seeks to enjoin Defendant TASC from terminating 17 her from the diversion program because she did not take drug and alcohol tests solely 18 because she could not afford them.\nREQUEST FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs demand a jury trial for all issues so appropriate 21 and request this Court to issue the following relief:\nA.

Plaintiffs, \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT AND JURY TRIAL DEMAND\n17 William Montgomery, in his official capacity as County Attorney of Maricopa County; Maricopa County; Treatment Assessment Screening Center, Inc., Defendants.\nOVERVIEW\n1. The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office (MCAO) and the Treatment 23 Assessment Screening Center (TASC) jointly operate a possession of marijuana 24 diversion program1 that penalizes the poor because of their poverty.\n27 1 This diversion program is referred to in the Complaint as “the possession of marijuana diversion program,” “the marijuana diversion program,” and “the 28 program.”\n2. In a “diversion” program, participants undergo a period of supervision 2 and must meet certain requirements to avoid criminal prosecution and conviction.\n3. The programs are generally “a functional equivalent of a sentence to 4 pretrial probation... and [are] staffed with paraprofessionals overseeing individuals in 5 what [is] in effect a probationary-type of supervision and control.”2\n4. In principle, the programs are “intended to relieve overburdened courts 7 and crowded jails, and to spare low-risk offenders from the devastating consequences 8 of a criminal record.”3\n5. But in Maricopa County, they serve another purpose: to make money for 10 those who operate the program, including the MCAO.4\n6. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO collected nearly $15 million in revenue 12 by diverting threatened prosecutions to TASC.5\n7. The length of time a person spends in the diversion program and whether 14 the person ultimately completes the program and avoids felony criminal prosecution 15 depends on whether she can pay the program’s required fees.\n17 2 S\nRep\nNo. 93–1021, at 36–37 (1974) (describing the operation of two pretrial diversion programs).\n18 3 Shaila Dewan Andrew W.

In order to complete the program and avoid felony criminal prosecution, 2 participants in the marijuana diversion program must pay a fee of $950 or $1000.\n9. Participants must also pay $15 or $17 for each drug and alcohol test; they 4 may be required to take as many as three or four tests each week.\n10. The program is two-tiered: people who meet program requirements— 6 completing a three-hour drug education seminar and routine drug and alcohol testing— 7 and are wealthy enough to pay the $950 or $1000 program fee complete the program in 8 90 days and are no longer subject to felony criminal prosecution.\n11. But participants who cannot pay the program fees are forced to stay in the 10 program for at least six months and until they can pay off the money owed to MCAO 11 and TASC, even if they have satisfied every program requirement other than payment.\n12. During the “pay-only”6 period, participants remain subject to felony 13 criminal prosecution during the additional time they are forced to remain in the 14 diversion program.\n13. These participants also remain subject to all of the diversion program’s 16 requirements.\n14. These requirements include reporting to a TASC location, as often as four 18 times per week, so that the participant’s urine can be collected and tested.\n15. Participants who remain on diversion solely because of their inability to 20 pay program fees must also continue to pay $15 or $17 each time they are required to 21 submit to a drug and alcohol test.\n24 6 “Pay-only” refers to a period of criminal supervision during which the person is 25 supervised only because she has not paid all of her debt. This “extremely muscular form of debt collection,” which “masquerades as supervision,” is becoming 26 increasingly common.

The perverse result is that poor people are ultimately charged more 2 money—potentially hundreds of dollars more—than similarly situated participants who 3 can afford to pay to finish the program in 90 days.\n17. Participants who cannot afford to pay for diversion may also be 5 terminated from the program altogether and referred for felony prosecution.\n18. This can happen in at least two ways.\n19. First, Defendants require diversion participants to make a minimum 8 monthly payment towards the $950 or $1000 program fees at a rate set by Defendant \n9 TASC.\n20. A participant who fails to pay the minimum monthly payment set by 11 Defendant TASC can be terminated from the program and prosecuted.\n21. Defendants do not inquire into a participant’s ability to pay before setting 13 the minimum monthly fee.\n22. Defendants’ policy does not include any exception for participants who 15 do not pay the minimum monthly amount solely because they cannot afford it.\n23. Second, participants are not allowed to take the drug and alcohol tests the 17 program requires if they cannot afford to pay for them.\n24. For example, if a participant cannot pay the $15 or $17 fee for a drug and 19 alcohol test, she is not allowed to take the test at all.\n25. Therefore, if a participant reports for a drug and alcohol test without the 21 required fee, she will be turned away, and she will receive a violation for missing the 22 test.\n26. In other words, an unpaid drug and alcohol test is a failed test.\n27. If a participant misses too many drug and alcohol tests—even if she 25 missed them solely because she could not afford to pay for them—she will be failed out 26 of the diversion program and prosecuted for felony possession of marijuana.\n28. Defendants enforce these policies even when they know that diversion 2 participants are poor or even homeless, and even when they know that participants are 3 sacrificing basic necessities to pay fees.\n29. And indeed, Defendants have a financial incentive to enforce the policies 5 this way—and to use the specter of termination and felony prosecution to coerce as 6 much money from participants as they can.\n30. Diversion participants who alert TASC employees that they cannot afford 8 the required fees are told that they will be failed from the program if they do not pay 9 and to do whatever it takes to get the money.\n31. For example, Plaintiff Marc Pascale is a 60-year-old man with 11 degenerative disc disease, which has left him physically unable to work.\n32. TASC refused to waive his program and drug and alcohol testing fees 13 even after he repeatedly told them that he could not afford to pay the fees.\n33\nMr. Pascale’s case manager repeatedly told him to borrow money to pay 15 the fees or else he would fail the program, lose the money he had already paid in 16 program and drug and alcohol testing fees, and be prosecuted for felony criminal 17 possession of marijuana.\n34. Plaintiff Taja Collier emailed her case manager at TASC to tell her that 19 she was homeless and could not afford to pay for drug and alcohol testing.\n35\nMs. Collier’s case manager responded that if she did not test, she would 21 be issued a notice of violation and her case would be sent back to court, where she 22 would be prosecuted for felony criminal possession of marijuana.\n36. As a result, Ms. Collier sold her blood plasma to pay for drug and alcohol 24 tests.\n37. Plaintiffs bring this civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to 26 redress violations of Named Plaintiffs’, class members’, and Plaintiff Collier’s rights 27 under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\n38. Named Plaintiffs DeShawn Briggs and Mark Pascale, as well as the class 2 members whose interests they represent, seek monetary damages against Defendants 3 for violation of these rights.\n39. Named Plaintiff McKenna Stephens, as well as the class members whose 5 interests she represents, seeks injunctive relief against the Defendants to enjoin 6 Defendants from continuing their unlawful and unconstitutional policies, practices, and 7 customs.\n40. Plaintiff Taja Collier seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief on her 9 own behalf.\nPARTIES\nPlaintiffs\n41. Plaintiff DeShawn Briggs is a 28-year-old African American man. He is 13 a resident of Maricopa County, Arizona Mr. Briggs spent six months in Defendants’ 14 marijuana diversion program solely because he was unable to pay the program fees 15 within 90 days. He represents himself and a class of similarly situated people subject to\n42. Plaintiff Marc Pascale is a 60-year-old white man. He is a resident of 18 Maricopa County, Arizona Mr. Pascale spent more than seven months in Defendants’ 19 marijuana diversion program solely because he was unable to pay the program fees in 20 90 days. He represents himself and a class of similarly situated people subject to\n43. Plaintiff McKenna Stephens is a 24-year-old white woman. She is a 23 resident of Maricopa County, Arizona Ms. Stephens is currently a participant in 24 Defendants’ marijuana diversion program Ms. Stephens has complied with all of the 25 program requirements to date and will complete all non-monetary program 26 requirements during the first 90 days of the program. However, she is unable to pay the 27 program fees in full during the first 90 days of the program. Therefore, as a result of 1 Defendants’ policies and practices, Ms. Stephens will be forced to stay in the program 2 for at least six months and until she can pay all of the required fees. As long as Ms.\n3 Stephens is required to remain in the program, she will remain subject to felony criminal 4 prosecution and be forced to submit to routine, suspicionless drug and alcohol tests.\n5 Ms. Stephens also cannot afford the minimum monthly payments Defendants require, 6 and Defendants may terminate her from the program as a result. She represents herself 7 and a class of similarly situated people subject to Defendants’ unlawful policies, 8 practices, and customs.\n44. Plaintiff Taja Collier is a 21-year-old African American woman. She is 10 a resident of Maricopa County, Arizona Ms. Collier first enrolled in Defendants’ 11 marijuana diversion program in July \n2017\nMs. Collier was willing to meet all diversion 12 requirements, but she could not afford to pay for drug and alcohol testing, particularly 13 during a month when she was homeless and sleeping in parks. After Ms. Collier could 14 not afford to pay for several drug and alcohol tests, she was terminated from the 15 diversion program and prosecuted for felony possession of marijuana. After prosecution 16 was initiated, Ms. Collier was again diverted into Defendants’ diversion program. Ms.\n17 Collier cannot afford the minimum monthly payments Defendants require, and 18 Defendants may terminate her from the program as a result Ms. Collier also cannot 19 afford to pay for the required drug and alcohol tests, and she may be terminated for that 20 reason as well Ms. Collier brings this suit on her own behalf.\nDefendants\n45. Defendant Bill Montgomery is the elected County Attorney for 23 Maricopa County, Arizona. Defendant Montgomery is the chief official responsible for 24 the enforcement and prosecution of felonies within Maricopa County. Defendant 25 Montgomery is also responsible for operating and administering the deferred 26 prosecution programs in Maricopa County. Defendant Montgomery is the final 27 policymaker for Maricopa County on matters relating to diversion programs, including 1 the marijuana diversion program at issue in this lawsuit. He is sued in his official 2 capacity.\n46. Defendant Maricopa County, Arizona7 is a political subdivision formed 4 and designated as such pursuant to Title 11 of the Arizona Revised Statutes. Defendant 5 Maricopa County can sue and be sued in its own name. Maricopa County is liable for 6 the practices and policies of Defendants Montgomery and TASC. The County has and 7 continues to acquiesce in the administration of the TASC drug diversion program, 8 including the marijuana diversion program at issue in this lawsuit.\n47. Defendant Treatment Assessment Screening Center is a private, non- 10 profit, 501(c)(3) corporation headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. Defendant TASC has 11 contracted and continues to contract with MCAO to operate, administer, and supervise 12 the marijuana diversion program at issue in this lawsuit. Defendant TASC supervises 13 all people whose prosecutions for simple possession of marijuana have been diverted.\n14 Defendant TASC acts under the color of law in its administration and supervision of 15 the County’s marijuana diversion program.\nJURISDICTION\n48. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Constitution of the 18 United States. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n49. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). All Defendants’ official 21 places of business are located within this District. The events giving rise to the claims 22 occurred in this District.\n27 7 Defendant Montgomery, in his official capacity, acts on behalf of and is the final policymaker for Maricopa County with respect to the conduct described in this 28 lawsuit. If this is correct, naming Maricopa County as a defendant is redundant. 8 \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n2 I. Defendants’ Unlawful Policies Marijuana Possession Prosecutions in Maricopa County\n50. In Arizona, possession of any amount of marijuana—even trace 5 amounts—can be prosecuted as a felony.8\n51. Felony prosecution has severe consequences.\n52. According to the National Inventory of the Collateral Consequences of 8 Conviction—an American Bar Association database—people convicted of felony 9 offenses in Arizona are subject to over 350 “collateral consequences” as a direct result 10 of a felony criminal conviction.9\n53. For example, a person convicted of a felony in Arizona cannot vote, serve 12 on a jury, obtain a commercial driver’s license, possess a gun, or join the U.S. armed 13 forces.10\n54. A felony conviction may also bar a person from receiving professional 15 licenses and affect a person’s child custody rights, parental status, and housing.11\n55. A person with a felony drug conviction in Arizona may lose public 17 benefits, such as food stamps and social security benefits.12 19 8 See Ariz Rev. Stat Ann. § 13-3405(B)(1) (providing that possession of “an 20 amount of marijuana not possessed for sale having a weight of less than two pounds is guilty of a class 6 felony”). Arizona is the only state in the nation where any amount 21 of marijuana, no matter how small, can draw a felony charge. See Jacob Sullum, 22 Explaining His Cannabis Conversion, John Boehner Cites a Marijuana Myth, Reason (Apr. 12, 2018), http://reason.com/blog/2018/04/12/explaining-his-cannabis- 23 conversion-john/print. Possession of marijuana paraphernalia is also a class 6 felony under Arizona law. See Ariz Rev. Stat Ann. § 13-3415(A). 24 9 See National Inventory of the Collateral Consequences of Conviction, 25 https://niccc.csgjusticecenter.org/search/?jurisdiction=8 (last visited Oct. 12, 2018). 10 See Consequences of a Felony, Maricopa County, AZ, 26 https://www.maricopa.gov/930/Consequences-for-a-Felony (last visited Oct. 11, 2018). 11 Id.\n28 12 Id.\n56. Defendant County Attorney Bill Montgomery has aggressively opposed 2 legalization measures as well as efforts to reduce simple possession of marijuana to a 3 misdemeanor.\n57. In 2016, Defendant Montgomery successfully advocated against the 5 passage of Proposition 205, a ballot initiative that would have made recreational 6 marijuana use legal in Arizona.\n58. Defendant Montgomery made numerous public statements and 8 participated in public debates attacking the initiative and advocating for its failure.\n59. During a public debate on marijuana legalization, Defendant 10 Montgomery told a Vietnam veteran, who admitted to using medical marijuana for back 11 pain and occasional recreation use, “I have no respect for you. … [Y]ou’re an enemy.”\n60. Defendant Montgomery has also worked to narrow Arizona’s medical 13 marijuana laws.\n61. For example, when Defendant Montgomery learned that doctors were 15 able to stop a five-year-old’s seizures by using a marijuana extract, he threatened the 16 child’s parents with felony prosecution, arguing that extracts were not covered by the 17 state’s medical marijuana allowance.13\n62. Drug possession charges represent an overwhelming proportion of the 19 charges filed by MCAO.\n63. Possession of marijuana is the MCAO’s most commonly prosecuted 21 offense; it amounts to approximately 15 percent of total prosecutions.14 24 13 Evan Wyloge, Court Rules Medical Marijuana Patients Can Use Extracts, Ariz.\n25 Capitol Times (Mar. 22, 2014), https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2014/03/22/azmedical-marijuana-patients-can-use-cannabis-extract-court-rules-bill-montgomery.\n26 14 See Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, 2016 Annual Report, at 43, available at https://www.maricopacountyattorney.org/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/88. The year 2016 is the most recent for which MCAO has published 28 this charging data.\n64. And more broadly, more than 45 percent of MCAO’s prosecutions are for 2 drug possession.15\n65. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO made nearly $15 million from diverting 4 threatened prosecutions to TASC.16 The Possession of Marijuana Diversion Program\n66. For most people who are arrested in Maricopa County for simple 7 possession of marijuana or marijuana paraphernalia, the only way to avoid a felony 8 criminal prosecution is to complete the diversion program offered by MCAO.\n67. To operate, administer, and supervise participants in the program, MCAO 10 has contracted with TASC, a private, non-profit company.\n68. TASC also partners with MCAO to administer a diversion program for 12 possession of narcotics.\n69. More than 15,000 people participated in MCAO and TASC’s marijuana 14 diversion program between 2011 and 2017.17\n70. Over that same time period, the marijuana diversion program accounted 16 for approximately three quarters of TASC’s total intakes for drug diversion.18\n71. People arrested for simple possession of marijuana or marijuana 18 paraphernalia can enter the diversion program either before or after criminal charges 19 are filed.\n22 15 Id. (calculated by adding the percentage of the total offenses charged represented by each type of drug charge listed).\n23 16 Cassidy, supra note\n4. 17 See id. (providing the number of participants who enrolled in the program 24 between 2011 and 2015); Letter from Bill Montgomery, County Attorney, Maricopa 25 County, to Elizabeth Ortiz, Executive Director, Arizona Prosecuting Attorneys’ Advisory Council (Aug. 8, 2017) (providing the number of participants who enrolled 26 in the program from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017). 27 18 See Cassidy, supra note 4; Letter from Bill Montgomery, County Attorney, Maricopa County, to Elizabeth Ortiz, Executive Director, Arizona Prosecuting 28 Attorneys’ Advisory Council (Aug. 8, 2017). 11\n72. People who enter into the marijuana diversion program post-filing have 2 charges filed against them prior to enrolling in the program.\n73. The charges are suspended while the person completes the program.\n74. If the person successfully completes the program, MCAO dismisses the 5 case.\n75. If the person fails to complete the program, MCAO reinstates 7 prosecution.\n76. People can also enter the program before any criminal charges are filed 9 in court.\n77. People who enter the marijuana diversion program pre-filing are sent a 11 letter from MCAO.\n78. The letter informs the person that she is facing class 6 felony charges and 13 offers two options: criminal prosecution or the TASC marijuana diversion program.\n79. The letter warns, “If convicted of a class 6 felony, you could receive a 15 maximum sentence of 2 years in prison and a maximum fine of $150,000 plus 80% 16 surcharge.”\n80. The letter also warns that a class 1 misdemeanor conviction could result 18 in “a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a maximum fine of $2,500.00 plus 19 80% surcharge.”\n81. The threats in this letter are false.\n82. The pre-filing diversion program generally only includes people with no 22 prior convictions.\n83. Under Arizona law, jail or prison time is prohibited for a first or second 24 offense of simple possession of marijuana.\n84. Instead, for people in this category, the law requires drug treatment and a 26 maximum penalty of probation. See Ariz Rev\nStat. § 13-901.01(A), (D), (H)(1).\n85. Accordingly, the people who receive the pre-filing letter threatening jail 2 time are ineligible to be jailed as a matter of state law.\n86. The letter’s representation that its recipients could be fined $150,000 plus 4 an 80% surcharge are false as well.19\n87. After delivering these false threats, the letter explains the basic 6 requirements of the marijuana diversion program and provides a deadline and contact 7 information to sign up for the program.\n88. If a person in the pre-filing category completes the diversion program, 9 MCAO will not file charges against her.\n89. Failing the program results in criminal prosecution.20\n90. Participants who do not complete the diversion program and whose cases 12 are prosecuted have little hope of avoiding felony criminal prosecution and conviction 13 because people who enroll in the marijuana diversion program—whether pre- or post- 14 filing—are first required to sign a statement of facts admitting their guilt.\n91. A TASC employee tells participants exactly what to write in the statement 16 of facts.\n92. The following information must be written into the statement:\na. Date and location of the offense;\nb. The full name of the substance possessed;\nc. That the participant possessed a usable amount of the substance; and 22 19 A person convicted of possession of marijuana can be fined $750 or three times 23 the value of the marijuana involved. See Ariz Rev\nStat. § 13-3405(D). $150,000 is the maximum fine allowable for any felony. See Ariz Rev\nStat. § 13-801(a). No 24 person accused of a crime involving $150,000 worth of marijuana would be eligible 25 for TASC. 20 When a person in the pre-filing group fails diversion, the prosecutor will file 26 charges in the case. When a person in the post-filing group fails diversion, the prosecutor will move to reinstate the prosecution. As a matter of policy, practice, and custom, for both pre- and post-filing participants, TASC sends the participant a final 28 warning letter before the participant is failed from the program.\nd. The facts of the offense, which must read, “the [name of the drug] was found in [where the drug was found] in my possession.”\n93. This signed statement of facts can be used against a person if she fails to 4 complete the marijuana diversion program and is criminally prosecuted. See State v. 5 Gill, 391 P.3d 1193, 1197 (Ariz. 2017) (holding that a written admission contained in 6 a statement of facts obtained by a TASC representative was admissible at trial).\nThe Cost of Avoiding Prosecution\n94. Once enrolled in the marijuana diversion program, the requirements for 9 the pre- and post-filing participants are the same.\n95. For both groups of participants, avoiding prosecution costs money.\n96. To complete the program, all participants must:\na. Pay program fees—$950 or $1000—in full;\nb. Pay for and pass routine drug and alcohol tests for 90 days; and c. Complete a three-hour drug education seminar.\n97. The mandatory $950 or $1000 program fee includes the following:\na. $150 admission fee;\nb. $650 “drug fund” fee;\nc. $150 TASC fee; and d. $50 booking fee, which applies only to participants who were arrested and booked.\n98. All of these fees must be paid in person by debit card or with a money 22 order.\n99. Participants are not allowed to pay by any other means, including with 24 credit or cash.\n100. Defendants require that participants pay the $150 admission fee at the 26 program orientation.\n101. If a participant is unable to pay the $150 admission fee at orientation 2 because she cannot afford it, Defendants allow her to pay $75 at orientation and the 3 other $75 during the program.\n102. If a participant cannot afford to pay $75 at orientation, she may be told to 5 return with the money the same day or be failed from the program and face felony 6 prosecution.\n103. In addition to the $950 or $1000 in fees, participants must pay to take 8 drug and alcohol tests at TASC.\n104. Each drug and alcohol test costs $15 or $17, depending on the method of 10 payment.\n105. Participants must call TASC or consult a phone application every day, 12 seven days a week to determine whether they are required to report to a TASC location 13 that day so that TASC can collect and test their urine.\n106. If a participant does not call daily, she may miss a scheduled test and be 15 sanctioned, which could ultimately result in termination from the diversion program, 16 followed by felony prosecution.\n107. Participants are required to drug test at least once—and often multiple 18 times—each week.\n108. At the TASC location, TASC employees watch participants through glass 20 panels while they submit urine for drug and alcohol testing.\n109. In at least one TASC location, the bathroom where participants submit 22 urine for testing includes multiple mirrors so that a TASC employee can watch the 23 participant urinate from multiple angles.\n110. Records obtained as part of the preliminary investigation for this lawsuit 25 revealed that participants may be required to test as many as nine times per month.\n111. Thus, on top of the $1000 in program fees, diversion participants pay at 27 least $60—but up to $153—each month for drug and alcohol tests.\n112. In addition to the three program requirements, Defendants impose a 2 number of additional terms on participants.\n113. These terms are set forth in a document called the “Client Contract.” 21\n114. The Client Contract states that diversion participants must make 5 minimum monthly payments towards those fees at a rate set by Defendant TASC.\n115. The rate set forth in the Client Contract is $160 or $170 per month.\n116. Defendant TASC does not inquire into a participant’s ability to pay before 8 setting the minimum monthly fee.\n117. If a participant does not make the minimum monthly payment set by 10 Defendant TASC, she can be terminated from the program and then prosecuted.\n118. The Client Contract also prohibits, among other things:\na. Alcohol use, including over-the-counter medications that include alcohol, like NyQuil;22 b. Leaving the state for any amount of time without “special permission from TASC”;23 c. Leaving Maricopa County for more than one day without informing a TASC case manager;24 d. Taking any prescription medication without reporting it to a TASC case manager and bringing the prescription to TASC for verification.25 21 See MCAO/TASC Adult Deferred Prosecution Program Possession of 24 Marijuana, Client Contract (hereinafter “Client Contract”). In this Complaint, 25 Plaintiffs cite the version of the Client Contract distributed to participants on Tuesday, October 9, 2018.\n26 22 Id. 5.\n28 25 Id. 3.\n119. The Client Contract also states that “[u]nless disability status applies, 2 [participants] must be employed while participating in the program.”26\n120. “[V]iolation of any” of these provisions “can result in program 4 termination.”27 Defendants Require Participants to Remain on Diversion Until All Fees Are Paid\n121. Participants who complete the three program requirements—including 7 full payment of fees—within 90 days complete the diversion program at that point, and 8 they are not subject to felony criminal prosecution thereafter.\n122. However, as a matter of policy, practice, and custom, people who cannot 10 afford to pay the program fees in full within 90 days are not released from the 11 program—even if they have completed the other program requirements, including 12 passing all drug and alcohol tests.\n123. Instead, participants who cannot afford to pay these fees must remain 14 subject to the requirements of the diversion program for a minimum of six months.\n124. If these participants are not able to pay the program fees by the end of six 16 months, they must remain in the program until they do.\n125. Defendants do not assess a person’s ability to pay before refusing to 18 consider her for program completion after 90 days, even when the participant has 19 completed every program requirement other than payment.\n126. Nor do Defendants assess a person’s ability to pay before they require her 21 to remain on diversion beyond six months and until all fees are paid.\n127. People who are forced to stay on diversion solely because they cannot 23 afford to pay program fees remain subject felony prosecution until they complete the 24 program.\n27 26 Id.\n17. 28 27 Id. (unnumbered paragraph).\n128. In addition, these “pay only”28 participants are subject to same 2 requirements as they were during the first 90 days on diversion.\n129. Thus, “pay only” participants are barred from drinking alcohol, taking 4 certain medications (like NyQuil), and leaving the State without Defendant TASC’s 5 approval.29\n130. “Pay only” participants must continue to submit to one or more drug and 7 alcohol tests weekly—under the threat of felony criminal prosecution.\n131. These participants must also complete all of the requirements attendant 9 to the drug and alcohol tests.\n132. For example, participants must continue to call TASC every day, seven 11 days a week, to determine whether they are required to report to a TASC location during 12 a certain time period that day so that TASC can collect and test their urine.\n133. People who remain on diversion because they cannot afford to pay 14 program fees are also still forced to pay $15 or $17 for each drug and alcohol test.\n134. As a result, these participants may ultimately have to pay hundreds of 16 dollars more than people wealthy enough to pay the $950 or $1000 program fee within 17 90 days—in addition to remaining subject to felony criminal prosecution for months 18 longer.\nDefendants Terminate Participants from the Diversion Program for Failure to Pay Minimum Monthly Program Fees\n135. Pursuant to Defendants’ written policy, failure to pay program fees at the 21 monthly rate set by Defendant TASC will result in termination from the program and 22 prosecution for felony possession of marijuana.\n27 28 See supra note 6 (explaining the term “pay-only”). 28 29 See Client Contract 3, 5, 10.\n136. The Client Contract, to which all participants are subject, states that the 2 minimum monthly rate is $160 or $170.\n137. Defendants’ policy does not include any exception for participants who 4 did not make their monthly payment solely because they could not afford it.\n138. Defendants do not inquire into a participant’s ability to pay before setting 6 the minimum monthly fee.\n139. The Client Contract states: “Failure to make payments [toward the 8 program fees] each month as agreed will result in [the] case being returned for 9 prosecution.”30\n140. Another paragraph of the Client Contract states that “failure to test as 11 scheduled, continued positive/diluted/altered tests, missed seminar/counseling, and/or 12 failure to make payments as agreed may result in unsuccessful termination from the 13 program.”31\n141. Defendants have discretion as to when to enforce this policy; they may 15 terminate a participant on the first missed payment or the tenth.\n142. But in every case, Defendants have a financial incentive to use the threat 17 of termination to coerce as much money from participants as they can.\n143. Thus, a diversion participant who at any point is unable to make the 19 monthly payment set by Defendant TASC can be terminated from the program and 20 prosecuted for felony possession of marijuana.\nDefendants Do Not Allow Participants to Take Drug and Alcohol Tests Unless They Pay for Them\n144. As a matter of policy, practice, and custom, Defendants do not allow 24 diversion participants to take the program’s mandatory drug and alcohol tests unless 25 they can pay for them at the time of the test.\n27 30 Id.\n12. 28 31 Id. 17 (emphasis added).\n145. As a result, poor people are forced to extend their time on the program 2 for failing to take mandatory drug and alcohol tests—solely because they could not 3 afford to pay for them.\n146. People who cannot afford to take drug and alcohol tests may also fail the 5 program altogether.\n147. Missed drug and alcohol tests are counted as “violations”—even when a 7 person only missed the test because she could not afford to pay for it.\n148. The Client Contract states that “failure to test as scheduled... may result 9 in unsuccessful termination from the program.”32\n149. A person who accrues too many of these violations will be failed by 11 TASC and referred to the MCAO for prosecution.\n150. When this happens, a person faces felony prosecution solely because of 13 her inability to pay.\n151. No one at TASC assesses a person’s ability to pay before referring her for 15 prosecution because she did not pay for drug and alcohol tests.\n152. Nor does anyone at MCAO assess ability to pay before prosecuting 17 people who have failed diversion solely because of their inability to pay for drug and 18 alcohol tests.\nDefendants’ Refusal to Waive Fees for the Poor\n153. As a matter of policy, practice, and custom, Defendants do not reduce or 21 waive the $950 or $1000 program fee for any person, regardless of financial 22 circumstances.\n154. Defendants contend that they allow for reductions of drug and alcohol 24 testing fees to $7 instead of $15 per test for participants who cannot afford them—but 25 these reductions are almost never granted in practice.\n27 32 Client Contract 16.\n155. At the outset, Defendants do not assess participants’ ability to pay before 2 charging them in full for tests.\n156. But even when Defendants are aware that a participant is indigent and 4 unable to pay without sacrificing basic necessities, Defendants require the participant 5 to pay the full $15 or $17 to test.\n157. One TASC employee interviewed by investigators for undersigned 7 counsel stated that reduced drug and alcohol testing fees are reserved for people who 8 can demonstrate that they have basically zero income.\n158. Another TASC employee explained that fee reductions are “very 10 difficult” to get and that “it rarely happens.”\n159. As one TASC employee explained, drug and alcohol testing is “strictly 12 fee for service.”\n160. When participants tell TASC case managers that they are struggling to 14 pay, the case managers recommend they borrow money from friends or family because 15 they will be failed from the program and prosecuted if they do not pay.\n161. According to Defendants’ written policy, even in the rare cases that fee 17 reductions are granted, full fees can be reinstated as a punishment for a dirty or diluted 18 urine test.\n162. Defendants’ Client Contract warns, “If [a participant’s] fees are reduced 20 and [the participant] submit[s] a positive/diluted/altered urine test, full fees may be 21 reinstated … from that point forward until completion of the program.”33 The “User-Funded” Model\n163. Defendants MCAO and TASC advertise the diversion program as “user- 24 funded.” 27 33 See MCAO/TASC Adult Deferred Prosecution Program Possession of 28 Marijuana, Client Contract 13.\n164. According to MCAO, “user-funded” means that “the [person entering the 2 program] typically bears the costs of the initial assessment and the assigned treatment.”\n165. A brochure published by MCAO describing its felony pretrial diversion 4 programs notes that “defendants … bear the costs of the program.”34\n166. Defendant TASC’s website explains that the diversion program “is fully 6 funded by the clients we serve.”35\n167. Defendant TASC is responsible for collecting fees from the people 8 enrolled in the diversion program.\n168. Defendant TASC keeps a portion of the money it collects.\n169. The $650 “drug fund fee” that Defendant TASC collects from each 11 participant is deposited to MCAO.\n170. MCAO does not publicly disclose how it spends the money it receives 13 from the program.\n171. In addition to collecting fees, the Contract between Defendants MCAO 15 and TASC makes Defendant TASC responsible for most of the day-to-day operations 16 of the possession of marijuana diversion program.\n172. This includes administering drug and alcohol tests, tracking participants’ 18 attendance and participation, and determining whether a participant has completed the 19 program requirements.\n173. MCAO’s duties under the Contract are to assess the appropriateness of 21 referrals to the program and to send qualified participants to Defendant TASC.\n174. The Contract does not require the MCAO to pay Defendant TASC any 23 money.\n26 34 Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, Felony Pretrial Intervention Program (2018). 35 Diversion, TASC, http://www.tascsolutions.org/tasc-services/diversion (last 28 visited Aug. 22, 2018).\n175. Instead, the Contract provides that the program’s participants alone will 2 pay Defendant TASC, and “no public monies will be expended pursuant to [the 3 Contract].”36\n176. The Contract does provide that, “[a]t his option, the County Attorney may 5 utilize monies accumulated in the Drug Diversion Fund to satisfy the costs associated 6 with this agreement if the participant is indigent and unable to pay the costs associated 7 with the … diversion program.”37\n177. But there is no requirement that MCAO make such payments. 38\n178. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO made nearly $15 million in fees from 10 participants in the marijuana diversion program.39\n179. Defendant TASC has also benefited financially from operating the\n180. Defendant TASC’s net assets were approximately $18 million in 2016.40\n181. In 2014, TASC paid its CEO $281,165 and its former CEO $963,358.41 17 II. Plaintiffs Damages Class Representatives DeShawn Briggs and Mark Pascale\n184. Class representatives DeShawn Briggs and Mark Pascale were both 20 required to remain in the pretrial diversion program for more than double the time 22 36 MCAO TASC, Behavior Specific Adult Diversion Program Contract, at 1 23 (Mar. 22, 2016, effective through Sept. 30, 2018).\n37 Id. 24 38 The Contract states, “[U]nder no circumstances is the County liable for any fees 25 or costs related to [the] Contract.” Id. 39 Cassidy, supra note 4.\nSee IRS Form 990, filed by TASC for 2014, at\n7. See IRS Form 990, filed by TASC for 2015, at 7.\n1 required of similarly situated (but wealthier) participants solely because they were 2 unable to pay program fees.\n185. Plaintiff DeShawn Briggs is a 28-year-old African American man.\n186. In December 2015, Mr. Briggs was arrested for simple possession of 5 marijuana.\n187. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Briggs worked part-time at Walmart, where 7 he made $10 per hour.\n188\nMr. Briggs had no prior criminal record.\n189. He was not addicted to marijuana.\n190. On or around January 13, 2016, Mr. Briggs received a letter from MCAO.\n191. The letter stated that he had two options with respect to his marijuana 12 arrest: he could face prosecution and conviction with a punishment of two years in jail 13 and a fine of up to $150,000 plus an 80% surcharge—or he could participate in the 14 TASC pretrial diversion program.\n192. The claims in the letter Mr. Briggs received were false.\n193. Because this was Mr. Briggs’ first offense, under Arizona law, he could 17 not receive jail or prison time if convicted of simple possession of marijuana.\n194\nMr. Briggs also did not face a $150,000 fine.\n195\nMr. Briggs did not know that he could not receive jail time for conviction 20 of marijuana possession since it was his first offense.\n196. He also did not know that he could not be fined $150,000.\n197\nMr. Briggs chose to participate in the pretrial diversion program because 23 he did not want to go to jail and thought the diversion program was the only way to 24 avoid two years of incarceration and a six-figure fine.\n198\nMr. Briggs followed the instructions given in the letter and contacted 26 TASC to enroll in the program.\n199. A TASC employee told Mr. Briggs to appear for orientation and bring a 2 $150 intake fee.\n200. At the orientation, a TASC employee informed Mr. Briggs of the program 4 requirements and fees.\n201. The TASC employee told Mr. Briggs that he would have to submit to and 6 pass random drug and alcohol tests for 90 days, complete a three-hour drug education 7 class, and pay his program fees of $1000 in full within that 90-day period.\n202. The TASC employee told Mr. Briggs that the program would either last 9 for 90 days or six months.\n203. The employee told him that if he tested clean, attended the class, and paid 11 his program fees in full, then he would complete the program in 90 days.\n204. If he did not complete any of the three requirements in the first 90 days, 13 including payment of fees in full, he would have to stay in the program for an additional 14 three months or be prosecuted for a felony.\n205. The TASC employee did not ask Mr. Briggs whether he would be able to 16 pay the program and drug and alcohol testing fees.\n206\nMr. Briggs was told to sign a “statement of facts” as a condition of entry 18 into the program.\n207. The statement of facts stated that Mr. Briggs possessed a usable quantity 20 of marijuana.\n208\nMr. Briggs did not consult with an attorney before signing the statement 22 because he could not afford one.\n209. Because of this, Mr. Briggs believed that if he failed to meet the 24 program’s requirements—including paying the necessary fees—he would go to jail.\n210\nMr. Briggs passed all of his drug tests during the first 90 days of the 26 program.\n211. During that time period, Mr. Briggs was required to report for drug and 2 alcohol testing up to three times each week.\n212\nMr. Briggs was forced to pay each time he reported for a drug and alcohol 4 test, even though he was struggling to pay for basic necessities.\n213\nMr. Briggs also completed the required three-hour drug education 6 seminar during his first 90 days on the program.\n214. However, in that first 90 days, Mr. Briggs could not afford to pay the 8 $1000 fee.\n215\nMr. Briggs’s monthly pay at Walmart was less than $1000.\n216\nMr. Briggs also has disabilities caused by spinal meningitis that limit his 11 ability to work.\n217. During the first 90 days of the program, Mr. Briggs was only able to pay 13 $421 toward the $1000 balance.\n218\nMr. Briggs made those payments in small installments.\n219. He paid one $75 installment toward his $150 orientation fee on February\n220. He paid the second installment on April 14, 2016.\n221. On that same date, Mr. Briggs paid another $95 toward his balance.\n222. On May 5, 2016, Mr. Briggs paid $170 toward his balance.\n223. On May 11, 2016, he paid another $16.\n224. During that same time period, Mr. Briggs paid approximately $195 for 22 drug and alcohol tests.\n225. Despite meeting all other program requirements, Mr. Briggs was not 24 considered for program completion at the 90-day mark because he had not paid the 25 $1000 fee in full.\n226. Instead, Mr. Briggs was required to remain on diversion, and remained 27 subject to felony criminal prosecution.\n227\nMr. Briggs was also required to continue reporting to drug and alcohol 2 testing one to three times each week.\n228. After the first 90 days on the program, Mr. Briggs reported for and passed 4 15 additional drug and alcohol tests.\n229. The final drug and alcohol test that Mr. Briggs submitted to and paid for 6 was on August 23, 2016.\n230. In total, the 15 drug and alcohol tests that Mr. Briggs had to take during 8 the pay-only period cost Mr. Briggs approximately $225.\n231\nMr. Briggs also continued to make payments against his balance.\n232. On June 16, 2016, Mr. Briggs paid $170.\n233. On July 14, 2016, he paid $70.\n234. On August 18, 2016, he paid $50.\n235. Finally, on August 25, 2016, Mr. Briggs paid a final installment of $275.\n236. When Mr. Briggs made this final payment, a TASC employee told 15 Mr. Briggs that had successfully completed the program and that he should return to 16 the TASC office the next day to receive his certificate of completion.\n237\nMr. Briggs returned to the TASC offices the following day and received 18 a certification of completion from TASC.\n238. Plaintiff Mark Pascale is a 60-year-old man.\n239\nMr. Pascale lives in Maricopa County, Arizona with his 15-year-old son, 21 for whom he is the sole provider.\n240\nMr. Pascale is disabled; he suffers from degenerative disc disease in his 23 neck and back.\n241. To manage his symptoms, Mr. Pascale takes an anti-epileptic drug, an 25 anti-convulsant drug, and morphine every day.\n242. Because of his illness, Mr. Pascale has been physically unable to work 27 since 2008.\n243. That year, Mr. Pascale filed for bankruptcy.\n244\nMr. Pascale’s only stable source of income comes from federal disability 3 benefits.\n245\nMr. Pascale also receives nutritional assistance benefits and, in the past, 5 has received assistance from government programs to pay his utility bills.\n246. In May 2017, a police officer found a small amount of marijuana in 7 Mr. Pascale’s car.\n247\nMr. Pascale was not arrested, but he received a criminal summons in the 9 mail in October 2017, stating that he was being charged with possession or use of 10 marijuana, a class 6 felony.\n248. At his first court appearance, Mr. Pascale agreed to enroll in the \n249\nMr. Pascale was not addicted to marijuana.\n250\nMr. Pascale attended an orientation for the program on November 21, \n251\nMr. Pascale could not afford to pay the $150 application fee that TASC 17 requires at orientation.\n252. A TASC employee agreed to allow Mr. Pascale to pay $75 up front 19 instead of $150 to attend the orientation.\n253. The remaining $75 was added to Mr. Pascale’s bill, and he was required 21 to pay it before he could complete the diversion program.\n254. During the orientation, a TASC employee told Mr. Pascale that he could 23 complete the program in 90 days if he did not fail any drug and alcohol tests and paid 24 all required fees in full.\n255. When Mr. Pascale reported for his first mandatory drug and alcohol test, 2 he told his case worker at TASC that he could not afford to pay the $950 in program 3 fees.44\n256. He also told her that he could not afford to pay $15 or $17 for drug and 5 alcohol testing weekly or multiple times each week.\n257\nMr. Pascale’s case worker told him that there was no way to waive or 7 reduce the program fees.\n258. However, she explained, his drug and alcohol testing fees could 9 potentially be reduced to $7 per test instead of $15 per test.\n259. The case worker gave Mr. Pascale a financial information form to 11 complete.\n260. On the form, Mr. Pascale marked that he was disabled and worked zero 13 hours per week.\n261. He listed his income as $920 per month, explaining that he received 15 disability benefits.\n262. The case worker told Mr. Pascale that he did not qualify for reduced drug 17 and alcohol testing fees because he owned a computer and was paying for internet 18 service, which are “luxuries.” \n263\nMr. Pascale therefore had to pay the full $15 for each required drug and 20 alcohol test.\n264. These payments, made out of his disability income, made it difficult for 22 Mr. Pascale to pay for basic necessities for himself and his son, including food, shelter, 23 medication, and clothing.\n265\nMr. Pascale was tested at least once per week, but as often as three times 25 per week.\n27 44 Because Mr. Pascale was not arrested, he did not have to pay the $50 booking 28 fee.\n266. At least once each month, Mr. Pascale would be asked to submit to 2 additional drug and alcohol testing because he had tested positive for opiates due to the 3 prescription medications he takes.\n267\nMr. Pascale had provided his case worker with information and 5 documentation about the prescription medications that he takes (including morphine), 6 but even so, she ordered the extra testing.\n268\nMr. Pascale had to pay for these additional tests as well.\n269\nMr. Pascale frequently emphasized to his case worker that he did not have 9 the money to pay for drug and alcohol tests.\n270. The case worker told Mr. Pascale that he had to pay in order to be tested 11 and suggested he borrow money.\n271\nMr. Pascale often skipped paying bills to keep up with the fees.\n272. After 90 days had passed, Mr. Pascale had met all non-monetary program 14 requirements and had never failed a drug and alcohol test.\n273. He had not, however, finished paying the $950 he owed in program fees.\n274. As a result, Mr. Pascale was required to remain on diversion until all of 17 the fees were paid.\n275. During this time, he was still required to submit to and pay for drug and 19 alcohol testing up to three times each week.\n276\nMr. Pascale made his final payment—and submitted to and passed his 21 final drug and alcohol test—on June 29, 2018, more than seven months after he had 22 entered the program.\n277. When Mr. Pascale told his case worker that he had paid his program fees 24 in full, she told him that he had successfully completed the program and issued a 25 certificate of completion dated July 5, 2018.\nInjunctive Relief Class Representative McKenna Stephens\n278. Plaintiff McKenna Stephens is a 24-year-old white woman.\n279\nMs. Stephens works as a part-time server at a restaurant.\n280. On October 29, 2016, Ms. Stephens was sitting with a friend in a car when 3 they were approached by two police officers.\n281. The officers searched the car and found a small amount of marijuana and 5 marijuana paraphernalia in the vehicle.\n282\nMs. Stephens was arrested for possession of marijuana.\n283. She was booked into a local jail and released.\n284. The arresting officer told Ms. Stephens that she would receive a letter in 9 the mail regarding next steps.\n285\nMs. Stephens had no prior criminal convictions.\n286. She was not addicted to marijuana.\n287. On August 3, 2018—nearly two years after she was arrested for 13 marijuana possession—Ms. Stephens received a letter from Defendant MCAO about 14 the marijuana arrest.\n288. The letter gave her a choice: she could agree to participate in the TASC 16 diversion program or she would face felony prosecution.\n289. The letter threatened Ms. Stephens that, if convicted, she could be 18 sentenced to two years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $150,000, plus an 80% 19 surcharge.\n291. Because this was Ms. Stephens’s first marijuana arrest, under Arizona 22 law, she could not receive jail or prison time if convicted of simple possession of 23 marijuana.\n292. Nor was Ms. Stephens eligible for a $150,000 fine.\n293. But Ms. Stephens believed the threats Defendant MCAO made in the 26 letter.\n294. She decided to enroll in the diversion program because she did not want 2 to be fined $150,000 or spend two years in prison.\n295. Prior to orientation for the diversion program, a TASC employee told Ms.\n4 Stephens that she would have to pay $150 in order to attend orientation and begin the 5 program.\n296\nMs. Stephens attended orientation for the marijuana diversion program\n297. That same day, Ms. Stephens paid $150 to TASC.\n298. During the orientation, a TASC employee told Ms. Stephens that in order 10 to complete the program in 90 days, she would have to submit to and pass random drug 11 and alcohol tests, attend a three-hour drug and alcohol seminar, and pay the $1000 12 program fee within that time period.\n299. The TASC employee told Ms. Stephens that if she were unable to meet 14 any of the three requirements—including full payment of program fees—within 90 15 days, she would have to stay in the diversion program for at least six months and until 16 the program fees were paid.\n300. The TASC employee also told Ms. Stephens that, in addition to the $1000 18 program fee, she would have to pay $15 each time she submitted to a drug and alcohol 19 test.\n301\nMs. Stephens informed the TASC employee that she had a medical 21 marijuana card and was legally able to use marijuana.\n302. The TASC employee told her that she could use marijuana while on the 23 marijuana diversion program, but that Ms. Stephens would still have to submit to and 24 pay for random drug and alcohol tests.\n303. During her first week in the marijuana diversion program, Defendants 26 required Ms. Stephens to submit to four drug and alcohol tests.\n304. Defendants required Ms. Stephens to pay $15 for each of the four drug 2 and alcohol tests.\n305\nMs. Stephens intends to fulfill all of the non-monetary requirements of 4 the diversion program within the first 90 days.\n306. However, Ms. Stephens cannot afford to pay the $1000 program fee 6 within 90 days.\n307\nMs. Stephens’s sole income is the $600 or $700 she makes each month 8 as a part-time server.\n308\nMs. Stephens’s allocates almost 100% of her income towards paying her 10 bills and expenses, which includes her car payment, insurance, gas, and phone service.\n309. In order to complete diversion within 90 days, Ms. Stephens would have 12 to pay well over $300 each month.\n310\nMs. Stephens could not pay this amount without defaulting on bill 14 payments and sacrificing basic necessities.\n311. Because Ms. Stephens cannot pay the $1000 program fees within 90 days, 16 pursuant to Defendants’ policy, practice, and custom, she will be required to remain on 17 diversion (and subject to the diversion program’s requirements) for at least six months 18 and until she is able to pay the $1000 program fee.\n312. Without sacrificing basic necessities or defaulting on bills, Ms. Stephens 20 also cannot afford to pay Defendant TASC’s standard monthly minimum payment of 21 $160 or $170 per month, which was set forth in the Client Contract to which she is 22 subject.\n313. If Ms. Stephens cannot afford to make the minimum monthly payment, 24 pursuant to Defendants’ written policy, she will be terminated from the diversion 25 program.45 27 45 Id. 12 (“Failure to make payments [toward the program fees] each month as 28 agreed will result in [the] case being returned for prosecution.”).\n314. Pursuant to Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs, if Ms. Stephens 2 is terminated from the diversion program, she will be prosecuted for felony possession 3 of marijuana.\n315. At orientation, Ms. Stephens was told to sign a statement of facts 5 confessing to possession of marijuana as a condition of entering the program.\n316\nMs. Stephens believed that signing the statement in order to enter the 7 diversion program was the only way that she could avoid prosecution and potential 8 confinement for two years and a $150,000 fine.\n317. Arizona law allows this confession to be used against Ms. Stephens in 10 court.\n318. Accordingly, Ms. Stephens believes that if she is prosecuted, she will be 12 convicted of felony marijuana possession because she signed the confession.\nIndividual Plaintiff Taja Collier\n319. Plaintiff Taja Collier is a 21-year-old African American woman.\n320. On October 7, 2016, Ms. Collier was riding in a car with friends when the 16 car was pulled over by a police officer for making an improper turn.\n321. The officer searched the car’s occupants and found a small cylinder in 18 Ms. Collier’s purse that contained trace amounts of marijuana.\n322. The amount of marijuana in the container was so small that the police 20 officer did not weigh it.\n323\nMs. Collier was placed under arrest for possession of marijuana.\n324\nMs. Collier had no prior criminal record.\n325\nMs. Collier was not addicted to marijuana.\n326. In early Spring 2017, Ms. Collier received a letter from MCAO.\n327. The letter gave her two choices: she could face felony charges for 26 marijuana possession, or she could agree to participate in the TASC diversion program.\n328. The letter warned Ms. Collier that if convicted, she could be sentenced to 2 two years in jail and a fine of up to $150,000, plus an 80% surcharge.\n330. Because this was Ms. Collier’s first offense, under Arizona law, she could 5 not receive jail or prison time if convicted of simple possession of marijuana.\n331. Nor was Ms. Collier eligible for a $150,000 fine.\n332. But Ms. Collier believed the threats in the letter.\n333. She decided to enroll in the TASC diversion program because she did not 9 want to be fined $150,000 or spend two years in prison.\n334. At the time of her arrest, Mr. Collier was a sophomore at Central Arizona 11 College, where she studied social work.\n335. Central Arizona College is located in Casa Grande, Arizona, which is 13 almost an hour away from Phoenix.\n336. When Ms. Collier learned that the TASC diversion program required 15 drug and alcohol testing in Phoenix multiple times each week, she decided she could 16 not go back to college while she was on the TASC program.\n337\nMs. Collier did not have a car or money to make such a long trip so 18 frequently.\n338. She had to stop attending school and move to Phoenix in order to 20 participate in the diversion program.\n339\nMs. Collier was told that she would need to pay $150 at the orientation in 22 order to start the program.\n340. She planned to start the program on June 22, 2017.\n341. That week, however, Ms. Collier realized she would not be able to come 25 up with the $150 required to start the program.\n342\nMs. Collier had recently started a job working part-time at a Target.\n343\nMs. Collier made around minimum wage and worked approximately 16 2 hours per week.\n344. However, she had not yet received her first paycheck.\n345\nMs. Collier called TASC’s main office to tell them that she could not 5 afford to pay the $150 fee.\n346. No one called her back.\n347. At 6:51 a.m. on the morning her orientation was set to begin, Ms. Collier 8 sent an email to the general email address for the possession of marijuana diversion 9 program.\n348. The email read, “Hi, my name is Taja Collier. I called the office to 11 reschedule my appointment 2 days ago and have not received a call back. I left a 12 message for the corporate office and nod [sic] I'm sending this email. I had an 13 appointment today at 8:45 and I do not have 150 because I get my first check next week.\n14 I do not want my file sent back to the court system.”\n349. Later the same day, Ms. Collier reached a TASC employee by phone and 16 rescheduled her orientation for July 6, 2017.\n350. Several days later, however, on June 25, 2017, Ms. Collier learned that 18 she would not be paid until after July 9, 2017.\n351\nMs. Collier wrote again to the email address for the possession of 20 marijuana diversion program and informed TASC that she needed to reschedule the 21 orientation for after she got paid.\n352. A TASC employee rescheduled Ms. Collier’s orientation for July 13,\n353. The employee did not tell her that she could start the program even if she 25 did not pay.\n354. The employee also did not tell her that she could apply for a fee waiver 27 or a fee reduction.\n355. On July 13, 2017, Ms. Collier paid $150 to TASC and attended the 2 mandatory orientation.\n356. Shortly after her orientation, Ms. Collier was informed by the case 4 manager that had been assigned to her that she had to submit to a drug and alcohol test 5 and that she had to pay for the test in order to take it.\n357\nMs. Collier was willing to take the mandatory test, but she could not 7 afford the $15 or $17 fee to pay for it.\n358\nMs. Collier again emailed the address for the possession of marijuana\n359. In her email, Ms. Collier pleaded: “I won't be able to come up with the 11 fee money until next Friday. I keep calling [my case manager] to figure out what my 12 next steps should be. Is there anyway [sic] I can change case managers or get some 13 assistance?”\n360. No one responded to the email.\n361. Nor did anyone call Ms. Collier to follow up.\n362. Ultimately, Ms. Collier could not take the test because she could not 17 afford to pay for it.\n363. To pay for her drug tests going forward, Ms. Collier began to sell her own 19 blood plasma whenever she was called to test.\n364. Whenever Ms. Collier would learn that she had a drug test, she would 21 schedule a blood plasma sale so that she could pay for the test.\n365\nMs. Collier made $20 to $35 each time she sold her blood plasma.\n366. However, according to the blood plasma center’s rules, a person is only 24 allowed to sell blood plasma twice each week.\n367. Therefore, weeks when Ms. Collier was called to drug test more than 26 twice were especially difficult for her to manage.\n368. After she sold her blood plasma, Ms. Collier often felt fatigued and dizzy, 2 like she couldn’t breathe or might black out.\n369. But she continued to sell her blood plasma because it was the only way 4 she could pay for the drug tests.\n370\nMs. Collier told her case manager at TASC that she sold her blood plasma 6 to pay for drug tests.\n371. The case manager never told her that she could take the tests without 8 paying for them at the time of the test.\n372. The case manager also never told her that she could apply for a reduced 10 fee.\n373. At times, even after selling her blood plasma, Ms. Collier could not afford 12 to take drug and alcohol tests at TASC.\n374. When this happened, Ms. Collier could not take required drug and alcohol 14 tests because she was not allowed to test if she could not pay for it.\n375. Instead, Ms. Collier would try to contact her case manager to tell her that 16 she could not afford to pay to test.\n376. Frequently, Ms. Collier’s case manager would not answer her phone or 18 respond to emails, and Ms. Collier would try to reach her by calling TASC’s corporate 19 office.\n377. In September 2017, Ms. Collier became homeless.\n378. She remained homeless for approximately one month.\n379. While she was homeless, Ms. Collier slept in public parks.\n380. On September 20, 2017, Ms. Collier emailed her case manager.\n381. She explained, “I have been homeless for the passed [sic] week so money 25 has been really tight. … It has been really tough.” \n382\nMs. Collier also told her case manager in the email that she planned to 2 start Job Corps and that she would be able to pay for drug and alcohol tests once she 3 started.\n383\nMs. Collier’s case manager responded five days later.\n384. In her email, the case manager replied:\n“Sorry to hear that you are going through this. I am hoping things get better for you. I also noticed that since you are on your FINAL NOTICE, any missed test past this point will result in program termination. So I am happy to hear that you are going to do whatever is possible to test next time you are required to test. Good Luck and hope everything works out for you.”\n385. Again, the case manager did not suggest that Ms. Collier could take the 12 tests without paying for them.\n386. Nor did she invite her to apply for a reduced fee.\n387. Shortly after this exchange, Ms. Collier was issued another violation 15 because she did not take drug and alcohol tests solely because she could not afford to 16 pay for them.\n388. On October 10, 2017, TASC reported to MCAO that Ms. Collier had 18 failed the diversion program.\n389. In its reasons for failing Ms. Collier, TASC listed that Ms. Collier had not 20 submitted to mandatory drug and alcohol tests.\n390. As described above, Ms. Collier did not take these tests solely because 22 she could not afford to pay for them.\n391. TASC also stated that Ms. Collier was being failed because she had not 24 paid the required TASC fee and had not paid the required drug fund assessment fee.46 In addition, TASC stated that Ms. Collier had not attended the program’s 26 mandatory seminar. However, participants are required to take this seminar before they can successfully complete the program; they are not required to take it at a specific time Ms. Collier would not have been failed from the diversion program solely because 28 she had not yet completed the seminar. The only other reason TASC provided for failing\n392. On December 8, 2017, MCAO filed felony charges against Ms. Collier 2 for possession of marijuana.\n393\nMs. Collier’s preliminary hearing was on January 22, 2018.\n394. On that same date, Ms. Collier agreed to re-enroll in the TASC possession 5 of marijuana diversion program.\n395\nMs. Collier’s prosecution was suspended for two years to allow her to 7 complete TASC.\n396\nMs. Collier knew that she would struggle to pay for diversion.\n397. But she decided to re-enroll because—based on the false threats in the 10 letter that she received from MCAO—she believed that she would go to jail if she did 11 not complete diversion.\n398. To re-enter the program, Ms. Collier was again required to pay the $150 13 admissions fee.\n399\nMs. Collier paid $148 toward that amount on March 13, 2018.\n400\nMs. Collier paid the remaining $2 on May 24, 2018.\n401. Since that time, Ms. Collier has made payments of between $8 and $20.\n402\nMs. Collier still must pay $667 to TASC before she can complete the 18 program.\n403\nMs. Collier cannot afford this sum without sacrificing basic necessities 20 like food and housing.\n404. Nor can she afford to pay it at the rate required by Defendant TASC in 22 the Client Contract.\n405\nMs. Collier is also still required to submit to drug and alcohol testing—at 24 $15 or $17 per test—one to three times each week.\n25 Ms. Collier was that she did not respond to a non-compliance letter she received on 26 August 7,\n2017. But Ms. Collier was in contact with her case manager after receiving this letter and explained that she could not afford to pay for drug and alcohol tests. In addition, TASC does not have a policy, practice, or custom of failing diversion 28 participants who do not respond to a letter.\n406. TASC still will not allow Ms. Collier to complete drug and alcohol tests 2 unless she pays for them.\n407\nMs. Collier therefore continues to sell her blood plasma whenever she 4 knows she is going to be drug tested so that she can pay for the tests.\n408. On August 17, 2018, Ms. Collier sent an e-mail to her case manager.\n409\nMs. Collier wrote:\n“Tasc has really been putting a big strain on my pockets. … I am very concerned that I will end up homeless again trying to sacrifice rent for tasc as this is putting Me [sic] in a bad space. I have been donating plasma whenever I have to test to get the money I need to pay for it, but I am afraid it is affecting my health. I am willing to test whenever I'm required but I cannot afford the fees. Is there anyway [sic] that I can test without having to pay for it?” 12 \n410\nMs. Collier’s case worker replied, “You have to pay for the program in 14 order to complete the program. I understand that this is cost effective [sic] but in order 15 for you to have you [sic] felony dismissed with prejudice you will have to complete all 16 program requirement [sic] which includes paying all fees associated with the 17 program.”47\n411. On September 4, 2018, Ms. Collier was scheduled to submit to a drug and 19 alcohol test at TASC.\n412\nMs. Collier did not have any money to pay for the drug test.\n413. Nevertheless, at approximately 6 p.m., Ms. Collier reported to the TASC 22 office in Phoenix to submit to a test.\n414. When she arrived, Ms. Collier told a male TASC staff member that she 24 was willing to take the drug and alcohol test, but that she could not pay the fee that day.\n27 47 In her response, the case worker also suggested that Ms. Collier could apply for insurance to alleviate the costs of one of the mandatory treatment classes. This would 28 do nothing to relieve the costs of program fees or the fees for drug and alcohol tests. 41\n415. The TASC staff member told Ms. Collier that if she did not have the 2 money, she could not take the drug and alcohol test.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n416. The named Plaintiffs bring this case as a class action pursuant to Rules 5 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n417. The Classes are defined as follows:\na. Damages Class: All people who, since August 23, 2016, and until the trial of this case, (1) were enrolled in the marijuana diversion program operated by Defendants TASC and MCAO; (2) satisfied all program requirements in the first 90 days of the program other than payment of program fees; and (3) were not considered for successful completion after 90 days solely because they were unable to pay the required fees. Named Plaintiffs Deshawn Briggs and Mark Pascale seek certification of this class.\nb. Injunctive Class: All people who (1) have not yet been formally charged with possession of marijuana; (2) received a pre-filing letter offering participation in the MCAO and TASC marijuana diversion program; and 3) are unable to pay the required program fees within 90 days and/or at the rate required by Defendant TASC. Named Plaintiff McKenna Stephens seeks certification of this class.\n418. The class members are readily ascertainable: the names and relevant 22 records of the class members are in Defendants’ possession.\nNumerosity: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(1)\n419. On information and belief, both Classes include at least several hundred 25 members.\n420. During the 2017 fiscal year (July 1, 2016 through July 30, 2017), there 27 were 2687 admittances to the possession of marijuana diversion program.\n421. The marijuana diversion program has maintained similar numbers of 2 admittances in its last several years of operation.\n422. Therefore, there were likely at least 2500 admittances in the 2018 fiscal 4 year.\n423. Thus, if even a small percentage of the people admitted to TASC since 6 August 23, 2016 meet the requirements for the Classes, the Classes would number in 7 the hundreds.\n424. Moreover, on information and belief, a large majority of those arrested 9 and prosecuted for marijuana possession in Maricopa County are deemed indigent for 10 the purposes of appointment of counsel.\nCommonality: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(2)\n425. The Class members’ claims raise common issues of fact and law.\n426. With respect to the Damages Class, those common questions include, but 14 are not limited to:\na. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of refusing days and beyond solely because they cannot afford to pay the required fees, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nb. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who have not paid the required fees to remain on diversion supervision until they have done so, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nc. Whether Defendants’ diversion extension policies (in subparagraphs (a) and (b)) violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;\nd. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who remain on diversion solely due to inability to pay to continue to submit to and pay for random drug and alcohol tests; and e. Whether Defendants’ policy of continuing this mandatory drug and alcohol testing for participants who remain on the diversion program solely due to inability to pay violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n427. With respect to the Injunctive Class, those common questions include, 8 but are not limited to:\na. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of refusing days and beyond solely because they cannot afford to pay the required fees, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nb. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who have not paid the required fees to remain on diversion supervision until they have done so, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nc. Whether Defendants’ diversion extension policies (in subparagraphs (a) and (b)) violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;\nd. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who remain on diversion solely due to inability to pay to continue to submit to and pay for random drug and alcohol tests;\ne. Whether Defendants’ policy of continuing this mandatory drug and alcohol testing for participants who remain on the diversion program solely due to inability to pay violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;\nf. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants to make a minimum monthly payment and terminating those who fail to do so, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay; and g. Whether Defendants’ policy of terminating participants who cannot afford to make a minimum monthly payment policy violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nTypicality: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(3)\n428. The Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of 11 the Class, and they have the same interests in this case as all other members of the Class 12 that they represent.\n429. The determination whether the Defendants’ scheme of policies, practices, 14 and customs is unlawful in the ways alleged will determine the claims of the named 15 Plaintiffs and every other class member.\nAdequacy: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(4)\n430. Named Plaintiffs are capable of fairly and adequately protecting the 18 interests of the Class because Named Plaintiffs do not have any interests antagonistic 19 to the Class.\n431. There are no known conflicts of interest among class members, all of 21 whom have a similar interest in vindicating the constitutional rights to which they are 22 entitled.\n432. Plaintiffs’ counsel are experienced in civil rights litigation and have 24 successfully litigated a number of civil rights class action cases.\n433. Many of those cases, like this one, involve unconstitutional penalties 26 based solely on wealth status.\nPredomination, Injunctive Class: Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(2) 3 questions of law and fact predominate in this case.\n435. For Named Plaintiff McKenna Stephens, as well as for the members of 5 the Class, this case turns on what the Defendants’ policies and practices are and on 6 whether those policies are lawful.\n8 questions in the case for every member of the Class.\n437. Because the putative Class challenges the Defendants’ scheme as 10 unconstitutional through injunctive relief that would apply to every member of the 11 Class, Rule 23(b) (2) certification is proper.\nPredomination, Damages Class: Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(3) 14 questions of law and fact overwhelmingly predominate in this case.\n439. For every Named Plaintiff, as well as for the members of the Class, this 16 case turns on what the Defendants’ policies and practices are and on whether those 17 policies are lawful.\n19 questions in the case of every member of the Class.\n441. Moreover, the question of liability can therefore be determined on a class- 21 wide basis.\n442. To the extent that individual damages will vary, they will vary depending 23 in large part on the amount of time that a person was subjected to the unlawful scheme 24 and the amount of money coerced from them.\n443. Determining damages for individual class members can thus typically be 26 handled in a ministerial fashion based on easily verifiable records in the Defendants’ 27 possession.\n444. If need be, individual hearings on class members’ specific damages based 2 on special circumstances and particular hardships caused by Defendants’ scheme can 3 be held after class-wide liability is determined.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nCount One: Wealth-Based Discrimination in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 7 Brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by Named Plaintiffs DeShawn Briggs and Mark Pascale on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against all Defendants for damages.\n445. Defendants, acting in concert under color of state law, enacted, enforced, 10 11 and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of subjecting diversion 12 participants to longer terms of diversion supervision while under threat of felony 13 prosecution, which include in-person reporting, drug and alcohol testing requirements, 14 and increased payments, solely because of their inability to pay fees associated with the 15 program.\n446. This policy, practice, and custom of penalizing individuals based solely 17 on wealth status violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 18 Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n20 and custom, Plaintiffs have suffered violations of their constitutional rights and thus are 21 entitled to compensatory damages for their injuries.\ninvolved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. 23 Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover punitive damages—in addition to 24 compensatory damages—against Defendant TASC. 25 Count Two: Wealth-Based Discrimination in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 3 Brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by Named Plaintiff McKenna Stephens on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated against all Defendants for injunctive relief; and by Plaintiff Taja Collier on her own behalf against Defendant TASC for injunctive relief.\n7 and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of subjecting participants to 8 longer terms of diversion and/or terminating them from the diversion program based on 9 wealth status.\n450. Defendants subject diversion participants to longer terms of diversion 11 supervision while under threat of felony prosecution, which include in-person 12 reporting, drug and alcohol testing requirements, and increased payments, solely 13 because of their inability to pay fees associated with the program.\n451. Pursuant to a written policy, Defendants terminate participants who 15 cannot afford to make specific minimum monthly payments toward diversion program 16 fees and subsequently prosecute them for felony possession of marijuana.\n452. These policies, practices, and customs violates the Due Process and Equal 18 Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n20 practices, and customs, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer violations of their 21 constitutional rights unless Defendants are enjoined.\n454. Plaintiff Stephens is a participant in Defendants’ diversion program and 23 cannot afford to pay the fees required to complete the program in 90 days.\n25 others similarly situated, to remain on diversion for more than 90 days solely because 26 they cannot afford to pay the fees necessary to complete the diversion program.\n456. Plaintiff Stephens also cannot afford to pay the minimum monthly fees 2 set by Defendant TASC.\n457. Plaintiff Stephens seeks to enjoin Defendants from terminating her from 4 the diversion program solely because she cannot afford to pay minimum monthly fees.\n458. Plaintiff Collier is a participant in Defendants’ diversion program and 6 cannot afford to pay the fees required to complete the program.\n459\nMs. Collier seeks to enjoin Defendant TASC from forcing her to remain 8 on diversion solely because she cannot afford to pay the fees necessary to complete the\n460. Plaintiff Collier also cannot afford to pay the minimum monthly fees set 11 by Defendant TASC.\n461. Plaintiff Collier seeks to enjoin Defendant TASC from terminating her 13 from the diversion program solely because she cannot afford to pay monthly minimum 14 fees.\nCount Three: Wealth-Based Discrimination in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 17 Brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by Plaintiff Taja Collier on her own behalf against all Defendants for damages and against Defendant TASC for injunctive relief.\n20 and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of not allowing participants in 21 Defendants’ diversion program to complete drug and alcohol tests unless those 22 participants can pay for them at the time of the test.\n463. Defendants, acting in concert under color of state law, also enacted, 24 enforced, and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of failing participants 25 from the program because those participants were not permitted to take drug and 26 alcohol tests solely because they were unable to afford them.\n464. These policies, practices, and customs penalized Plaintiff Collier based 2 solely on her wealth status in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n5 practices, and customs, Plaintiff Collier suffered violations of her constitutional rights 6 and thus is entitled to compensatory damages for her injuries.\n8 involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiff Collier’s constitutional rights.\n9 Accordingly, she is entitled to recover punitive damages—in addition to compensatory 10 damages—against Defendant TASC.\n12 cannot afford to pay the program’s fees or the fees required to take drug and alcohol 13 tests.\n468. Plaintiff Collier therefore seeks to enjoin Defendant TASC from refusing 15 to allow her to take drug and alcohol tests solely because she is unable to pay for them.\n469. Plaintiff Collier also seeks to enjoin Defendant TASC from terminating 17 her from the diversion program because she did not take drug and alcohol tests solely 18 because she could not afford them.\n19 Count Four: Unreasonable Searches and Seizures in Violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments 21 Brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by Named Plaintiffs DeShawn Briggs and Mark Pascale on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against all Defendants for damages.\n2 unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S.\n3 Constitution.\n5 and custom, Plaintiffs have suffered violations of their bodily liberty and integrity and 6 are entitled to compensatory damages for their injuries.\n473. Defendant TASC’s actions were knowing, willful, deliberate, and 8 malicious, and involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutional 9 rights. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover punitive damages—in addition to 10 compensatory damages—against Defendant TASC.\n11 Count Five: Unreasonable Searches and Seizures in Violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments 13 Brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by Named McKenna Stephens on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated against all Defendants for injunctive relief; and by 14 Plaintiff Taja Collier on her own behalf against Defendant TASC for injunctive relief.\n20 unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S.\n21 Constitution.\n23 and custom, Plaintiffs will suffer violations of their bodily liberty and integrity unless 24 Defendants are enjoined.\n477. Plaintiff Stephens is currently a participant in Defendants’ diversion 26 program and cannot afford to pay the fees required to complete the program in 90 days.\n2 others similarly situated, to submit to drug and alcohol testing after 90 days in the 3 program if the sole reason she remains on the program is that she cannot afford to pay 4 the fees necessary to complete it.\n6 cannot afford to pay the fees required to complete the diversion program.\n480. Plaintiff Collier therefore requests that this Court enjoin Defendant TASC 8 from requiring her to take drug and alcohol tests solely because she cannot afford to 9 pay the fees necessary to complete the diversion program.\nREQUEST FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs demand a jury trial for all issues so appropriate 12 and request this Court to issue the following relief:\nA. That this action be certified as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the 14 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, declaring Named Plaintiffs DeShawn Briggs, Mark 15 Pascale, and McKenna Stephens as representatives of their respective Classes and 16 Named Plaintiffs’ counsel as counsel for the Classes;\nB. A judgment compensating the Plaintiffs and the Classes of similarly 18 situated individuals for the damages that they suffered as a result of the Defendants’ 19 unconstitutional and unlawful conduct in an amount to be determined at trial;\nC. A judgment granting the punitive damages authorized by statute based 21 on Defendant TASC’s willful and egregious violations of the law;\nD. A judgment enjoining Defendants from further unconstitutional and 23 unlawful conduct against Named Plaintiff McKenna Stephens and the class she 24 represents;\nE. A judgment enjoining Defendant TASC from further unconstitutional 26 conduct against Plaintiff Taja Collier;\nF.

 '1 WO\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA\n9 Deshawn Briggs, et al., No. CV-18-02684-PHX-EJM Plaintiffs, \nORDER\n11 v. 12 William Montgomery, et al., Defendants.\nPending before the Court are Defendants Maricopa County and Maricopa County 16 Attorney William Montgomery’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 34) and Defendant Treatment 17 Assessment Screening Center, Inc.’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 36). All appropriate 18 responses and replies have been filed, and the Court heard oral arguments from the parties 19 on May 22,\n2019. For the reasons explained below, the Court will deny the motions.\n20 I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs filed their first amended class action complaint (“FAC”) on October 12, \n22\n2018. (Doc. 20). Plaintiffs allege civil rights claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1983 and the 23 Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and seek monetary 24 damages and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs are four named individuals who represent 25 themselves and a class of similarly situated people Id. at 6–7. Plaintiffs’ allegations 26 concern a marijuana deferred prosecution program (“MDPP” or “the program”) operated 27 by the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office (“MCAO”) and Treatment Assessment 28 Screening Center (“TASC”). Id.\n47. Plaintiffs also allege Defendant Bill Montgomery, 1 the elected County Attorney (“CA”) for Maricopa County, is liable in his official capacity 2 for his role in operating and administering the diversion program, and that Montgomery is 3 the final policymaker for Maricopa County on matters relating to diversion programs. Id.\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants “jointly operate a possession of marijuana 6 diversion program that penalizes the poor because of their poverty.” Id.\n1. Specifically, 7 Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that:\n7. The length of time a person spends in the diversion program and whether the person ultimately completes the program and avoids felony criminal prosecution depends on whether she can pay the program’s required fees. 10\n8. In order to complete the program and avoid felony criminal prosecution, participants in the marijuana diversion program must pay a fee of $950 or $1000. 12\n9. Participants must also pay $15 or $17 for each drug and alcohol test; they may be required to take as many as three or four tests each week. 14\n10. The program is two-tiered: people who meet program requirements—completing a three-hour drug education seminar and routine drug and alcohol testing—and are wealthy enough to pay the $950 or $1000 program fee complete the program in 90 days and are no longer subject to felony criminal prosecution.\n11. But participants who cannot pay the program fees are forced to stay in the program for at least six months and until they can pay off the money owed to MCAO and TASC, even if they have satisfied every program requirement other than payment.\n12. During the “pay-only” period, participants remain subject to felony criminal prosecution during the additional time they are forced to remain in the diversion program.\n13. These participants also remain subject to all of the diversion program’s requirements. 24\n14. These requirements include reporting to a TASC location, as often as four times per week, so that the participant’s urine can be collected and tested. 26\n15. Participants who remain on diversion solely because of their inability to pay program fees must also continue to pay $15 or $17 each time they are required to submit to a drug and alcohol test.\n16. The perverse result is that poor people are ultimately charged more money—potentially hundreds of dollars more— than similarly situated participants who can afford to pay to finish the program in 90 days.\n17. Participants who cannot afford to pay for diversion may also be terminated from the program altogether and referred for felony prosecution.\n18. This can happen in at least two ways.\n19. First, Defendants require diversion participants to make a minimum monthly payment towards the $950 or $1000 program fees at a rate set by Defendant TASC.\n20. A participant who fails to pay the minimum monthly payment set by Defendant TASC can be terminated from the program and prosecuted.\n21. Defendants do not inquire into a participant’s ability to pay before setting the minimum monthly fee.\n22. Defendants’ policy does not include any exception for participants who do not pay the minimum monthly amount solely because they cannot afford it.\n23. Second, participants are not allowed to take the drug and alcohol tests the program requires if they cannot afford to pay for them.\n24. For example, if a participant cannot pay the $15 or $17 fee for a drug and alcohol test, she is not allowed to take the test at all.\n25. Therefore, if a participant reports for a drug and alcohol test without the required fee, she will be turned away, and she will receive a violation for missing the test.\n26. In other words, an unpaid drug and alcohol test is a failed test.\n27. If a participant misses too many drug and alcohol tests— even if she missed them solely because she could not afford to pay for them—she will be failed out of the diversion program and prosecuted for felony possession of marijuana.\n28. Defendants enforce these policies even when they know that diversion participants are poor or even homeless, and even when they know that participants are sacrificing basic necessities to pay fees.\n30. Diversion participants who alert TASC employees that they cannot afford the required fees are told that they will be failed from the program if they do not pay and to do whatever it takes to get the money.\n2 Id. at 2–5 (footnote omitted).\n3 Plaintiffs state five claims for relief: 1) wealth-based discrimination in violation of 4 the Fourteenth Amendment by Plaintiffs Briggs and Pascale and others similarly situated 5 against all Defendants for monetary damages; 2) wealth-based discrimination in violation 6 of the Fourteenth Amendment by Plaintiff Stephens and others similarly situated against 7 all Defendants for injunctive relief, and by Plaintiff Collier on her own behalf against 8 Defendant TASC for injunctive relief; 3) wealth-based discrimination in violation of the 9 Fourteenth Amendment by Plaintiff Collier against all Defendants for damages and against 10 Defendant TASC for injunctive relief; 4) unreasonable search and seizure in violation of 11 the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by Plaintiffs Briggs and Pascale and others 12 similarly situated against all Defendants for damages; and 5) unreasonable search and 13 seizure in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by Plaintiff Stephens and 14 others similarly situated against all Defendants for injunctive relief, and by Plaintiff Collier 15 on her own behalf against Defendant TASC for injunctive relief. (Doc. 20 at 47–51).\n16 On November 20, 2018 Defendant TASC filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.\n17 R\nCiv\nP. 12(b)(6). (Doc. 36). TASC alleges that: “(1) TASC cannot be liable for any of 18 the harm Plaintiffs allege; (2) even if TASC could be liable to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs’ 19 substantive claims (alleging violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments) fail as 20 a matter of law; and (3) even if Plaintiffs had a substantive claim for relief, Plaintiff Briggs’ 21 claims are time-barred.” Id. at\n1. TASC further states that at a minimum, Plaintiffs should 22 be required to amend their complaint to clarify their claims and eliminate immaterial 23 allegations in compliance with Fed R\nCiv. P.\n8. Id.\n24 Also on November 20, 2018, Defendants Maricopa County and William 25 Montgomery (“the County Defendants”) filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed R\nCiv. 26 P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). (Doc. 34). The County Defendants allege that dismissal is 27 warranted for the following reasons:\n28 (1) Because the County Attorney acts as a State official, not a County official, when he establishes and implements a marijuana deferred prosecution program, Plaintiffs’ § 1983 Monell liability claims/requests for relief against the County and County Attorney must be dismissed [Counts 1–5]; (2) 11th Amendment sovereign immunity bars § 1983 damages claims against the County Attorney in his capacity as a State official; further, the County Attorney in his capacity as a State official is not a “person” for purposes of §\n1983. Plaintiffs’ 1983 damages claims against him thus must be dismissed [Counts 1, 3 and 4]; (3) Because the County Attorney’s policies and practices in establishing and implementing a marijuana deferred prosecution program are prosecutorial functions, absolute prosecutorial immunity bars Plaintiffs’ § 1983 damages claims against the County Attorney [Counts 1, 3 and 4], requiring concomitant dismissal of Plaintiffs’ redundant § 1983 damages claims asserted against the County; (4) Plaintiff Briggs’ claims [Counts 1 and 4] are statutorily time-barred; and (5) For the reasons set forth in Part IV of TASC’s Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs fail to state claims for relief for alleged wealth discrimination under the 14th Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses or for alleged unreasonable search and seizure under the a matter of law [Counts 1–5].\n16 Id. at 1.1 The County Defendants join in parts IV and V of Defendant TASC’s motion to 17 dismiss Id. 18 \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW 19\nPursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 12(b)(6), the Court may grant a motion to dismiss when 20 the plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A complaint must 21 contain a “short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s jurisdiction,” a “short 22 and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” and “a 23 demand for the relief sought.” Fed R. Civ P. 8(a). While Rule 8 does not demand factual 24 allegations, “it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me 25 accusation.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009). “Threadbare recitals of a 26 cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id. 27 28 1 The County Defendants later withdrew their absolute prosecutorial immunity argument. See Doc. 81.\nA dismissal for failure to state a claim “is proper only where there is no cognizable 2 legal theory or an absence of sufficient facts alleged to support cognizable legal theory.” 3 Navarro v. Block, 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal citation omitted); see also 4 Jablon v. Dean Witter Co., 614 F.2d 677, 682 (9th Cir. 1980) (Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal 5 motion “can be granted only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set 6 of facts in support of his or her claim.”). However, “the court [is not] required to accept as 7 true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or 8 unreasonable inferences.” Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir.\nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a pleading must allege facts 11 sufficient “to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Bell Atl Corp\nv. Twombly, 12 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). A claim must be plausible, allowing the court to draw the 13 reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the conduct alleged. Ashcroft, 129 S.\n14 Ct. at\n1949. “The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks 15 for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Id. (quoting 16 Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). “Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent 17 with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of 18 entitlement to relief.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.\n“In adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,... a court does not resolve 20 factual disputes between the parties on an undeveloped record. Instead, the issue is whether 21 the pleading states a sufficient claim to warrant allowing the [plaintiffs] to attempt to prove 22 their case.” Coleman v. City of Mesa, 230 Ariz. 352, 363 (2012); see also Lee v. City of 23 Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001) (“factual challenges to a plaintiff’s 24 complaint have no bearing on the legal sufficiency of the allegations under Rule 12(b)(6)”), 25 overruling on other grounds recognized by Jack Loumena v. Walter P. Hammon, 2015 WL \n26 7180679 (N.D\nCal\nNov. 16, 2015). Thus, Defendants’ motions do not require the Court 27 to make factual determinations regarding Plaintiffs’ indigency, or whether Plaintiffs have 28 proved that Defendants have a policy or policies that unconstitutionally discriminate 1 against indigents. The Court only considers whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated their 2 claims to justify allowing those claims to move forward.\nThe Court must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the nonmoving 4 party, with every doubt resolved on his behalf, and with that party’s allegations taken as 5 true. See Abramson v. Brownstein, 897 F.2d 389, 391 (9th Cir. 1990). Generally, the court 6 only considers the face of the complaint when deciding a motion under Rule 12(b)(6). See 7 Van Buskirk v. Cable News Network, Inc., 284 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir. 2002). Consideration 8 of matters outside the pleading converts the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to a Rule 56 motion for 9 summary judgment, unless one of two exceptions are met:\nFirst, a court may consider material which is properly submitted as part of the complaint on a motion to dismiss without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. If the documents are not physically attached to the complaint, they may be considered if the documents’ authenticity... is not contested and the plaintiff’s complaint necessarily relies on them. Second, under Fed. R.\nEvid. 201, a court may take judicial notice of matters of public record.\n15 Lee, 250 F.3d at 688–89 (internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Harris v. Cty.\n16 of Orange, 682 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir. 2012) (“documents not attached to a complaint 17 may be considered if no party questions their authenticity and the complaint relies on those 18 documents.”). The Court “may take judicial notice of court filings, as they are matters of 19 public record, and ‘[i]t is also well established that a federal district court can take judicial 20 notice of its own records.’” Baca ex rel. Nominal Defendant Insight Enterprises, Inc\nv. 21 Crown, 2010 WL 2812712, at *2 (D Ariz. July 12, 2010) aff’d sub nom. Baca v. Crown, 22 458 F. App’x 694 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). “[While a] court may take judicial 23 notice of matters of public record without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for 24 summary judgment... a court may not take judicial notice of a fact that is subject to 25 reasonable dispute.” Lee, 250 F.3d at\n689. Here, the Court previously ruled that it shall take 26 judicial notice of Exhibits B–F attached to the County Defendants’ motion to dismiss and 27 that by so doing the Court does not convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for 28 summary judgment.\n1 III. DISCUSSION\nPlaintiffs seek relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1983. “Section 1983 provides a cause 3 of action against any person who deprives an individual of federally guaranteed rights 4 ‘under color’ of state law.” Filarsky v. Delia, 566 U.S. 377, 383 (2012). “Anyone whose 5 conduct is ‘fairly attributable to the state’ can be sued as a state actor under § 1983.” Id.\n6 (quoting Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982)). “To prevail on a claim 7 under § 1983, a plaintiff must show that (1) acts by the defendants, (2) under color of state 8 law, (3) deprived him of federal rights, privileges, or immunities, and (4) caused him 9 damage.” Platt v. Moore, 2018 WL 2058136, at *2 (D Ariz\nMar. 15, 2018) (citing 10 Thornton v. City of St. Helens, 425 F.3d 1158, 1163–64 (9th Cir. 2005)), appeal filed April Plaintiffs’ claims concern a class of persons that Plaintiffs refer to as “pay-only 13 participants”2—persons who cannot afford to pay the MDPP fee within 90 days and are 14 required to stay on the program longer. Plaintiffs challenge three policies that apply to 15 indigent diversion program participants and allegedly caused the constitutional violations 16 at issue in this suit:\n1) participants who are unable to pay minimum monthly payments or fees for mandatory urine tests are terminated from the program (the “wealth-based termination policy”); 2) participants who cannot afford to pay the program fees in 90 days are subject to longer terms of intrusive supervision than similarly-situated participants who are able to pay (the “wealth-based extended supervision policy”); and 3) participants who are supervised in the program solely due to their inability to pay program fees are subject to routine suspicionless urine testing for drugs and alcohol (the “wealth- based extended urine testing policy”).\n23 (Doc. 45 at 3–4) (internal citations omitted).\n24 A. Defendant Treatment Assessment Screening Center, Inc.’s Motion to 25 Dismiss 26 i. Policy, Decision, or Custom 28 2 “‘Pay-only’ refers to a period of criminal supervision during which the person is supervised only because she has not paid all of her debt.” (Doc. 20 at 3 n.6).\nTASC first argues that it cannot be liable as an entity because it has not established 2 any policies that Plaintiffs may be challenging. TASC further states that Plaintiffs have 3 failed to allege any facts regarding policies that TASC adopted, or any custom that TASC 4 had the discretion to implement, that is so persistent and widespread that it became a 5 permanent and well-settled entity policy. (Doc. 36 at 7).\nIn Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978), the Supreme Court held that 7 local governments and local government officials sued in their official capacity are 8 “persons” for purposes of § 1983 and may be held liable for constitutional violations arising 9 from a government policy or custom. In Tsao v. Desert Palace, Inc., 698 F.3d 1128 (9th 10 Cir. 2012), the Ninth Circuit held that Monell also applies to suits against private entities.\n11 “To create liability under § 1983, the constitutional violation must be caused by a policy, 12 practice, or custom of the entity, or be the result of an order by a policy-making officer.” 13 Id. at 1139 (internal quotations and citations omitted); Monell, 436 U.S. at 690–91 (local 14 governments “can be sued directly under § 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive 15 relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or 16 executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and 17 promulgated by that body’s officers... Moreover,... local governments... may be sued 18 for constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental ‘custom’ even though such 19 a custom has not received formal approval through the body’s official decisionmaking 20 channels.”).\nThus, to state a claim against TASC under Monell and Tsao, Plaintiffs must show 22 that (1) TASC acted under color of state law, and (2) that the alleged constitutional 23 violation was caused by a policy or custom. Tsao, 698 F.3d at\n1139. The Court finds that 24 Plaintiffs have pled enough facts to state a claim for entity liability against TASC sufficient 25 to survive a motion to dismiss.\nFirst, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled that TASC acted under color of state law via 27 its agreement with MCAO to operate the MDPP.3 The FAC alleges that MCAO and TASC 28 3 The court considers four tests to determine “whether a private [party’s] actions amount to state action: (1) the public function test; (2) the joint action test; (3) the state compulsion 1 jointly operate the MDPP, that TASC has a contract with MCAO to operate, administer, 2 and supervise the program, and that TASC supervises all people whose prosecutions for 3 simple possession of marijuana have been diverted. (Doc. 20 1, 47, 67).\nThe second thing that Plaintiffs must show is that TASC had a policy, custom, or 5 pattern that was the actionable cause of Plaintiffs’ injuries. Tsao, 698 F.3d at\n1143. A policy 6 may be either formal or informal: “‘Congress included customs and usages [in § 1983] 7 because of the persistent and widespread discriminatory practices of state officials...\n8 Although not authorized by written law, such practices of state officials could well be so 9 permanent and well settled as to constitute a ‘custom or usage’ with the force of law.’” 10 Monell, 436 U.S. at 691 (quoting Adickes v S\nH. Kress Co., 398 U.S. 144, 167–168 11 (1970)). As this Court explained in Milke v. City of Phoenix, 2016 WL 5339693, at *15 (D.\n12 Ariz Jan. 8, 2016), An informal policy... exists when a plaintiff can prove the existence of a widespread practice that, although not authorized by an ordinance or an express municipal policy, is so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law. To be viable, a plaintiff must do more than point to a single constitutional deprivation, a random act, or an isolated event. Instead, a plaintiff... must show a pattern of similar incidents in order for the factfinder to conclude that the alleged informal policy was so permanent and well settled as to carry the force of law.\n19 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Thus, even if TASC does not have an official 20 policy, liability may be established “by acquiescence in a longstanding practice or custom 21 which constitutes the ‘standard operating procedure’ of the local governmental entity.” Jett 22 v. Dallas Indep Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 737 (1989).\nHere, the FAC alleges both formal and informal policies. Plaintiffs specifically 24 reference the MDPP client contract, which includes a provision stating that program 25 participants may be terminated and referred for prosecution for failure to pay the program 26 fees or failure to test as scheduled. (Doc. 20 139, 140). The FAC also alleges informal test; and (4) the governmental nexus test.” Tsao, 698 F.3d at 1140 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Because neither party argues this point, the Court will not address it further here.\n1 policies or practices: no one at TASC assesses a person’s ability to pay before referring the 2 person back for prosecution because they could not pay for urine tests; no one at MCAO 3 assesses ability to pay before prosecuting people who have failed diversion solely because 4 of their inability to pay; Defendants do not waive the program fee for anyone regardless of 5 financial circumstances; and Defendants contend that they allow for reduced fees for urine 6 screens, but in practice these reductions are almost never granted. (Doc. 20 at 151–154).\nAccordingly, the Court rejects TASC’s argument that Plaintiffs have failed to plead 8 a persistent and widespread custom or practice such that it constitutes a permanent and 9 well-settled entity policy. (Doc. 36 at 8–9). TASC notes that neither Briggs nor Stephens 10 have alleged that they made any statements to TASC regarding their alleged inability to 11 pay; Pascale states that TASC deferred payment for his orientation fee and found him 12 ineligible for a reduction in testing fees; and Collier is the only plaintiff who alleges she 13 told TASC she could not pay and was not invited to apply for a reduction or waiver. TASC 14 contends that these allegations are insufficient to establish a persistent and widespread 15 practice. However, Plaintiffs state that they are not arguing that the indigent are entitled to 16 fee waivers; they are challenging TASC’s policies of requiring program participants to 17 remain on the program longer when they cannot afford to pay the program fee, and the 18 requirement that pay-only participants must also continue to pay for additional urine 19 screenings as long as they do remain on the program. Further, Plaintiffs are seeking to have 20 this matter certified as a class action. While the existence of a persistent and widespread 21 practice, policy, or custom will require discovery for Plaintiffs to prove their claims and to 22 establish a class, at this early stage in the proceedings, the FAC states sufficient allegations 23 to survive a motion to dismiss. See Milke, 2016 WL 5339693 at *18 (“A Monell claim must 24 be based on more than ‘a single constitutional deprivation, a random act, or an isolated 25 event.’ There must be ‘a pattern of similar incidents.’” (quoting Castro v Cty. of Los 26 Angeles, 797 F.3d 654, 671 (9th Cir. 2015)).\nFinally, the Court rejects TASC’s argument that it has no authority to establish 28 policies regarding the development or implementation of the MDPP because deferred 1 prosecution programs are established by the state legislature and the Arizona Prosecuting 2 Attorneys’ Advisory Council (“APAAC”) establishes the program guidelines. (Doc. 36 at 3 8). These issues are discussed further below in the County Defendants’ motion to dismiss, 4 but the Court notes that Plaintiffs do not challenge the establishment of the program 5 generally—Plaintiffs challenge the three specific policies detailed above, and Plaintiffs 6 have pled that none of these policies were set by state law—they were jointly enacted by 7 the CA/MCAO and TASC.4 Accordingly, accepting Plaintiffs’ allegations as true, as the Court must on a motion 9 to dismiss, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a § 1983 claim for entity liability against TASC 10 based on the three challenged policies.\nii. Qualified Immunity TASC alternatively argues that because Plaintiffs cannot bring a claim for entity 13 liability against it, to the extent Plaintiffs assert an individual claim against it, TASC is 14 shielded by qualified immunity. Plaintiffs contend that qualified immunity does not apply 15 because qualified immunity only protects individual employees, not corporate entities like \n16 TASC.\n“Qualified immunity is an immunity from suit.” Trevino v. Gates, 99 F.3d 911, 916 18 (9th Cir. 1996). It “shields government officials from civil damages liability unless the 19 official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time 20 of the challenged conduct.” Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 664 (2012); see also 21 Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009). The Supreme Court has “described the 22 doctrine’s purposes as protecting government’s ability to perform its traditional functions 23 by providing immunity where necessary to preserve the ability of government officials to 24 serve the public good or to ensure that talented candidates were not deterred by the threat 25 of damages suits from entering public service.” Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U.S. 399, 26 407–08 (1997) (internal quotations and citation omitted).\n27 4 TASC further alleges that the CA is the final policymaker for Maricopa County on matters relating to diversion programs, and because the CA acts on behalf of the State, Plaintiffs’ allegations concern State policies. (Doc. 36 at 8). This argument is addressed in section B(i) below.\nHere, TASC relies on the Supreme Court’s decision in Filarsky v. Delia, 566 U.S.\n2 377 (2012) for its argument that qualified immunity extends to non-government employees 3 working in close proximation with public employees. In Filarsky, the Court held that a 4 private attorney temporarily retained by the city was entitled to seek qualified immunity.\n5 566 U.S.\n377. The Court found that “immunity under § 1983 should not vary depending 6 on whether an individual working for the government does so as a full-time employee, or 7 on some other basis[,]” and noted that “[a]ffording immunity not only to public employees 8 but also to others acting on behalf of the government similarly serves to ensure that talented 9 candidates [are] not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.” 10 Id. at 389–90 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The Court also distinguished its 11 prior decision in Richardson, 521 U.S. 399, where it held that guards employed by a 12 privately-run prison facility were not entitled to seek qualified immunity. The Court 13 explained that “Richardson was a self-consciously ‘narrow[ ]’ decision” and “was not 14 meant to foreclose all claims of immunity by private individuals.” Filarsky, 566 U.S. at \n15\n393. Rather, “the particular circumstances of that case—‘a private firm, systematically 16 organized to assume a major lengthy administrative task (managing an institution) with 17 limited direct supervision by the government, undertak[ing] that task for profit and 18 potentially in competition with other firms’—combined sufficiently to mitigate the 19 concerns underlying recognition of governmental immunity under § 1983.” Id. (quoting 20 Richardson, 521 U.S. at 413).\nThe Court finds that this case is more like Richardson than Filarsky. Here, like in 22 Richardson, “the most important special government immunity-producing concern— 23 unwarranted timidity—is less likely present, or at least is not special, when a private 24 company subject to competitive market pressures operates a [deferred prosecution 25 program].” Richardson, 521 U.S. at\n409. “In other words, marketplace pressures provide 26 [TASC] with strong incentives to avoid overly timid, insufficiently vigorous, unduly 27 fearful, or ‘nonarduous’ employee job performance.” Id. at\n410. Further, TASC is a private 28 entity that entered into a contract with Maricopa County to “assume a major lengthy 1 administrative task... with limited direct supervision by the government” and undertook 2 that task for profit and likely in competition with other providers of drug rehabilitation 3 services. See also Halvorsen v. Baird, 146 F.3d 680, 685–86 (9th Cir. 1998) (finding that 4 private firm providing municipality with involuntary commitment services for inebriates 5 was not entitled to qualified immunity under Richardson and noting that whether a firm is 6 for-profit or not-for-profit is immaterial because both compete for municipal contracts and 7 both have incentives to display effective performance). This case is clearly unlike Filarsky, 8 where the Supreme Court found qualified immunity for a private attorney retained by the 9 city for a limited period of time to assist with one aspect of an investigation.5 The Court also notes that Plaintiffs’ claims are against TASC as an entity, not 11 individual TASC employees. The Ninth Circuit has specifically rejected an expansion of 12 Filarsky to include immunity for all service contractors. Gomez v. Campbell-Ewald Co., 13 768 F.3d 871 (9th Cir. 2014), aff’d, 136 S Ct. 663 (2016), as revised (Feb. 9, 2016). In 14 Gomez, the court noted that Filarsky “did not establish any new theory,” and although it 15 provided a broad reading of qualified immunity, it was “applicable only in the context of 16 § 1983 qualified immunity from personal tort liability[,]” and thus was not available for 17 Telephone Consumer Protection Act claims against the defendant company Id. at\n881. The 18 court emphasized that “[w]here immunity lies, an injured party with an otherwise 19 meritorious tort claim is denied compensation, which contravenes the basic tenet that 20 individuals be held accountable for their wrongful conduct. Accordingly, immunity must 21 5 TASC also relies on Filarsky’s reasoning that:\nSometimes, as in this case, private individuals will work in close coordination with public employees, and face threatened legal action for the same conduct... Because government employees will often be protected from suit by some form of immunity, those working alongside them could be left holding the bag—facing full liability for actions taken in conjunction with government employees who enjoy immunity for the same activity.\n566 U.S. at\n391. This is of no moment, however, because Plaintiffs’ claims are against TASC and the County Defendants as entities, not individual employees. And, as discussed further in section B below, the Court finds that the CA acted for the county, not the state, and that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a Monell claim against the county.\n1 be extended with the utmost care.” Id. at 882 (internal quotations and citation omitted).\nThe Court also finds the other cases TASC relies upon distinguishable. In Young v. 3 Cty. of Hawaii, 947 F. Supp.\n4 2014), the court held that a humane society officer qualified for qualified immunity where 5 the humane society was an independent contractor hired by the county to carry out its 6 animal control program. The court noted that “private defendants are not covered by 7 immunity unless ‘firmly rooted tradition’ and ‘special policy concerns involved in suing 8 government officials’ warrant immunity.” Id. (quoting Richardson, 521 U.S. at 404). In 9 Young, the officer was “duly appointed by law to execute search warrants and perform law 10 enforcement functions like those of the police.” Id. at\n1108. Further, special policy 11 concerns supported granting immunity because “[a]nimal control officers, like police 12 officers, should be encouraged to perform their public duties without ‘unwarranted 13 timidity’ that may decrease their effectiveness in responding to public danger.” Id. (quoting 14 Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 814 (1982)). The court also distinguished the special 15 policy concerns at issue in Richardson, noting that there, “the prison performed its task 16 ‘independently, with relatively less ongoing direct state supervision[,]’... [and s]uch 17 freedom allowed the private contractor prison to respond to market pressures to adjust 18 employee behavior.” Id. at\n1109. In contrast, in Young, there was “close government 19 collaboration and supervision that restrict[ed] [the humane society’s] ability to respond as 20 a private firm to market pressures.” Id. Accordingly, the court concluded that the officer 21 was protected by qualified immunity because of the police department’s collaboration with 22 the humane society and its supervision over the humane society’s work. Id.6 In the present case, there is no “firmly rooted tradition” that would support 24 extending qualified immunity to TASC as a private entity operating a diversion program— 25 TASC is not performing a traditional prosecutorial function of determining who to 26 6 Defendants also cite Fabrikant v. French, 691 F.3d 193 (2d Cir. 2012) (court found private animal rescue organization and its employees acted under color of state law and were entitled to qualified immunity) and Herrera v. Santa Fe Pub. Sch., 41 F. Supp.\n1027 (D. N.M. 2014) (court applied qualified immunity to private school security company based on Tenth Circuit precedent), but both are out of circuit cases that are not binding on this Court.\n1 prosecute; it is carrying out the day to day operations of the program. Further, there is no 2 evidence of “close government collaboration and supervision” by the county defendants 3 over TASC’s work. TASC’s main argument in its motion is that none of the three policies 4 that Plaintiffs challenge exist, and if they do, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of the 5 CA. But there is no evidence before the Court at this time suggesting that the CA closely 6 supervises TASC in its day to day operations, such as meeting with program participants, 7 collecting payments, or administering urine screens.\nIn sum, the Court finds that the FAC states claims against TASC as a private entity, 9 not individual TASC employees, making qualified immunity inapplicable here. Further, 10 the principles that supported an extension of qualified immunity in Filarsky and Young are 11 not present here.\niii. Punitive Damages Claim TASC contends that even if Plaintiffs could state a claim against it, the Court should 14 strike the punitive damages claim based on City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 15 U.S. 247 (1981). In Newport, the Supreme Court held that “a municipality is immune from 16 punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” 453 U.S. at\n271. The Court notes that TASC 17 fails to make a meaningful argument on this point and simply cites Newport without any 18 explanation. Plaintiffs maintain that punitive damages are warranted and that Newport is 19 inapplicable to cases of private entity liability.\nBased on TASC’s lack of argument on this issue, and because this case is still in the 21 early stages and discovery may reveal evidence sufficient to warrant a punitive damages 22 award, the Court declines to dismiss Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim at this time. See 23 Arredondo v. Ortiz, 365 F.3d 778, 781 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Normally we decline to address 24 an issue that is simply mentioned but not argued.”).\niv. Failure to State a Claim a. Wealth discrimination TASC argues that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for wealth-based discrimination 28 under the Fourteenth Amendment because the indigent are not a suspect class and wealth 1 is not a fundamental right.\n“The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes procedural 3 constraints on governmental decisions that deprive individuals of liberty or property 4 interests.” Nozzi v Hous\nAuth. of City of Los Angeles, 806 F.3d 1178, 1190 (9th Cir. 2015), 5 as amended on denial of reh’g and reh’g en banc (Jan. 29, 2016). “Thus, the first question 6 in any case in which a violation of procedural due process is alleged is whether the plaintiffs 7 have a protected property or liberty interest and, if so, the extent or scope of that interest.” 8 Id. at 1190–91. “The property interests that due process protects extend beyond tangible 9 property and include anything to which a plaintiff has a ‘legitimate claim of entitlement.’” 10 Id. at 1191 (citation omitted).\n“The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the 12 government from denying equal protection of the laws.” Buffin v. City and Cty. of San 13 Francisco, 2018 WL 424362, 7 (N.D Cal\nJan. 16, 2018). “While Equal Protection is 14 typically used to analyze government actions that draw a distinction among people based 15 on specific characteristics, it is also used if the government discriminates among people as 16 to the exercise of a fundamental right.” Id.\nFinancial need alone does not identify a suspect class for purposes of equal 18 protection analysis. Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 471 (1977) (“In a sense, every denial of 19 welfare to an indigent creates a wealth classification as compared to nonindigents who are 20 able to pay for the desired goods or services.”); see also Rodriguez v. Cook, 169 F.3d 1176, 21 1179 (9th Cir. 1999) (“indigent prisoners are not a suspect class”). Thus, “where wealth is 22 involved, the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal 23 advantages.” San Antonio Indep Sch. Dist v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 24 (1973).\nClaims alleging “categorically worse treatment for the indigent” require a “hybrid 25 analysis of equal protection and due process principles.” Walker v. City of Calhoun, GA, 26 901 F.3d 1245, 1261 (11th Cir. 2018), cert. denied sub nom. Walker v. City of Calhoun, 27 Ga., 139 S Ct. 1446 (2019). In Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 665 (1983), the Supreme 28 Court explained that “[d]ue process and equal protection principles converge in the Court’s 1 analysis in these cases.” Thus, “we generally analyze the fairness of relations between the 2 criminal defendant and the State under the Due Process Clause, while we approach the 3 question of whether the State has invidiously denied one class of defendants a substantial 4 benefit available to another class of defendants under the Equal Protection clause.” Id. In 5 Bearden, the Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in automatically revoking 6 probation when the petitioner could not pay his fine without first determining that the 7 petitioner had not made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay or that there were no adequate 8 alternate forms of punishment. 461 U.S. at\n662. The Court noted that there was substantial 9 similarity between the question of whether considering indigent status in revoking 10 probation violates the Equal Protection Clause and the due process question of whether it 11 is fundamentally unfair or arbitrary for the State to revoke probation when an indigent is 12 unable to pay the fine Id. at 665–66. Thus, the issue cannot be resolved by resort to easy slogans or pigeonhole analysis, but rather requires a careful inquiry into such factors as “the nature of the individual interest affected, the extent to which it is affected, the rationality of the connection between legislative means and purpose, [and] the existence of alternative means for effectuating the purpose..\n17 Id. at 666–67 (quoting Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 260 (1970) (Harlan, J., 18 concurring)); see also MacFarlane v. Walter, 179 F.3d 1131, 1139 (9th Cir. 1999) 19 (“Bearden delineated the factors to be balanced in examining an equal protection claim 20 involving a lack of financial resources and the working of the criminal justice system”), 21 cert. granted, opinion vacated sub nom. Lehman v. MacFarlane, 529 U.S. 1106 (2000).\n22 “Both defendants granted probation and those accepted into preprosecution 23 diversion programs have a ‘conditional liberty’ interest—freedom from imprisonment or 24 freedom from prosecution and the possibility of a criminal record and imprisonment— 25 which may not be revoked in violation of the procedural and substantive requirements of 26 due process.” State v. Jimenez, 111 N.M. 782, 786 (1991) (citing Black v. Romano, 471 27 U.S. 606, 610 (1985)). “Similarly, the different treatment of individuals in the criminal 28 justice system based on ability to pay restitution as a condition of either probation or 1 preprosecution diversion invokes the same concerns for a defendant’s right to equal 2 protection.” Id. (citing Bearden, 461 U.S. at 664). However, while “Bearden requires the 3 sentencing court to consider, before revoking probation for a nonwilful failure to pay a fine 4 or restitution, whether alternatives to imprisonment are adequate to serve the relevant state 5 interests in deterrence and punishment... different considerations apply to termination of 6 a preprosecution diversion agreement.” Id. at\n787. “A defendant accepted into a diversion 7 program has a protected liberty interest in remaining free from prosecution... The relevant 8 alternatives in such a case, therefore, are not alternatives to imprisonment but alternatives 9 to termination from diversion and consequent prosecution.” Id.\nHere, the Plaintiffs “have a ‘conditional liberty’ interest... [in] freedom from 11 prosecution and the possibility of a criminal record and imprisonment.” Jimenez, 111 N.M.\n12 at\n786. And, this interest can be impacted to a great extent: when pay-only participants are 13 required to stay in the program beyond 90 days solely because of inability to pay the 14 program fee, they remain subject to all of the program terms including prohibitions on 15 alcohol use, leaving the county or the state, and taking any prescription medication without 16 reporting it to TASC, plus the required urine screens. (Doc. 20 118). Moreover, 17 participants live in fear of the ultimate consequence of being terminated from the program, 18 referred for felony prosecution, and sentenced to prison. While TASC argues that Plaintiffs 19 have not been absolutely deprived of the ability to complete the program, Plaintiffs have 20 indeed been absolutely deprived of the ability to complete the program in 90 days like 21 other, wealthier participants solely because they are unable to pay the program fee. See 22 Walker, 901 F.3d at 1261–62 (district court was wrong to apply heightened scrutiny 23 because pursuant to Rodriguez and the cases following it, “differential treatment by wealth 24 is impermissible only where it results in a total deprivation of a benefit because of 25 poverty[,]” and under the standing bail order, indigents suffered no absolute deprivation— 26 “they must merely wait some appropriate amount of time to receive the same benefit as the 27 more affluent.”).\nDefendants contend that the program fees are rationally related to a legitimate 1 government interest because the state has an interest in having program participants, rather 2 than taxpayers, fund the program. (Doc. 36 at 12). However, Plaintiffs’ claim is not, as 3 Defendants suggest, that the indigent are automatically entitled to fee waivers, or that the 4 initial fee determination must consider the individual’s financial status. (Doc. 36 at 13); 5 see Rodriguez, 169 F.3d at 1180 (“the Constitution only requires waiver of filing fees in a 6 narrow category of cases where the litigant has a ‘fundamental interest at stake.’” (quoting \n7 M.L.B\nv. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 117 S Ct. 555, 562 (1996))). Rather, Plaintiffs are 8 challenging the three specific policies about how the program fees are enforced against 9 those who cannot afford to pay them. (Doc. 67 at 20). Plaintiffs admit that it would be 10 rational for Defendants to create a payment plan and enforce it with civil debt-collection 11 remedies if needed, but the challenged policy is not just a payment plan, it requires 12 individuals to remain in the program and subject to all of its other terms and conditions.7 13 Id. Plaintiffs do not object to a payment schedule; they object to the onerous conditions 14 and extending the risk of prosecution. (Doc. 87 at 31).\nDefendants further state that additional program interests include rehabilitation, 16 holding the offender accountable, and relieving the burden on the judicial system. (Doc. 36 17 at 10). However, none of these proffered reasons explains why participants who are unable 18 to pay the program fee within 90 days must stay on the program longer and to continue to 19 abide by all of the program rules, rather than being allowed to complete all of the non- 20 monetary program requirements and set up an extended payment plan until the fee is paid 21 off.8 And, as Plaintiffs note, “no rehabilitative or retributive interest is served by 22 terminating people who, but for their poverty, would have successfully completed the 23 program and avoided prosecution.” (Doc. 67 at 21).\n7 At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiffs explained that you have to call TASC every day to see if you are required to report for a urine screen, and you can be tested up to four times a week, with a cost of $15–17 each time. (Doc. 87 at 23). “So actually in a perverse way, just because you’re poor and you couldn’t pay the fees for 90 days, you ultimately have to pay more to complete diversion than somebody who had the money to get off diversion faster.” (Doc. 87 at 23:17-20).\n8 As Plaintiffs’ counsel stated, “[j]ust because of the size of someone’s pocketbook doesn’t change what kind of rehabilitation you need.” (Doc. 87 at 30:2-4).\nWhile the Court is not persuaded that there is a rational connection between the 2 government’s purpose and the means of effectuating that purpose, or that no adequate 3 alternative measures exist, the Court need not make a definitive finding on these issues at 4 this juncture. Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a prima facie case of wealth discrimination 5 based on the policies that subject participants who are unable to pay the program fee to a 6 longer period of time in the MDPP and all of the conditions that come along with it, 7 including the urine screenings and the required fees for those screenings, and the ultimate 8 possibility of being failed from the program and referred for felony prosecution solely 9 because they are unable to pay the fees within 90 days. See Williams, 399 U.S. at 241–42 10 (“[o]nce the State has defined the outer limits of incarceration necessary to satisfy its 11 penological interests and policies, it may not then subject a certain class of convicted 12 defendants to a period of imprisonment beyond the statutory maximum solely by reason of 13 their indigency.”); see also Mueller v. State, 837 N.E.2d 198, 204 (Ind Ct\nApp. 2005) 14 (“Completely foreclosing a benefit that the State offers to defendants... based solely on 15 an inability to pay a fee or fine, violates the Fourteenth Amendment... the argument that 16 the fees help offset the cost of running the pretrial diversion program is not sufficient to 17 establish a rational basis for distinguishing between the indigent and those able to pay the 18 fees.”); Moody v. State, 716 So.2d 562, 565 (Miss. 1998) (citing Bearden and holding that 19 “an indigent’s equal protection rights are violated when all potential defendants are offered 20 one way to avoid prosecution and that one way is to pay a fine, and there is no 21 determination as to an individual’s ability to pay such a fine... The automatic nature of 22 the fine is what makes it discriminating to the poor, in that only the poor will face jail 23 time.”); Jimenez, 111 N.M. at 784 (holding that under Bearden, “the state may terminate a 24 diversion agreement, even if the sole ground is the defendant’s nonwilful failure to make 25 restitution, but only if there are no adequate alternatives to termination which will meet the 26 state’s legitimate penological interests.”).\nFurther, while TASC contends that Plaintiffs’ conclusory allegation of inability to 28 pay is insufficient for an equal protection claim and that Plaintiffs must show that they 1 made all reasonable efforts to pay but were unable to do so through no fault of their own, 2 the Court rejects TASC’s characterization of Plaintiffs’ claims as “conclusory.” Plaintiffs 3 have pled their financial circumstances in sufficient detail9 to support their claim that 4 “because of their impecunity they were completely unable to pay for some desired benefit, 5 and as a consequence, they sustained an absolute deprivation of a meaningful opportunity 6 to enjoy that benefit[]”—the opportunity to complete the program in 90 days like other, 7 wealthier participants and thereby be free of the conditions required for staying on the 8 program as well as the fear of being failed from the program, prosecuted, and jailed. San 9 Antonio Indep Sch. Dist., 411 U.S. at 20; see also Bearden, 461 U.S. at 668 (distinguishing 10 situations where the probationer has willfully refused to pay or has failed to make sufficient 11 bona fide efforts to seek employment or borrow money—such situations “may reflect an 12 insufficient concern for paying the debt” and the state is then “justified in revoking 13 probation and using imprisonment as an appropriate penalty for the offense.”).\nFinally, the Court finds the decision in Walker, 901 F.3d 1245, distinguishable.\n15 There, the Eleventh Circuit considered a standing bail order whereby arrestees were 16 released immediately if they were able to post bail, but arrestees who did not post bail 17 immediately were held for 48 hours until a bail hearing took place. Arrestees who could 18 prove indigency at the hearing were released on a recognizance bond. The court found that 19 the claim was properly analyzed under a hybrid due process and equal protection 20 framework—while the Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, plaintiff challenged 21 “not the amount and conditions of bail per se, but the process by which those terms are set, 22 which [plaintiff] alleges invidiously discriminate against the indigent.” Id. at 1258–60. The 23 court concluded that under the standing bail order, indigents suffered no absolute 24 deprivation—“they must merely wait some appropriate amount of time to receive the same 25 benefit as the more affluent.” Id. at 1261–62. Here, like in Walker, Plaintiffs do not 26 challenge the amount of the program fees per se, but the method of how the fees are 27 collected. But unlike Walker, in the present matter Plaintiffs are not merely waiting “some 28 9 See FAC (Doc. 20 31–36, 215–17, 240–45, 260–62, 271, 307–10, 342–43, 348, 359, 363, 377–81, 407, 409).\n1 appropriate amount of time to receive the same benefit as the more affluent.” The Walker 2 court found that a 48-hour detention period was reasonable for those unable to immediately 3 post bail, but here, Plaintiffs are required to spend double the amount of time or more on 4 diversion simply because they are unable to pay. Extending an individual’s time in the 5 program by several months can hardly be considered appropriate even under the standard 6 of rational basis review.\n“The sine qua non of a Bearden-... style claim... is that the State is treating the 8 indigent and the non-indigent categorically differently. Only someone who can show that 9 the indigent are being treated systematically worse solely because of [their] lack of 10 financial resources,—and not for some legitimate State interest—will be able to make out 11 such a claim.” Walker, 901 F.3d at 1260 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The 12 FAC makes sufficient allegations, if taken as true, to support such a claim.10 See Mueller, 13 837 N.E.2d at 205 (“The concept that our criminal justice system should be operated as far 14 [sic] as reasonably possible without regard to a defendant’s financial resources is axiomatic 15 and beyond dispute. Allowing some defendants and not others to completely avoid 16 prosecution and a potential criminal conviction, based solely on their respective abilities to 17 pay certain fees, violates this fundamental principle.”); San Antonio Indep Sch. Dist., 411 18 U.S. at 88–89 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (“It is, of course, true that the Constitution does not 19 require precise equality in the treatment of all persons.... But this Court has never 20 suggested that because some ‘adequate’ level of benefits is provided to all, discrimination 21 in the provision of services is therefore constitutionally excusable. The Equal Protection 22 Clause is not addressed to the minimal sufficiency but rather to the unjustifiable 10 The parties also dispute whether rational basis review or some form of heightened scrutiny applies to Plaintiffs’ claims. It is clear from this Court’s review of the case law that the Court must apply Bearden’s four factors to Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amendment claims, and that the Bearden framework requires something more than traditional rational basis review. See MacFarlane, 179 F.3d 1141 (explaining that Bearden requires “heightened scrutiny” and that the Bearden factors must also be weighed); Buffin, 2018 WL 424362 at 9 (applying “heightened review” to wealth-based detention challenge); see also San Antonio Indep Sch. Dist., 411 U.S. at 117 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (noting that the Supreme Court “has frequently recognized that discrimination on the basis of wealth may create a classification of a suspect character and thereby call for exacting judicial scrutiny.”).\n1 inequalities of state action. It mandates nothing less than that all persons similarly 2 circumstanced shall be treated alike.” (internal quotations and citation omitted)); see also 3 MacFarlane, 179 F.3d at 1141 (“crucial factor” was that additional incarceration was 4 caused solely by the petitioners’ indigency).\nb. Fourth Amendment TASC argues that Plaintiffs’ claims in Counts Four and Five regarding the urine 7 screenings are solely a Fourteenth Amendment issue, not a Fourth Amendment issue, 8 because Plaintiffs are not challenging the urine tests per se, but the process by which 9 participants are able to complete the tests. (Doc. 36 at 15–16). Plaintiffs contend that they 10 have stated a valid Fourth Amendment claim based on Defendants’ policy that requires 11 pay-only participants (who must remain in the program longer than 90 days) to continue to 12 submit to urine screens. Plaintiffs allege this is a suspicionless search that only applies to 13 the indigent because they are unable to pay the program fee.\n“The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the 15 reasonableness of a search is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which 16 it intrudes upon an individual’s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed 17 for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.” United States v. Knights, 534 U.S.\n18 112, 118–19 (2001) (internal quotations and citation omitted); see also United States v. 19 Scott, 450 F.3d 863, 867 (9th Cir. 2006) (“Under modern Fourth Amendment juris- 20 prudence, whether a search has occurred depends on whether a reasonable expectation of 21 privacy has been violated.”). “Usually, Fourth Amendment reasonableness means that a 22 search or seizure must be supported by probable cause, though pat-downs and similar 23 minor intrusions need only be supported by reasonable suspicion.” Scott, 450 F.3d at 868.\n24 However, the court may “relax these requirements when special needs, beyond the need 25 for normal law enforcement, make an insistence on the otherwise applicable level of 26 suspicion impracticable.” Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted).\nIn Scott, 450 F.3d 863, the court considered whether warrantless searches, including 28 drug testing, imposed as a condition of pretrial release, required a showing of probable 1 cause, despite the defendant’s consent to the search conditions when he signed the pretrial 2 release form. The court noted that “[w]hile government may sometimes condition benefits 3 on waiver of Fourth Amendment rights... its power to do so is not unlimited.” Id. at 867– 4\n68. Thus, “Scott’s consent to any search is only valid if the search in question (taking the 5 fact of consent into account) was reasonable.” Id. at 868; but see Knights, 534 U.S. at 119 6 (“a court granting probation may impose reasonable conditions that deprive the offender 7 of some freedoms enjoyed by law-abiding citizens). The Scott court rejected the 8 government’s argument that the drug tests were justified by special needs: (1) protecting 9 the community from criminal defendants released pending trial, and (2) ensuring the 10 defendants appeared at trial. 450 F.3d at\n869. As to protecting the community, the court 11 found this was the exact opposite of a special need because the government interest in 12 preventing crime by anyone is legitimate and compelling and is a quintessential general 13 law enforcement purpose Id. at\n870. While the court found the second reason—ensuring 14 appearance at trial—more persuasive, the court still found that “the connection between 15 the object of the test (drug use) and the harm to be avoided (non-appearance in court) [was] 16 tenuous.” Id. The court further found that the search was not reasonable under the totality 17 of the circumstances approach: pretrial releasees have greater privacy and liberty interests 18 than probationers, and “the assumption that Scott was more likely to commit crimes than 19 other members of the public, without an individualized determination to that effect, is 20 contradicted by the presumption of innocence[.]” Id. at 872–74; contra Knights, 534 U.S. 21 at 120 (“the very assumption of the institution of probation is that the probationer is more 22 likely than the ordinary citizen to violate the law” (internal quotations and citation 23 omitted)). The court thus concluded that because there was no probable cause to test Scott 24 for drugs, the drug test violated the Fourth Amendment. Scott, 450 F.3d at 874; contra 25 Knights, 534 U.S. 112 (holding that a warrantless search of a probationer’s apartment, 26 supported by reasonable suspicion and that the probationer consented to as a condition of 27 his probation, was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment based on the totality of the 28 circumstances).\nHere, TASC argues that the government’s interests in reducing recidivism, 2 rehabilitation, protecting society, and ensuring that program participants are clean from 3 drugs and alcohol at the time they complete the program outweighs Plaintiffs’ privacy 4 interests. Plaintiffs counter that there is no legitimate government interest because 5 Defendants have determined that the government interests in punishment, deterrence, and 6 recidivism can be met by successfully completing the program in 90 days, and the only 7 reason Plaintiffs were required to stay on the program beyond 90 days and submit to 8 additional urine screenings was due to their inability to pay the program fees. TASC 9 alternatively argues that Plaintiffs’ consent made the searches permissible, but as Plaintiffs 10 note, consent is not the only factor because the Court must also consider whether the 11 consent was voluntary and whether the condition being consented to was constitutional.\n12 See Scott, 450 F.3d at 866 (“The ‘unconstitutional conditions’ doctrine limits the 13 government’s ability to exact waivers of rights as a condition of benefits, even when those 14 benefits are fully discretionary.” (citation omitted)) and 871 (“Scott’s assent to his release 15 conditions does not by itself make an otherwise unreasonable search reasonable.”). The 16 Court finds that these are issues of factual dispute that cannot be resolved at this time.\n17 Plaintiffs have adequately pled a claim under the Fourth Amendment sufficient to survive 18 Defendants’ motion to dismiss. Discovery will reveal evidence that will enable the finder 19 of fact to determine whether the government’s interest does outweigh the Plaintiffs’ 20 privacy interests, whether the special needs exception applies, and whether Plaintiffs’ 21 consent to the urine screens as part of the MDPP’s terms made the searches permissible.\nc. Statute of limitations TASC argues that Plaintiff Briggs’ claims are barred for the reasons set forth in the 24 County Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Court will address this argument in Section 25 B(iii) below.\nv. Rule 8 Finally, TASC argues that if the Court does not dismiss Plaintiffs’ claim(s) pursuant 28 to Rule 12(b)(6), Plaintiffs should be required to amend and streamline their complaint to 1 comply with Rule 8(a) and (d)(1). TASC contends that the 480-paragraph, 53-page 2 complaint is “verbose, confusing, contains numerous irrelevant facts... citations to news 3 articles... and references to an unrelated contract” and that “it is unclear which allegations 4 in the FAC Plaintiffs deem relevant to their claims because each alleged cause of action 5 simply contains conclusory allegations of violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights...” 6 (Doc. 36 at 20–21). Plaintiffs contend that they have explained the challenged policies in 7 detail (Doc. 20 120–34, 135–52), that each count specifies the challenged policy that 8 harmed the plaintiff and what relief is sought (Id. at 445–80), and that the information 9 Defendants challenge provides background on the policies (Id. at 56–61), offers sources 10 for allegations (Id. at n.3–6), and explains the relationship between MCAO and TASC (Id.\n11 at 175–177).\nA complaint must contain a “short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s 13 jurisdiction,” a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled 14 to relief,” and “a demand for the relief sought...” Fed R. Civ P. 8(a); Johnson v. City of 15 Shelby, Miss., 574 U.S. 10, 135 S Ct. 346, 346 (2014) (“Federal pleading rules call for ‘a 16 short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,’...\n17 they do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal 18 theory supporting the claim asserted.”); McHenry v. Renne, 84 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.\n19 1996) (the complaint must set forth “who is being sued, for what relief, under what theory, 20 with enough detail to guide discovery”). “[A] dismissal for a violation under Rule 8(a)(2), 21 is usually confined to instances in which the complaint is so verbose, confused and 22 redundant that its true substance, if any, is well disguised.” Hearns v. San Bernardino 23 Police Dep’t, 530 F.3d 1124, 1131 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotations and citations 24 omitted).\nThe Court declines to require Plaintiffs to amend their complaint. While the FAC is 26 lengthy and includes some extraneous background information that is not material to the 27 claims for relief, the Court will allow this action to proceed forward on the FAC. See 28 Hearns, 530 F.3d at 1127 (district court abused its discretion by dismissing FAC with 1 prejudice solely because of its length; “although each [complaint] set forth excessively 2 detailed factual allegations, they were coherent, well-organized, and stated legally viable 3 claims”); contra McHenry v. Renne, 84 F.3d 1172, 1177–78 (9th Cir. 1996) (affirming 4 district court’s dismissal of complaint with prejudice where complaint was “argumentative, 5 prolix, replete with redundancy, and largely irrelevant,” consisted “largely of immaterial 6 background information,” and “Despite all the pages, requiring a great deal of time for 7 perusal, one cannot determine from the complaint who is being sued, for what relief, and 8 on what theory, with enough detail to guide discovery.”); Nevijel v N. Coast Life Ins. Co., 9 651 F.2d 671, 674 (9th Cir. 1981) (affirming district court’s dismissal where complaint 10 was “verbose, confusing and conclusory”). Here, despite its length, “[t]he [FAC] is 11 logically organized, divided into a description of the parties, a chronological factual 12 background, and a presentation of enumerated legal claims, each of which lists the liable 13 Defendants and legal basis therefor.” Hearns, 530 F.3d at\n1132. While it does contain some 14 “excessive detail”, the FAC is “intelligible and clearly delineate[s] the claims and the 15 Defendants against whom the claims are made.” Id.\nFurther, the Court’s Notice to the Parties of the MIDP project and General Order 17 17-08 states that the parties are required to provide “information as to facts that are relevant 18 to the claims and defenses in the case,” and also allows a party to limit its response as long 19 as the party explains the basis of the objection. (Doc. 5 at 4). General Order 17-08 also 20 specifies exactly what information must be provided in the mandatory initial discovery 21 requests, including documents “that you believe may be relevant to any party’s claims or 22 defenses,” and requires the parties to state the relevant facts and legal theories supporting 23 their claims and defenses Id. at 7–8. Given these provisions, it should be clear to all parties 24 what information must be disclosed, and exchanging MIDP responses will help clarify the 25 facts and legal theories supporting each party’s claims and defenses, to the extent that those 26 may be unclear.\nB. Defendants Maricopa County and Maricopa County Attorney William Montgomery’s Motion to Dismiss i. Monell Claims Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs’ § 1983 Monell claims fail because the County 5 Attorney acts on behalf of the State, not the County, when he establishes and implements 6 the MDPP. (Doc. 34 at 12). Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims against Maricopa 7 County and the CA in his official capacity11 fail as a matter of law and must be dismissed 8 with prejudice Id. at 13.\n“To hold a local government liable for an official’s conduct, a plaintiff must first 10 establish that the official (1) had final policymaking authority ‘concerning the action 11 alleged to have caused the particular constitutional or statutory violation at issue’ and (2) 12 was the policymaker for the local governing body for the purposes of the particular act.” 13 Weiner v. San Diego Cty., 210 F.3d 1025, 1028 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting McMillian v. 14 Monroe Cty., Ala., 520 U.S. 781, 785 (1997)).\na. Whether the CA acts for the state or the local government “‘Ordinarily, an official designated as an official of a county... is a county official 17 for all purposes.’” Platt, 2018 WL 2058136, at *17 (quoting Ceballos, 361 F.3d at 1182).\n18 “Under Arizona law, a county attorney is an officer of the county.” Id. (citing Ariz\nRev. 19 Stat. § 11-401). “However, some county officials may serve the county and the state.” Id.\n20 “In this situation, the court determines whether the officer is a state or county official by 21 reviewing state law to determine whether the officer’s alleged actions fit within the range 22 of his state or county functions.” Id.12 23 11 “[O]fficial-capacity suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent[.]” Monell, 436 U.S. at 601 n.55; see also McMillian, 520 U.S. at 785 n.2 (“a suit against a governmental officer in his official capacity is the same as a suit against [the] entity of which [the] officer is an agent” and “victory in such an official-capacity suit imposes liability on the entity that [the officer] represents” (internal quotations and citations omitted)). 12 In Platt, the court found that the defendant acted for the state when he pursued uncontested forfeiture of plaintiff’s car, and therefore the county was not liable under Monell for the officer’s actions. The court based this conclusion on Arizona statutes:\nA.R.S.\n§ 11-532 (county attorneys conduct prosecutions on behalf of the state); § 14-4301(1) (“attorney for the state” is defined as “an attorney designated by... a county attorney...\nto investigate, commence, and prosecute” a forfeiture action); and § 13-4309 (attorney for In McMillian, the parties agreed that the sheriff had final policy making authority 2 in the area of law enforcement, but disputed whether the sheriff was a policymaker for the 3 county or for the state when acting in a law enforcement capacity. 520 U.S. at\n785. The 4 Court explained that this inquiry is guided by two principles: First, the question is not 5 whether the official acted for the state or the county “in some categorical, ‘all or nothing’ 6 manner[; o]ur cases... instruct us to ask whether government officials are the final 7 policymakers for the local government in a particular area, or on a particular issue.” Id.\n8 “Second, our inquiry is dependent on an analysis of state law.” Id. at 786.\nThus, in the present matter, “Maricopa County’s liability on [Plaintiffs’ claims] 10 turns on whether the Maricopa County Attorney was acting ‘as a policymaker for the state 11 or for the county’ when engaging in the culpable action or inaction.” Milke, 2016 WL 12 5339693 at *16 (quoting Goldstein v. City of Long Beach, 715 F.3d 750, 753 (9th Cir.\n13 2013)); see also Platt, 2018 WL 2058136, at *17. “‘This determination is made on a 14 function-by-function approach by analyzing under state law the organizational structure 15 and control over the district attorney.’” Id. (quoting Goldstein, 715 F.3d at 753). “The 16 precise level of control, however, is not dispositive as the determination turns on whether 17 the county attorney ‘was acting on behalf of the state or the county’ when setting the 18 harmful policy.” Id. (quoting Goldstein, 715 F.3d at 755).\nThe parties vigorously dispute whether the CA was acting on behalf of the state or 20 the county for purposes of the challenged policies. The District of Arizona’s decision in 21 Milke is instructive:\nBoth the Arizona Constitution and Arizona statute describe county attorneys as county officers Ariz. Const art. XII, § 3;\nA.R.S. § 11-401. County attorneys are elected by the voters of each county and county attorneys must reside in the county where they are elected Ariz. Const art. XII, § 3;\nA.R.S. § 11-\n404. County attorneys’ salaries are fixed by the county boards of supervisors Ariz\nConst. art XII, §\n4. And the boards of supervisors are responsible for “[s]upervising] the official conduct” of county attorneys. A.R.S. § 11-251. These “structural provisions provide a helpful starting point” indicating county attorneys are local officials but these provisions are not enough on their own. Goldstein, 715 F.3d at the state may make uncontested forfeiture proceedings available).\n755. The Court must also conduct a “functional inquiry” regarding actual job duties and identify who exercises control over county attorneys. Id.\nIn Arizona, a county attorney is responsible for the appointment of “deputies, stenographers, clerks and assistants necessary to conduct the affairs of” the county attorney’s office. A.R.S. § 11-409. The county board of supervisors must approve all appointments and the board sets the appointees’ salaries Id. As for fiscal matters, a county attorney must “[d]eliver receipts” to the board of supervisors “for monies or property received in the county attorney’s official capacity.” A.R.S. 11-532. A county attorney also acts as a “legal advisor to the board of supervisors” as well as the attorney for school districts and the community college district Id. Arizona counties also have a policy of indemnifying county officers and employees. (Doc. 46 at 20). In terms of prosecutions, a county attorney must “[a]ttend the superior and other courts within the county and conduct, on behalf of the state, all prosecutions for public offenses.” A.R.S. § 11-532 (emphasis added). Thus, in most situations a county attorney appears to be acting as a local official, reporting to a local board of supervisors and subject to control by the local board of supervisors. A county attorney is, however, explicitly identified as acting on behalf of the state when prosecuting crimes.\nA county attorney is also subject to a limited degree of control by the Arizona Attorney General. The Arizona Attorney General serves as the “chief legal officer of the state” and has “charge of and direct[s] the department of law.” A.R.S. § 41-\n192. The “department of law” is “composed of the attorney general and the subdivisions of the department” created by law.\nA.R.S. § 41-193. The department of law is responsible for prosecuting and defending “in the supreme court all proceedings in which the state or an officer thereof in his official capacity is a party.” Id. In addition, “[a]t the direction of the governor, or when deemed necessary by the attorney general,” the department of law must “prosecute and defend any proceeding in a state court other than the supreme court in which the state or an officer thereof is a party or has an interest.” Id. While the department of law “[e]xercise[s] supervisory powers over county attorneys of the several counties in matters pertaining to that office,” the Attorney General can only “require reports [from county attorneys] relating to the public business” of their offices Id. In other words, neither the Attorney General nor the department of law has day-to-day control over the operation of county attorneys’ offices.\n26 Milke, 2016 WL 5339693 at *16–17; see also Puente Arizona, 2016 WL 6873294 at *24 27 (noting Arizona law provisions indicating generally that CA is an officer of the county, but 28 that Ariz Rev\nStat. § 11-532 “provides a clear answer” that CA conducts prosecutions on 1 behalf of the state). In Milke the District of Arizona further noted that, Viewed as a whole, the foregoing situation is very similar to that presented under California law as explored in Goldstein v. City of Long Beach, 715 F.3d 750 (9th Cir. 2013). In California, the Attorney General has “direct supervision over every district attorney” but that was deemed evidence of only a “limited” amount of control Id. at\n756. The California Attorney General is “limited to requiring a district attorney to make reports,” which is “far short of a power to dictate policy to district attorneys statewide.” Id. In addition, the California “Attorney General is not given the power to force a district attorney to act or adopt a particular policy, but instead may step in and prosecute any violations of law himself or herself.” Id.\nat\n757. Finally, California law requires counties, not the state, “defend and indemnify the district attorney in an action for damages.” Id. at\n758. Based on all of these provisions, the Ninth Circuit concluded a California “district attorney acts on behalf of the state when conducting prosecutions,” but a district attorney “represents the county when establishing administrative policies and training related to the general operation of the district attorney’s office.” Id. at 759-60.\n13 Milke, 2016 WL 5339693 at *17. Thus, in Milke we concluded that “[b]ased on the 14 substance of Arizona law, and the similarities between the situation in Arizona and 15 California, the Maricopa County Attorney is a local policymaker when it comes to 16 administrative policies such as direct supervision of other prosecutors and official 17 policies.” Id. Therefore, “[b]ecause Milke’s Monell claim [was] based on such 18 administrative policies... the Maricopa County Attorney can be sued in his capacity as a 19 local policymaker for Maricopa County.” Id.\nHere, Defendants argue that under Arizona law, the CA acts for the state when he 21 prosecutes offenders for felony possession of marijuana, and that state laws authorizing the 22 establishment and implementation of the MDPP depend upon the CA’s role as a prosecutor 23 for the state. (Doc. 34 at 13–14). Specifically, the CA decides whether (a) there will be a 24 MDPP, (b) an offender is eligible for the MDPP program, (c) an offender is offered 25 participation in the MDPP, and (d) an offender has completed or failed the program Id. at \n26\n14. Defendants contend that “[b]ecause these prosecutorial decisions and actions effectuate 27 the disposition of justiciable criminal charges per § 13-3405 against eligible offenders, they 28 fall entirely within the prosecutorial function of the County Attorney.” (Doc. 34 at 14).\nWhile there is no doubt that the CA acts for the state when conducting prosecutions, 2 it does not follow that the CA also acts for the state when he exercises his policymaking 3 authority to establish and implement deferred prosecution programs, or when he set the 4 specific policies at issue in this suit.13 The difference turns on whether the CA is performing 5 a prosecutorial function or an administrative function. As the court noted in Goldstein, 6 “[t]here can be a ‘meaningful analytical distinction’ between policies and training relating 7 to prosecutorial functions and an index made and maintained as an administrative matter.” 8 715 F.3d at 762 (challenge focused on failure to create index of informants, their reliability, 9 and benefits provided to them, and failure to train prosecutors to use index). Here, like in 10 Goldstein, “the local administrative policies challenged by [Plaintiffs] are distinct from the 11 prosecutorial act” and “[t]he conduct at issue... does not involve prosecutorial strategy, 12 but rather administrative oversight of systems used to help prosecutors comply with their 13 constitutional duties.” 715 F.3d at 759,\n762. Stated another way, the issue in this suit is not 14 the CA’s decision whether to prosecute an individual for possession of marijuana or refer 15 him or her to the MDPP, but his role in establishing and implementing the MDPP and its 16 allegedly discriminatory policies. As the court noted in Goldstein, “several circuits have 17 come to the same conclusion that we reach here, that district attorneys act as county officers 18 when deciding administrative policy and procedures related to training or supervision, even 19 though they act as state officers when conducting prosecutions.” 715 F.3d at 765 20 (Reinhardt, J., concurring) (collecting cases); see also Weiner, 210 F.3d at 1031 (finding 21 that under California law, district attorney acts for the state when deciding whether to 22 prosecute, but also noting that district attorney is not a state officer for all purposes); Del 23 Campo v. Kennedy, 491 F. Supp.\n24 prosecutor encompasses all actions in relation to preparing to prosecute, prosecuting crimes 25 and establishing policy and training employees in this area.” (internal quotations and 26 citation omitted)).\n27 13 While A.R.S. § 11-365 states that the CA has sole discretion to decide whether to divert or defer prosecution of an offender, which arguably implicates the CA’s role as a prosecutor for the state, this case is not about a prosecutorial discretion function.\nIn Del Campo, the court concluded that the district attorney acted as a local 2 policymaker when contracting with a private organization to administrate a bad check 3 writers diversion program. The court looked to the diversion program statutes and noted 4 several important factors in reaching this conclusion: Under California law, the decision to 5 implement diversion programs is left “to the county board of supervisors, conditioned on 6 the approval of the district attorney, in order to meet the individual needs of each county.” 7 491 F. Supp.\n8 implementation on the district attorney’s approval was to allow the district attorney to 9 retain discretionary power over eligibility requirements, not to couch the entire program 10 within the district attorney’s prosecutorial power.” Id. at\n900. Thus, “[t]he history of the 11 statutory scheme leads the Court to conclude that the legislature had no intention of 12 implementing a state-wide diversion program. Instead, the legislature reinforced the local 13 aspect of the diversion program...” Id. The court found that the district attorney’s 14 decisions to contract with a private entity, structure the distribution of work, and run the 15 program were “purely administrative decisions that have no connection to the District 16 Attorney’s role as a prosecutor.” Id. Thus, the alleged factual basis for the lawsuit was not 17 connected to the district attorney’s prosecutorial function. Id.\nHere, like in Del Campo, the decision whether to implement a diversion program is 19 left to the local county. See A.R.S. § 11-361 (A “deferred prosecution program” is defined 20 as “a special supervision program in which the county attorney of a participating county 21 may divert or defer, before a guilty plea or a trial, the prosecution of a person who is 22 accused of committing a crime...” (emphasis added));\nA.R.S. § 11-362(A) (The program 23 “shall be administered by the county attorney of each participating county according to the 24 guidelines established by the Arizona prosecuting attorneys’ advisory council.” (emphasis 25 added)); see also A.R.S. § 11-363 (allowing counties, in their discretion, to establish a 26 county attorney deferred prosecution fund). Had the Arizona legislature wanted to 27 implement a state-wide program, it certainly could have, but it did not. Further, also like 28 Del Campo, the decisions at issue here—the CA’s decision to contract with a private entity 1 (TASC), structure the distribution of work, and run the program, including setting and 2 enforcing its policies—are all “purely administrative decisions that have no connection” 3 with the CA’s role as a prosecutor.14 Defendants also argue that “[b]y requiring county attorneys to follow the APAAC 5 Deferred Prosecution Guidelines, the Legislature intended to impose statewide minimum 6 standards for ‘the conduct of any deferred prosecution program as defined by A.R.S. § 11- 7 361 within the State of Arizona.’” (Doc. 34 at 14). However, the state does not actually 8 supervise deferred prosecution programs or the county attorneys’ administration of those 9 programs. While the CA is required to provide reports on the MDPP to the Arizona 10 legislature, see A.R.S. § 11-362(B), here, as the courts noted in Milke and Goldstein, this 11 reporting requirement merely reflects a general state oversight, not actual state control or 12 supervision of the day-to-day operations of the CA’s office or the MDPP.15 And, as 13 Plaintiffs note, the APAAC guidelines only provide suggestions about the program’s 14 content; “a merely advisory set of guidelines and an obligation to report to the state what 15 the county decides to do in its discretion do not covert county policy into state policy.” 16 (Doc. 45 at 5–6; 14).16 All of this shows that it is within each county’s discretion whether to establish a 18 deferred prosecution program. And while the CA must maintain records and submit reports 19 14 The cases Defendants rely on to compel the opposite conclusion are out of circuit decisions not binding on this Court. See Davis v. Grusemeyer, 996 F.2d 617, 629 (3d Cir. 1993) (finding oversight of bad check restitution program “is by definition intimately related to [DA’s] prosecutorial powers, as it concerns who the district attorney will and will not bring criminal charges against.”); Shouse v. Nat’l Corrective Grp., Inc., 2010 WL 4942222, at *6 (M.D Pa\nNov. 30, 2010) (court noted that the Third Circuit uses a “functional approach” to determine whether a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity for conduct associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process, or qualified immunity for the prosecutor’s administrative or investigative roles; but court did not undertake the kind of detailed analysis required by the Ninth Circuit in examining state statutes to determine the state or local nature of the precise function at issue).\n15 For example, the APAAC guidelines section entitled “Mandated Reporting” states that each county attorney operating a program will maintain statistics on the number of enrollees, number of persons who successfully complete the program, and number of persons who were enrolled and who were subsequently convicted of a felony, and provide this information to APAAC each year. 16 For example, the guidelines state that they are intended to provide minimum standards and that they do not prevent individual prosecutors from adding provisions. Section B is entitled “Suggested Program Content” and notes that every effort should be made to include the suggested components, within the discretion of the prosecutor.\n1 to the state, and follow APAAC guidelines in establishing a program, there is no direct 2 state involvement in establishing, administering, or otherwise operating a deferred 3 prosecution program. To the contrary, the statutes specifically state that only on request of 4 the CA, APAAC may provide technical assistance to develop or refine the program. A.R.S.\n5 § 11-362(C). Taken all together, the statutes show an intent by the state legislature that 6 deferred prosecution programs are local programs, that it is up to each county/CA to 7 determine whether to have such a program and how the program will be established and 8 administered, and that the state has only general oversight over the programs of the counties 9 that decide to participate. In sum, the Court rejects the County Defendants’ argument that 10 Plaintiffs’ claims are predicated upon the CA’s function as a prosecutor on behalf of the 11 state. The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims are specific to the CA’s administrative role, 12 acting on behalf of Maricopa County, in developing, implementing, authorizing, or 13 otherwise adopting the three policies that Plaintiffs challenge. Plaintiffs’ damages claims 14 are not based on the CA’s decision to refer individuals to the MDPP, or on his decision to 15 prosecute participants who are terminated from the MDPP. Thus, the Court concludes that 16 that CA acts as a local policymaker for purposes of the challenged conduct in this suit.\nb. Policymaking authority As explained above, pursuant to § 1983 and Monell, “a local government may be 19 liable for constitutional torts committed by its officials according to municipal policy, 20 practice, or custom.” Weiner, 210 F.3d at\n1028. “‘[A] policy is a deliberate choice to follow 21 a course of action... made from among various alternatives by the official or officials 22 responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.’” 23 Puente Arizona, 2016 WL 6873294 at *23 (quoting Chew v. Gates, 27 F.3d 1432, 1444 24 (9th Cir. 1994)). “These policies may be set by the government’s lawmakers, ‘or by those 25 whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.’” McMillian, 520 U.S.\n26 at 784–85 (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 694).\nHere, Defendants appear to argue that Maricopa County lacks policymaking 28 authority concerning the MDPP: “the FAC does not allege any specific facts showing that 1 the County engaged in any decision-making or actions to establish, administer, control, 2 fund, or supervise the MDPP or the decisions and actions of the County Attorney and his 3 prosecutors. Thus, the FAC lacks any allegations that the County Attorney’s policies, 4 practices, and customs undertaken in connection with the MDPP are subject to § 1983 5 Monell liability. Instead, the FAC’s allegations point only to decisions and actions 6 undertaken by the County Attorney and his prosecutors in their capacity as prosecutors on 7 behalf of the State.” (Doc. 34 at 17).17 The Court rejects this argument. As explained above, 8 the Court finds that the CA acts for the county, not the state, in administering the MDPP 9 program. Second, the FAC names the CA as a defendant in his official capacity, which is 10 in essence a suit against the County. Plaintiffs allege that the CA acts on behalf of and is 11 the final policymaker for the County with respect to the MDPP, (Doc. 20 at 45, n.7), and 12 Defendants admit that the CA is the MDPP’s relevant policymaker (Doc. 34 at 13).\n13 Plaintiffs further allege that the County is liable for the CA’s administration of the program 14 and of TASC’s administration and supervision of participants in the program. (Doc. 20 15 46; Doc. 45 at 9).18 16 17 Defendants’ argument in their motion is not so much about policymaking authority of the County or the CA, but that the board of supervisors has not taken any action regarding the MDPP. (Doc. 34 at 17). Defendants cite A.R.S. § 11-201(A) for the proposition that the powers of the county may only be exercised by the board of supervisors. However, the full sentence of the statute specifically states that “[t]he powers of a county shall be exercised only by the board of supervisors or by agents and officers acting under its authority and authority of law.” (emphasis added). The CA is clearly an agent or officer of the county. See A.R.S. § 11-532 (the county attorney is the public prosecutor of the county). 18 Plaintiffs further state that the evidence they have gathered thus far suggests that Maricopa County has delegated its policymaking authority for the MDPP to the CA, and either directly or through the CA, to TASC as well. (Doc. 45 at 9 n.9).\nAs to Plaintiffs’ argument that the County is liable for TASC’s administration and supervision of MDPP participants, Plaintiffs state that the Court need not reach the issue if it determines that Maricopa County is liable for the CA’s unlawful administration of the program. (Doc. 45 at 21–22); see Lemmons v Cty. of Sonoma, 2018 WL 452108, *3 (N.D.\nCal Jan. 17, 2018) (“By ceding control and final decision making to [private entity] as it relates to providing adequate healthcare to prisoners, [private entity’s] policies effectively become the policies of Sonoma County” and county can be liable for constitutional injuries); Ancata v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 705 n.9 (11th Cir. 1985) (county was liable for any constitutional deprivations caused by policies or customs of private entity that county contracted with to provide medical services in county jail; “where a governmental entity delegates the final authority to make decisions then those decisions necessarily represent official policy.”); Herrera v Cty. of Santa Fe, 213 F. Supp.\n1292 (D. N.M. July 18, 2002) (where county contracted with private company to manage and operate detention center, county delegated final policy-making authority to private entity and any custom or policy of entity with respect to operation of detention center The Court also looks to the January 27, 2009 Memorandum of Understanding 2 Between Maricopa County Attorney and TASC (“MOU”) to guide its analysis on this 3 issue. The MOU appears to use the terms “county attorney” and “MCAO” interchangeably.\n4 While the document is entitled MOU between “Maricopa County Attorney” and is signed 5 by former CA Andrew Thomas, the first line of the document states that “The Maricopa 6 County Attorney’s Office (“MCAO”), and TASC, Inc., (“TASC”) entered into a 7 Memorandum of Understanding effective 16 April 1990 to clarify and set forth initial 8 guidelines for the implementation of the Maricopa County Attorney/TASC Adult Deferred 9 Prosecution Program (“ADPP”) for first time felony drug offenders.” The very next line 10 states that “MCAO and TASC agree that the 1990 MoU should be replaced with this 11 Memorandum of Understanding... to reflect the current understanding and practice[.]” 12 The remainder of the document refers to the CA, the County Attorney’s Office, and the 13 MCAO. While Defendants offer this document as evidence of Maricopa County’s lack of 14 involvement in the MDPP, this is a distinction without a difference. For all intents and 15 purposes, Maricopa County and the MCAO are essentially the same thing when it comes 16 to entity liability, as is a claim against the CA in his official capacity.19 Further, the substance of the MOU makes clear that the CA/MCAO worked jointly 18 with TASC to “create a structured program” and “hold the offender accountable.” The 19 MOU states, among other terms, that “TASC’s operation of the ADPP has successfully constitutes a policy of the county for purposes of § 1983 liability). Here, Plaintiffs argue that the County is responsible for establishing the MDPP and has authorized TASC to design and run the day-to-day operations of the program; the County is therefore liable for any custom or policy established by TASC in the course of that operation. (Doc. 45 at 22). Plaintiffs state that “[d]iscovery will allow Plaintiffs and this Court to determine which policies the County is responsible for based on its delegation of policymaking authority to Montgomery and TASC and/or its acquiescence in their unconstitutional practices.” (Doc. 45 at 23) (footnote omitted). The Court agrees. While Plaintiffs make a number of allegations in the FAC, as the pleadings make clear, this case involves many disputed issues of fact that the Court cannot resolve at this juncture and that require discovery. 19 This is made clear in the Behavior Specific Adult Diversion Program Contract that Plaintiffs attach to their Response. Although not the contract governing the MDPP, Plaintiffs offer this as evidence of what they believe may be a similar contract existing that does govern the MDPP. The behavior contract states that it is entered into and between “Maricopa County (“County”), a political subdivision of the State of Arizona, through the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office (“MCAO”), and TASC[.]” 1 implemented the County Attorney’s objectives”; that “TASC through the County Attorney 2 Submittal Form (“submittal”) will report to MCAO the status of each offender’s 3 participation and/or compliance with ADPP requirements”; “The County Attorney will 4 receive a submittal from TASC documenting the successful completion”; “Documentation 5 of all areas of non-compliance will be sent to the County Attorney’s Office”; 6 “Documentation of all program failures will be sent to the County Attorney”; “TASC 7 agrees to provide MCAO with a report showing program success rates”; and “TASC will 8 arrange a payment plan with the defendant and collect payments on behalf of MCAO...\n9 TASC will send the County Attorney a list of those defendants who have paid along with 10 a check for the collected amount.” In sum, based on the pleadings and this Court’s reading of the MOU, the Court finds 12 that the FAC has adequately pled policymaking authority by the county sufficient to 13 survive the motion to dismiss.\nii. Eleventh Amendment Sovereign Immunity Defendants next argue that because the CA acts on behalf of the State in establishing 16 and implementing the MDPP, Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity bars Plaintiffs 17 from recovering damages against the State or a State official in his official capacity. (Doc.\n18 34 at 19).\nBecause the Court finds that the CA acts on behalf of the county in establishing and 20 implementing the MDPP and the specific policies at issue in this suit, this argument is 21 moot. See Eason v. Clark Cty Sch. Dist., 303 F.3d 1137, 1141 (9th Cir. 2002) (“the 22 Eleventh Amendment does not extend to counties and municipal corporations”); Del 23 Campo v. Kennedy, 491 F.Supp.2d 891 (N.D Cal\nDec. 5, 2006) (district attorney acts as 24 county policymaker in implementing certain aspects of misdemeanor diversion program 25 for bad check writers and thus is not a state actor entitled to Eleventh Amendment 26 immunity).\niii. Statute of Limitations Finally, Defendants argue that Arizona’s two-year statute of limitations bars 1 Plaintiff Briggs’ claims. (Doc. 34 at 23).\n“The defendant... bears the burden of proof as to each element of a statute of 3 limitations based affirmative defense.” Lopez v. Bans, 2016 WL 6821860, *3 (E.D. Cal.\n4 Nov. 18, 2016). The Court may dismiss a claim as untimely under Rule 12(b)(6) “when the 5 running of the statute of limitations is apparent on the face of the complaint.” Id. (internal 6 quotations and citation omitted).\n“Actions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 are governed by the forum state’s 8 statute of limitations for personal injury actions.” Knox v. Davis, 260 F.3d 1009, 1012 (9th 9 Cir. 2001). “In Arizona, the courts apply a two-year statute of limitations to § 1983 claims.” 10 TwoRivers v. Lewis, 174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir. 1999). “‘Although state law determines 11 the length of the limitations period, federal law determines when a civil rights claim 12 accrues.’” Knox, 260 F.3d at 1013 (quoting Morales v. City of Los Angeles, 214 F.3d 1151, 13 1153–54 (9th Cir. 2000)). “Under federal law, a claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or 14 has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.” TwoRivers, 174 F.3d at \n15\n991. “Once a claim accrues, the limitations period begins to run, and any suits filed outside 16 the limitations period will be time barred.” Lopez, 2016 WL 6821860 at *3.\n“The continuing violations doctrine extends the accrual of a claim if a continuing 18 system of discrimination violates an individual’s rights up to a point in time that falls within 19 the applicable limitations period.” Douglas v Cal\nDept. of Youth Authority, 271 F.3d 812, 20 822 (9th Cir. 2001). In Gutowsky v. County of Placer, 108 F.3d 256, 259 (9th Cir. 1997), 21 the court held that the continuing violations theory applies to § 1983 actions. The court 22 noted that a Monell § 1983 municipal liability claim must allege “‘execution of a 23 government’s policy or custom... [that] inflicts the injury.’” Id. (quoting Monell, 436 U.S.\n24 at 694). Thus, “[i]f the continuing violations doctrine were inapplicable to Monell actions, 25 it is difficult to ascertain exactly when such claims would accrue[.]” Id.\n[There are] two methods by which a plaintiff may establish a continuing violation. First, the plaintiff may show a serial violation by pointing to a series of related acts against one individual, of which at least one falls within the relevant period of limitations... Second, a plaintiff may show a systematic policy or practice of discrimination that operated, in part, within the limitations period—a systematic violation.\n2 Douglas, 271 F.3d at 822 (internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Gutowsky, 3 108 F.3d at 259 (“a continuing violation may be established through a series of related acts 4 against one individual, or by a systematic policy or practice of discrimination”; court found 5 plaintiff’s “papers were replete with evidence of an ongoing practice and policy that denied 6 [employment advancement] opportunity to women”). Further, for a systemic violation 7 claim, “if both discrimination and injury are ongoing, the limitations clock does not begin 8 to tick until the invidious conduct ends.” Douglas, 271 F.3d at 822 (quotations and citation 9 omitted). “However,... a mere continuing impact from past violations is not actionable.” 10 Knox, 260 F.3d at 1013 (internal quotations and citations omitted) (finding continuing 11 violation theory did not apply where plaintiff received permanent and complete suspension 12 letter withdrawing her legal mail and visitation privileges; plaintiff failed to establish that 13 a new violation occurred each time she was denied visitation or mail privileges, and 14 subsequent denials were merely continuing effect of original suspension); see also Shannon 15 v. Babb, 103 F. App’x 201 (9th Cir. 2004); Poole v. City of Los Angeles, 41 F. App’x 60 16 (9th Cir. 2002).\n17 Plaintiffs filed their original complaint on August 23,\n2018. (Doc. 1). Briggs took 18 his final urine test on August 23, 2016 and completed the program on August 25, 2016.\n19 (Doc. 45 at 25).\n20 Defendants argue that Briggs’ “latest plausible accrual date is August 8, 2016, when 21 Briggs knew or had reason to know of his injury stemming from his inability to pay at the 22 time of his first of fifteen urinalysis tests occurring beyond the initial 90 days of the 23 program.” (Doc. 34 at 23–24) (citation omitted). Thus, Defendants conclude that, 24 “[w]orking backwards from Briggs’ last test on August 23, 2016, accrual occurred at the 25 latest on August 8, 2016 if Briggs was subject to one test each day for the fifteen days 26 directly prior to his last test.” Id. at 24.\n27 Conversely, Plaintiffs contend that Briggs’ claims did not begin to accrue until he 28 completed the diversion program on August 25,\n2016. (Doc. 45 at 24). Because Briggs was 1 subject to Defendants’ “systematic violations until he completed the program... the 2 limitations clock to challenge that continuing series of violations relating to his unlawful 3 supervision in the diversion program did not begin to tick until he completed the program.” 4 Id.\nThe Court finds that Briggs’ claims may fall within either or both of the two methods 6 for establishing a continuing violation set forth in Douglas. First, Briggs has pointed to a 7 series of related acts—multiple drug tests occurring past the 90-day period that he alleges 8 were conducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment and only because he was unable to 9 pay the program fee. Second, Briggs also alleges Defendants have a policy, practice, and/or 10 custom that discriminates against the poor; indeed, Briggs brings his Fourth and Fourteenth 11 Amendment claims not just on his own behalf, but also on behalf of a class of others 12 similarly situated. Finally, because Briggs alleges a systemic violation claim, “the 13 limitations clock does not begin to tick until the invidious conduct ends”—in this case, on 14 August 25, 2016, when Briggs completed the program. Douglas, 271 F.3d at 822.\n15 Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff Briggs’ claims are not barred by the statute of 16 limitations.\n17 IV.

Plaintiffs, \nACTION COMPLAINT AND JURY TRIAL DEMAND\n18 William Montgomery, in his official capacity as County Attorney of Maricopa County; Maricopa County; Treatment Assessment Screening Center, Inc., Defendants.\nOVERVIEW\n1. The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office (MCAO) and the Treatment 24 Assessment Screening Center (TASC) jointly operate a possession of marijuana 25 diversion program1 that penalizes the poor because of their poverty.\n27 1 This diversion program is referred to in the Complaint as “the possession of marijuana diversion program,” “the marijuana diversion program,” and “the program.”\n2. In a “diversion” program, participants undergo a period of supervision 2 and must meet certain requirements to avoid criminal prosecution and conviction.\n3. The programs are generally “a functional equivalent of a sentence to 4 pretrial probation... and [are] staffed with paraprofessionals overseeing individuals in 5 what [is] in effect a probationary-type of supervision and control.”2\n4. In principle, the programs are “intended to relieve overburdened courts 7 and crowded jails, and to spare low-risk offenders from the devastating consequences 8 of a criminal record.”3\n5. But in Maricopa County, they serve another purpose: to make money for 10 those who operate the program, including the MCAO.4\n6. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO collected nearly $15 million in revenue 12 by diverting threatened prosecutions to TASC.5\n7. The length of time a person spends in the diversion program and whether 14 the person ultimately completes the program and avoids felony criminal prosecution 15 depends on whether she can pay the program’s required fees.\n17 2 S\nRep\nNo. 93–1021, at 36–37 (1974) (describing the operation of two pretrial diversion programs).\n18 3 Shaila Dewan Andrew W.

In order to complete the program and avoid felony criminal prosecution, 2 participants in the marijuana diversion program must pay a fee of $950 or $1000.\n9. Participants must also pay $15 or $17 for each drug and alcohol test; they 4 may be required to take as many as three or four tests each week.\n10. The program is two-tiered: people who meet program requirements— 6 completing a three-hour drug education seminar and routine drug and alcohol testing— 7 and are wealthy enough to pay the $950 or $1000 program fee complete the program in 8 90 days and are no longer subject to felony criminal prosecution.\n11. But participants who cannot pay the program fees are forced to stay in the 10 program for at least six months and until they can pay off the money owed to MCAO 11 and TASC, even if they have satisfied every program requirement other than payment.\n12. During the “pay-only”6 period, participants remain subject to felony 13 criminal prosecution during the additional time they are forced to remain in the\n13. These participants also remain subject to all of the diversion program’s 16 requirements.\n14. These requirements include reporting to a TASC location, as often as four 18 times per week, so that the participant’s urine can be collected and tested.\n15. Participants who remain on diversion solely because of their inability to 20 pay program fees must also continue to pay $15 or $17 each time they are required to 21 submit to a drug and alcohol test.\n24 6 “Pay-only” refers to a period of criminal supervision during which the person is 25 supervised only because she has not paid all of her debt. This “extremely muscular form of debt collection,” which “masquerades as supervision,” is becoming 26 increasingly common. Human Rights Watch, Profiting from Probation: America’s ‘Offender Funded’ Probation Industry (Feb. 5, 2014), https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/02/05/profiting-probation/americas-offender- 28 funded-probation-industry.\n16. The perverse result is that poor people are ultimately charged more 2 money—potentially hundreds of dollars more—than similarly situated participants who 3 can afford to pay to finish the program in 90 days.\n17. Participants who cannot afford to pay for diversion may also be 5 terminated from the program altogether and referred for felony prosecution.\n18. This can happen in at least two ways.\n19. First, Defendants require diversion participants to make a minimum 8 monthly payment towards the $950 or $1000 program fees at a rate set by Defendant \n9 TASC.\n20. A participant who fails to pay the minimum monthly payment set by 11 Defendant TASC can be terminated from the program and prosecuted.\n21. Defendants do not inquire into a participant’s ability to pay before setting\n22. Defendants’ policy does not include any exception for participants who 15 do not pay the minimum monthly amount solely because they cannot afford it.\n23. Second, participants are not allowed to take the drug and alcohol tests the 17 program requires if they cannot afford to pay for them.\n24. For example, if a participant cannot pay the $15 or $17 fee for a drug and 19 alcohol test, she is not allowed to take the test at all.\n25. Therefore, if a participant reports for a drug and alcohol test without the 21 required fee, she will be turned away, and she will receive a violation for missing the 22 test.\n26. In other words, an unpaid drug and alcohol test is a failed test.\n27. If a participant misses too many drug and alcohol tests—even if she 25 missed them solely because she could not afford to pay for them—she will be failed out 26 of the diversion program and prosecuted for felony possession of marijuana.\n28. Defendants enforce these policies even when they know that diversion 2 participants are poor or even homeless, and even when they know that participants are 3 sacrificing basic necessities to pay fees.\n29. And indeed, Defendants have a financial incentive to enforce the policies 5 this way—and to use the specter of termination and felony prosecution to coerce as 6 much money from participants as they can.\n30. Diversion participants who alert TASC employees that they cannot afford 8 the required fees are told that they will be failed from the program if they do not pay 9 and to do whatever it takes to get the money.\n31. For example, Plaintiff Marc Pascale is a 60-year-old man with 11 degenerative disc disease, which has left him physically unable to work.\n32. TASC refused to waive his program and drug and alcohol testing fees 13 even after he repeatedly told them that he could not afford to pay the fees.\n33\nMr. Pascale’s case manager repeatedly told him to borrow money to pay 15 the fees or else he would fail the program, lose the money he had already paid in 16 program and drug and alcohol testing fees, and be prosecuted for felony criminal 17 possession of marijuana.\n34. Plaintiff Taja Collier emailed her case manager at TASC to tell her that 19 she was homeless and could not afford to pay for drug and alcohol testing.\n35\nMs. Collier’s case manager responded that if she did not test, she would 21 be issued a notice of violation and her case would be sent back to court, where she 22 would be prosecuted for felony criminal possession of marijuana.\n36. As a result, Ms. Collier sold her blood plasma to pay for drug and alcohol 24 tests.\n37. Plaintiffs bring this civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to 26 redress violations of Named Plaintiffs’, class members’, and Plaintiff Collier’s rights 27 under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\n38. Named Plaintiffs DeShawn Briggs, Mark Pascale, and Lucia Soria, as 2 well as the class members whose interests they represent, seek monetary damages 3 against Defendants for violation of these rights.\n39. Named Plaintiffs McKenna Stephens and Lucia Soria, as well as the class 5 members whose interests they represent, seek injunctive relief against the Defendants 6 to enjoin Defendants from continuing their unlawful and unconstitutional policies,\n40. Plaintiff Taja Collier seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief on her 9 own behalf.\nPARTIES\nPlaintiffs\n41. Plaintiff DeShawn Briggs is a 28-year-old African American man. He is 13 a resident of Maricopa County, Arizona Mr. Briggs spent six months in Defendants’ 14 marijuana diversion program solely because he was unable to pay the program fees 15 within 90 days. He represents himself and a class of similarly situated people subject to\n42. Plaintiff Marc Pascale is a 60-year-old white man. He is a resident of 18 Maricopa County, Arizona Mr. Pascale spent more than seven months in Defendants’ 19 marijuana diversion program solely because he was unable to pay the program fees in 20 90 days. He represents himself and a class of similarly situated people subject to\n43. Plaintiff McKenna Stephens is a 24-year-old white woman. She is a 23 resident of Maricopa County, Arizona Ms. Stephens is currently a participant in 24 Defendants’ marijuana diversion program Ms. Stephens has complied with all of the 25 program requirements to date and will complete all non-monetary program 26 requirements during the first 90 days of the program. However, she is unable to pay the 27 program fees in full during the first 90 days of the program. Therefore, as a result of 1 Defendants’ policies and practices, Ms. Stephens will be forced to stay in the program 2 for at least six months and until she can pay all of the required fees. As long as Ms.\n3 Stephens is required to remain in the program, she will remain subject to felony criminal 4 prosecution and be forced to submit to routine, suspicionless drug and alcohol tests.\n5 Ms. Stephens also cannot afford the minimum monthly payments Defendants require, 6 and Defendants may terminate her from the program as a result. She represents herself 7 and a class of similarly situated people subject to Defendants’ unlawful policies,\n44. Plaintiff Lucia Soria is a 38-year-old Latina woman. She is a resident of 10 Maricopa County, Arizona Ms. Soria is currently being supervised on Defendants’ 11 marijuana diversion program solely because she is unable to pay program fees. Ms.\n12 Soria represents herself and a class of similarly-situated people subject to Defendants’ 13 unlawful policies, practices, and customs.\n45. Plaintiff Taja Collier is a 21-year-old African American woman. She is 15 a resident of Maricopa County, Arizona Ms. Collier first enrolled in Defendants’ 16 marijuana diversion program in July \n2017\nMs. Collier was willing to meet all diversion 17 requirements, but she could not afford to pay for drug and alcohol testing, particularly 18 during a month when she was homeless and sleeping in parks. After Ms. Collier could 19 not afford to pay for several drug and alcohol tests, she was terminated from the 20 diversion program and prosecuted for felony possession of marijuana. After prosecution 21 was initiated, Ms. Collier was again diverted into Defendants’ diversion program. Ms.\n22 Collier cannot afford the minimum monthly payments Defendants require, and 23 Defendants may terminate her from the program as a result Ms. Collier also cannot 24 afford to pay for the required drug and alcohol tests, and she may be terminated for that 25 reason as well Ms. Collier brings this suit on her own behalf.\nDefendants\n46. Defendant Bill Montgomery is the elected County Attorney for 3 Maricopa County, Arizona. Defendant Montgomery is the chief official responsible for 4 the enforcement and prosecution of felonies within Maricopa County. Defendant 5 Montgomery is also responsible for operating and administering the deferred 6 prosecution programs in Maricopa County. Defendant Montgomery is the final 7 policymaker for Maricopa County on matters relating to diversion programs, including 8 the marijuana diversion program at issue in this lawsuit. He is sued in his official 9 capacity.\n47. Defendant Maricopa County, Arizona7 is a political subdivision formed 11 and designated as such pursuant to Title 11 of the Arizona Revised Statutes. Defendant 12 Maricopa County can sue and be sued in its own name. Maricopa County is liable for 13 the practices and policies of Defendants Montgomery and TASC. The County has and 14 continues to acquiesce in the administration of the TASC drug diversion program, 15 including the marijuana diversion program at issue in this lawsuit.\n48. Defendant Treatment Assessment Screening Center is a private, non- 17 profit, 501(c)(3) corporation headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. Defendant TASC has 18 contracted and continues to contract with MCAO to operate, administer, and supervise 19 the marijuana diversion program at issue in this lawsuit. Defendant TASC supervises 20 all people whose prosecutions for simple possession of marijuana have been diverted.\n21 Defendant TASC acts under the color of law in its administration and supervision of 22 the County’s marijuana diversion program.\n27 7 Defendant Montgomery, in his official capacity, acts on behalf of and is the final policymaker for Maricopa County with respect to the conduct described in this 28 lawsuit. If this is correct, naming Maricopa County as a defendant is redundant. 8 \nJURISDICTION\n49. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Constitution of the 3 United States. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n50. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). All Defendants’ official 6 places of business are located within this District. The events giving rise to the claims 7 occurred in this District.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n9 I. Defendants’ Unlawful Policies Marijuana Possession Prosecutions in Maricopa County\n51. In Arizona, possession of any amount of marijuana—even trace 12 amounts—can be prosecuted as a felony.8\n52. Felony prosecution has severe consequences.\n53. According to the National Inventory of the Collateral Consequences of 15 Conviction—an American Bar Association database—people convicted of felony 16 offenses in Arizona are subject to over 350 “collateral consequences” as a direct result 17 of a felony criminal conviction.9 22 8 See Ariz Rev. Stat Ann. § 13-3405(B)(1) (providing that possession of “an 23 amount of marijuana not possessed for sale having a weight of less than two pounds is guilty of a class 6 felony”). Arizona is the only state in the nation where any amount 24 of marijuana, no matter how small, can draw a felony charge. See Jacob Sullum, 25 Explaining His Cannabis Conversion, John Boehner Cites a Marijuana Myth, Reason (Apr. 12, 2018), http://reason.com/blog/2018/04/12/explaining-his-cannabis- 26 conversion-john/print. Possession of marijuana paraphernalia is also a class 6 felony under Arizona law. See Ariz Rev. Stat Ann. § 13-3415(A). 9 See National Inventory of the Collateral Consequences of Conviction, 28 https://niccc.csgjusticecenter.org/search/?jurisdiction=8 (last visited Oct. 12, 2018).\n54. For example, a person convicted of a felony in Arizona cannot vote, serve 2 on a jury, obtain a commercial driver’s license, possess a gun, or join the U.S. armed 3 forces.10\n55. A felony conviction may also bar a person from receiving professional 5 licenses and affect a person’s child custody rights, parental status, and housing.11\n56. A person with a felony drug conviction in Arizona may lose public 7 benefits, such as food stamps and social security benefits.12\n57. Defendant County Attorney Bill Montgomery has aggressively opposed 9 legalization measures as well as efforts to reduce simple possession of marijuana to a 10 misdemeanor.\n58. In 2016, Defendant Montgomery successfully advocated against the 12 passage of Proposition 205, a ballot initiative that would have made recreational 13 marijuana use legal in Arizona.\n59. Defendant Montgomery made numerous public statements and 15 participated in public debates attacking the initiative and advocating for its failure.\n60. During a public debate on marijuana legalization, Defendant 17 Montgomery told a Vietnam veteran, who admitted to using medical marijuana for back 18 pain and occasional recreation use, “I have no respect for you. … [Y]ou’re an enemy.”\n61. Defendant Montgomery has also worked to narrow Arizona’s medical 20 marijuana laws.\n62. For example, when Defendant Montgomery learned that doctors were 22 able to stop a five-year-old’s seizures by using a marijuana extract, he threatened the 25 10 See Consequences of a Felony, Maricopa County, AZ, 26 https://www.maricopa.gov/930/Consequences-for-a-Felony (last visited Oct. 11, 2018). 11 Id.\n28 12 Id.\n1 child’s parents with felony prosecution, arguing that extracts were not covered by the 2 state’s medical marijuana allowance.13\n63. Drug possession charges represent an overwhelming proportion of the 4 charges filed by MCAO.\n64. Possession of marijuana is the MCAO’s most commonly prosecuted 6 offense; it amounts to approximately 15 percent of total prosecutions.14\n65. And more broadly, more than 45 percent of MCAO’s prosecutions are for 8 drug possession.15\n66. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO made nearly $15 million from diverting 10 threatened prosecutions to TASC.16 The Possession of Marijuana Diversion Program\n67. For most people who are arrested in Maricopa County for simple 13 possession of marijuana or marijuana paraphernalia, the only way to avoid a felony 14 criminal prosecution is to complete the diversion program offered by MCAO.\n68. To operate, administer, and supervise participants in the program, MCAO 16 has contracted with TASC, a private, non-profit company.\n69. TASC also partners with MCAO to administer a diversion program for 18 possession of narcotics.\n22 13 Evan Wyloge, Court Rules Medical Marijuana Patients Can Use Extracts, Ariz.\n23 Capitol Times (Mar. 22, 2014), https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2014/03/22/azmedical-marijuana-patients-can-use-cannabis-extract-court-rules-bill-montgomery.\n24 14 See Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, 2016 Annual Report, at 43, 25 available at https://www.maricopacountyattorney.org/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/88. The year 2016 is the most recent for which MCAO has published 26 this charging data. 27 15 Id. (calculated by adding the percentage of the total offenses charged represented by each type of drug charge listed). 28 16 Cassidy, supra note 4.\n70. More than 15,000 people participated in MCAO and TASC’s marijuana 2 diversion program between 2011 and 2017.17\n71. Over that same time period, the marijuana diversion program accounted 4 for approximately three quarters of TASC’s total intakes for drug diversion.18\n72. People arrested for simple possession of marijuana or marijuana 6 paraphernalia can enter the diversion program either before or after criminal charges 7 are filed.\n73. People who enter into the marijuana diversion program post-filing have 9 charges filed against them prior to enrolling in the program.\n74. The charges are suspended while the person completes the program.\n75. If the person successfully completes the program, MCAO dismisses the 12 case.\n76. If the person fails to complete the program, MCAO reinstates 14 prosecution.\n77. People can also enter the program before any criminal charges are filed 16 in court.\n78. People who enter the marijuana diversion program pre-filing are sent a 18 letter from MCAO.\n79. The letter informs the person that she is facing class 6 felony charges and 20 offers two options: criminal prosecution or the TASC marijuana diversion program.\n23 17 See id. (providing the number of participants who enrolled in the program 24 between 2011 and 2015); Letter from Bill Montgomery, County Attorney, Maricopa 25 County, to Elizabeth Ortiz, Executive Director, Arizona Prosecuting Attorneys’ Advisory Council (Aug. 8, 2017) (providing the number of participants who enrolled 26 in the program from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017). 27 18 See Cassidy, supra note 4; Letter from Bill Montgomery, County Attorney, Maricopa County, to Elizabeth Ortiz, Executive Director, Arizona Prosecuting 28 Attorneys’ Advisory Council (Aug. 8, 2017). 12\n80. The letter warns, “If convicted of a class 6 felony, you could receive a 2 maximum sentence of 2 years in prison and a maximum fine of $150,000 plus 80% 3 surcharge.”\n81. The letter also warns that a class 1 misdemeanor conviction could result 5 in “a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a maximum fine of $2,500.00 plus 6 80% surcharge.”\n82. The threats in this letter are false.\n83. The pre-filing diversion program generally only includes people with no 9 prior convictions.\n84. Under Arizona law, jail or prison time is prohibited for a first or second 11 offense of simple possession of marijuana.\n85. Instead, for people in this category, the law requires drug treatment and a 13 maximum penalty of probation. See Ariz Rev\nStat. § 13-901.01(A), (D), (H)(1).\n86. Accordingly, the people who receive the pre-filing letter threatening jail 15 time are ineligible to be jailed as a matter of state law.\n87. The letter’s representation that its recipients could be fined $150,000 plus 17 an 80% surcharge are false as well.19\n88. After delivering these false threats, the letter explains the basic 19 requirements of the marijuana diversion program and provides a deadline and contact 20 information to sign up for the program.\n89. If a person in the pre-filing category completes the diversion program, 22 MCAO will not file charges against her.\n25 19 A person convicted of possession of marijuana can be fined $750 or three times 26 the value of the marijuana involved. See Ariz Rev\nStat. § 13-3405(D). $150,000 is the maximum fine allowable for any felony. See Ariz Rev\nStat. § 13-801(a). No person accused of a crime involving $50,000 worth of marijuana would be eligible for \n28 TASC.\n90. Failing the program results in criminal prosecution.20\n91. Participants who do not complete the diversion program and whose cases 3 are prosecuted have little hope of avoiding felony criminal prosecution and conviction 4 because people who enroll in the marijuana diversion program—whether pre- or post- 5 filing—are first required to sign a statement of facts admitting their guilt.\n92. A TASC employee tells participants exactly what to write in the statement 7 of facts.\n93. The following information must be written into the statement:\na. Date and location of the offense;\nb. The full name of the substance possessed;\nc. That the participant possessed a usable amount of the substance; and d. The facts of the offense, which must read, “the [name of the drug] was found in [where the drug was found] in my possession.”\n94. This signed statement of facts can be used against a person if she fails to 15 complete the marijuana diversion program and is criminally prosecuted. See State v. 16 Gill, 391 P.3d 1193, 1197 (Ariz. 2017) (holding that a written admission contained in 17 a statement of facts obtained by a TASC representative was admissible at trial).\nThe Cost of Avoiding Prosecution\n95. Once enrolled in the marijuana diversion program, the requirements for 20 the pre- and post-filing participants are the same.\n96. For both groups of participants, avoiding prosecution costs money.\n97. To complete the program, all participants must:\na. Pay program fees—$950 or $1000—in full;\nb. Pay for and pass routine drug and alcohol tests for 90 days; and 25 20 When a person in the pre-filing group fails diversion, the prosecutor will file 26 charges in the case. When a person in the post-filing group fails diversion, the prosecutor will move to reinstate the prosecution. As a matter of policy, practice, and custom, for both pre- and post-filing participants, TASC sends the participant a final 28 warning letter before the participant is failed from the program.\nc. Complete a three-hour drug education seminar.\n98. The mandatory $950 or $1000 program fee includes the following:\na. $150 admission fee;\nb. $650 “drug fund” fee;\nc. $150 TASC fee; and d. $50 booking fee, which applies only to participants who were arrested and booked.\n99. All of these fees must be paid in person by debit card or with a money 9 order.\n100. Participants are not allowed to pay by any other means, including with 11 credit or cash.\n101. Defendants require that participants pay the $150 admission fee at the 13 program orientation.\n102. If a participant is unable to pay the $150 admission fee at orientation 15 because she cannot afford it, Defendants allow her to pay $75 at orientation and the 16 other $75 during the program.\n103. If a participant cannot afford to pay $75 at orientation, she may be told to 18 return with the money the same day or be failed from the program and face felony 19 prosecution.\n104. In addition to the $950 or $1000 in fees, participants must pay to take 21 drug and alcohol tests at TASC.\n105. Each drug and alcohol test costs $15 or $17, depending on the method of 23 payment.\n106. Participants must call TASC or consult a phone application every day, 25 seven days a week to determine whether they are required to report to a TASC location 26 that day so that TASC can collect and test their urine.\n107. If a participant does not call daily, she may miss a scheduled test and be 2 sanctioned, which could ultimately result in termination from the diversion program, 3 followed by felony prosecution.\n108. Participants are required to drug test at least once—and often multiple 5 times—each week.\n109. At the TASC location, TASC employees watch participants through glass 7 panels while they submit urine for drug and alcohol testing.\n110. In at least one TASC location, the bathroom where participants submit 9 urine for testing includes multiple mirrors so that a TASC employee can watch the 10 participant urinate from multiple angles.\n111. Records obtained as part of the preliminary investigation for this lawsuit 12 revealed that participants may be required to test as many as nine times per month.\n112. Thus, on top of the $1000 in program fees, diversion participants pay at 14 least $60—but up to $153—each month for drug and alcohol tests.\n113. In addition to the three program requirements, Defendants impose a 16 number of additional terms on participants.\n114. These terms are set forth in a document called the “Client Contract.” 21\n115. The Client Contract states that diversion participants must make 19 minimum monthly payments towards those fees at a rate set by Defendant TASC.\n116. The rate set forth in the Client Contract is $160 or $170 per month.\n117. Defendant TASC does not inquire into a participant’s ability to pay before 22 setting the minimum monthly fee.\n118. If a participant does not make the minimum monthly payment set by 24 Defendant TASC, she can be terminated from the program and then prosecuted.\n26 21 See MCAO/TASC Adult Deferred Prosecution Program Possession of Marijuana, Client Contract (hereinafter “Client Contract”). In this Complaint, Plaintiffs cite the version of the Client Contract distributed to participants on Tuesday,\n119. The Client Contract also prohibits, among other things:\na. Alcohol use, including over-the-counter medications that include alcohol, like NyQuil;22 b. Leaving the state for any amount of time without “special permission from TASC”;23 c. Leaving Maricopa County for more than one day without informing a TASC case manager;24 d. Taking any prescription medication without reporting it to a TASC case manager and bringing the prescription to TASC for verification.25\n120. The Client Contract also states that “[u]nless disability status applies, 12 [participants] must be employed while participating in the program.”26\n121. “[V]iolation of any” of these provisions “can result in program 14 termination.”27 Defendants Require Participants to Remain on Diversion Until All Fees Are Paid\n122. Participants who complete the three program requirements—including 17 full payment of fees—within 90 days complete the diversion program at that point, and 18 they are not subject to felony criminal prosecution thereafter.\n123. However, as a matter of policy, practice, and custom, people who cannot 20 afford to pay the program fees in full within 90 days are not released from the 21 program—even if they have completed the other program requirements, including 22 passing all drug and alcohol tests.\n26 24 Id.\n28 27 Id. (unnumbered paragraph).\n124. Instead, participants who cannot afford to pay these fees must remain 2 subject to the requirements of the diversion program for a minimum of six months.\n125. If these participants are not able to pay the program fees by the end of six 4 months, they must remain in the program until they do.\n126. Defendants do not assess a person’s ability to pay before refusing to 6 consider her for program completion after 90 days, even when the participant has 7 completed every program requirement other than payment.\n127. Nor do Defendants assess a person’s ability to pay before they require her 9 to remain on diversion beyond six months and until all fees are paid.\n128. People who are forced to stay on diversion solely because they cannot 11 afford to pay program fees remain subject felony prosecution until they complete the 12 program.\n129. In addition, these “pay only”28 participants are subject to same 14 requirements as they were during the first 90 days on diversion.\n130. Thus, “pay only” participants are barred from drinking alcohol, taking 16 certain medications (like NyQuil), and leaving the State without Defendant TASC’s 17 approval.29\n131. “Pay only” participants must continue to submit to one or more drug and 19 alcohol tests weekly—under the threat of felony criminal prosecution.\n132. These participants must also complete all of the requirements attendant 21 to the drug and alcohol tests.\n133. For example, participants must continue to call TASC every day, seven 23 days a week, to determine whether they are required to report to a TASC location during 24 a certain time period that day so that TASC can collect and test their urine.\n27 28 See supra note 6 (explaining the term “pay-only”). 28 29 See Client Contract 3, 5, 10.\n134. People who remain on diversion because they cannot afford to pay 2 program fees are also still forced to pay $15 or $17 for each drug and alcohol test.\n135. As a result, these participants may ultimately have to pay hundreds of 4 dollars more than people wealthy enough to pay the $950 or $1000 program fee within 5 90 days—in addition to remaining subject to felony criminal prosecution for months 6 longer.\nDefendants Terminate Participants from the Diversion Program for Failure to Pay Minimum Monthly Program Fees\n136. Pursuant to Defendants’ written policy, failure to pay program fees at the 9 monthly rate set by Defendant TASC will result in termination from the program and 10 prosecution for felony possession of marijuana.\n137. The Client Contract, to which all participants are subject, states that the 12 minimum monthly rate is $160 or $170.\n138. Defendants’ policy does not include any exception for participants who 14 did not make their monthly payment solely because they could not afford it.\n139. Defendants do not inquire into a participant’s ability to pay before setting\n140. The Client Contract states: “Failure to make payments [toward the 18 program fees] each month as agreed will result in [the] case being returned for 19 prosecution.”30\n141. Another paragraph of the Client Contract states that “failure to test as 21 scheduled, continued positive/diluted/altered tests, missed seminar/counseling, and/or 22 failure to make payments as agreed may result in unsuccessful termination from the 23 program.”31\n142. Defendants have discretion as to when to enforce this policy; they may 25 terminate a participant on the first missed payment or the tenth.\n27 30 Id.\n12. 28 31 Id. 17 (emphasis added).\n143. But in every case, Defendants have a financial incentive to use the threat 2 of termination to coerce as much money from participants as they can.\n144. Thus, a diversion participant who at any point is unable to make the 4 monthly payment set by Defendant TASC can be terminated from the program and 5 prosecuted for felony possession of marijuana.\nDefendants Do Not Allow Participants to Take Drug and Alcohol Tests Unless They Pay for Them\n145. As a matter of policy, practice, and custom, Defendants do not allow 9 diversion participants to take the program’s mandatory drug and alcohol tests unless 10 they can pay for them at the time of the test.\n146. As a result, poor people are forced to extend their time on the program 12 for failing to take mandatory drug and alcohol tests—solely because they could not 13 afford to pay for them.\n147. People who cannot afford to take drug and alcohol tests may also fail the 15 program altogether.\n148. Missed drug and alcohol tests are counted as “violations”—even when a 17 person only missed the test because she could not afford to pay for it.\n149. The Client Contract states that “failure to test as scheduled... may result 19 in unsuccessful termination from the program.”32\n150. A person who accrues too many of these violations will be failed by 21 TASC and referred to the MCAO for prosecution.\n151. When this happens, a person faces felony prosecution solely because of 23 her inability to pay.\n152. No one at TASC assesses a person’s ability to pay before referring her for 25 prosecution because she did not pay for drug and alcohol tests.\n27 32 Client Contract \n16. 28\n153. Nor does anyone at MCAO assess ability to pay before prosecuting 2 people who have failed diversion solely because of their inability to pay for drug and 3 alcohol tests.\nDefendants’ Refusal to Waive Fees for the Poor\n154. As a matter of policy, practice, and custom, Defendants do not reduce or 6 waive the $950 or $1000 program fee for any person, regardless of financial 7 circumstances.\n155. Defendants contend that they allow for reductions of drug and alcohol 9 testing fees to $7 instead of $15 per test for participants who cannot afford them—but 10 these reductions are almost never granted in practice.\n156. At the outset, Defendants do not assess participants’ ability to pay before 12 charging them in full for tests.\n157. But even when Defendants are aware that a participant is indigent and 14 unable to pay without sacrificing basic necessities, Defendants require the participant 15 to pay the full $15 or $17 to test.\n158. One TASC employee interviewed by investigators for undersigned 17 counsel stated that reduced drug and alcohol testing fees are reserved for people who 18 can demonstrate that they have basically zero income.\n159. Another TASC employee explained that fee reductions are “very 20 difficult” to get and that “it rarely happens.”\n160. As one TASC employee explained, drug and alcohol testing is “strictly 22 fee for service.”\n161. When participants tell TASC case managers that they are struggling to 24 pay, the case managers recommend they borrow money from friends or family because 25 they will be failed from the program and prosecuted if they do not pay.\n162. According to Defendants’ written policy, even in the rare cases that fee 2 reductions are granted, full fees can be reinstated as a punishment for a dirty or diluted 3 urine test.\n163. Defendants’ Client Contract warns, “If [a participant’s] fees are reduced 5 and [the participant] submit[s] a positive/diluted/altered urine test, full fees may be 6 reinstated … from that point forward until completion of the program.”33 The “User-Funded” Model\n164. Defendants MCAO and TASC advertise the diversion program as “user- 9 funded.”\n165. According to MCAO, “user-funded” means that “the [person entering the 11 program] typically bears the costs of the initial assessment and the assigned treatment.”\n166. A brochure published by MCAO describing its felony pretrial diversion 13 programs notes that “defendants … bear the costs of the program.”34\n167. Defendant TASC’s website explains that the diversion program “is fully 15 funded by the clients we serve.”35\n168. Defendant TASC is responsible for collecting fees from the people 17 enrolled in the diversion program.\n169. Defendant TASC keeps a portion of the money it collects.\n170. The $650 “drug fund fee” that Defendant TASC collects from each 20 participant is deposited to MCAO.\n171. MCAO does not publicly disclose how it spends the money it receives 22 from the program.\n25 33 See MCAO/TASC Adult Deferred Prosecution Program Possession of Marijuana, Client Contract 13.\n26 34 Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, Felony Pretrial Intervention Program (2018). 35 Diversion, TASC, http://www.tascsolutions.org/tasc-services/diversion (last 28 visited Aug. 22, 2018).\n172. In addition to collecting fees, the Contract between Defendants MCAO 2 and TASC makes Defendant TASC responsible for most of the day-to-day operations 3 of the possession of marijuana diversion program.\n173. This includes administering drug and alcohol tests, tracking participants’ 5 attendance and participation, and determining whether a participant has completed the 6 program requirements.\n174. MCAO’s duties under the Contract are to assess the appropriateness of 8 referrals to the program and to send qualified participants to Defendant TASC.\n175. The Contract does not require the MCAO to pay Defendant TASC any 10 money.\n176. Instead, the Contract provides that the program’s participants alone will 12 pay Defendant TASC, and “no public monies will be expended pursuant to [the 13 Contract].”36\n177. The Contract does provide that, “[a]t his option, the County Attorney may 15 utilize monies accumulated in the Drug Diversion Fund to satisfy the costs associated 16 with this agreement if the participant is indigent and unable to pay the costs associated 17 with the … diversion program.”37\n178. But there is no requirement that MCAO make such payments. 38\n179. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO made nearly $15 million in fees from 20 participants in the marijuana diversion program.39\n180. Defendant TASC has also benefited financially from operating the 25 36 MCAO TASC, Behavior Specific Adult Diversion Program Contract, at 1 (Mar. 22, 2016, effective through Sept. 30, 2018).\n26 37 Id.\n38 The Contract states, “[U]nder no circumstances is the County liable for any fees or costs related to [the] Contract.” Id.\n28 39 Cassidy, supra note 4.\n181. Defendant TASC’s net assets were approximately $18 million in 2016.40\n182. In 2014, TASC paid its CEO $281,165 and its former CEO $963,358.41 5 II. Plaintiffs Damages Class Representatives DeShawn Briggs and Mark Pascale\n185. Class representatives DeShawn Briggs and Mark Pascale were both 8 required to remain in the pretrial diversion program for more than double the time 9 required of similarly situated (but wealthier) participants solely because they were 10 unable to pay program fees.\n186. Plaintiff DeShawn Briggs is a 28-year-old African American man.\n187. In December 2015, Mr. Briggs was arrested for simple possession of 13 marijuana.\n188. At the time of his arrest, Mr. Briggs worked part-time at Walmart, where 15 he made $10 per hour.\n189\nMr. Briggs had no prior criminal record.\n190. He was not addicted to marijuana.\n191. On or around January 13, 2016, Mr. Briggs received a letter from MCAO.\n192. The letter stated that he had two options with respect to his marijuana 20 arrest: he could face prosecution and conviction with a punishment of two years in jail 21 and a fine of up to $150,000 plus an 80% surcharge—or he could participate in the 22 TASC pretrial diversion program.\n193. The claims in the letter Mr. Briggs received were false.\nSee IRS Form 990, filed by TASC for 2014, at\n7. See IRS Form 990, filed by TASC for 2015, at 7.\n194. Because this was Mr. Briggs’ first offense, under Arizona law, he could \n195\nMr. Briggs also did not face a $150,000 fine.\n196\nMr. Briggs did not know that he could not receive jail time for conviction 5 of marijuana possession since it was his first offense.\n197. He also did not know that he could not be fined $150,000.\n198\nMr. Briggs chose to participate in the pretrial diversion program because 8 he did not want to go to jail and thought the diversion program was the only way to 9 avoid two years of incarceration and a six-figure fine.\n199\nMr. Briggs followed the instructions given in the letter and contacted 11 TASC to enroll in the program.\n200. A TASC employee told Mr. Briggs to appear for orientation and bring a 13 $150 intake fee.\n201. At the orientation, a TASC employee informed Mr. Briggs of the program 15 requirements and fees.\n202. The TASC employee told Mr. Briggs that he would have to submit to and 17 pass random drug and alcohol tests for 90 days, complete a three-hour drug education 18 class, and pay his program fees of $1000 in full within that 90-day period.\n203. The TASC employee told Mr. Briggs that the program would either last 20 for 90 days or six months.\n204. The employee told him that if he tested clean, attended the class, and paid 22 his program fees in full, then he would complete the program in 90 days.\n205. If he did not complete any of the three requirements in the first 90 days, 24 including payment of fees in full, he would have to stay in the program for an additional 25 three months or be prosecuted for a felony.\n206. The TASC employee did not ask Mr. Briggs whether he would be able to 27 pay the program and drug and alcohol testing fees.\n207\nMr. Briggs was told to sign a “statement of facts” as a condition of entry 2 into the program.\n208. The statement of facts stated that Mr. Briggs possessed a usable quantity 4 of marijuana.\n209\nMr. Briggs did not consult with an attorney before signing the statement 6 because he could not afford one.\n210. Because of this, Mr. Briggs believed that if he failed to meet the 8 program’s requirements—including paying the necessary fees—he would go to jail.\n211\nMr. Briggs passed all of his drug tests during the first 90 days of the 10 program.\n212. During that time period, Mr. Briggs was required to report for drug and 12 alcohol testing up to three times each week.\n213\nMr. Briggs was forced to pay each time he reported for a drug and alcohol 14 test, even though he was struggling to pay for basic necessities.\n214\nMr. Briggs also completed the required three-hour drug education 16 seminar during his first 90 days on the program.\n215. However, in that first 90 days, Mr. Briggs could not afford to pay the 18 $1000 fee.\n216\nMr. Briggs’s monthly pay at Walmart was less than $1000.\n217\nMr. Briggs also has disabilities caused by spinal meningitis that limit his 21 ability to work.\n218. During the first 90 days of the program, Mr. Briggs was only able to pay 23 $421 toward the $1000 balance.\n219\nMr. Briggs made those payments in small installments.\n220. He paid one $75 installment toward his $150 orientation fee on February\n221. He paid the second installment on April 14, 2016.\n222. On that same date, Mr. Briggs paid another $95 toward his balance.\n223. On May 5, 2016, Mr. Briggs paid $170 toward his balance.\n224. On May 11, 2016, he paid another $16.\n225. During that same time period, Mr. Briggs paid approximately $195 for 5 drug and alcohol tests.\n226. Despite meeting all other program requirements, Mr. Briggs was not 7 considered for program completion at the 90-day mark because he had not paid the 8 $1000 fee in full.\n227. Instead, Mr. Briggs was required to remain on diversion, and remained 10 subject to felony criminal prosecution.\n228\nMr. Briggs was also required to continue reporting to drug and alcohol 12 testing one to three times each week.\n229. After the first 90 days on the program, Mr. Briggs reported for and passed 14 15 additional drug and alcohol tests.\n230. The final drug and alcohol test that Mr. Briggs submitted to and paid for 16 was on August 23, 2016.\n231. In total, the 15 drug and alcohol tests that Mr. Briggs had to take during 18 the pay-only period cost Mr. Briggs approximately $225.\n232\nMr. Briggs also continued to make payments against his balance.\n233. On June 16, 2016, Mr. Briggs paid $170.\n234. On July 14, 2016, he paid $70.\n235. On August 18, 2016, he paid $50.\n236. Finally, on August 25, 2016, Mr. Briggs paid a final installment of $275.\n237. When Mr. Briggs made this final payment, a TASC employee told 25 Mr. Briggs that had successfully completed the program and that he should return to 26 the TASC office the next day to receive his certificate of completion.\n238\nMr. Briggs returned to the TASC offices the following day and received 2 a certification of completion from TASC.\n239. Plaintiff Mark Pascale is a 60-year-old man.\n240\nMr. Pascale lives in Maricopa County, Arizona with his 15-year-old son, 5 for whom he is the sole provider.\n241\nMr. Pascale is disabled; he suffers from degenerative disc disease in his 7 neck and back.\n242. To manage his symptoms, Mr. Pascale takes an anti-epileptic drug, an 9 anti-convulsant drug, and morphine every day.\n243. Because of his illness, Mr. Pascale has been physically unable to work 11 since 2008.\n244. That year, Mr. Pascale filed for bankruptcy.\n245\nMr. Pascale’s only stable source of income comes from federal disability 14 benefits.\n246\nMr. Pascale also receives nutritional assistance benefits and, in the past, 16 has received assistance from government programs to pay his utility bills.\n247. In May 2017, a police officer found a small amount of marijuana in 18 Mr. Pascale’s car.\n248\nMr. Pascale was not arrested, but he received a criminal summons in the 20 mail in October 2017, stating that he was being charged with possession or use of 21 marijuana, a class 6 felony.\n249. At his first court appearance, Mr. Pascale agreed to enroll in the \n250\nMr. Pascale was not addicted to marijuana.\n251\nMr. Pascale attended an orientation for the program on November 21, \n252\nMr. Pascale could not afford to pay the $150 application fee that TASC 2 requires at orientation.\n253. A TASC employee agreed to allow Mr. Pascale to pay $75 up front 4 instead of $150 to attend the orientation.\n254. The remaining $75 was added to Mr. Pascale’s bill, and he was required 6 to pay it before he could complete the diversion program.\n255. During the orientation, a TASC employee told Mr. Pascale that he could 8 complete the program in 90 days if he did not fail any drug and alcohol tests and paid 9 all required fees in full.\n256. When Mr. Pascale reported for his first mandatory drug and alcohol test, 11 he told his case worker at TASC that he could not afford to pay the $950 in program 12 fees.44\n257. He also told her that he could not afford to pay $15 or $17 for drug and 14 alcohol testing weekly or multiple times each week.\n258\nMr. Pascale’s case worker told him that there was no way to waive or 16 reduce the program fees.\n259. However, she explained, his drug and alcohol testing fees could 18 potentially be reduced to $7 per test instead of $15 per test.\n260. The case worker gave Mr. Pascale a financial information form to 20 complete.\n261. On the form, Mr. Pascale marked that he was disabled and worked zero 22 hours per week.\n262. He listed his income as $920 per month, explaining that he received 24 disability benefits.\n27 44 Because Mr. Pascale was not arrested, he did not have to pay the $50 booking 28 fee.\n263. The case worker told Mr. Pascale that he did not qualify for reduced drug 2 and alcohol testing fees because he owned a computer and was paying for internet 3 service, which are “luxuries.” \n264\nMr. Pascale therefore had to pay the full $15 for each required drug and 5 alcohol test.\n265. These payments, made out of his disability income, made it difficult for 7 Mr. Pascale to pay for basic necessities for himself and his son, including food, shelter, 8 medication, and clothing.\n266\nMr. Pascale was tested at least once per week, but as often as three times 10 per week.\n267. At least once each month, Mr. Pascale would be asked to submit to 12 additional drug and alcohol testing because he had tested positive for opiates due to the 13 prescription medications he takes.\n268\nMr. Pascale had provided his case worker with information and 15 documentation about the prescription medications that he takes (including morphine), 16 but even so, she ordered the extra testing.\n269\nMr. Pascale had to pay for these additional tests as well.\n270\nMr. Pascale frequently emphasized to his case worker that he did not have 19 the money to pay for drug and alcohol tests.\n271. The case worker told Mr. Pascale that he had to pay in order to be tested 21 and suggested he borrow money.\n272\nMr. Pascale often skipped paying bills to keep up with the fees.\n273. After 90 days had passed, Mr. Pascale had met all non-monetary program 24 requirements and had never failed a drug and alcohol test.\n274. He had not, however, finished paying the $950 he owed in program fees.\n275. As a result, Mr. Pascale was required to remain on diversion until all of 27 the fees were paid.\n276. During this time, he was still required to submit to and pay for drug and 2 alcohol testing up to three times each week.\n277\nMr. Pascale made his final payment—and submitted to and passed his 4 final drug and alcohol test—on June 29, 2018, more than seven months after he had 5 entered the program.\n278. When Mr. Pascale told his case worker that he had paid his program fees 7 in full, she told him that he had successfully completed the program and issued a 8 certificate of completion dated July 5, 2018.\nDamages and Injunctive Relief Class Representative Lucia Soria\n279. Plaintiff Lucia Soria is a 38-year-old Latina woman.\n280\nMs. Soria is a single mother. She has a son and daughter, both of whom 12 are teenagers. She lives with her parents, her children, and members of her extended 13 family.\n281\nMs. Soria is unemployed and without income because her ability to work 15 is severely limited by her medical conditions, which include diabetes and neuropathy.\n16 In November 2018, Ms. Soria’s doctor advised her to stop working because of her 17 medical conditions.\n282\nMs. Soria left her employment as an assistant manager at Dollar Tree 19 shortly after receiving this advice from her doctor.\n283. In December 2018, Ms. Soria was driving friends home when she was 21 pulled over. The officer alleged he found marijuana in the car, but Ms. Soria was not 22 arrested or cited.\n284. On or around March 25, 2019, Ms. Soria received a letter from Defendant 24 MCAO about the marijuana diversion program.\n286. The letter threatened Ms. Soria that, if convicted, she could be sentenced 2 to two years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $150,000, plus an 83% surcharge.\n288. Because Ms. Soria had never been convicted of possessing marijuana, she 5 could not receive jail or prison time if convicted of simple possession of marijuana 6 under Arizona law.\n289. Nor was Ms. Soria eligible for a $150,000 fine.\n290. But Ms. Soria believed the threats Defendant MCAO made in the letter.\n291\nMs. Soria decided to enroll in the diversion program because she did not \n292\nMs. Soria attended orientation for the marijuana diversion program after 12 receiving the letter in March 2019.\n293\nMs. Soria was told that the program would cost approximately $950.\n294. At orientation, Ms. Soria told the TASC employee who facilitated the 15 orientation class that she had no income and could not afford the fees. The TASC 16 employee responded by saying “it’s not up to me,” and told Ms. Soria that she had to 17 pay the fees or she could not participate in TASC.\n295. The TASC employee also told Ms. Soria that in order to complete the 19 program in 90 days, she would have to submit to and pass random drug and alcohol 20 tests, attend a three-hour drug and alcohol seminar, and pay the $950 program fee within 21 that time period. Further, the TASC employee told Ms. Soria that if she were unable to 22 meet any of the three requirements—including full payment of program fees—she 23 would remain under TASC supervision in the diversion program.\n296\nMs. Soria had to sign the “Client Contract” during orientation, which, 25 among other things, stated that she would be terminated from the program if she did 26 not make minimum monthly payments required by Defendant TASC.\n297. The Client Contract Ms. Soria signed set the minimum monthly payment 2 at $160 or $170.\n298. The TASC employee also told Ms. Soria that, in addition to the program 4 fee, she would have to pay $15 each time she submitted to a drug and alcohol test.\n299\nMs. Soria was not offered a fee waiver or fee reduction at orientation or 6 any other time during her tenure under TASC supervision.\n300\nMs. Soria has submitted to one to three drug and alcohol tests every week 8 since she started the marijuana diversion program.\n301. When Ms. Soria first started on the marijuana diversion program, the 10 closest location where she could test was approximately a 45-minute drive each way 11 from her home if there was no traffic.\n302. During her time on the program, a TASC location has opened closer to 13 her house, but it is still a 30-minute drive each way from her home.\n303\nMs. Soria often has to rely on her daughter to drive her to and from TASC 15 when she has to test.\n304\nMs. Soria borrows money from her parents or her daughter when she has 17 to submit to drug and alcohol tests, because she fears that if she cannot pay for the test, 18 she will not be allowed to test and will be terminated from the program.\n305\nMs. Soria cannot borrow money from her family members to pay off the 20 rest of the program fees because they cannot afford to give her the money.\n306\nMs. Soria’s family has helped her pay off portions of the program fees in 22 the past with money received from tax refunds but they currently cannot afford to give 23 her money to pay off any more of the program fees.\n307. On July 15, 2019, Ms. Soria asked her case worker, Viviana Garcia, when 25 her 90 days would be over and she would be off the program.\n308\nMs. Garcia replied: “Your anticipated completion date is on 7/29/19 as 27 long as you have a zero balance....” \n309\nMs. Soria asked, “what could I do if I can’t pay the 440.00 [I] still owe 2 by the 29th” and informed Ms. Garcia that she “still do[esn’t] have a job.” \n310\nMs. Garcia replied: “If you are unable to pay of[f] your fees in full by 4 7/29/19 you will continue to comply with the program.” \n311\nMs. Soria did not violate any program rules or policies between July 15, 6 2019 and July 29, 2019, the date she would have completed the program if she could 7 have afforded to pay the program fees.\n312\nMs. Soria could not afford to pay the program fees in full by July 29, 9 2019—and still cannot afford to pay the program fees in full—and thus remains on the 10 program solely because she could not and cannot afford to pay the program fees.\n313\nMs. Soria also cannot afford to pay Defendant TASC’s standard monthly 12 minimum payment of $160 or $170 per month, which was set forth in the Client 13 Contract to which she is subject.\n314. Pursuant to Defendants’ written policy, if Ms. Soria cannot afford to 15 make the minimum monthly payment she will be terminated from the diversion 16 program.\n315. Pursuant to Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs, if Ms. Soria is 18 terminated from the diversion program, she will be prosecuted for felony possession of 19 marijuana.\n316. At orientation, Ms. Soria was told to sign a statement of facts confessing 21 to possession of marijuana as a condition of entering the program.\n317\nMs. Soria believed that signing the statement in order to enter the 23 diversion program was the only way that she could avoid prosecution and potential for 24 a two-year prison sentence and a $150,000 fine.\n318. Arizona law allows this confession to be used against Ms. Soria in court.\n319. Accordingly, Ms. Soria believes that if she is prosecuted, she will be Injunctive Relief Class Representative McKenna Stephens\n320. Plaintiff McKenna Stephens is a 24-year-old white woman.\n321\nMs. Stephens works as a part-time server at a restaurant.\n322. On October 29, 2016, Ms. Stephens was sitting with a friend in a car when 5 they were approached by two police officers.\n323. The officers searched the car and found a small amount of marijuana and 7 marijuana paraphernalia in the vehicle.\n324\nMs. Stephens was arrested for possession of marijuana.\n325. She was booked into a local jail and released.\n326. The arresting officer told Ms. Stephens that she would receive a letter in 11 the mail regarding next steps.\n327\nMs. Stephens had no prior criminal convictions.\n328. She was not addicted to marijuana.\n329. On August 3, 2018—nearly two years after she was arrested for 15 marijuana possession—Ms. Stephens received a letter from Defendant MCAO about 16 the marijuana arrest.\n331. The letter threatened Ms. Stephens that, if convicted, she could be 20 sentenced to two years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $150,000, plus an 80% 21 surcharge.\n333. Because this was Ms. Stephens’s first marijuana arrest, under Arizona 24 law, she could not receive jail or prison time if convicted of simple possession of 25 marijuana.\n334. Nor was Ms. Stephens eligible for a $150,000 fine.\n335. But Ms. Stephens believed the threats Defendant MCAO made in the 2 letter.\n336. She decided to enroll in the diversion program because she did not want 4 to be fined $150,000 or spend two years in prison.\n337. Prior to orientation for the diversion program, a TASC employee told Ms.\n6 Stephens that she would have to pay $150 in order to attend orientation and begin the 7 program.\n338\nMs. Stephens attended orientation for the marijuana diversion program\n339. That same day, Ms. Stephens paid $150 to TASC.\n340. During the orientation, a TASC employee told Ms. Stephens that in order 12 to complete the program in 90 days, she would have to submit to and pass random drug 13 and alcohol tests, attend a three-hour drug and alcohol seminar, and pay the $1000 14 program fee within that time period.\n341. The TASC employee told Ms. Stephens that if she were unable to meet 16 any of the three requirements—including full payment of program fees—within 90 17 days, she would have to stay in the diversion program for at least six months and until 18 the program fees were paid.\n342. The TASC employee also told Ms. Stephens that, in addition to the $1000 20 program fee, she would have to pay $15 each time she submitted to a drug and alcohol 21 test.\n343\nMs. Stephens informed the TASC employee that she had a medical 23 marijuana card and was legally able to use marijuana.\n344. The TASC employee told her that she could use marijuana while on the 25 marijuana diversion program, but that Ms. Stephens would still have to submit to and 26 pay for random drug and alcohol tests.\n345. During her first week in the marijuana diversion program, Defendants 2 required Ms. Stephens to submit to four drug and alcohol tests.\n346. Defendants required Ms. Stephens to pay $15 for each of the four drug 4 and alcohol tests.\n347\nMs. Stephens intends to fulfill all of the non-monetary requirements of 6 the diversion program within the first 90 days.\n348. However, Ms. Stephens cannot afford to pay the $1000 program fee 8 within 90 days.\n349\nMs. Stephens’s sole income is the $600 or $700 she makes each month 10 as a part-time server.\n350\nMs. Stephens’s allocates almost 100% of her income towards paying her 12 bills and expenses, which includes her car payment, insurance, gas, and phone service.\n351. In order to complete diversion within 90 days, Ms. Stephens would have 14 to pay well over $300 each month.\n352\nMs. Stephens could not pay this amount without defaulting on bill 16 payments and sacrificing basic necessities.\n353. Because Ms. Stephens cannot pay the $1000 program fees within 90 days, 18 pursuant to Defendants’ policy, practice, and custom, she will be required to remain on 19 diversion (and subject to the diversion program’s requirements) for at least six months 20 and until she is able to pay the $1000 program fee.\n354. Without sacrificing basic necessities or defaulting on bills, Ms. Stephens 22 also cannot afford to pay Defendant TASC’s standard monthly minimum payment of 23 $160 or $170 per month, which was set forth in the Client Contract to which she is 24 subject.\n355. If Ms. Stephens cannot afford to make the minimum monthly payment, 2 pursuant to Defendants’ written policy, she will be terminated from the diversion 3 program.45\n356. Pursuant to Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs, if Ms. Stephens 5 is terminated from the diversion program, she will be prosecuted for felony possession 6 of marijuana.\n357. At orientation, Ms. Stephens was told to sign a statement of facts 8 confessing to possession of marijuana as a condition of entering the program.\n358\nMs. Stephens believed that signing the statement in order to enter the 10 diversion program was the only way that she could avoid prosecution and potential 11 confinement for two years and a $150,000 fine.\n359. Arizona law allows this confession to be used against Ms. Stephens in 13 court.\n360. Accordingly, Ms. Stephens believes that if she is prosecuted, she will be Individual Plaintiff Taja Collier\n361. Plaintiff Taja Collier is a 21-year-old African American woman.\n362. On October 7, 2016, Ms. Collier was riding in a car with friends when the 19 car was pulled over by a police officer for making an improper turn.\n363. The officer searched the car’s occupants and found a small cylinder in 21 Ms. Collier’s purse that contained trace amounts of marijuana.\n364. The amount of marijuana in the container was so small that the police 23 officer did not weigh it.\n365\nMs. Collier was placed under arrest for possession of marijuana.\n366\nMs. Collier had no prior criminal record.\n27 45 Id. 12 “Failure to make payments [toward the program fees] each month as 28 agreed will result in [the] case being returned for prosecution.” \n367\nMs. Collier was not addicted to marijuana.\n368. In early Spring 2017, Ms. Collier received a letter from MCAO.\n369. The letter gave her two choices: she could face felony charges for 4 marijuana possession, or she could agree to participate in the TASC diversion program.\n370. The letter warned Ms. Collier that if convicted, she could be sentenced to 6 two years in jail and a fine of up to $150,000, plus an 80% surcharge.\n372. Because this was Ms. Collier’s first offense, under Arizona law, she could\n373. Nor was Ms. Collier eligible for a $150,000 fine.\n374. But Ms. Collier believed the threats in the letter.\n375. She decided to enroll in the TASC diversion program because she did not\n376. At the time of her arrest, Mr. Collier was a sophomore at Central Arizona 15 College, where she studied social work.\n377. Central Arizona College is located in Casa Grande, Arizona, which is 17 almost an hour away from Phoenix.\n378. When Ms. Collier learned that the TASC diversion program required 19 drug and alcohol testing in Phoenix multiple times each week, she decided she could 20 not go back to college while she was on the TASC program.\n379\nMs. Collier did not have a car or money to make such a long trip so 22 frequently.\n380. She had to stop attending school and move to Phoenix in order to 24 participate in the diversion program.\n381\nMs. Collier was told that she would need to pay $150 at the orientation in 26 order to start the program.\n382. She planned to start the program on June 22, 2017.\n383. That week, however, Ms. Collier realized she would not be able to come 2 up with the $150 required to start the program.\n384\nMs. Collier had recently started a job working part-time at a Target.\n385\nMs. Collier made around minimum wage and worked approximately 16 5 hours per week.\n386. However, she had not yet received her first paycheck.\n387\nMs. Collier called TASC’s main office to tell them that she could not 8 afford to pay the $150 fee.\n388. No one called her back.\n389. At 6:51 a.m. on the morning her orientation was set to begin, Ms. Collier 11 sent an email to the general email address for the possession of marijuana diversion 12 program.\n390. The email read, “Hi, my name is Taja Collier. I called the office to 14 reschedule my appointment 2 days ago and have not received a call back. I left a 15 message for the corporate office and nod [sic] I’m sending this email. I had an 16 appointment today at 8:45 and I do not have 150 because I get my first check next week.\n17 I do not want my file sent back to the court system.”\n391. Later the same day, Ms. Collier reached a TASC employee by phone and 19 rescheduled her orientation for July 6, 2017.\n392. Several days later, however, on June 25, 2017, Ms. Collier learned that 21 she would not be paid until after July 9, 2017.\n393\nMs. Collier wrote again to the email address for the possession of 23 marijuana diversion program and informed TASC that she needed to reschedule the 24 orientation for after she got paid.\n394. A TASC employee rescheduled Ms. Collier’s orientation for July 13,\n395. The employee did not tell her that she could start the program even if she 2 did not pay.\n396. The employee also did not tell her that she could apply for a fee waiver 4 or a fee reduction.\n397. On July 13, 2017, Ms. Collier paid $150 to TASC and attended the 6 mandatory orientation.\n398. Shortly after her orientation, Ms. Collier was informed by the case 8 manager that had been assigned to her that she had to submit to a drug and alcohol test 9 and that she had to pay for the test in order to take it.\n399\nMs. Collier was willing to take the mandatory test, but she could not 11 afford the $15 or $17 fee to pay for it.\n400\nMs. Collier again emailed the address for the possession of marijuana\n401. In her email, Ms. Collier pleaded: “I won’t be able to come up with the 15 fee money until next Friday. I keep calling [my case manager] to figure out what my 16 next steps should be. Is there anyway [sic] I can change case managers or get some 17 assistance?”\n402. No one responded to the email.\n403. Nor did anyone call Ms. Collier to follow up.\n404. Ultimately, Ms. Collier could not take the test because she could not 21 afford to pay for it.\n405. To pay for her drug tests going forward, Ms. Collier began to sell her own 23 blood plasma whenever she was called to test.\n406. Whenever Ms. Collier would learn that she had a drug test, she would 25 schedule a blood plasma sale so that she could pay for the test.\n407\nMs. Collier made $20 to $35 each time she sold her blood plasma.\n408. However, according to the blood plasma center’s rules, a person is only 2 allowed to sell blood plasma twice each week.\n409. Therefore, weeks when Ms. Collier was called to drug test more than 4 twice were especially difficult for her to manage.\n410. After she sold her blood plasma, Ms. Collier often felt fatigued and dizzy, 6 like she couldn’t breathe or might black out.\n411. But she continued to sell her blood plasma because it was the only way 8 she could pay for the drug tests.\n412\nMs. Collier told her case manager at TASC that she sold her blood plasma 10 to pay for drug tests.\n413. The case manager never told her that she could take the tests without 12 paying for them at the time of the test.\n414. The case manager also never told her that she could apply for a reduced 14 fee.\n415. At times, even after selling her blood plasma, Ms. Collier could not afford 16 to take drug and alcohol tests at TASC.\n416. When this happened, Ms. Collier could not take required drug and alcohol 18 tests because she was not allowed to test if she could not pay for it.\n417. Instead, Ms. Collier would try to contact her case manager to tell her that 20 she could not afford to pay to test.\n418. Frequently, Ms. Collier’s case manager would not answer her phone or 22 respond to emails, and Ms. Collier would try to reach her by calling TASC’s corporate 23 office.\n419. In September 2017, Ms. Collier became homeless.\n420. She remained homeless for approximately one month.\n421. While she was homeless, Ms. Collier slept in public parks.\n422. On September 20, 2017, Ms. Collier emailed her case manager.\n423. She explained, “I have been homeless for the passed [sic] week so money 2 has been really tight. … It has been really tough.” \n424\nMs. Collier also told her case manager in the email that she planned to 4 start Job Corps and that she would be able to pay for drug and alcohol tests once she 5 started.\n425\nMs. Collier’s case manager responded five days later.\n426. In her email, the case manager replied:\n“Sorry to hear that you are going through this. I am hoping things get better for you. I also noticed that since you are on your FINAL NOTICE, any missed test past this point will result in program termination. So I am happy to hear that you are going to do whatever is possible to test next time you are required to test. Good Luck and hope everything works out for you.”\n427. Again, the case manager did not suggest that Ms. Collier could take the 14 tests without paying for them.\n428. Nor did she invite her to apply for a reduced fee.\n429. Shortly after this exchange, Ms. Collier was issued another violation 17 because she did not take drug and alcohol tests solely because she could not afford to 18 pay for them.\n430. On October 10, 2017, TASC reported to MCAO that Ms. Collier had 20 failed the diversion program.\n431. In its reasons for failing Ms. Collier, TASC listed that Ms. Collier had not 22 submitted to mandatory drug and alcohol tests.\n432. As described above, Ms. Collier did not take these tests solely because 24 she could not afford to pay for them.\n433. TASC also stated that Ms. Collier was being failed because she had not 26 paid the required TASC fee and had not paid the required drug fund assessment fee.46 In addition, TASC stated that Ms. Collier had not attended the program’s 28 mandatory seminar. However, participants are required to take this seminar before they\n434. On December 8, 2017, MCAO filed felony charges against Ms. Collier 2 for possession of marijuana.\n435\nMs. Collier’s preliminary hearing was on January 22, 2018.\n436. On that same date, Ms. Collier agreed to re-enroll in the TASC possession 5 of marijuana diversion program.\n437\nMs. Collier’s prosecution was suspended for two years to allow her to 7 complete TASC.\n438\nMs. Collier knew that she would struggle to pay for diversion.\n439. But she decided to re-enroll because—based on the false threats in the 10 letter that she received from MCAO—she believed that she would go to jail if she did 11 not complete diversion.\n440. To re-enter the program, Ms. Collier was again required to pay the $150 13 admissions fee.\n441\nMs. Collier paid $148 toward that amount on March 13, 2018.\n442\nMs. Collier paid the remaining $2 on May 24, 2018.\n443. Since that time, Ms. Collier has made payments of between $8 and $20.\n444\nMs. Collier still must pay $667 to TASC before she can complete the 18 program.\n445\nMs. Collier cannot afford this sum without sacrificing basic necessities 20 like food and housing.\n446. Nor can she afford to pay it at the rate required by Defendant TASC in 22 the Client Contract.\ncan successfully complete the program; they are not required to take it at a specific 24 time Ms. Collier would not have been failed from the diversion program solely because 25 she had not yet completed the seminar. The only other reason TASC provided for failing Ms. Collier was that she did not respond to a non-compliance letter she received on 26 August 7,\n2017. But Ms. Collier was in contact with her case manager after receiving this letter and explained that she could not afford to pay for drug and alcohol tests. In addition, TASC does not have a policy, practice, or custom of failing diversion 28 participants who do not respond to a letter.\n447\nMs. Collier is also still required to submit to drug and alcohol testing—at 2 $15 or $17 per test—one to three times each week.\n448. TASC still will not allow Ms. Collier to complete drug and alcohol tests 4 unless she pays for them.\n449\nMs. Collier therefore continues to sell her blood plasma whenever she 6 knows she is going to be drug tested so that she can pay for the tests.\n450. On August 17, 2018, Ms. Collier sent an e-mail to her case manager.\n451\nMs. Collier wrote:\n“Tasc has really been putting a big strain on my pockets. … I am very concerned that I will end up homeless again trying to sacrifice rent for tasc as this is putting Me [sic] in a bad space. I have been donating plasma whenever I have to test to get the money I need to pay for it, but I am afraid it is affecting my health. I am willing to test whenever I’m required but I cannot afford the fees. Is there anyway [sic] that I can test without having to pay for it?” 14 \n452\nMs. Collier’s case worker replied, “You have to pay for the program in 16 order to complete the program. I understand that this is cost effective [sic] but in order 17 for you to have you [sic] felony dismissed with prejudice you will have to complete all 18 program requirement [sic] which includes paying all fees associated with the 19 program.”47\n453. On September 4, 2018, Ms. Collier was scheduled to submit to a drug and 21 alcohol test at TASC.\n454\nMs. Collier did not have any money to pay for the drug test.\n455. Nevertheless, at approximately 6 p.m., Ms. Collier reported to the TASC 24 office in Phoenix to submit to a test.\n27 47 In her response, the case worker also suggested that Ms. Collier could apply for insurance to alleviate the costs of one of the mandatory treatment classes. This would 28 do nothing to relieve the costs of program fees or the fees for drug and alcohol tests. 45\n456. When she arrived, Ms. Collier told a male TASC staff member that she 2 was willing to take the drug and alcohol test, but that she could not pay the fee that day.\n457. The TASC staff member told Ms. Collier that if she did not have the 4 money, she could not take the drug and alcohol test.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n458. The named Plaintiffs bring this case as a class action pursuant to Rules 7 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n459. The Classes are defined as follows:\na. Damages Class: All people who, since August 23, 2016, and until the trial of this case, (1) were enrolled in the marijuana diversion program operated by Defendants TASC and MCAO; (2) satisfied all program requirements in the first 90 days of the program other than payment of program fees; and (3) were not considered for successful completion after 90 days solely because they were unable to pay the required fees. Named Plaintiffs Deshawn Briggs, Mark Pascale, and Lucia Soria seek certification of this class.\nb. Injunctive Class: All people who (1) have not yet been formally charged with possession of marijuana; (2) received a pre-filing letter offering participation in the MCAO and TASC marijuana diversion program; and (3) are unable to pay the required program fees within 90 days and/or at the rate required by Defendant TASC. Named Plaintiffs McKenna Stephens and Lucia Soria seek certification of this class.\n460. The class members are readily ascertainable: the names and relevant 24 records of the class members are in Defendants’ possession.\nNumerosity: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(1)\n461. On information and belief, both Classes include at least several hundred 27 members.\n462. During the 2017 fiscal year (July 1, 2016 through July 30, 2017), there 2 were 2687 admittances to the possession of marijuana diversion program.\n463. The marijuana diversion program has maintained similar numbers of 4 admittances in its last several years of operation.\n464. Therefore, there were likely at least 2500 admittances in the 2018 fiscal 6 year.\n465. Thus, if even a small percentage of the people admitted to TASC since 8 August 23, 2016 meet the requirements for the Classes, the Classes would number in 9 the hundreds.\n466. Moreover, on information and belief, a large majority of those arrested 11 and prosecuted for marijuana possession in Maricopa County are deemed indigent for 12 the purposes of appointment of counsel.\nCommonality: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(2)\n467. The Class members’ claims raise common issues of fact and law.\n468. With respect to the Damages Class, those common questions include, but 16 are not limited to:\na. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of refusing days and beyond solely because they cannot afford to pay the required fees, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nb. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who have not paid the required fees to remain on diversion supervision until they have done so, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nc. Whether Defendants’ diversion extension policies (in subparagraphs (a) and (b)) violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;\nd. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who remain on diversion solely due to inability to pay to continue to submit to and pay for random drug and alcohol tests; and e. Whether Defendants’ policy of continuing this mandatory drug and alcohol testing for participants who remain on the diversion program solely due to inability to pay violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n469. With respect to the Injunctive Class, those common questions include, 10 but are not limited to:\na. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of refusing days and beyond solely because they cannot afford to pay the required fees, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nb. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who have not paid the required fees to remain on diversion supervision until they have done so, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay;\nc. Whether Defendants’ diversion extension policies (in subparagraphs (a) and (b)) violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;\nd. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants who remain on diversion solely due to inability to pay to continue to submit to and pay for random drug and alcohol tests;\ne. Whether Defendants’ policy of continuing this mandatory drug and alcohol testing for participants who remain on the diversion program solely due to inability to pay violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution;\nf. Whether Defendants have a policy, practice, and custom of requiring diversion participants to make a minimum monthly payment and terminating those who fail to do so, without inquiring into those participants’ ability to pay; and g. Whether Defendants’ policy of terminating participants who cannot afford to make a minimum monthly payment violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nTypicality: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(3)\n470. The Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of 13 the Class, and they have the same interests in this case as all other members of the Class 14 that they represent.\n471. The determination whether the Defendants’ scheme of policies, practices, 16 and customs is unlawful in the ways alleged will determine the claims of the named 17 Plaintiffs and every other class member.\nAdequacy: Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(4)\n472. Named Plaintiffs are capable of fairly and adequately protecting the 20 interests of the Class because Named Plaintiffs do not have any interests antagonistic 21 to the Class.\n473. There are no known conflicts of interest among class members, all of 23 whom have a similar interest in vindicating the constitutional rights to which they are 24 entitled.\n474. Plaintiffs’ counsel are experienced in civil rights litigation and have 26 successfully litigated a number of civil rights class action cases.\n475. Many of those cases, like this one, involve unconstitutional penalties 2 based solely on wealth status.\nPredomination, Injunctive Class: Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(2) 5 questions of law and fact predominate in this case.\n477. For Named Plaintiffs McKenna Stephens and Lucia Soria, as well as for 7 the members of the Class, this case turns on what the Defendants’ policies and practices 8 are and on whether those policies are lawful.\n10 questions in the case for every member of the Class.\n479. Because the putative Class challenges the Defendants’ scheme as 12 unconstitutional through injunctive relief that would apply to every member of the 13 Class, Rule 23(b)(2) certification is proper.\nPredomination, Damages Class: Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(3) 16 questions of law and fact overwhelmingly predominate in this case.\n481. For every Named Plaintiff, as well as for the members of the Class, this 18 case turns on what the Defendants’ policies and practices are and on whether those 19 policies are lawful.\n21 questions in the case of every member of the Class.\n483. Moreover, the question of liability can therefore be determined on a class- 23 wide basis.\n484. To the extent that individual damages will vary, they will vary depending 25 in large part on the amount of time that a person was subjected to the unlawful scheme 26 and the amount of money coerced from them.\n485. Determining damages for individual class members can thus typically be 2 handled in a ministerial fashion based on easily verifiable records in the Defendants’ 3 possession.\n486. If need be, individual hearings on class members’ specific damages based 5 on special circumstances and particular hardships caused by Defendants’ scheme can 6 be held after class-wide liability is determined.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nCount One: Wealth-Based Discrimination in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and Lucia Soria on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against all Defendants for damages.\n14 and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of subjecting diversion 15 participants to longer terms of diversion supervision while under threat of felony 16 prosecution, which include in-person reporting, drug and alcohol testing requirements, 17 and increased payments, solely because of their inability to pay fees associated with the 18 program.\n488. This policy, practice, and custom of penalizing individuals based solely 20 on wealth status violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 21 Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n23 and custom, Plaintiffs have suffered violations of their constitutional rights and thus are 24 entitled to compensatory damages for their injuries.\n26 involved reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.\n27 Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover punitive damages—in addition to Count Two: Wealth-Based Discrimination in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 3 Brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by Named Plaintiffs McKenna Stephens and Lucia Soria on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated against all Defendants for injunctive relief; and by Plaintiff Taja Collier on her own behalf against Defendant TASC for injunctive relief.\n7 and continue to enforce a policy, practice, and custom of subjecting participants to 8 longer terms of diversion and/or terminating them from the diversion program based on 9 wealth status.\n492. Defendants subject diversion participants to longer terms of diversion 11 supervision while under threat of felony prosecution, which include in-person 12 reporting, drug and alcohol testing requirements, and increased payments, solely 13 because of their inability to pay fees associated with the program.\n493. Pursuant to a written policy, Defendants terminate participants who 15 cannot afford to make specific minimum monthly payments toward diversion program 16 fees and subsequently prosecute them for felony possession of marijuana.\n494. These policies, practices, and customs violate the Due Process and Equal 18 Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n20 practices, and customs, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer violations of their 21 constitutional rights unless Defendants are enjoined.\n496. Plaintiffs Stephens and Soria are participants in Defendants’ diversion 23 program and cannot afford to pay the fees required to complete the program in 90 days.\n25 them, and all others similarly situated, to remain on diversion for more than 90 days 26 solely because they cannot afford to pay the fees necessary to complete the diversion 27 program.\n498. Plaintiffs Stephens and Soria also cannot afford to pay the minimum 2 monthly fees set by Defendant TASC.\n499. Plaintiffs Stephens and Soria seek to enjoin Defendants from terminating 4 them, and all others similarly situated, from the diversion program solely because they 5 cannot afford to pay minimum monthly fees.\n500. Plaintiff Collier is a participant in Defendants’ diversion program and 7 cannot afford to pay the fees required to complete the program.\n501. Plaintiff Collier seeks to enjoin Defendant TASC from forcing her to 9 remain on diversion solely because she cannot afford to pay the fees necessary to 10 complete the diversion program.\n502.

The plaintiffs sued Maricopa County and Treatment Assessment Screening Center, Incorporated, a private company, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Civil Rights Corps and private counsel, sought injunctive and monetary relief, claiming violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs alleged that the Maricopa County Attorney's Office and Treatment Assessment Screening Center jointly operated a marijuana possession diversion program that discriminated against the poor in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and led to unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, the defendants were, under threat of felony prosecution, subject to longer terms of imprisonment, repeated drug tests and increased fee payments due to their inability to pay fees associated with the program. One class member individually sought injunctive relief to prevent Maricopa County from keeping her in the diversion program if she could not pay the fees associated with completing the program. The case was assigned to Judge James A. Teilborg but immediately reassigned to Judge Steven P. Logan.

On October 12, 2018, the case was reassigned to Judge James A. Soto. That same day, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 12, 2018, adding a third representative to the class. 

In January 2019, the parties agreed to Magistrate Judge Jurisdiction and the case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Eric J. Markovich.

After the submission of the amended complaint, several defendants filed motions to dismiss the case with regards to the allegations leveled against them specifically. Magistrate Judge Eric J. Markovich denied all these motions in a June 18, 2019 order (2019 WL 2515950). He stated that the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded the elements of a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim and that, because the violations of rights were ongoing, there is no statute of limitations concerns. As for the Treatment Assessment Screening Center, he stated that the group was not subject to qualified immunity because it was being sued as an organization, not in individual capacity. He also wrote that the County Attorney was eligible for suit because he oversaw what the plaintiffs allege is a discriminatory practice. He added that as a municipality, the County Attorney was not subject to sovereign immunity.  

On September 23, 2019, the plaintiffs submitted a second amended complaint adding another representative to the class. Discovery is ongoing in the case.","[ENTITYCHAIN] August 23, 2018 | Maricopa County | Arizona | U.S. District Court | District of Arizona | Phoenix Division ||| Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments [SUMMARY] On August 23, 2018, three Maricopa County, Arizona residents who have been referred to Maricopa County's Marijuana Diversion program filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, Phoenix Division.
