They alleged that they did not have an ability to pay the fines due to their financial circumstances and that the city did not consider their ability to pay. On May 1, 2014, the District Court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the city from collecting more money from traffic tickets of plaintiffs'. On October 31, 2014 the parties filed to dismiss the case pursuant to a settlement agreement, which included numerous changes to Municipal Court proceedings. The case is now closed.","RECEiVED IN THE UNITED STATES DIscTcquR FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICTLO ALAAMA 1 SHARNALLE MITCHELL, LORENZO BROWN, DEB -RA P HCETT. CLV US u 1 STCid 3 ALA flCTr'T I Li Li L i COURTNEY TUBBS, TITO WILLIAMS, Plaintiffs, V. THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY, Defendant. COMPLAINT Introduction The Plaintiffs in this case are each impowrished people who were jailed by the City of Montgomery because they were unable to pay a debt owed to the City from traffic tickets. In each case, the City ordered the Plamtiff either to pay the City immediately or to ""sit out"" his or her debt in the City jail at a rate of $50 per day. Although the Plaintiffs pleaded that they were Unable to pay due to their poverty, each was sent to jail for nonpayment and none was afforded the inquiry into their ability to pay that the United States and Alabama Constitutions require. Once locked in the City's jail, the Plaintiffs were told that they could reduce their time in jail by working off their debts for an additional $25 per day if they agreed to perform janitorial tasks assigned by City employees, including cleaning feces and blood from jail floors and wiping the jail bars inside their overcrowded cells. The treatment of Sharnalle Mitchell, Lorenzo Brown, Tito Williams, and Courtney Tubbs reveals systemic illegality perpetrated by the City of Montgomery against some of its. poorest people. The City of Montgomery, as a matter of policy and practice, engages in the same conduct against many other indigent human beings on a daily basis, unlawfully jailing people if they are too poor to pay traffic tickets and the associated fees that the City increasingly levies. By and through their attorneys, Plaintiffs seek in this civil action the vindication of their fundamental rights, compensation for the violations that they suffered, injunctive relief assuring that their rights will not be violated again, and a declaration that the City's conduct is unlawful. In the year 2014, these practices have no place in our society. Nature of the Action' It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to jail people when they cannot afford to pay debts owed to the City resulting from prior traffic tickets without conducting any inquiry into the person's ability to pay and without considering alternatives to imprisonment as required by federal and Alabama law. 2. It is the policy and practice of the City to jail indigent people for these debts without informing people of their right to counsel and without providing adequate counsel. 3. It is the policy and practice of the City to hold prisoners in the City jail at a rate of $50 per day, ""serving out"" their debts until the debts are extinguished. It is the policy and practice of the City to tell inmates that their time in City jail can be further reduced if they agree to ""work oft"" their debts to the City While in jail by laboring at janitorial and other work for the City at a rate of $25 per day toward their debts. 'Plaintiffs make the allegations in this Complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which they have had personal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters. 4. It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to contract with a private for-profit corporation, Judicial Correction Services, Inc. (""JCS, Inc""), to perform what the City calls ""probation"" services, which consists of collecting City debts in exchange for fees added to the debts owed by people who cannot afford to pay their traffic ticket fees, costs, and surcharges immediately. It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to rely on the discretionary recommendations and factual representations of this private entity to make decisions about Whether to arrest a person, what disposition to enter in a person's case, and whether to put the person on ""probation"" or to require immediate payment or jail despite the fact that the private entity has a significant personal financial stake in these judicial enforcement proceedings. 5.

The complaint was originally filed in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama and then transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, where it was consolidated with a similar case.

Case No. 03-CV-2013-901494.00 CITY OF MONTGOMERY, THE HONORABLE MILTON J. WESTRY, Respondents. AMENDED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY RELIEFS WRIT OF CERTIORARI, OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WRIT OF MANDAMUS COMES NOW Petitioner Harriet Delores Cleveland, by and through undersigned counsel, and states as follows: I. INTRoDucTIoN I. Petitioner Harriet Cleveland is an indigent woman who was ordered' to be incarcerated in the Montgomery Municipal Jail, in violation of her constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and to counsel. 2. Petitioner has been unable to find full time employment Since she was laid off from her job at a day care in 2009. She has been babysitting and renting out rooms in her home to strangers in order to make ends meet. Very recently, she obtained a part time job as a custodian. 3. In 2008 and 2009, when a police roadblock was often set up in her West Montgomery neighborhood, she incurred several tickets because she could not afford car insurance. Her license was soon suspended because she could not pay the fines imposed, and she obtained tickets for this failure as well when she drove to work and took her child to school. This order remains in effect, but Petitioner was released from jail on a bond pending the resolution of her appeal. 4. On August 20, 2013, Petitioner was arrested at her home for failure to pay fines and costs associated with various traffic tickets in the Montgomery Municipal Court (""Municipal Court""). She had received a letter from the District Attorney, notifying her that she ""MUST pay this amount in full within SEVEN (7) days of the date of this notice or [she] may be ARRESTED."" (emphasis in original). 5. The Municipal Court ordered Petitioner to either pay $1554 immediately to satisfy those fines, or be immediately taken into custody to serve a 31 day sentence. Petitioner told the Municipal Court that she could not pay the full amount, but nonetheless was taken to the Montgomery Municipal Jail immediately, where she remains. 6. The incarceration is unconstitutional for at least two reasons: 7. First: It is unconstitutional under both the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and Alabama Constitution to jail an indigent person for failure to pay a fine. U.S Const amend. XIV; Ala Const art. I, <unk>1, 6, 22; Ala R. Crim P. 26.11 (setting out procedures to comply with this constitutional right). See also Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S 660, 672-73 (1983) (jailing a probationer because he cannot pay a fine without considering her ability to pay violates Fourteenth Amendment); Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971) (""[T]he Constitution prohibits the State from imposing a fine as a sentence and then automatically converting it into a jail term solely because the defendant is indigent and cannot forthwith pay the fine in full.""); Frazier v. Jordan, 457 F.2d 726, 728-29 (5th Cir. 1972) (finding that an alternative sentencing scheme of $17 dollars or 13 days in jail was unconstitutional as applied to those who cannot immediately pay a fine). In order to grant the relief Petitioner seeks, this Court need not consider the facts surrounding her nonpayment or make any express finding about her inability to pay. Rather, the fact that Petitioner said that she could not pay, coupled with the failure of the Municipal Court to make a meaningful inquiry into Petitioner's ability to pay, constitutes a violation under the Constitution and Rule 26.11 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and mandates that this Court quash the order of the Municipal Court. 9. Second: Because Petitioner was actually imprisoned on the charges against her, Petitioner was jailed in violation of her right to counsel, as she never knowingly and intelligently waived this right. See U.S Const amend. VI; Ala Const art. I, <unk>6; see also Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 373 (1979) (Because ""actual imprisonment is a penalty different in kind from fines or the mere threat of imprisonment,.. actual imprisonment [is] the line defining the c<unk>nstittitional right to appointment of counsel"" in nonfelony cases.). 10. Petitioner therefore asks that this Court issue a writ of certiorari and quash the order of the Municipal Court requiring Petitioner to serve the 31-day sentence, and declare that this order violates the U.S. and Alabama Constitutions and Alabama laW.

Plaintiffs, CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT AND JURY TRIAL DEMAND William Montgomery, in his official capacity as County Attorney of Maricopa County; Maricopa County; Treatment Assessment Screening 19 Center, Inc., Defendants. OVERVIEW 1. The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office (MCAO) and the Treatment 23 Assessment Screening Center (TASC) jointly operate a possession of marijuana 24 diversion program1 that penalizes the poor because of their poverty. 27 1 This diversion program is referred to in the Complaint as “the possession of marijuana diversion program,” “the marijuana diversion program,” and “the program.” 2. In a “diversion” program, participants undergo a period of supervision 2 and must meet certain requirements to avoid criminal prosecution and conviction. 3. The programs are generally “a functional equivalent of a sentence to 4 pretrial probation... and [are] staffed with paraprofessionals overseeing individuals in 5 what [is] in effect a probationary-type of supervision and control.”2 4. In principle, the programs are “intended to relieve overburdened courts 7 and crowded jails, and to spare low-risk offenders from the devastating consequences 8 of a criminal record.”3 5. But in Maricopa County, they serve another purpose: to make money for 10 those who operate the program, including the MCAO.4 6. Between 2006 and 2016, MCAO collected nearly $15 million in revenue 12 by diverting threatened prosecutions to TASC.5 7. The length of time a person spends in the diversion program and whether 14 the person ultimately completes the program and avoids felony criminal prosecution 15 depends on whether she can pay the program’s required fees. 17 2 S Rep No. 93–1021, at 36–37 (1974) (describing the operation of two pretrial diversion programs). 18 3 Shalia Dewan Andrew W.

In order to complete the program and avoid felony criminal prosecution, 2 participants in the marijuana diversion program must pay a fee of $950 or $1000. 9. Participants must also pay $15 or $17 for drug and alcohol tests up to 4 three times each week. 10. The program is two-tiered: people who meet program requirements— 6 completing a three-hour drug education seminar and routine drug and alcohol testing— 7 and are wealthy enough to pay the program fees complete the program in 90 days and 8 are no longer subject to felony criminal prosecution. 11. But participants who cannot pay the program fees are forced to stay in the 10 program for at least six months or until they can pay off the money owed to MCAO and 11 TASC, even if they have","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Arizona County Attorney's Office (MCAO) and the Treatment 23 Assessment Screening Center (TASC) jointly operate a possession of marijuana 24 diversion program that penalizes the poor because of their poverty.

This- action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 to vindicate the right of the 3 press and the public to attend, meanngfully observe, and gather and report on important 4 information at executions adminstered by the Californa Deparent of Corrections and 5 Rehabilitation and the Californa State Prison at San Quentin. This right is guaranteed by the 6 First and Foureenth Amendments ofthe United States Constitution and is primarly effectuated 7 by members of the press who are actually present at executions and who serve as surogates for 8 the press and the public at large. Plaintiff, a media organzation that reports on Californa 9 executions, seeks temporar, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the 10 defendants from executing any death row inmates in a maner that conceals important 11 information to which the public is constitutionally entitled. Defendants' use of pan cur onium 12 bromide, a paralytic agent that acts as a chemical curain over the lethal injection process, makes 13 it impossible for witnesses to determine whether death row inmates in California are being' 14 subjected to substantial and unecessar pain before dying. Pancuronium bromide also conceals 1. other aspects ofthe, dying process about which the public is entitled to know. This lawsuit is not 16 a bhuiket challenge to the death penalty or to all lethal injection executions. Rather, plaintiff 17 contends that Californa may not execute death row inmates in a maner that violates the First 18 Amendment rights of the press and of the public. The public requires information in order to 19 decide via democratic processes whether and how executions should be conducted. The First 20 Amendment claim, therefore, vindicates the public's right to gather information related to that' 21 decision-making process. 22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2.

Within a few months, the defendants changed their policy and submitted an Offer of Judgment. The case is now closed. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO Civil Action No. 18-cv-02593 MICKEY HOWARD Plaintiff, v. THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER, COLORADO Plaintiff Mickey Howard, by and through his counsel, Rebecca Wallace and Mark Silverstein of the AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION FOUNDATION OF COLORADO, respectfully alleges for his Complaint and Jury Demand as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. In the City and County of Denver (Denver), when a judge sets a monetary bond, Denver will release the defendant upon payment of that bond only if the defendant also pays a $50 bond fee. That means that even if the defendant can pay the monetary bond, Denver will not release the defendant if he cannot also pay the additional bond fee. Plaintiff Mickey Howard was a victim of this practice. In June of this year, he was arrested for alleged violations of municipal ordinances. The Denver judge set a $10 cash bond for his release, a sum Mr. Howard could pay Mr. Howard could not, however, pay the additional $50 bond fee that Denver’s policy required as an additional condition of his release. As a result, Mr. Howard spent four additional nights in jail until the Colorado Freedom Fund, a non-profit bail fund, paid the required fee and secured his release. While out on bond, Mr. Howard fulfilled all obligations related to his case, and Denver ultimately dismissed all of the charges against him Mr. Howard brings this case to seek compensation and to spur Denver to end the oppressive and irrational practices described herein. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. This civil rights action is authorized and instituted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331. 3. The events or omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in the District of Colorado, and at all relevant times the parties reside in the District. Venue is therefore proper under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b). PARTIES 4. Plaintiff Mickey Howard is a resident of Colorado. 5. Defendant, the City and County of Denver, Colorado, is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS Denver’s bond fee 6. A Denver ordinance establishes a $50 bond fee. Section 14-34 of the Denver Municipal Code states: “It shall be the duty of the judge or any officer or court clerk designated by the judge taking any such bond to assess and collect therefore a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each bond taken.” 7. The ordinance provides that the bond fee is to be collected as provided in Section 14-11, which directs that the fees are payable to the Denver Manager of Finance and are to be credited to Denver’s general fund. 8. Denver assesses the bond fee for all pretrial monetary bonds. 9. While not required by the Denver ordinance, pursuant to Denver’s policy and practice, the bond fee: a. is non-refundable regardless of the outcome of the criminal case or the defendant’s compliance with bond conditions; b. must be paid at the time the monetary bond is posted;1 and c. results in the defendant’s continued pretrial detention when left unpaid, even if the defendant has the means to post the monetary bond set by the court. 10. Denver commonly charges many other fees to criminal defendants, including, when applicable, court costs, a public defender fee, and pretrial supervision fees. Upon information and belief, inability to pay these fees does not cause the defendant to be jailed. Instead, Denver generally bills the defendant for these fees after release. If the defendant fails to pay by a specified time, Denver sends these debts to collections but does not jail the defendant for nonpayment.2 Denver selected only one fee – the bond fee – for mandatory payment in order for a defendant to secure release from jail. 1 See https://www.denvercountycourt.org/posting-bond/. 2 Since March 2009, Denver has contracted with Integral Recoveries to collect outstanding courtrelated debts, with a high rate of return. From 2009 through 2012, Integral Recoveries “helped the Court recover over $9.7 million, or 39 percent of funds it was referred,” a rate that “exceeded the Court’s expectations.” See Office of the Auditor Denver County Court Accounting Practices, Performance Audit (October 2013), at page 17, available at: 11. The predictable and inevitable result of Denver’s policy is that some individuals with low monetary bonds and limited resources, such as Mr. Howard, will be detained in jail pretrial solely because they are too poor to pay the $50 fee. Denver’s booking fee 12. A Denver ordinance permits Denver to collect a $30 booking fee for “committing and discharging convicted inmates to and from the county jail.” D.R.M.C. <unk>53-514.3 13. Colorado law requires that the fee “shall be refunded to any prisoner who is not convicted.” C.R.S. <unk>30-1-104(n).

7,CJ-DC-0002,"[ENTITYCHAIN] 2012 | U.S. District Court of D.C [SUMMARY] In 2012, U.S. District Court of D.C. found that the policy of seizing and retaining private vehicles pending civil forfeiture proceedings without providing a post-deprivation hearing was unconstitutional.","FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FREDERICK SIMMS, 2904 Plaintiff, MAY- 1 2012 CClerk. ourts U.s. oI<unk>stn<unk>et for the District V. THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, Office of the Attorney General 441 CATHY LANIER, CHIEF OF POLICE, 300 Indiana Avenue NW VINCENT GRAY, MAYOR 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 316 Ass1gn. Date 5/112012 Description: TRO/PI Defendants. COMPLAINT 1. Plaintiff Frederick Simms, by and through his attorneys, brings this action for injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendants the District of Columbia, the Chief of Police of the Metropolitan Police Department (""MPD""), and the Mayor of the District of Columbia from their unconstitutional policy of seizing private vehicles and retaining them indefinitely pending potential civil forfeiture proceedings, without providing property owners with a prompt, post-deprivation hearing before a neutral arbiter. 2 Mr. Simms alleges as follows, based on personal knowledge as to matters in which he has personal involvement and information and belief as to all other matters. Nature of the Action 3 Mr. Simms is a D.C. resident whose car was seized by MPD officers after MPD officers claimed to find a firearm in a bag inside the vehicle on May 29, 2011. 4 Mr. Simms was acquitted by a jury of all charges arising out of the incident on December 7, 2011. When Mr. Simms sought to retrieve his vehicle at the impoundment lot, he was informed by the MPD that police intended to attempt to take legal ownership of his car through the District's civil forfeiture laws. 5. D.C.'s civil forfeiture scheme does not provide for a prompt, post-deprivation hearing in which property owners can test the validity of the District's warrantless seizure of their vehicles, and can challenge the validity of the District's continued retention of the vehicle pending a determination on the merits of any forfeiture action. In accordance with MPD and District policy, Mr. Simms has received no such hearing since the seizure and impoundment of his car. 6 Mr. Simms was instead told that in order merely to challenge the forfeiture of his car, he must pay a bond of over $1,200 dollars to the MPD Mr. Simms applied for a waiver of the bond on account of indigence, submitting extensive financial records in support of his request. An MPD official reduced the bond to $800-an amount Mr. Simms cannot afford. 7. As a matter of District policy, payment of that sum is required before the District will even file its initial civil suit formally to forfeit the vehicle in Superior Court. Because Mr. Simms cannot pay the bond, he is afforded no opportunity to challenge the ultimate forfeiture of his car by the District. Under D.C.'s statutory civil forfeiture scheme and District policy, the MPD may sell the car at auction if the bond is not paid within 30 days of the owner receiving notice of the forfeiture. 8 Mr. Simms has suffered and continues to suffer grave hardships flowing from the loss of his car. He is experiencing difficulty taking his 11-month-old daughter to daycare and appointments. He was forced to move away from his mother's home in D.C. in order to rent an apartment nearer to his job in Sterling, Virginia. Eventually, he moved back to D.C. and now faces a daily commute of between one-and-a-half to two hours each way. And that job, which requires him to travel to several geographic locations, is in jeopardy because his employer requires employees to have a reliable vehicle. Moreover, he is forced to continue making loan payments on a car that is not is in his possession while paying additional costs associated with obtaining alternate transportation. 9. The District's policy of seizing vehicles pursuant to D.C's civil forfeiture statute without a prompt, post-deprivation opportunity to challenge the District's initial seizure and continued retention of the vehicle pending any potential forfeiture litigation violates Mr. Simms's right to procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 10. The District's policy that forces indigent property owners to pay a ""penal sum"" before even being able to commence the legal process to challenge the police seizure of their property violates Mr. Simms's right to due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 11 Mr. Simms seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Jurisdiction and Venue 12. This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, et seq., and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The case was assigned to Judge Richard W. Story. Represented by Strickland Brockington Lewis, LLP, and the Institute for Justice, the plaintiffs sued the City of Doraville under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 and the Declaratory Judgments Act. The plaintiffs alleged that the city’s policy and practice of using its law enforcement and municipal court system for revenue generation violated the plaintiffs' due process rights. The plaintiffs sought declarative and injunctive relief from Doraville’s policy and practice of budgeting to receive revenues from fines and fees. The defendant sought to dismiss the case on July 2, 2018; the court denied the motion to dismiss on July 9, 2019. This case is ongoing. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA ATLANTA DIVISION HILDA BRUCKER; JEFFERY THORNTON; JANICE CRAIG; and BYRON BILLINGSLEY, Plaintiffs, vs. THE CITY OF DORAVILLE, a Georgia municipal corporation, PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Defendant. Plaintiffs Hilda Brucker, Jeffery Thornton, Janice Craig, and Byron Billingsley, by their undersigned counsel, allege as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. This lawsuit is a constitutional challenge to a municipality’s policy and practice of using its law enforcement and municipal court system for revenue generation. 2. Courts, prosecutors, and law enforcement are public officials, entrusted with discretion over the cases they adjudicate or prosecute. 3. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that municipal courts cannot have, or appear to have, an independent interest, such as a financial interest, in obtaining convictions. 4. The U.S. Supreme Court has also stated that the government violates a defendant’s constitutional rights when prosecutors and law enforcement have a financial interest in convicting the defendant. 5. Therefore, a municipality may not use, or appear to use, its municipal court, municipal prosecutor, police department, or property code enforcement officers to generate revenue in order to fund the municipality, including those very departments and individuals. 6. But municipalities that budget to receive fines and forfeitures revenue do exactly that: They are using, or appearing to use, their municipal courts, prosecutors, police, and code enforcement officers to generate revenue. Municipalities that rely on such revenues to balance their budgets create financial incentives to ticket, convict, and fine defendants. These financial incentives are unconstitutional. 7. Defendant the City of Doraville budgets to receive millions of dollars from municipal court fines, fees, and forfeitures, which account for anywhere between about a fifth to about a third of its general operating revenues. 8. Doraville’s City Council heavily relies on these revenues to balance the City’s budget. 9. Therefore, Doraville’s municipal court personnel—who serve at the pleasure of Doraville’s City Council—have a financial incentive to convict defendants. 10. This financial incentive to convict infects Doraville’s municipal court with a bias or an appearance of bias in violation of the U.S. Constitution. 11. Moreover, Doraville law enforcement personnel—who are paid from Doraville’s revenues and serve at the ultimate pleasure of its City Council—have an incentive to ticket and prosecute to raise revenue. The same is true of the independent contractor whom Doraville employs to issue code enforcement tickets against property owners. 12. This financial incentive to ticket and prosecute injects an unconstitutional financial bias or an appearance of such bias into law enforcement and prosecutorial discretion. 13. Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Doraville’s policy and practice of budgeting for fines, fees, and forfeitures revenue, and vigorously ticketing and convicting both residents and passers-through in order to raise revenue, is unconstitutional. 14. Therefore, this lawsuit seeks a declaration and injunction against Doraville’s policy and practice of budgeting to receive revenues from fines, fees, and forfeitures. 15. Plaintiffs also seek a preliminary and permanent injunction restraining the city from acting in furtherance of any policy, practice, or custom that violates Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 16. Plaintiffs bring this civil-rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and the Declaratory Judgments Act, 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, for violations of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S Constitution. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief against defendant City of Doraville because the City’s financial incentive to ticket, convict, and fine plaintiffs, both facially and as-applied, violates plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. 17. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 (federal-question jurisdiction) and <unk>1343 (civil-rights jurisdiction). 18. Venue is appropriate in this Court under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b)(1) and LR 3.1, NDGa.

This case, which arises under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983, challenges the constitutionality of a legal scheme whereby individuals who have been convicted of certain sex-related crimes end up serving life sentences behind prison bars as the result of the interactions of various state laws and state agency regulations promulgated by three distinct entities—the Illinois legislature, the Prison Review Board (“PRB”), and the Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”). In particular, individuals convicted of sex-related crimes who are sentenced to three years to life of mandatory supervised release (“MSR”) find themselves stuck in prison for life as a result of the imposition of unmeetable restrictions on where they can live that must be satisfied in order for such individuals to be released on MSR. The challenged scheme results in what amounts to a Kafkaesque nightmare whereby these individuals are denied any semblance of proportionality in their prison sentences and due process of law. 2. This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the classes they seek to represent, allege violations of their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 3. As of the filing of this complaint, there are approximately 4,000 people imprisoned in the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been convicted of sex-related offenses for which state law imposes an indeterminate term of “three years to life” of Mandatory Supervised Release (“MSR”) (formerly known as parole). 4. As set forth below, Illinois laws severely restrict where individuals deemed sex offenders may live while on MSR. As a result, the vast majority of such prisoners are unable to find approved “host sites” at which to serve their MSR terms. Because of the unavailability of compliant housing, such prisoners are detained in the Illinois Department of Corrections long after they have served the term of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced. For individuals with indeterminate MSR sentences, their prison terms are in effect converted to sentences of lifetime imprisonment without any possibility of release. 5. The named Plaintiffs are individuals currently being held in the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been sentenced to serve “three years to life” MSR terms and are unable to find “host sites.” Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of two classes of similarly situated individuals (identified below), challenge the constitutionality of the statutory schemes that cause this severe deprivation of their constitutional right to liberty.

MARTINEZ, et al., Plaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF DODGE CITY, and FORD COUNTY Defendant. Case No. 15-CV-9344 (Class Action) CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Introduction This case is about Dodge City’s wealth-based post-arrest detention scheme, which operates to jail some of Dodge City’s poorest residents solely because they cannot pay an arbitrary amount of money. Named Plaintiff Lawrence Martinez was arrested yesterday and is currently imprisoned in the county jail solely because he is too poor to pay the amount of money generically set by the fixed “bail schedule” used by Dodge City. In Dodge City, arrestees face two different outcomes depending on their wealth status. Wealthy arrestees purchase their freedom by paying an arbitrary amount set by the bail schedule. Poor arrestees are stuck behind bars for 48 hours simply because they cannot afford to pay the City’s pre-determined sum of money. The amount of the bond is fixed and predetermined for each offense, ranging from $250–$2,500. Those arrestees who are too poor to afford several hundred dollars remain in jail because of their poverty for at least two days, at which time Dodge City typically releases them for free. In Defendants’ wealth-based detention scheme, the sole criterion determining whether a pretrial arrestee walks free or sits in jail is the amount of money she has. On behalf of the many other arrestees subjected to the City’s unlawful and ongoing wealth-based detention scheme, the named Plaintiff in this action challenges the use of an unlawful generic “bail schedule” that operates to detain poor arrestees while letting rich arrestees free. Dodge City’s wealth-based detention scheme has no place in a system that promises equal justice under law, and it violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution. By and through his attorneys and on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, the named Plaintiff seeks in this civil action the vindication of his fundamental rights, injunctive relief assuring that his rights and the rights of the other Class members will not continue to be violated, compensatory damages for injuries suffered, and a declaration that the City’s wealthbased detention practices are unlawful. Nature of the Action1 1. It is the policy and practice of the City of Dodge City to refuse to release arrestees from jail unless they pay a generic and arbitrary “bond” amount. That amount is between $250 and $2,500 for the minor misdemeanor cases prosecuted by the City.2 Because this sum is set generically by reference to the alleged offense of arrest, no individualized factors are considered, and anyone who cannot afford to pay is held in jail for at least two days. Plaintiff seeks declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief. Jurisdiction and Venue 2.

CLARK COUNTY, KENTUCKY Serve: Henry Branham County Judge-Executive County Courthouse 34 South Main -and- FRANK DOYLE, individually Serve: Office of Clark County Jailer 30 Wall Street DEFENDANTS. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT I. Introduction 1. Plaintiff David Jones files this class action complaint in his individual capacity and on behalf of all persons who, while incarcerated or detained at the Clark County Detention Center (“the Jail”), have been wrongfully deprived of their property without due process of law, and in violation of their clearly-established constitutional, statutory, and common law protections, by the policy, custom and/or practice at the Jail of charging persons admitted to the Jail – even those like Plaintiff who were subsequently proven innocent – for the costs of their incarceration. Such costs are routinely levied by the Jail despite the absence of a requirement by a sentencing court for reimbursement of the county for expenses incurred by reason of such person’s confinement, in violation of KRS <unk>441.265, and Plaintiff and the class’ constitutional and common law rights. 2. On information and belief, numerous persons admitted to the Jail have been subjected to deprivation of their cash and other property by operation of such policies, customs and/or practices and the wrongful conduct described below. On information and belief, such policies, customs and/or practices have caused consequential and special damages to some or all such persons in addition to the actual damages represented by the funds retained. II. Jurisdiction and Venue 3. Plaintiff, and all others similarly situated, seek recovery of actual and punitive damages from Defendants under federal, state, and common law. As Clark County, Kentucky is the location of all acts pertinent to Plaintiff’s claims, venue is proper in this Court. III. Parties 4. Plaintiff is a resident of Clark County. 5. Defendant Clark County, Kentucky, at all times mentioned herein, employed, was responsible for the establishment of policies either formally or by custom for, and was responsible for the employment, training, supervision and conduct of, Jailer Frank Doyle, and the officers and employees of the Jail. 6. Defendant Doyle, at all times mentioned herein, was the Clark County Jailer, and was responsible for the establishment of policies, customs and practices governing the employment, training, supervision and conduct of, officers and employees staffing the Jail, and the establishment of policies, customs and practices governing conduct and practices of the Jail’s officers and employees regarding, inter alia, property of persons like Plaintiff, and, on information and belief, individually participated in the wrongful conduct made the basis of this complaint. IV. Nature of Defendants’ Conduct 7. Defendants engaged in the conduct described below under color of state law, and in accordance with the policies, customs and practice of the County and the Jail. The offenses described below resulted from the failure of Defendants to employ qualified persons for positions of authority, and/or to properly or conscientiously train and supervise the conduct of such persons after their employment, and/or to promulgate appropriate operating policies and procedures either formally or by custom and practice to protect the constitutional, statutory, and common law rights of inmates in the Jail’s care and custody. Defendants created, approved or knowingly acquiesced in a policy, custom and/or practice under which constitutional, statutory and common law violations occurred, and/or promulgated operating policies and procedures either formally or by custom and practice which violate the constitutional, statutory, and common law rights of inmates in the Jail’s care and custody and after their release. Defendants’ conduct was intentional or grossly negligent, and was indicative not only of deliberate indifference to, but active malice and a total and reckless disregard for the constitutional, statutory, and common law rights of Plaintiff and the class, justifying an award of punitive damages in addition to the actual damages which Plaintiff and the class are entitled to recover. V. Class Action 8. Plaintiff brings this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23.01, et seq. of the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure. The class consists of all persons admitted to, incarcerated in, or released from the Jail who have been charged the costs of their confinement without an order of a sentencing court requiring that they reimburse the county for expenses incurred by reason of such person’s confinement. 9. Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of all class members. He is a member of the class and his claims are typical of the claims of all class members. Plaintiff will aggressively pursue the interests of the entirety of the class. Plaintiff’s interest in obtaining injunctive relief and actual, special, consequential and punitive damages for the violations of his statutory and common law rights and privileges are consistent with and not antagonistic of those of any other person within his class. 10.

The plaintiffs alleged that, in charging fees in addition to bail to be released from prison before trial, the defendant RHI had violated federal and state anti-racketeering law, their Due Process and Equal Protection rights, and the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The parties reached a private settlement, and the case was dismissed on February 20, 2020.","THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA HENRY AYO, and KAIASHA WHITE on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, v. CLEVE DUNN, Sr., REHABILITATION HOME INCARCERATION, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH, Defendants. Case No. 3:17-cv-526 COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION JURY DEMAND I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. For years, Defendant Rehabilitation Home Incarceration (“RHI”), a private organization purporting to provide pretrial supervision services, has profited off individuals in East Baton Rouge Parish by requiring them to pay hundreds of dollars to RHI to be released from jail—effectively holding them for ransom. This fee is the creation of RHI alone—it is not ordered by any court. Those who cannot afford the fee languish in jail for days, weeks, or even months as they and their loved ones scramble to pay off RHI. 2. This scheme is arranged by Cleve Dunn, Sr. (“Dunn”), RHI’s Chief Executive Officer, and officials with the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison (the “Prison”), who, at RHI’s direction, refuse to release individuals ordered to RHI supervision until they pay the initial fee. These officials do not inquire into an individual’s ability to pay RHI’s initial fee. 3. The practice occurs with the knowledge of Trudy White, a criminal court judge of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court of Louisiana (the “JDC”), who sets bond for arrestees and indiscriminately orders them to undergo supervision by RHI—often for indefinite periods of time before their cases go to trial. 4. After arrestees pay RHI’s initial fee and are released by the Prison, RHI continues to exact money from them, charging a $225 monthly fee and additional fees for requirements such as classes and ankle monitoring. RHI and Dunn wrongfully use the threat of arrest by East Baton Parish Rouge law enforcement or RHI officials, as well as the threat of bond revocation by the JDC and additional jailing at the Prison, to coerce payment. 5. Plaintiffs Kaiasha White and Henry Ayo bring this class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983, the Louisiana and federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Acts (RICO), and other state causes of action against Defendants Dunn, RHI”, and East Baton Rouge Parish (“the Parish”). Defendant Dunn regularly commits predicate acts under RICO–extorting money from Plaintiffs and the proposed Class—by wrongfully detaining them in jail until they pay RHI’s initial fee, then threatening them with additional jailing if they fail to satisfy RHI’s continuing demands for money once released. Plaintiffs seek actual and treble damages to compensate them and the proposed Class for the injuries they have sustained, and continue to sustain, because of Defendant Dunn’s extortionate activities. 6. Plaintiffs Ayo and White and the proposed Class also seek damages from East Baton Rouge Parish and RHI for their policy and practice of detaining Plaintiffs and proposed Class members in the Prison until they paid RHI’s initial fee, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantees of due process and equal protection and their Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures. 7. Finally, Plaintiffs Ayo and White individually seek damages from RHI under the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act for RHI’s harmful and oppressive commercial practices, and, on behalf of themselves and the proposed Class, seek damages from RHI for conversion and unjust enrichment under state law. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 8. This is a civil class action arising under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983, 18 U.S.C. <unk>1964, the United States Constitution, and Louisiana law. 9.

(Complaint: Class Action) CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Introduction Despite longstanding Supreme Court precedent that the Government cannot imprison people just because they are poor, New Orleans officials routinely use jail and threats of jail to collect court debts from thousands of the City’s poorest people. The result is an illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust modern debtors’ prison. To make matters worse, officials in the Collections Department of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court have admitted under oath that they have been issuing arrest warrants for unpaid debts by signing themselves the signatures of judges without first presenting any information to the judge or even notifying the judge.1 The Defendants use their unconstitutional scheme of arresting and jailing people for their inability to pay and keeping them in jail until they come up with money to fund themselves off the backs of New Orleans’ poorest. The Plaintiffs in this case are each victims of this illegal scheme. They each live in poverty and each has been jailed for unpaid or late court debts. Although the Plaintiffs pleaded 1 See Transcript of Evidentiary Hearing in State of Louisiana v. Michael Addison, No. 426-246J, Jan. 30, 2015, attached as Exhibit 1. that they were unable to pay due to their indigence, they were all arrested on an illegal warrant, and all languished in jail for nonpayment without receiving notice of how or when they would be released or when a hearing would be held. None was afforded the inquiry into their ability to pay that the United States Constitution requires. Once locked in jail, each person was told that they had no court date set and that they would not be released until they paid the entirety of their debts or posted a preset $20,000 secured money bond.2 No inquiry was made into their individual circumstances, their ability to pay, or whether they constituted a danger to the community or a risk of flight prior to the setting of this secured money bond. Some languished in jail for days and others remained locked up for weeks. The environment of threats of jail and actual jailing creates a culture of fear among indigent people and their families, who borrow money at high interest rates, divert money from food for their children, and cash their family members’ disability checks in a desperate attempt to pay the Collections Department to avoid indefinite confinement. The policies and practices that led to the jailing of the Plaintiffs and to the creation of a local debtors’ prison are part of a broader breakdown of fairness and neutrality in the local criminal legal system, where financial conflicts of interest have derailed the pursuit of justice. When an indigent defendant appears in court, every government entity—the jailor who brought her there, the lawyer assigned to represent her, the prosecutor arguing against her, and the judge ruling on her case—funds its own budget in part based on the decisions made in her case. Each of them takes a percentage of every money bond that is required for release after arrest. Each also partially funds their own budgets","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2015 | Orleans Parish | New Orleans | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of Louisiana ||| In 2014, a group of New Orleans residents filed a class action lawsuit against the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, alleging that the court's practice of issuing arrest warrants for unpaid court debts was unconstitutional and violated the Constitution.

Case No. 19-cv-13553 (Class Action) CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 1. Defendants, the Judges of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, are responsible for setting conditions of release for people who are arrested and charged with certain crimes in Orleans Parish. Defendants consistently and unlawfully impose secured financial conditions of release in an amount that individuals cannot afford, without any inquiry into or findings concerning their ability to pay or alternatives to incarceration. As a result, the moneybased orders of post-arrest release that they impose constitute de facto orders of pretrial detention for those unable to pay — orders that are issued without the legal and factual findings and procedures required for a valid order of pretrial detention. See Caliste v. Cantrell, 329 F. Supp. 2. Defendants have an institutional financial conflict of interest in every secured money bond that they impose because they act both as supposedly neutral judicial officers and as executives responsible for managing the funds generated by each bail order that they set. Louisiana law provides that if (and only if) an arrestee uses a commercial surety to secure pretrial release, the judges of the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (“OPCDC”) receive 1.8% of the amount of that bond into the court’s Judicial Expense Fund,1 which Defendant Judges control. 3. These policies and practices result in imminent and ongoing violations of fundamental rights.

Case No. 20-cv-843 (Class Action) CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 1. Every day in Baton Rouge, presumptively innocent people are confined in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison (“EBRPP” or “Jail”) simply because they are too poor to pay for their freedom. Hundreds of people—the vast majority of whom are poor and Black—are condemned to remain restrained in the Jail for weeks, months, or even years. They are locked in the Jail until either they have their day in the 19th Judicial District Court (“19th JDC”) or, more likely, accept a plea that allows them to escape custody and return to their lives. This system inflicts devastating harm on people solely because of their poverty and violates the most fundamental of American axioms, that all people are equal under the law and are innocent until they are found guilty. 2. The Judges and Commissioners of the Criminal Division of the 19th JDC (collectively, “the Judicial Defendants”) are responsible for setting conditions of release for people who are arrested and charged with certain crimes in East Baton Rouge Parish. They consistently and unlawfully impose secured financial conditions of release (including what is commonly known as cash bail) in an amount that individuals cannot afford, without any inquiry into or findings concerning the individual’s ability to pay or alternatives to incarceration. As a result, the payment-based conditions of release that the Judicial Defendants impose constitute de facto orders of pretrial detention for those who lack the financial means necessary to pay. These pretrial detention orders are issued without the legal and factual findings and procedures required for valid orders of pretrial detention. 3. Sheriff Sid J. Gautreaux, III, and Warden Dennis Grimes (collectively, “the Sheriff Defendants”) implement a policy of detaining people under the Judicial Defendants’ unconstitutional bail orders. Because Plaintiffs are indigent and cannot pay their bail, the Sheriff Defendants continue to confine them in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison, the local pretrial detention facility. If Plaintiffs could pay the amount of money required by the Judicial Defendants, then the Sheriff Defendants would release them immediately. Plaintiffs do not have the financial means to pay this amount of money, and so they are forced to remain in jail. By continuing to hold detained people under the Judicial Defendants’ unconstitutional bail orders, the Sheriff Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ and the putative class members’ constitutional rights. 4. On behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, the named Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief against the Defendants. Plaintiffs seek an order enjoining the Defendants from operating their wealth-based post-arrest detention policies and practices and requiring the immediate release of each Plaintiff. They also seek a declaration that the Defendants violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when they set secured financial conditions of release without an inquiry into ability to pay or consideration of non-financial alternatives, which results in jailing poor members of the community for no reason other than their poverty while allowing release from jail for their similarly situated counterparts who have greater financial means.

The plaintiff objected to the three-drug cocktail (sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in Maryland's lethal injections. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's lethal injection procedures arbitrarily and unnecessarily created a grave risk that he would suffer extreme pain during his execution, thus violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

The plaintiff also filed a similar complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleging that the defendants failed to follow Maryland law because the execution protocol had not been adopted under the Maryland Administrative Procedures Act (MAPA). 

On December 19, 2006 the Maryland Court of Appeals invalidated the Maryland execution protocols until such time as they were properly adopted under MAPA or exempted from that requirement by an act of the Maryland General Assembly. On January 29, 2007, two bills were introduced in the Maryland General Assembly, one that would exempt the death penalty protocols from the MAPA requirement and one that would repeal the death penalty in the state. The judge agreed to stay the proceedings of this case pending the outcome of the legislation. According to the status report on March 14, 2011, all executions in Maryland had been stayed until the proper administrative regulations were adopted. On August 16, 2012 this case was administratively closed. In May 2013 the Maryland legislature repealed the death penalty for all future convictions and in December 2014 Governor O'Malley commuted the death sentences of the four remaining death-row inmates to life without the possibility of parole.

INTRODUCTION 1. In the first quarter of 2020, the United States economy suffered its most severe contraction in more than a decade. As the threat of the novel coronavirus mushroomed into the country’s gravest public health crisis in a century, businesses were forced to shutter. 2. Small-business owners, in particular, faced a dire struggle for survival. According to federal data, between February and April, the total number of active business owners plummeted by 22%,1 the “largest drop on record.”2 By comparison, from the start to end of the Great Recession, the number of business owners decreased by 730,000—only a 5% reduction.3 3. The shutdowns hit business owners of color especially hard: 41% of African-American-owned businesses and 32% of Latinx-owned businesses disappeared between February and April 2020 alone.4 4. The cascading waves of closures and layoffs caused the national unemployment rate to soar to 14.7% in April, its highest peak since the Great 1 Hannah Knowles, Number of Working Black Business Owners Falls 40 Percent, Far More Than Other Groups Amid Coronavirus, Wash.

In the midst of the fallout, Congress stepped in to keep the economy on life support. The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020. The Act, in part, created a $669 billion small business grant program called the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). 6.

THE CITY OF FERGUSON Defendant. Case No. ___4_:1_5_-_cv_-_2_5_3_____ (Jury Trial Demanded) CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Introduction 1. The Plaintiffs in this case are each impoverished people who were jailed by the City of Ferguson because they were unable to pay a debt owed to the City from traffic tickets or other minor offenses. In each case, the City imprisoned a human being solely because the person could not afford to make a monetary payment. Although the Plaintiffs pleaded that they were unable to pay due to their poverty, each was held in jail indefinitely and none was afforded a lawyer or the inquiry into their ability to pay that the United States Constitution requires. Instead, they were threatened, abused, and left to languish in confinement at the mercy of local officials until their frightened family members could produce enough cash to buy their freedom or until City jail officials decided, days or weeks later, to let them out for free. 2. Once locked in the Ferguson jail, impoverished people owing debts to the City endure grotesque treatment. They are kept in overcrowded cells; they are denied toothbrushes, toothpaste, and soap; they are subjected to the constant stench of excrement and refuse in their congested cells; they are surrounded by walls smeared with mucus and blood; they are kept in the same clothes for days and weeks without access to laundry or clean underwear; they step on top of other inmates, whose bodies cover nearly the entire uncleaned cell floor, in order to access a single shared toilet that the City does not clean; they develop untreated illnesses and infections in open wounds that spread to other inmates; they endure days and weeks without being allowed to use the moldy shower; their filthy bodies huddle in cold temperatures with a single thin blanket even as they beg guards for warm blankets; they are not given adequate hygiene products for menstruation; they are routinely denied vital medical care and prescription medication, even when their families beg to be allowed to bring medication to the jail; they are provided food so insufficient and lacking in nutrition that inmates lose significant amounts of weight; they suffer from dehydration out of fear of drinking foul smelling water that comes from an apparatus on top of the toilet; and they must listen to the screams of other inmates languishing from unattended medical issues as they sit in their cells without access to books, legal materials, television, or natural light. Perhaps worst of all, they do not know when they will be allowed to leave. 3. These physical abuses and deprivations are accompanied by other pervasive humiliations. Jail guards routinely taunt impoverished people when they are unable to pay for their release, telling them that they will be released whenever jail staff “feels” like letting them go. As described in detail below, jail guards routinely and pervasively laugh at the inmates and humiliate them with discriminatory and degrading epithets. For example, when filthy and shivering women were forced to share blankets to stay warm, officers shouted at the women that they were “stanky ass dykes” and “dirty whores.” 4. City officials and employees—through their conduct, decisions, training and lack of training, rules, policies, and practices—have built a municipal scheme designed to brutalize, to punish, and to profit. The architecture of this illegal scheme has been in place for many years.1 5. In 2014, the City of Ferguson issued an average of more than 3.6 arrest warrants per household and almost 2.2 arrest warrants for every adult, mostly in cases involving unpaid debt for tickets.2 The City of Ferguson issues more arrest warrants per capita than any other city in Missouri larger than 10,000 residents. If the rest of the Saint Louis metropolitan area generated revenue from its courts at the rate done by relatively low-income Ferguson, it would have made nearly $1.3 billion in the past five years. 6. The City’s modern debtors’ prison scheme has been increasingly profitable to the City of Ferguson, earning it millions of dollars over the past several years. It has also devastated the City’s poor, trapping them for years in a cycle of increased fees, debts, extortion, and cruel jailings. The families of indigent people borrow money to buy their loved ones out of jail at rates set arbitrarily by jail officials, only for them later to owe more money to the City of Ferguson from increased fees and surcharges. Thousands of people like the Plaintiffs take money from their disability checks or sacrifice money that is desperately needed by their families for food, diapers, clothing, rent, and utilities to pay ever increasing court fines, fees, costs, and surcharges.

","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI EASTERN DIVISION KELLEN POWELL, et al. Plaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF ST. ANN, Defendant. Case No. (Class Action) CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Introduction This case is about the City of St. Ann jailing some of its poorest people and the poorest people in the St. Louis region because they cannot pay a small amount of money. Kellen Powell was arrested on May 21, 2015 and iscurrently imprisoned by the City because he cannot afford to pay the amount of money generically set by the City of St. Annand its police department. In St. Ann, most people arrested for minor ordinance violations are released immediately upon payment of a small cash bond. The amount of the bond ranges from $150-$350 depending on the offense. If a person is charged with multiple offenses, the fixed amount for each offense is added together to determine the total amount of cash required for release.Those arrestees who are too poor to afford $150remain in jail because of their poverty for at least three days, at which time St. Ann typically releases them for free. On behalf of the many other arrestees subjected to the City’s unlawful and ongoing post- arrest money-based detention scheme, the named Plaintiff challenges in this action the use of an unlawful generic bail that operates to detain only the most impoverished minor arrestees. The City’s policy has no place in modern American law. By and through his attorneys and on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, the named Plaintiff seeks in this civil action the vindication of his fundamental rights, injunctive relief assuring that his rights and the rights of the other Class members will not continue to be violated, and a declaration that the City’s conduct is unlawful. Nature of the Action1 1. It is the policy and practice of the City of St. Ann to refuse to release ordinance violation arrestees from jail unless they pay a generically set “bond” amount. That amount is $150 for most ordinance violations and $300 for Driving While Suspended.2 Because this sum is set generically by reference to the alleged offense of arrest, no individualized factors are considered, and anyone who cannot afford to pay is held in jail until they see a judge, which can be more than a week. Plaintiff seeks declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief. Jurisdiction and Venue 2. This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, et seq., and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343. 3. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391. Parties 1 Plaintiff makes the allegations in this Complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which he has had personal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters. 2 Felony and misdemeanor arrestees are not subject to the jurisdiction of the City of St. Ann and are instead processed according to policies adopted by the State of Missouri. 4. Named Plaintiff Kellen Powell is a 33-year-old homeless resident of St. Louis County. He represents himself as an individual and a Class of similarly situated people all subject to the City’s post-arrest money-based detention scheme. 5. Defendant City of St. Ann is a municipal corporation organized under the laws of the State of Missouri. The City operates the St. Ann Police Department and the St. Ann Municipal Court. Factual Background A. The Named Plaintiff’s Arrest 6. Kellen Powell is a 33 year old homeless citizen of St. Louis County. 7 Mr. Powell was arrested by St. Ann police on May 21, 2015 St. Ann court and St. Ann jail refuse to give out information confirming charges. Upon information and belief, Mr. Powell was charged with the failure to display a license plate and driving while suspended. He was arrested on these new charges. 8 Mr. Powell was taken to jail and told that he would be released if he paid cash to the City of St. Annin the amount of $300. He was told that he would be kept in jail until Thursday May 28, 2015 unless he paid $300. See Exhibit 1, Declaration of Kellen Powell. 9 Mr. Powell is indigent. He is employed part-time earning less than $300 per week at the time of his arrest. He does not own any real property. 10 Mr. Powell is currently homeless. 11. He has not been brought to court for an initial appearance. The earliest that Mr. Powell would be brought to court for a first appearance is May 28, 2015 nearly a week after his arrest. Pursuant to City policy, he must remain incarcerated because he is too poor to buy his freedom. B. The City’s Policies and Practices 12.

Case No. 4:16-cv-1302 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT (Jury Trial Demanded) INTRODUCTION 1. The Defendant Municipalities, through their police departments, municipal court systems, city prosecuting attorneys’ offices, and jails, have terrorized the named Plaintiffs and many thousands of others through a deliberate and coordinated conspiracy established and implemented to fill the Municipalities’ coffers by extorting money from thousands of poor, disproportionately African-American people in the St. Louis region, creating a modern-day police state and debtors’ prison scheme that has no place in American society. 2. The scheme reflects an extraordinary abuse of governmental authority, starting with the over-policing of low income communities of color and the issuance of excessive citations for traffic and other minor municipal code violations, followed by arbitrary fines, penalties, surcharges, and interest charges that pile up like debts to a loan-shark, arrest warrants auto-generated without good cause or even a semblance of due process, and imprisonment— imposed without assistance of counsel—in squalid debtors’ prisons. The Defendants’ unconstitutional revenue-generation scheme disproportionately targets African-American residents, placing jobs at risk, leaving children without supervision, and debasing fundamental human rights, for as long as it takes to strong-arm payment from Plaintiffs and others. 3. Plaintiffs are a group of similarly situated individuals who are victims of the Defendants’ predatory scheme. Each of these human beings was locked in a cage by or on behalf of one or more of the 13 municipalities named as Defendants in this lawsuit (the “Defendant Municipalities”) solely because he or she was unable to afford a cash payment. And each was left to languish in filthy, often overcrowded jail cells because he or she could not afford to pay the jacked-up fines, penalties, and other charges that Defendants assessed. Defendants did not inquire about, much less accommodate, the hardships their extortionate demands placed on Plaintiffs and their families. Nor did Defendants offer to provide Plaintiffs with counsel who could advise them of their rights or otherwise protect them from Defendants’ predatory scheme.1 1 The architecture of this illegal scheme has been in place for many years. See, e.g., T.E. Lauer, Prolegomenon to Municipal Court Reform in Missouri, 31 Mo L Rev. 69, 88 (1966) (“[I]t seems that many citizens of the state are being confined needlessly in our city jails....”); id. at 85 (“[I]t is disgraceful that we do not appoint counsel in our municipal courts to represent indigent persons accused of ordinance violations.”); id. at 90 (“It is clear that many 4. Defendants’ officials and employees—through their conduct, decisions, training, rules, policies, practices, and procedures—constructed and implemented this unified, conspiratorial scheme for the overriding purpose of raising municipal revenue (and not for any legitimate law enforcement purpose). In 2015 alone, the Defendant Municipalities issued an average of 1.7 arrest warrants per household and one (1) arrest warrant for every adult, mostly for allegedly unpaid debt in connection with tickets supposedly involving traffic violations and other petty offenses.2 5. Defendants gained the coercive leverage to effectuate their scheme by resurrecting a modern analogue of debtors’ prisons—an institution this country rejected as inhumane more than a century ago. That leverage has made Defendants’ scheme increasingly profitable, generating millions of dollars of revenue over the past several years. Defendants’ law enforcement and municipal court practices focus on maximizing revenue, rather than promoting public safety, administering justice, or providing the bare rudiments of due process. Defendants are forcing the poorest and most vulnerable citizens to finance a municipal system that is a tool of injustice and oppression. 6. As a result, this scheme has targeted and persecuted people who live in or travel through Defendants’ municipal borders, trapping them for years in a cycle of escalating fees, intractable debt, and imprisonment. In particular, Defendants’ scheme has preyed on the most vulnerable, those living in or near poverty, who are least able to bear, or to avoid, the extortionate costs Defendants have imposed. municipalities have at times conceived of their municipal courts in","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] October 2018 | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of Missouri ||| City of St. Louis ||| October 2019 ||| In October 2018, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District Of Missouri on behalf of thousands of poor, disproportionately African-American residents who were locked in squalid debtors' prisons because they could not afford to pay municipal fines and penalties.

Holland, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, and Plaintiff Lexington National Insurance Corporation (collectively “Plaintiffs”), bring this action against Defendants Kelly Rosen, Mary Colalillo, and Christopher S. Porrino (collectively “Defendants”), and allege the following: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Plaintiff Holland stands accused but unconvicted of a crime. Under bedrock principles of American law, he is presumed innocent. And like all innocent people, he is presumptively entitled to liberty from any pre-trial restraint. 2. For centuries, the mechanism for ensuring a defendant’s liberty from pre-trial restraint was monetary bail. A person accused but unconvicted of a bailable offense could not be subject to any pre-trial deprivation of liberty without the option of bail, unless the government showed that no amount of money would serve the government’s interest in securing the defendant’s future appearance (or, more recently, that detention was necessary to protect the community from danger). Bail is thus a liberty-preserving mechanism as old as the Republic. 3. The availability of bail is enshrined in the Bill of Rights. The Eighth Amendment forbids “[e]xcessive bail,” a protection that presupposes the option of bail. And the vast majority of state constitutions throughout American history, including New Jersey’s, have likewise guaranteed defendants (in all but capital cases) the option of bail before being subjected to pre-trial deprivations of liberty. 4. The option of bail to avoid pre-trial deprivations of liberty no longer exists in New Jersey. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act (“CJRA”), which took effect January 1, 2017, New Jersey courts may not consider releasing a defendant on bail unless they first conclude that no combination of non-monetary conditions— including substantial deprivations of pre-trial liberty like home detention or 24-hour electronic monitoring through an “ankle bracelet”—will ensure the defendant’s appearance at trial. Thus, no matter how much an accused would prefer posting bail and securing his liberty, New Jersey law mandates that home detention or an electronic monitoring device be imposed instead. 5. Plaintiff Holland’s experience is illustrative. He was arrested after an alleged bar fight and charged with assault. He has a job, a supportive family, a residence in the community, and part-time custody of his son. Given his ties to the community and lack of a criminal record, he would have been eligible for release on bail before New Jersey’s enactment of the CJRA. And he could have paid a nonexcessive amount of bail to secure his future appearance, likely with the help of a surety company like Plaintiff Lexington National. He then would have enjoyed his full pre-trial liberty, just like any other presumptively innocent member of society. 6. Instead, under the CJRA, the court never had the option to set bail, let alone to give Plaintiff Holland the opportunity to post it. Instead, relying on a new “risk assessment tool,” the court concluded that Plaintiff Holland’s appearance could be secured by a set of restrictive non-monetary conditions, including home detention, an electronic monitor that he must wear around his ankle constantly and that tracks his movement 24 hours a day, and a requirement that he report to the pretrial services office every two weeks—even if it disrupts his job. As a result, Plaintiff Holland’s liberty is sharply curtailed. Among other things, he cannot shop for food or basic necessities and cannot take his son to baseball practice, an important aspect of his custodial responsibilities and his efforts to bond with his child. 7.

More than seventy years ago, a unanimous Supreme Court held that only the judgment of a court establishes a defendant's sentence, and that imposition of an e)(tra-judicial sentence violates a defendant's constitutional rights. Hill v. United States ex reI. Wampler, 298 U.S. 460 (1936) (Cardozo, 1.). 2. Consistent with Wampler, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that the imposition of an extra-judicial sentence of post-release supervision (""PRS"") by the New York State Department of Correctional Services (""DOCS"") and the New York State Division of Parole (""DOP"") violated clearly established law. Earley v. Murray, 451 F.3d 71 (2d Cir. 2006). 3. Notwithstanding the unambiguous command of Wampler and Earley, defendants continued to administratively impose and enforce PRS on individuals such as plaintiff Betances, and thousands of others, whose sentences never included PRS (the ""PRS Policy""). And, if imposing illegal and onerous supervision terms and collecting supervision fees were not enough, DOCS has also imprisoned individuals, such as plaintiff Betances, who are accused of violating PRS conditions. 4. Plaintiff Betances brings this action for injunctive and declaratory relief, and for compensatory and punitive damages, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated whose judicially imposed sentence(s) did not include a term ofPRS, but whom nevertheless have been, subjected to PRS and/or incarcerated after the maximum expiration date of their determinate sentence(s).

Plaintiff Paul Betances ""plead guilty to Robbery in the First Degree and with a promised sentence of five years incarceration"" on or about July 20, 2004. Consistent with that agreement, Mr. Betances was sentenced to ""a detenninate tenn of five years."" Mr. Betances was not sentenced to PRS.

Introduction 1. In 1980, Tulsa County concluded that “it violated a defendant’s 14th Amendment rights to be held in jail if they were too poor to post bail.”1 Tulsa County Court Services, https://www.tulsacounty.org/Tulsacounty/dynamic.aspx?id=642 (last visited, June 4, 2018). History, 2. In 2018, hundreds of people are detained in the Tulsa County Jail every day solely because they cannot afford to purchase their liberty. 3. Named Plaintiffs are currently confined in Tulsa County jail cells solely because they do not have enough money to purchase their pretrial release. They are jailed pursuant to Tulsa County’s wealth-based detention scheme, which jails people who are unable to meet secured financial conditions of release. No official has conducted any inquiry into any Plaintiffs’ ability to pay or made any inquiry into or findings concerning alternative conditions of pretrial release or the necessity of pretrial detention. Because they cannot access the payments Defendants require for their release, the presumptively innocent Plaintiffs will be detained in the Tulsa County Jail for days, weeks, or months. 4. On behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, the named Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the Defendants. After arresting a person, Defendants require secured financial conditions of release, almost always according to a predetermined chart of offenses and corresponding dollar amounts. They do not provide any process for assessing a person’s ability to pay or determining the necessity of imposing monetary conditions of release in any individual case. People who are arrested and are unable to pay preset cash deposits to secure their release must remain in jail cells for six or more days before an arraignment, which is the first appearance in front of a judicial officer. Those who cannot afford private counsel are not appointed counsel during the initial period of wealth-based detention, and no lawyer appears with them at arraignment. Defendants refuse to address conditions of release at arraignments. 5. Defendants’ routine practice of requiring people to pay unattainable amounts of money to secure their release is the equivalent of issuing orders of detention against them, but without any of the substantive findings or procedural safeguards constitutionally required for orders of detention. As a result of Defendants’ policies, people too poor to pay for their release are jailed for days, weeks, or months. This automatic pretrial detention of poor people has devastating consequences: people who are arrested lose their jobs, are evicted from their homes, endure separation from their children and loved ones, and face pressure to plead guilty as soon as possible because that is often the quickest way to terminate their unlawful confinement. Plaintiffs seek an order declaring that this wealthbased detention scheme violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and an order enjoining Defendants from continuing its operation. Nature of the Action2 6. Defendants have a policy and practice of refusing to release arrested people from custody unless they pay money. The amount of money required is predetermined in almost all cases by an offense-based, secured money-bail “schedule.” Defendants require payment of a generic, predetermined amount without considering a person’s ability to pay or the necessity of imposing secured money bail, and without making the substantive findings or providing the procedural safeguards that the United States Constitution and Oklahoma law require to ensure that pretrial detention is necessary to further a compelling government interest. 2 Plaintiffs make the allegations in this Complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which they have had personal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters. 7. This policy and practice results in the systemic wealth-based detention of arrested people who are too poor to pay financial conditions of release.

The plaintiffs sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), alleging that the defendant, RealPage, Inc., adopted and maintained a policy and practice of failing to timely update the criminal record information it maintained so as to eliminate records of cases that have been expunged, thus not accurately reflecting the final disposition of these cases. Moreover, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant systematically violated FCRA by failing to provide complete and accurate disclosures of all information the defendant maintains about consumers to these consumers upon request. The parties settled, and the defendant agreed to provide consumers additional information about federal agencies responsible for enforcing FCRA, refrain from including expunged criminal records in tenant screening reports, and disclose the names of vendors who retrieved criminal record information to consumers, plus damages. The settlement term ended in 2020, and the case is now closed. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA HELEN STOKES, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, Plaintiff, vs. REALPAGE, INC. Defendant. CLASS ACTION JURY TRIAL DEMANDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT I. Preliminary Statement 1. This is a consumer class action brought for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. <unk>1681-1681x (FCRA). Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of consumers nationwide who have been the subject of misleading and inaccurate background reports sold by the Defendant RealPage, Inc. (RealPage) to landlords. In violation of FCRA section 1681e(b), Defendant has adopted and maintained a policy and practice of failing to timely update the criminal record information it maintains to eliminate records of cases that have been expunged, thus not accurately reflecting the final disposition of these cases. Furthermore, Defendant systemically violates FCRA section 1681g(a) by failing to provide complete and accurate disclosures of all information Defendant maintains about consumers to those consumers upon request. Defendant’s practices harms consumers seeking residential leases by prejudicing their prospective landlords with inaccurate adverse information, depriving consumers of valuable congressionally-mandated information, and harms interstate commerce as a whole. II. Parties 2. Plaintiff Helen Stokes is an adult individual who resides in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 3. Defendant RealPage, Inc. is a consumer reporting agency that regularly conducts business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and which maintains a principal place of business at 4000 International Parkway, #1000, Carrolton, TX 75007-1913. III. Jurisdiction and Venue 4. Jurisdiction of this Court arises under 15 U.S.C. <unk>1681p and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331. 5. Venue lies properly in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b). IV. Factual Allegations A. Defendant’s Practices As A Consumer Reporting Agency 6. At all times pertinent hereto, RealPage was a consumer reporting agency (CRA) as defined by section 1681a(f) of the FCRA. 7. Among other things, the FCRA regulates the collection, maintenance, and disclosure of consumer credit report information by CRAs, including public record information. 8. Defendant obtains distilled and incomplete public record information, including criminal record history, from third party databases and courthouses and maintains such data in consumer files that it creates and assembles. 9. Defendant sells such consumer files to landlords wishing to investigate the background of consumers applying for residential leases. 10. As a CRA, Defendant is required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 15 U.S.C. <unk>1681e(b). 11. Further, the FCRA unambiguously requires CRAs such as Defendant to clearly and accurately disclose to consumer all information that the CRA maintains about them, including the sources that supplied the information. 15 U.S.C. <unk>1681g(a); Cortez v. Trans Union, LLC, 617 F.3d 688, 711-12 (3d Cir. 2010); Dennis v. Trans Union, LLC, 2014 WL 5325231 (E.D Pa Oct. 20, 2014). 12. Defendant does not, however, maintain reasonable procedures designed to assure maximum possible accuracy. Based upon a common policy and practice, Defendant regularly and illegally reports criminal records that have been expunged, sealed, or otherwise removed by court order. In some situations, the report of an expunged case deprives the individual of a report that he has no criminal record. 13. Defendant also fails, as a matter of common policy and procedure, to provide consumers who request file disclosures with all information Defendant maintains about the requesting consumer, including never disclosing to consumers the source of the criminal record information it collects and reports about them. 14. Defendant’s practices not only violate the FCRA as a matter of law, the practices exact serious consequences on consumer job applicants and interstate commerce. Consumers who have obtained the deletion of negative background history are prejudiced in their ability to obtain leased housing despite the fact that negative information no longer appears in the public record, and are deprived of complete information regarding the nature and source(s) of the information Defendant maintains and sells about them. B. The Experience Of The Representative Plaintiff 15. Helen Stokes is 63 years old. She never had any criminal justice involvement until September, 2008, after which she was arrested twice on criminal charges that arose from her deteriorating marriage. 16. In September of 2008, Ms. Stokes was arrested in connection with a domestic dispute and charged with aggravated assault and other lesser charges. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. 17. In June of 2010, Ms. Stokes was arrested for theft offenses after taking her husband’s ATM card from their joint bank account. The charges were subsequently withdrawn. 18.

Plaintiff also alleged that Defendant failed to provide complete and accurate disclosures of all information Defendant maintains about consumers to those consumers upon request. On October 2015, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiff. On January 2016, the parties entered a consent decree, which required RealPage to comply with the terms of the consent decree. On March 2020, the parties agreed to the following terms: The consent decree requires the defendant to post a notice on its website about its policies and procedures regarding criminal record removal and disclosure.

The plaintiff alleged that a local rule which required it to agree to garnishment of judgment fees from bail bonds before it could post bail for indigent arrestees violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution and threatened its ability to operate as a non-profit. The District Judge granted a preliminary injunction in March 2020 enjoining the County Criminal Court Clerk from garnishing fees from bonds posted by the Bail Fund. In December 2020, the District Judge approved a consent decree where the Bail Fund and the County Government agreed to make the injunction permanent. The matter is ongoing as the parties are litigating over who should pay attorneys fees and how much.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE NASHVILLE DIVISION The Nashville Community Bail Fund, Case No. Plaintiff, v Hon. Howard Gentry, Criminal Court Clerk; in his official capacity; Defendant. COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Low-income people arrested and jailed in Davidson County face an unconscionable choice: endure the irreparable harm of pretrial confinement, or struggle to post bail, typically through a commercial surety company that requires a substantial, non-refundable deposit. Every day in Davidson County, hundreds of people remain in jail pretrial simply because they cannot pay an upfront money bail requirement. Pretrial incarceration devastates the individuals detained, their families, and their community. These negative consequences are well established: detention exposes people to violence and unsanitary conditions, stigmatizes them, and renders family and work responsibilities nearly impossible. 2. Unfortunately, accessing the money necessary to pay bail is not the only hurdle persons in Davidson County jails face to exercise their fundamental liberty interest. Local officials further use the pretrial bail system to collect fines and fees from arrested individuals, their families, and other third parties. Under Davidson County Local Rule Governing Bail Bonds 10(B), Defendant Criminal Court Clerk Howard Gentry garnishes cash bond deposits to collect judgment debts from court costs, fines, and restitution. Pursuant to policies created by his office, Gentry requires that people posting cash bonds acknowledge notice of and agree in writing to any future garnishment. Without a signed form, Gentry’s office will refuse to accept a bail bond1 deposit, and the person on whose behalf bond was to be posted will remain incarcerated. In this manner, Gentry unlawfully uses future garnishment of cash bail deposits as a pre-condition of someone’s pretrial release, for the sole purpose of ensuring post-judgment payment of fines, court costs, and restitution. 3. The Nashville Community Bail Fund (“NCBF” or “Bail Fund”) is a charitable organization established in 2016 to free persons from jail prior to trial who cannot afford to pay a money bond requirement, and to end wealth-based detention 1 Plaintiff refers in the Complaint to “bail” and “bond” interchangeably because this case deals with instances in which the form of bail required is a monetary bond. The terms are not otherwise synonymous, however, as courts may set other non-monetary conditions as terms of conditional release or “bail.” See, e.g., Harvard Law School Criminal Justice Policy Program, Moving Beyond Money: A Primer on Bail Reform, 5–6 (Oct. 2016), https://cutt.ly/Trvw1lG. by demonstrating the ineffectiveness of conditioning pretrial release on the payment of money. To sustain its operation, the NCBF uses a revolving fund that relies on recovering posted bond money at the conclusion of a participant’s case. Because the court may forfeit and completely retain posted bonds for those who fail to appear, the NCBF stakes its survival on participants returning to court.2 4. The NCBF now faces a threat to its existence unrelated to whether the people it bails out successfully return to court. For years, the Davidson County Criminal Court Judges granted the NCBF an exemption from Rule 10(B). The Criminal Court Judges revoked this exemption on September 30, 2019. Shortly thereafter, Gentry began enforcing both Rule 10(B) and his policy of conditioning acceptance of money bonds on receiving written agreement to garnishment against the Bail Fund. As a result, the NCBF and the persons it frees from jail are now subject to the same injuries local officials have long inflicted upon others. 5. Rule 10(B) and Gentry’s garnishment policy violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of those navigating the post-arrest system. The 2 The NCBF is one of several such charitable bail funds operating across the country. See, e.g., The Bronx Freedom Fund, https://cutt.ly/mrdsLbN (charitable bail fund established in the Bronx, New York, in 2007); Our Mission, Chicago Community Bond Fund, https://chicagobond.org (charitable bail fund formally launched in 2015); Detroit Justice Center, Bail Project, https://cutt.ly/brdsMtB (charitable bail fund in Detroit); Hawai‘i Community Bail Fund, https://cutt.ly/jrdduBr (charitable bail fund in Oahu, Hawai‘i). policies leverage the duress of pre-trial incarceration to extract tens of thousands of dollars annually from arrested individuals and their support networks, for the sole purpose of maximizing revenue for the court system. These garnishment practices bear no relationship to the constitutionally acceptable purpose of money bail: reasonably assuring court appearance. Gentry’s enforcement of these policies harms presumptively innocent people and their support networks by impermissibly taxing pretrial freedom and chilling the posting of bail. 6. Rule 10(B) and Gentry’s garnishment policy also threaten the existence of the NCBF by preventing it from fully recovering the bonds it posts and replenishing its revolving","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Nashville Community Bail Fund | Nashville | Davidson County | September 30, 2019 | U.S. District Court | Middle District of Tennessee ||||| Nashville ||| [redacted] On September 30, 2019, the Nashville CommunityBail Fund (NCBF) filed a lawsuit against the Davidson County Criminal Court Clerk's office in the United States District Court for the Middle district of Tennessee.

The plaintiffs brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983, and allege that the Defendants violated their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief. They want to enjoin the Defendants from enforcing their current debt collection program, which jails people who can't pay a certain portion of their fines for traffic and misdemeanor offenses. The Plaintiffs allege that Defendants adopted their debt collection program to generate revenue for they city, and the individual plaintiffs were not informed that they could assert their indigence. Rather, the Plaintiffs were simply told they had to pay or go to jail. On January 12th, 2017 Judge David Guaderrama granted the Defendant's motion to dismiss in part. Judge Guaderrama dismissed the Due Process claims, but did not reach the Equal Protection claims.

The Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in January 2017, and after the Court denied two motions to dismiss filed by defendants over the course of 2017, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the action pursuant to a settlement agreement. In the settlement agreement, defendants agreed to maintain certain administrative practices for three years.

","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS EL PASO DIVISION CARINA CANAAN and LEVI LANE, Plaintiffs, v. CITY OF EL PASO, Defendant. <unk>Civil Action No. I 1..- CV'- l'3Z. <unk><unk><unk>JURY TRIAL DEMANDED ORIGINAL COMPLAINT 1. Like nearly one-quarter of their fellow El Pasoans, Plaintiffs Carina Canaan and Levi Lane live in poverty. Nonetheless, when Ms. Canaan and Mr. Lane were unable to pay traffic fines owed to the City of El Paso, they were given just one repayment option jail Ms. Canaan was jailed twice due to her indigency, including while pregnant. She still owes outstanding debt that she is unable to pay, and lives in fear of further incarceration Mr. Lane spent twenty-three days in jail due to his indigency, losing his job Ms. Canaan and Mr. Lane bring this action to challenge the City of El Paso's unconstitntional debt collection policies and practices, which discriminate against Plaintiffs and other poor people in violation of the U.S. Constitntion, longstanding U.S. Supreme Court case law, and other federal and state law. 2. The City of El Paso (""Defendant"") has unconstitntionally adopted, maintained, and enforced policies and practices that require poor individuals to pay 25% of all fines owed for Class C misdemeanors, the lowest level of wrongdoing, before they may qualify for payment plans (the ""25% Upfront Policy''). Last year alone, Defendant resolved nearly 34,000 cases involving debtors who could not pay their fines to go to jail, while refusing to provide them with information about other options. 3. Under long-standing constitntional law, a municipality cannot jail poor debtors merely because they are unable to pay criminal fees or fines. Before imposing a jail sentence, the government must provide debtors with both notice and opportunity either to ask for a determination of indigency, excusing them from repayment, or to select an alternative option like community service or a reasonable payment plan. Defendant's 25% Up front Policy disregards these well-established protections. 4. For those indigent defendants unaware of their t-ights and unable to pay their fines, the practical effect of the 25% Upfront Policy is to automatically convert Class C misdemeanor fines into jail time. As a result, poor El Pasoans are either sentenced to a modern day's debtors' prison or coerced into paying fines that they cannot afford in order to avoid incarceration. 5. The City of El Paso seemingly adopted this policy, and disregarded constitutionally required protections, in order to fully maximize revenue. In 2015, Defendant procured almost $19 million in fines and court costs one of its most substantial general revenue sources and a shocking amount in a county where nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty. Community members, organizations, the media, and state lawmakers have put Defendant's policymakers on notice that its policies and practices fail to give poor debtors proper notice or the opportunity to avoid jail through alternative payment options. Nonetheless, Defendant has failed to take adequate steps to ensure that El Pasoans no longer face the threat of jail time simply for being poor. 7. In addition to Defendant's failure to repeal the 25% Upfront Policy, Defendant's employees repeatedly and systematically inform poor debtors that they must either pay their fines in full, pay 25% of their fines upfront to qualify for a payment plan, or go to jail. Indeed, this is precisely what Plaintiffs were told. 8. Moreover, Defendant's unlawful actions are intentional, the result of an agreement between Defendant and municipal court staff to intentionally violate debtors' due process rights in order to coerce the maximum payment on outstanding traffic fines. 9. Through its policies, practices, illegal agreements, and improper training and supervision, Defendant is violating the Due Process and Equal Protection rights of Ms. Canaan, Mr. Lane, and people across El Paso too poor to pay a significant portion of their debt upfront under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution in conjunction with the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. <unk>1983), and the Texas Constitution. I 0. Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court vindicate their constitutional rights Ms. Canaan seeks an injunctive order prohibiting Defendant from jailing her, and persons like her, for the inability to pay, and other injunctive relief Mr. Lane seeks compensation for the past violations of his constitutional rights, as well as other relief.

In August 2016, the Court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss and ordered the plaintiffs to pay $3,660.00 in litigation costs. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AMARILLO DIVISION RACHEL McKEE and LONETA JACKSON Plaintiffs, v. CITY OF AMARILLO, TEXAS Defendant. COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION Plaintiffs Rachel McKee and Loneta Jackson by and through undersigned counsel, bring this Class Action Complaint against Defendant City of Amarillo, Texas (“the City”), on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated and, as grounds therefore, state and allege as follows: INTRODUCTION1 1. This case involves a deliberate choice by the City to prioritize the collection of fines, fees and costs revenue over the Constitutional rights of its residents by instituting a modern day debtor’s prison. 1 Plaintiffs make the allegations in this complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which they have had personal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters alleged. 2. Until 1971 the practice in most municipal courts throughout the country and Texas was to impose a jail sentence on persons who did not pay fines assessed for non-jailable offenses such as traffic tickets. Under this practice, known as “pay or lay,” no consideration was given to individual defendants’ financial circumstances and no alternative methods of punishment were considered before sending people to jail for not paying their fines. 3. “Pay or lay” was abolished by the U.S. Supreme Court in Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395 (1971). There, the Court held that it was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to jail indigent persons solely for failing to pay a fine. 4. The City of Amarillo chose to ignore Tate and has maintained its policy of “pay or lay” from 1960 until the present. The City’s Municipal Code of Ordinances states: Sec. 2-8-111. Judgments; forms. In the event of a conviction in a case pending before the Municipal Court, the judgment shall be in the name of the State and shall recover of the defendant the fine and other penalties for the use and benefit of the City. Except as otherwise provided the Court shall require the defendant to remain in the custody of the Chief of Police of the City until the fine, Stateimposed fees and other penalties are paid, and order that execution issue to collect the fine and penalties. (Code 1960, <unk>7-27; Ord No. 5619, <unk>1, 8-26-86) The Municipal Code of Ordinances contains no exceptions to <unk>2-8-111 for defendants who are indigent. It does not include any procedure allowing for the determination of indigence or the appropriateness of alternative punishments, such as community service, for those who are indigent. Despite 44 years of jurisprudence recognizing the Fourteenth Amendment rights spelled out in Tate and its progeny, the City of Amarillo has stubbornly persisted in routinely jailing indigent people on the basis of its Code. 5. The City’s policy and practice of “pay or lay” results in the illegal jailing of hundreds, if not thousands, of Amarillo residents each year, threatening those residents’ jobs, housing, families and already tenuous financial circumstances. Two such people are the Plaintiffs in this lawsuit. 6. This lawsuit seeks to hold the City accountable to Plaintiffs Rachel McKee and Loneta Jackson and the class members they seek to represent for these violations of their constitutional rights. I. PARTIES 7. Plaintiff Rachel McKee is a 47 year-old resident of Amarillo, Texas. 8. Plaintiff Loneta Jackson is a 36 year-old resident of Amarillo, Texas. 9. Defendant City of Amarillo is a municipality organized under the laws of the State of Texas. The City of Amarillo has established the Amarillo Municipal Court as a department of the City. The City of Amarillo may be served with process by serving the City Clerk, Mayor, Treasurer, or Secretary at 509 S.E. Seventh Avenue, Amarillo, Texas 79105. II. JURISDICTION 10.

This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 (federal question jurisdiction) and <unk>1343 (civil rights jurisdiction). III. VENUE 11.

The District Court, Shoob, Senior District Judge, held that: (1) governor, department, and commissioner waived their right to seek abstention under Younger; (2) abstention would not have been appropriate; (3) Rooker–Feldman doctrine did not deprive district court of subject matter jurisdiction; (4) Adoption Act created individual rights in foster children, enforceable under <unk>1983; (5) EPSDT created individual rights in foster children; (6) Georgia statutes created individual rights in foster children; (7) plans submitted by state to Secretary of Health and Human Services for funding under Social Security Act constituted binding contracts which foster children could enforce as third-party beneficiaries; (8) proposed class satisfied commonality requirement; and (9) proposed class satisfied typicality requirement.

This action is before the Court on defendants’ motions to dismiss and for protective order and on plaintiffs’ motions for class certification and for leave to file their first amended complaint. For the following reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part defendants’ motions to dismiss, denies the motion for protective order, and grants plaintiffs’ motions for class certification and for leave to amend their complaint. Procedural Background On June 6, 2002, nine foster children in the custody of the Georgia Department of Human Resources filed this action in the Superior Court of Fulton County on behalf of a class of Fulton and DeKalb County foster children and a subclass of African–American foster children. The complaint seeks to address alleged systemic deficiencies in foster care in Fulton and DeKalb Counties. Plaintiffs assert fifteen causes of action under federal and state law.1 The federal law claims are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 for alleged violations of plaintiffs’ federal constitutional rights to substantive and procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment (Counts IV and XVII) and to liberty, privacy, and association under the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments (Count V); and for alleged violations of plaintiffs’ federal statutory rights under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Count VIII); the Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994, as amended by the Inter-ethnic Adoption Provisions of 1996 (Count XV); and the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Program of the Medicaid Act (Count XVI).

After the New York Times published several articles about the deaths of children in the care of DYFS due to lack of care, in 2003 the state entered into a settlement agreement providing for a systematic overhaul of the state child welfare system.

The case was filed on December 13, 1995, and the parties reached to two separate settlement agreements, one with the city and one with the state, on December 2, 1988. The plaintiffs returned to court in January 2001, seeking an order directing the state to comply with specific terms of the state settlement agreement. The court found that the state had acted with insufficient diligence in implementing the information management system, and therefore extended the terms of the agreement in this area and directed that the plaintiffs receive semi-annual reports. The defendants provided a January 2017 report to show that they were continuing to develop, implement, and update their information systems for child welfare needs.

This is a civil rights action on behalf of all children who are or will be in the custody of the New York City Child Welfare Administration (""CWA""), and those children who, while not in the custody of CWA, are or will be at risk of abuse or neglect and whose status is known or should be known to CWA. Defendants in this action have systematically denied these children their rights under the United States Constitution, federal statutes, the New York State Constitution, state laws and regulations, and the State plans provided to the federal government as a condition of receiving federal funds to support the state's child welfare system. 2. The child protection system supervised and operated by defendants presents the opportunity to help vulnerable children and give them a chance for a decent childhood. Instead, and at great public expense, defendants are producing new generations of young people so damaged by their childhood that they will be unable to function as independent, productive adults. 3. There are now approximately 43,000 children in foster care in New York City. Countless thousands more are the subjects of abuse and neglect allegations. Defendants' failure to protect these children and provide them and their families with appropriate, legally required services has jeopardized their health, education, safety, essential sense of stability and permanency, and developmental well-being. In some instances, as the recent death of Elisa Izquierdo has once again tragically JA-81 demonstrated, defendants' failures also jeopardize these children's very lives. 4. New York City has perhaps the most dysfunctional child welfare system in the country, despite the fact that New York State spends more per capita than any other state on child welfare and most of this expense is incurred in New York City. Children in need of foster care placement often get turned away at the door, while those children who wind up in placement spend a substantial part of their childhood growing up in government custody. 5. Despite the increasing needs of children, the foster care placement rate in New York City is declining.

INTRODUCTION 1. This civil rights class action seeks injunctive relief compelling the Honorable Nikki Haley, Governor of the State of South Carolina (“Governor Haley”), and Susan Alford, Acting State Director of the South Carolina Department of Social Services (“Director Alford”), in their official capacities (collectively, the “Defendants”), to remedy specific deficiencies in the South Carolina Department of Social Services (“DSS”) in order to safeguard and prevent harm to foster children in DSS custody. 2. Governor Haley and Director Alford directly and indirectly control the actions, inactions, policies, patterns, customs and practices of DSS alleged in this Complaint. 3. This civil rights class action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 on behalf of a Class and Subclasses of children who are or will be in the legal custody of DSS in foster care (“Plaintiff Children”). 4. Plaintiff Children seek only systemic declarative and injunctive relief to stop DSS from continuing to violate the federal constitutional and statutory rights of the putative Class and Subclasses. 5. Plaintiffs are children who are removed from their homes due to extreme family circumstances and placed in the legal custody of DSS at the direction and control of DSS. As wards of the State, Plaintiff Children are wholly dependent on the State, and in particular on DSS, for their safety, well-being and required services. 6. As a direct result of longstanding, well-documented failures by DSS, Plaintiff Children have been and continue to be harmed physically, psychologically and emotionally and continue to be placed at ongoing risk of such harms while in DSS custody. DSS is re-victimizing the very children it is charged to protect. 7. DSS has long operated, and continues to operate, a system in which Plaintiff Children are the victims, or remain at risk of becoming victims, of three specific unaddressed deficiencies: <unk>A drastic shortage of foster homes. DSS fails to maintain an adequate number and kind of foster homes and other appropriate living situations for children. According to the June 2014 DSS Child and Family Services Plan for FFY 20152019 (the “2014 DSS Plan”), DSS “did not regularly put the child in placement settings appropriate for the child – examples include[] group home settings and shelters.” A 2008 report of the Governor’s Task Force on Children in Foster Care and Adoption Services (the “2008 Governor’s Task Force”) found that DSS’s “insufficient number of foster homes” leads to “the inability to match children’s needs to available foster homes.” <unk>Excessive caseworker caseloads and an unstable foster care workforce that cannot provide basic monitoring of children’s safety. The caseloads of foster care caseworkers and child protective services investigators frequently exceed two times and often three or four times national standards and DSS’s own policy standards.

Over six years after Congress passed our nation's landmark civil rights law for persons with disabilities, Defendants continue to discriminate against persons who have disabilities that require them to use wheelchairs or other assistive devices for mobility and their nondisabled companions who attend concerts at Fiddler’s Green Amphitheater (“Fiddler’s Green”). Specifically, Defendants, who are the owners, operators, lessors and/or lessees of Fiddler’s Green, have failed to provide adequate seating for persons with mobility limitations and their nondisabled companions despite being repeatedly requested to do so. Further, Defendants continue to advertise and sell tickets for seating for persons with mobility limitations and their nondisabled companions with knowledge that such spaces frequently are not available, useable, or safe, often as a result of Defendants’ actions. Defendants are in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act as well as Colorado law. 2. On July 12, 1990, Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>12101, et seq., establishing the most important civil rights law for persons with disabilities in our country's history. 3. The Congressional findings include: a. “some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities... ;” b. “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem;” c. “discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as... public accommodations;” d. “individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural... barriers,... segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits,... or other opportunities;” e. “the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity... to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous...” 42 U.S.C. <unk>12101(a). 2. Congress explicitly stated that among the purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act are: a. “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;” b. “to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities,...;” and c. “to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the 14th Amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. <unk>12101(b). 2. Congress gave commercial businesses and owners, operators, lessors and lessees of places of public accommodation one and a half years to implement the Act. The effective date was January 26, 1992. 3. In spite of this abundant lead time and the extensive publicity the ADA has received since 1990, Defendants continue to discriminate against persons who use wheelchairs or other assistive devices and their companions by relegating them to inferior seating that is wholly in violation of applicable nondiscrimination laws. Further, Defendants advertise and sell tickets for “wheelchair seating” knowing that such seating frequently does not exist, often as a result of Defendants’ actions. Persons with disabilities are forced to either leave the event or sit in uncomfortable, dangerous locations where they often cannot see the performers and cannot sit with their companions.

The DOJ alleged that nearly two hundred children with disabilities were unnecessarily segregated from their communities and the general population by the State, which had placed them in nursing homes. The DOJ sought an injunction requiring the State to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131-12134, which, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of disabled individuals, and mandates that their rehabilitative and medical needs be provided in a manner that enables disabled individuals to be independent and integrated members of the community. In June 2014, the case was consolidated with another pending case, which is in the Clearinghouse as PB-FL-0007.","The Honorable Pamela Jo Bondi Attorney General for the State of Florida Florida Department of Legal Affairs PL-01 The Capitol Tallahassee, FL 32399-1050 Re: United States’ Investigation of the State of Florida’s Service System for Children with Disabilities Who Have Medically Complex Conditions, D.J No. 204-18-212 Dear Attorney General Bondi: We write to report the findings of the Civil Rights Division’s investigation of the State of Florida (the “State”) with respect to its system for delivering services and supports to children with disabilities, including those who have medically complex or medically fragile conditions.1 During our investigation, we assessed the State’s compliance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131-12134 (the “ADA”), as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), requiring public entities to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. Our review of the State’s system reveals that the State fails to meet its obligations under Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 35, by unnecessarily institutionalizing hundreds of children with disabilities in nursing facilities. Many children entering nursing facilities in the State are unnecessarily separated from their families and communities for years. With adequate services and supports, these children could live at home with their families or in other more integrated community settings. The State’s policies and practices also place numerous other children who have medically complex or medically fragile conditions at risk of placement in nursing facilities and other institutional settings. 1 For the purposes of this letter, the United States adopts Florida’s definition of “medically complex,” found in Title 59G of the Florida Administrative Code: “‘Medically complex’ means that a person has chronic debilitating diseases or conditions of one (1) or more physiological or organ systems that generally make the person dependent upon twentyfour (24) hour-per-day medical, nursing, or health supervision or intervention.” Fla Admin. Code R. 59G-1.010(164). Medically fragile individuals are by definition medically complex. See Fla Admin. Code R. 59G-1.010(165). Consistent with the legal requirements set forth in the ADA, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12133, this letter serves to provide notice of the State’s failure to comply with the ADA and of the minimum steps the State needs to take to meet its obligations under the law. I. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the State fails to provide services to children who reside in nursing facilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, and that the State’s policies and practices put many other children with medically complex or medically fragile conditions at risk of placement in such facilities. Hundreds of children are currently segregated in nursing facilities throughout Florida. They are growing up apart from their families in hospital-like settings, among elderly nursing facility residents and other individuals with disabilities. They live segregated lives—having few opportunities to interact with children and young adults without disabilities or to experience many of the social, educational and recreational activities that are critical to child development. As part of our investigation, we visited the six large nursing facilities that house the vast majority of children who reside in such facilities in Florida. At each facility, we met with numerous children and received a substantial amount of data. From our review of this data, we found a wide range of diagnoses among the children residing in each facility. Yet we consistently identified children who are qualified to receive services in the community, and who would benefit from moving home with their families or to other community settings if appropriate supports were provided to them. We also spoke with many families who want to have their children living at home but report their frustration with State policies that inhibit their ability to do so. Indeed, the State has planned, structured, and administered a system of care that has led to the unnecessary segregation and isolation of children, often for many years, in nursing facilities. For example, despite State and federal policies that require the State to evaluate children entering nursing facilities for appropriate placement in community-based settings, we found few examples of concrete efforts by the State to identify services that would enable children entering these facilities to return home to their families. As a result, many children continue to be separated from their families simply because the State has failed to identify or connect them to sufficient communitybased services to meet their needs. The State has also implemented policies and practices that impair access to medically necessary services and supports that would enable children to transition home or to other community-based settings. For example, we learned of many instances of the State reducing or limiting the availability of in-home services that had been prescribed as medically necessary by a child’s physician, without reasonably considering the child’s actual needs. And in the last several years, the State has made substantial cuts to programs designed to support children and adults with developmental disabilities in the community, leading to a years-long waiting list to access services","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2015 | U.S. Department of Justice | Florida | ADA | Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ||| Florida | Florida Department of Legal Affairs (D.L.A.) | Florida Office of the Attorney General (OAG) | ||| December 2015 ||| January 2016 ||| March 2017 ||| May 2017 | March 2018 ||| June 2018 | May 2018 | March 2019 | May 2019 | June 2019 | March 2020 | May 2020 | June 2020 | March 2021 | May 2021 | June 2021 | July 2020 | July 2021 | August 2019 | August 2020 | September 2019 | September 2020 | August 2021 | September 2021 | October 2020 | November 2020 | December 2020 | January 2021 | January 2020 | February 2020 | April 2021 | March 2022 | May 2022 | April 2022 | June 2022 | July 2022 | August 2022 | September 2022 | November 2022 | January 2019 | April 2020 | October 2022 | December 2022 | March 2025 | May 2025 | April 2025 | June 2025 | July 2025 | August 2025 | September 2025 | November 2025 | January 2025 | October 2025 | December 2025 | February 2025 | March 2023 | April 2023 | May 2023 | June 2023 | July 2023 | December 2023 | January 2023 | August 2018 | July 2018 | January 2018 | April 2019 | July 2019 | December 2018 | August 2023 | March 2019, January 2019, January 2019</s>"

Preliminary Statement 1. The Center for Community Access (“CCA”), is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, membership based, grassroots organization dedicated to assisting individuals with disabilities in becoming all that they can be. CCA's mission is to raise the status of people with disabilities, which is accomplished through educating, advocating and celebrating our differences and the commonality we share as human beings. CCA educates people with disabilities about their rights, and also educates the public on the obligations and responsibilities society has toward people with disabilities. CCA advocates for the individual and collective rights of people with disabilities in order to gain freedom of movement and access to the greater community. 2. CCA is located in the Hannan Building at 4750 Woodward Avenue, on the Southeast corner of the intersection of Woodward with Hancock. Recently the City of Detroit has resurfaced or otherwise altered intersections and sidewalks close to CCA's offices, but has failed to ensure that those altered intersections meet all federal and Michigan accessibility standards and guidelines. The City of Detroit has failed to make these sidewalks and intersections accessible to and readily usable by Plaintiff and its members and clients. 3. The Center is seeking for the City to ensure that these intersections are corrected and brought into compliance with the law. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1343(a)(3); 29 U.S.C. <unk>794(a) (Rehabilitation Act); and 42 U.S.C. <unk>12133 (Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act); 5. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) because the Defendant is located in the Eastern District and the events and/or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff's claims occurred in the Eastern District. 6. Jurisdiction in Count II is based on this Court's supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1367, because the Michigan State law claims arise out a common nucleus of facts with the federal law claims. III. PARTIES A. PLAINTIFF 7. The Center for Community Access, Inc., operating in central Detroit, Michigan, is a nonprofit Michigan Corporation. Its Board of Directors and staff, is composed of a majority of people with mobility and/or sight disabilities, along with volunteers. These people have disabilities as defined under the Americans with Disabilities Act, under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and under applicable Michigan law. The CCA was created to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living and economic self-sufficiency Defendants' conduct has and is frustrating the CCA's mission, and the Center has suffered financial harm attempting to overcome discrimination by the City, and it has many members and clients who are suffering from the City's violations of accessibility law. CCA and its employees, members and clients will continue to suffer exclusion from full participation in the grand concourse of life unless and until the court remedies the City's continuing, over-arching pattern and practice of discrimination against people with disabilities. B. DEFENDANTS 8. Defendant City of Detroit is authorized under the State of Michigan and is a public entity as that term is defined under 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131(1); 28 C.F.R. <unk>35.104. Upon information and belief, the City has received and will continue to receive federal funds for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act and for the Civil Rights Restoration Act, 29 U.S.C. <unk>794(b)(1)(A). The City has a continuing and overaching pattern and practice of discriminating against people with disabilities when it builds or repairs city facilities services, programs or activities. IV. FACTS 9. Beginning at least in 1992, and continuing each year until the present, the City of Detroit has resurfaced or otherwise altered intersections and sidewalks without ensuring that those altered intersections and sidewalks meet federal and Michigan accessibility standards, and so those sidewalks and intersections remain not accessible to and readily usable by the CCA, its employees, members and clients, as they attempt to transact the business and goals of the CCA. The lack of proper ramps at these intersections and on these sidewalks force the CCA and its members to travel in traffic, and to attempt to negotiate the defective curb ramps and sidewalks. 10.

In the State of Michigan and nationwide, there is an acute shortage of accessible rental housing available to persons with disabilities and their families. As a resuH, Congress directed over ten years ago that newly constructed multi- family housing units on ground floors must meet accessibility standards. Unfortunately, many architects, builders and apartment companies have wantonly ignored the law, and continue to construct ground floor multi-family housing that that is not accessible to persons with mobility impainnents. This is illegal discrimination, and denies housing to persons with disabilities. In addition, non-disabled tenants who rent these inaccessible apartments are unable to host friends and family who have mobility impairments. This failure to build apartments correctly stigmatizes persons with disabilities and their families and friends. This lawsuit is brought to help remedy this wanton discrimination in Southeastern Michigan. 2.

Plaintiff Michael Lowery is a U.S. citizen and a resident of the Uptown Apartments in Canton Michigan. He has a mobility impairment and requires a wheelchair for ambulation. He is a person with a disability as that term is defined by the Fair Housing Act and the ADA. 5. Defendant Beztak Properties, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of Michigan that conducts business in the Eastem District of Michigan. Defendant Beztak Properties is responsible for the design, construction, and operation of a number of apartment complexes, including the Uptown Apartments, located in Canton Michigan, where Plaintiff Mike Lowery lives. FACTS 6. Defendant designed, constructed, and operates the Uptown Apartments in Canton, Michigan. The complex consists of approximately 30 apartment buildings, containing a total of approximately 300 apartments. The complex also contains a pool, club house, exercise gym, meeting areas and a business office. The Uptown Apartments complex has saveral streets and intersections, and sidewalks throughout. 7. The Uptown Apartments became available for lease approximately one year ago. Plaintiff Mike Lowery has been a tenant there for the last several months Mr. Lowery uses a wheelchair to ambulate. Because there are no elevators and no ramps or any other way for a person using a wheelchair to access the second and third floor apartments at Uptown, Mr. Lowery needed a ground floor unit. 8. When he first inquired about renting an apartment at Uptown, the rental agent told Mr. Lowery that the complex had ""three handicap accessible apartments"" in the complex. The law requires that al/ ground floor units in a complex like Uptown must be accessible; Uptown should have had at least ninety accessible units, not just three. 9. The rental agent showed Mr. Lowery one of the units identified as ""handicap accessible."" The agent assured Mr. Lowery that this apartment was specifically designed for tenants who use a wheelchair Mr. Lowery agreed to rent the unit. A few days later, Uptown informed Mr. Lowery that another of the three ""handicap accessible"" apartments was available, and Mr. Lowery agreed to rent that unit instead. 10. After moving in, Mr. Lowery discovered numerous accessibility problems in his unit. For example, the bedroom and bathroom doors are too narrow, causing Mr. Lowery to scrape his fingers, toes, knees and chair wheels against the door frames when he tries to maneuver through them Mr. Lowery can not operate his washer or dryer and he can not reach other closet spaces, because the doors and shelves are improperly configured.

MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, Defendant. COMPLAINT Case No, fa cV11<unk>lJPJ-ftLB 1, This is a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of children with disabilities in the Jackson Public School District (""JPS"") to hold the Mississippi Department of Education (""MDE"") accOlmtable for ensuring that they receive the free appropriate public education they are entitled to receive under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (""IDEA""), 20 U.S.C, <unk>1400 et seq. For years, students with disabilities throughout JPS have been denied the educational and supportive services they need to achieve academically, and have been removed from their schools and forced into substandard segregated settings with little to no appropriate academic programming and related services. In September 2010, Plaintiff and a class of similarly situated JPS students filed a systemic state administrative complaint against IPS which alerted MDE to numerous systemic violations of the IDEA, and requested MDE's assistance in investigating and ensuring correction of both the individual and systemic violations that prevented them from obtaining an appropriate education from JPS, Although MDE substantiated each and everyone of the violations detailed in Plaintiffs administrative complaint, JPS has continued to violate the rights of the Plaintiff and the class of similarly situated students. 2. Over the past twenty-two months, JPS has sought only to evade responsibility for these violations, and has openly and defiantly refused to provide the Plaintiff and similarly situated students with the appropriate services they are entitled to receive under the IDEA. Sadly, despite having the authority and obligation lmder federal and state law to hold JPS accountable for these violations and ensure the provision of critical special education and related services to children with disabilities, MDE has exhibited complete indifference to Plaintiffs pleas for relief, and has failed to take appropriate action to compel JPS to correct the individual and systemic violations of the IDEA that harm thousands of JPS's most vulnerable students. 3. JPS's systemic failure to comply with the IDEA greatly diminishes the likelihood that thousands of JPS students will realize their full academic potential and achieve a successful transition from high school. The devastating impact of JPS's unlawful conduct is borne out in the District's dismal graduation rate for students with disabilities: less than ten percent of students with disabilities graduate from JPS. During the 2010-2011 school year, ouly 9% of eighth grade students with disabilities scored proficient or above in state-wide science testing, while only 4% of eighth grade students with disabilities were considered proficient in language arts as measured on the Mississippi Curriculum Test. Plaintiff and the proposed class are merely seeking to claim their rightfi.Jl opportunity to make meaningful behavioral and academic progress to achieve and succeed academically, and cannot allow more time to pass for JPS to continue to treat their education as expendable. The consequences of continued noncompliance by JPS, and MDE's refusal to ensure compliance, are serious and profound for Plaintiff and the class. 4. In 1975, Congress enacted what is now called the IDEA to end the longstanding failure of schools to meet the educational needs of students with disabilities. The statute is aimed at cOlTecting the historic exclusion of students with disabilities fi'om the classroom, and ensuring the provision of an appropriate education to all studeEts with disabilities. To achieve this goal, state education agencies such as MDE are required to ensure that local school districts have policies and procedures in place to ensure that students with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education (""FAPE""). This entails providing each child with a disability with an individualized education program (""IEP"") that is reasonably calculated to confer meaningful educational benefit. IEPs must also include the provision of any related services, such as counseling and speech therapy, necessary to ensure that a child can make academic and behavioral progress; and must also provide for specific behavioral interventions when it is determined that a child's behavior is interfering with his/her ability to make academic and/or behavioral progress. For some students, IEPs must provide for transition services to facilitate a successful transition from high school, and for extended school year (""ESY"") services over the summer months. The IDEA also mandates that students be served alongside their typical peers in the least restrictive environment (""LRE""), and includes nmnerous procedural safeguards to protect children from school discipline practices that punish them for behaviors related to their disabilities. 5. The Mississippi Department of Education bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that local school districts such as JPS comply with the IDEA and for ensuring that all students with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability, receive FAPE in the least restrictive environment.

The student plaintiffs are either student in Staten Island District 75 schools or vulnerable to being sent to those schools, which are separated from New York City community schools.

No. 1.21-CV-00419 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. This civil rights class action lawsuit is brought against the New York City Department of Education (the “DOE”), the City of New York (the “City”), and Richard A. Carranza in his official capacity as the Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education (the “Chancellor”) (collectively “Defendants”) on behalf of a class of almost 2,000 Staten Island students with disabilities who are being educated in segregated and unequal public schools and classrooms in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), and the New York City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”). 2. The DOE funds and operates a wholly separate citywide school district based solely on disability known as District 75, which on Staten Island draws students from Staten Island public schools (“Staten Island District 75”). 3. The DOE created District 75 to serve as a separate school district for students with “moderate to severe disabilities,” including autism spectrum disorders, cognitive delays, sensory impairments, emotional disturbances, and multiple disabilities. 4. Over 25,000 students with disabilities attend District 75 schools citywide, and almost 2,000 students with disabilities attend Staten Island District 75 schools. 5. District 75 students are placed in a separate District 75 school (containing only District 75 students) or a co-located District 75 placement that is composed of classrooms located within a neighborhood DOE school. 6. Regardless of the District 75 setting in which students are placed, District 75 students spend all or almost all of their school day segregated from students without disabilities. 7. Students with disabilities placed in Staten Island District 75 schools could be educated successfully alongside students without disabilities in traditional, neighborhood public schools—also called “community schools”—in Staten Island, if provided with appropriate and legally required services and supports. 8. The Staten Island District 75 school system denies students with disabilities equal educational opportunities by forcing them into a segregated environment, providing them with an education that is not comparable to that which students without disabilities receive, and denying them access to electives, extracurricular activities, or other opportunities to interact with students without disabilities, such as lunch or recess. 9. In 2008, at the DOE’s request, the Council of the Great City Schools (“CGCS”), one of the leading national organizations supporting urban education, put the DOE on notice that by funding and operating District 75 it is improperly and inefficiently consuming and diverting resources that should be spent on providing students with disabilities with an integrated learning environment in community schools. 10. The CGCS report concluded that “the isolation of students [is] more pronounced in the New York City school system than in other major urban school systems...” 11. By continuing to isolate unnecessarily students with disabilities in Staten Island District 75 schools, Defendants perpetuate stigma, misunderstanding, and fear and reinforce feelings of shame and unworthiness for students with disabilities who have been labeled as unfit to learn and unwelcome in their Staten Island community schools. 12. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged Defendants to demonstrate unprecedented flexibility in restructuring the way education is delivered; as such, there has never been a more opportune time to apply that same resourcefulness and commitment to reform the delivery of educational services to Staten Island students with disabilities in a manner firmly rooted in integration and equal opportunities to education in community schools. 13. Without intervention, Defendants’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic will further entrench segregation and deny students with disabilities access to the same quality of education in the most integrated setting enjoyed by their peers without disabilities. 14. By unnecessarily segregating students with disabilities from their peers without disabilities, Defendants violate the ADA, Section 504, the IDEA, and the NYCHRL, which all require public school districts to provide programs, services, and activities to students with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. 15. The individual Named Plaintiffs E.F., A.S., L.P., and Plaintiff Disability Rights New York (“DRNY”) (collectively “Named Plaintiffs”) seek an order requiring Defendants to provide all necessary services and supports in community schools such that Named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class are given a meaningful opportunity to attend these schools, thereby ending the systematic placement of Staten Island District 75 students into segregated and unequal schools and classrooms.

The library agreed to transition to the exclusive use of accessible devices within four years, and to add ten accessible e-readers within 60 days of the settlement date.","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA DENICE BROWN, KAREN COMORATO, PATRICIA GREBLOSKI, and ANTOINETTE WHALEY, Plaintiffs, vs. FREE LIBRARY OF PHILADELPHIA, Defendant. COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Almost forty years after Congress mandated, through passage of the Rehabilitation Act, that institutions in receipt of federal funds could not discriminate on the basis of disability, defendant Free Library of Philadelphia (“Library”) has initiated and subsequently expanded a NOOK e-reading device lending program for older library patrons knowing that this device is completely inaccessible to its blind patrons. The Library has developed this lending program in an effort to “bridge the digital divide” between young and old patrons, but in doing so has needlessly exacerbated the “digital divide” between disabled and non-disabled library patrons. 2. Because today’s technology can offer blind individuals greater access to books, periodicals, and other materials that were traditionally available only in print, the Library has the statutory responsibility to ensure that it offers fully accessible e-reading technology. In the past, when libraries provided only print books, the libraries and their blind patrons had to rely on separate processes to obtain accessible versions of books. However, because e-books are not inherently visual, audible, or tactile, they provide individuals with an opportunity to access content through whatever methods are accessible to them. For the first time, there exist commercially available portable e-book readers that allow blind and sighted readers to use the same means of accessing the written word and get at the same content. By choosing to lend inaccessible devices, the Library discriminates against its blind patrons and segregates them needlessly from its programs and activities. JURISDICTION 3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343. 4. Venue is proper within this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391. PARTIES 5. Plaintiff Denice Brown is a 54-year-old resident of Philadelphia and a retired elementary school teacher Ms. Brown is blind and uses audio recordings and text-to-speech programs to read books, newspapers, and magazines. In addition to reading the newspaper daily, Ms. Brown reads a book a month. She is particularly interested in biographies, autobiographies, and books about African-American history Ms. Brown is a member of the Library. She uses the Library’s Walnut Street location, known as the Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (“braille and talking book branch”), and also attends technology trainings and poetry readings at the Library’s Central Parkway branch. Because of her love of reading and interest in technology, she is interested in borrowing an accessible e-reading device from the Library. 6. Plaintiff Karen Comorato is a 57-year-old resident of Philadelphia Ms. Comorato is blind. She enjoys romance and historical novels as well as good mysteries Ms. Comorato uses audiobooks from the Library’s braille and talking book branch, but the few print books that are converted to audio by the National Library Service of the Library of Congress for lending become available only after long delays. An accessible e-book reader would be a substantial purchase for Ms. Comorato; as a result she would be interested in participating in the Library’s e-reader lending program if it were accessible. 7. Plaintiff Patricia Grebloski is a 70-year-old resident of Philadelphia Ms. Grebloski has worked in the insurance and medical transcription industries Ms. Grebloski is blind. She enjoys reading non-fiction books about history and current events, as well as mysteries. She is a member of the Library, but except for occasional events at the Central Parkway branch, she generally uses the braille and talking book branch. She is frustrated by the length of time (years, if ever) that it takes for her to receive a new release from the specialized branch Ms. Grebloski is an avid public radio listener and enjoys interviews of popular authors. Although she would like to read their books, they are often not available in braille or audio and, when they are, the books are no longer new and what her friends and others are talking about. She is very interested in the e-reader lending program because she would be able to read new releases at the same time that the sighted world is reading and discussing these books. 8. Plaintiff Antoinette Whaley is a 66-year-old resident of Ardmore, Pennsylvania and a member of the Library Ms. Whaley is blind. She began her career as a mathematician and computer scientist at the National Security Agency, later serving as a computer instructor for several vocational rehabilitation agencies. She has also taught math and psychology at the high school and college levels Ms. Whaley enjoys reading novels, particularly historical fiction.

One argument Arkansas raised is that the Eleventh Amendment bars a federal court from exercising jurisdiction over the Bradleys' IDEA claim. The Honorable James M.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR DAMAGES INTRODUCTION 1. This is a civil rights action demanding declaratory and injunctive relief and 3 monetary damages from the Visalia Unified School District (“VUSD”) and its agents and 4 employees for depriving students who are gay or lesbian or who are perceived to be gay or 5 lesbian of a safe and equal educational environment in violation of their established 6 constitutional and statutory rights. By bringing this action, Plaintiffs Gay-Straight Alliance 7 Network (“GSA Network”) and George Loomis seek to eliminate the hostile and intolerant 8 climate within the VUSD through reforms to change the policies and practices within VUSD 9 schools and to compel VUSD officials to respond appropriately to complaints of harassment 10 by students who are gay or lesbian or who are perceived to be gay or lesbian. Plaintiff 11 George Loomis also seeks monetary damages for the discrimination he has suffered. 2. Students experience pervasive, severe, and unwelcome harassment and 13 discrimination at VUSD schools, including but not limited to Golden West High School 14 (“Golden West”), based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation. Students who are gay 15 or who are perceived to be gay are verbally harassed by their classmates, who refer to them in 16 the classrooms and the hallways as “faggots, ” “fags,” “queers,” and “homos.” Some students 17 are physically assaulted or intimidated by other students based on their sexual orientation, and 18 others are even taunted and harassed by school administrators and teachers. 3. What is worse, complaints by student victims to administrators and teachers 20 are met with deliberate indifference and institutionalized ostracism. When students who have 21 been harassed have sought assistance from administrators at VUSD, instead of taking steps to 22 ensure a safe and equal educational environment for all students, VUSD and its agents and/or 23 employees either ignore these complaints or encourage, convince, or allow these students to 24 leave full-time classroom instruction and transfer into independent study programs or other 25 alternative educational programs. Such programs are designed for students with severe 26 problems such as extremely limiting physical or other disabilities, substance abuse problems, 27 or for students who need to work full time to help support their families. 4. These alternative educational programs were not and are not designed as a FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR DAMAGES 1 depository for ordinary students who just happen to be gay or who are perceived as gay. 2 Defendants’ use of these alternative educational programs to isolate these students irreparably 3 harms them physically, mentally, and emotionally, and greatly limits their ability to pursue 4 higher education. Moreover, segregating students perceived to be gay in this manner enables 5 harassing students to continue tormenting other students and frees teachers and administrators 6 from any responsibility to change these dreadful conditions within the VUSD. 5. Even more shockingly, teachers and administrators at Golden West have not 8 only ignored and been deliberately indifferent to the concerns of victims of anti-gay 9 harassment, but in some cases have directly harassed students, referring to them as “faggot” 10 and mocking them, and have contributed to and exacerbated the hostile environment at 11 Golden West and other VUSD schools. 6.

Plaintiff alleges as follows: JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331. 2. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B). PARTIES 3. Plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. (“SFFA”) is an Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), voluntary membership organization formed for the purpose of defending human and civil rights secured by law, including the right of individuals to equal protection under the law, through litigation and any other lawful means. 4. Defendant U.S. Department of Education (“the Department”) is an agency of the United States government. The Department has possession, custody, and control of records to which SFFA seeks access. The Department is headquartered at 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20202. STATEMENT OF FACTS 5. On January 11, 2016, SFFA submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) to the Department, seeking the following: All documents concerning the investigation of Princeton University in Case Number 02-08-6002, which is referenced in the September 9, 2015 letter from Timothy C.J. Blanchard to Christopher L Eisgruber. See http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/02086002-a.pdf. 6. By letter dated January 13, 2016, the Department acknowledged receiving SFFA’s request on January 11, 2016 and advised that it had assigned SFFA’s request as FOIA Request No. 16-00645-F. 7. On February 22, 2016, six weeks after SFFA submitted its FOIA request, SFFA’s counsel emailed the Department’s FOIA Office to determine when the Department would produce the documents responsive to SFFA’s FOIA request. 8. The next day, Kim Jones, the Department’s FOIA Manager, replied that the Department was “conducting [a] search for responsive records,” but did “not have a specific completion time available.” 9. On April 14, 2016, more than three months after SFFA submitted its FOIA request, SFFA’s counsel again emailed the Department’s FOIA Office to determine when the Department would produce the documents responsive to SFFA’s FOIA request. 10. Later that day, Ms. Jones sent SFFA’s counsel the same email from two months earlier, informing SFFA that the Department was “conducting [a] search for responsive records,” but did “not have a specific completion time available.” 11. On April 18, 2016, John Carroll, an officer of the U.S. Department of Education, New York Office for Civil Rights, had a telephone conversation with Edward Blum, the President of SFFA, and SFFA’s counsel about SFFA’s FOIA request. Later that afternoon, Mr. Carroll sent Mr. Blum an email purporting to summarize the conversation: “[Y]ou confirmed that you are making this request on behalf of Students for Fair Admission. You also confirmed that you agree to the redaction of personally identifiable information. You also confirmed that you would like the documents to be provided in digital format on a CD. Finally, you confirmed that you would like the entire case file. After receiving our response, if you disagree with any of our redactions you can file an appeal in writing, within 35 days of your receipt of our response[.]” 12. A few months later, SFFA received a letter from the U.S. Department of Education, New York Office for Civil Rights dated June 10, 2016. In that letter, the agency said that it was “currently processing the documents that are responsive to your request,” but needed “additional time ... due to the volume of documents requested,” which it estimated to “exceed 1,500 pages.” 13. On July 18, 2016, more than seven months after SFFA submitted its FOIA request, SFFA’s counsel emailed Mr. Carroll to determine when the Department would produce the documents responsive to SFFA’s FOIA request. 14. The following day, Mr. Carroll responded to SFFA via email Mr. Carroll “apologize[d] for the delay,” but said the request was “being processed as expeditiously as possible but due to the size and complexity of the request, it [would] require additional processing time.” Mr. Carroll declined to provide an estimated time for completion. 15.

Parties voluntarily dismissed case.","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE TRUSTEES OF PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, Princeton, New Jersey 08544 Plaintiff, v. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202, and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, 32 Old Slip, 26th Floor New York, NY 10005, Defendants. COMPLAINT Plaintiff The Trustees of Princeton University (the “University”), by and through its attorneys, hereby complains against Defendants United States Department of Education (the “Department”), and its sub-agency the United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. The University brings this “reverse FOIA” action pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. <unk>701-706, the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, and the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. <unk>1905, to prevent the disclosure of certain confidential and commercially sensitive documents and information relating to the University’s undergraduate admissions program submitted to OCR in the course of an OCR compliance review. These materials fall generally into two categories: (1) documents and information about undergraduate applicants to the University (“Applicant Documents and Information”), and (2) documents and information about the University’s proprietary admissions processes (“Admissions Documents and Information”). The University does not object to OCR producing documents that OCR itself generated in the course of its compliance review, to the extent OCR generated documents do not incorporate or quote those documents the University is seeking to protect. 2. The materials at issue are the subject of a pending FOIA request, Department of Education FOIA Request Number 16-00645-F (the “FOIA Request”), and accompanying suit to compel disclosure, Students for Fair Admissions, Inc v. U.S. Department of Education, No. 1:16cv-02154-TSC (D.D.C.) (the “FOIA Action”). In that case, the plaintiff is seeking an order directing the Department to produce “all documents concerning the investigation of Princeton University in [OCR] Case Number 02-08-6002,” which includes the Applicant Documents and Information and Admissions Documents and Information. 3. The Applicant Documents and Information and Admissions Documents and Information are composed of sensitive applicant and admissions information and data that the University disclosed to OCR in response to specific requests by OCR during the compliance review, in good faith and in a spirit of voluntary cooperation to assist OCR. These materials include, but are not limited to, specific applicants’ admission files, highly sensitive data about applicants that was requested by OCR (and assembled by the University solely for the purpose of responding to OCR’s request), information about how the University evaluates applicants for admission, and information about how the University conducts its admissions program. Moreover, before providing any materials to OCR in the compliance review, the University specifically asked OCR how OCR would respond to a FOIA request for these materials, and received assurance from OCR that it would adequately protect the rights and interests of both the applicants and the University. 4. The University has at all times maintained that the Applicant Documents and Information and Admissions Documents and Information are exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemption 4, which exempts from disclosure “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(b)(4). To that end, each of the documents the University seeks to withhold from release was designated and marked, “Confidential, Private, Personal and Proprietary – Exempt from Mandatory Disclosure Under FOIA” at the time it was produced to OCR. At no time during the compliance review did OCR object to or question these designations. 5. For purposes of FOIA, the activities disclosed by these materials are “commercial” pursuant to the term’s ordinary meaning. These materials contain confidential information concerning the University’s consideration of admissions applications, the structure of the University’s admissions program, its process and criteria for making admissions decisions, and the nature and relative success of its recruiting initiatives. If disclosed, these materials would reveal core aspects of the University’s applicant pool, admissions, and recruiting programs, all of which are evaluated and conducted within a highly competitive market for applications and enrollments. As explained below, disclosure of the materials would put the University at a substantial competitive disadvantage to identify, evaluate, and enroll prospective students, as well as potentially discourage applicants from applying to the University in the future if they have concerns about the confidentiality of the materials they submit. 6. Information exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4 generally is also protected from disclosure by the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. <unk>1905. See, e.g., Bartholdi Cable Co v. FCC, 114 F.3d 274, 281 (D.C Cir. 1997). The Applicant Documents and Information and Admissions Documents and Information fall within the protections of the Trade Secrets Act for the same reasons the material is exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4. 7.

PAUL PASTOREK, Louisiana State Superintendent of Education in his official capacity; LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION; and LOUISIANA BOARD OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION, Defendants. Case No. COMPLAINT.;CLASS ACTION 'COMPLAINT 1. This is a class action to vindicate the rights of all New Orleans students with disabilities filed pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (""IDEA""), 20 U.S.c. <unk>1400 et seq.; <unk>504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (""Section 504""),29 U.S.C. <unk>794; and Title II ofthe Americans with Disabilities Act (""Title II""), 42 U.S.C. <unk>12101' et seq.l 2. In 1975, Congress enacted what is now called the IDEA to protect the educational rights of the more than eight million students with disabilities in the United States whose educational needs were neglected. Section 1 of Act Nov. 29, 1975, P.L. 94-142, 89 Stat. 773. This statute focuses on correcting two evils: the exclusion of children with disabilities from public schooling and the provision of inadequate education to those children already admitted to the classroom. Pursuant to the IDEA, state educational agencies-like the Defendants- are required to ensure that schools and school districts have policies and practices in place to ensure the pro-active identification of students with disabilities. This is ktiownas the ""child find"" mandate. State educational agencies must also ensure that each child with a disability receives an individualized education plan (""IEP"") that is reasonably calculated to confer educational benefit. IEPs must include the provision of any related services necessary to ensure that a child makes academic progress. Related services include counseling, speech therapy and other similar supports. For some students, IEPs must provide for transitional services to help aide in the transition from student to productive adult. The IDEA also includes numerous procedural safeguards to protect children from school discipline -practices that punish them for behaviors related to their disabilities. 1 Section S04 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title IT of the ADA prohibit entities from discriminating against individuals on the basis of their disabilities, and both laws' anti-discrimination mandates use nearly identical language. See Section S04 at 29 U.S.C. <unk>794(a) (1973) and Title IT at 42 U.S.C. <unk>12132 (1990). The only meaningful difference between Section S04 and Title II is that Section S04applies only to federally-funded recipients. Hence, when applying both laws in the context of state actors receiving federal funding for the provision of elementary and secondary education, the Fifth Circuit has concluded that the rights and remedies under both statutes are the same, and that both statutes may be used interchangeably. Pace v. Bogalusa City Sch. Bd., 403 F.3d 272,287-88 (Sth Cir. 200S). 3. Students with disabilities are also protected by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act which prohibits entities that receive federal funding-including state Departments of Education-from discriminating against people on the basis of their disabilities. Section 504 mandates that state educational agencies provide students with disabilities with access to the same educational opportunities that are provided to non-disabled students. 4. Defendants State Superintendent of Education Paul Pastorek, the Louisiana Department of Education (""LDE"") and the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (""BESE"") bear ultimate responsibility for ensuring that every school district and every school within the state of Louisiana complies with these federal laws. The Defendants have abdicated this responsibility and as a result, the rights of New Orleans public school students with disabilities are violated in four general ways: 5. First, students with disabilities are denied admission to public schools on the basis of their disabilities because the Defendants have failed to ensure that public schools offer disabled students the same variety of educational programs and services as are available to nondisabled children. These practices constitute nothing less than disability discrimination. 6. Second, students with disabilities are denied the protections and services to which they are entitled under federal law because the Defendants have not promulgated and","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] December 2004 | Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 | U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana ||| Louisiana Department of Education ||| Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act .<n>Plaintiffs filed this class action on behalf of all New Orleans public school students with disabilities.

The Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) within the U.S. Department of Education (“DOE”) has a special mission: “to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence through vigorous enforcement of civil rights in our nation’s schools.” https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/aboutocr.html. This office serves “student populations facing discrimination and the advocates and institutions promoting systemic solutions to civil rights problems.” Id. 3. To fulfill its mission, OCR notes that “an important responsibility is resolving complaints of discrimination.” Id. Complaints of discrimination can be filed by anyone who believes that an educational institution that receives federal financial assistance has discriminated against someone on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. The victim himself does not need to file – instead, an advocate or organization can file on an individual’s behalf or on behalf of a group. The ability to file a complaint and have it thoroughly reviewed is integral to the mission of the OCR. 4. Indeed, some claims under the statutes enforced by DOE’s OCR, such as those alleging disparate impact discrimination, can only be enforced by the federal government. Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001) (finding that implementing regulation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 regarding disparate impact discrimination is only enforceable by the federal funding agencies). 5. Contrary to its mission and without any public notice, earlier this year DOE summarily eliminated substantive rights of the very people it purports to serve by changing its Case Processing Manual to abdicate its basic duty to investigate legitimate complaints of discrimination by students and their parents. 6. Effective March 5, 2018, the DOE amended the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights Case Processing Manual (“2018 OCR Manual”). The changes include new provisions to require mandatory dismissal of certain complaints and the elimination of the appeal rights of complainants. 7. Because these changes violate the federal Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. Chapter 5, <unk>551, et seq., and are contrary to OCR’s mission, Plaintiffs, on their own behalf and on behalf of their members who are or may be victims of discrimination in the education system, ask the Court (1) to declare the amendments to the 2018 OCR Manual in violation of the law, (2) to enjoin Defendants from enforcing these new provisions of the 2018 OCR Manual, and (3) to set aside the changes PARTIES JURISDICTION 8. The National Federation of the Blind, Inc. (“NFB”) is the oldest and largest national organization of blind persons. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation duly organized under the laws of the District of Columbia and headquartered at 200 East Wells Street at Jernigan Place, Baltimore, Maryland. It has approximately 50,000 members and affiliates in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The NFB and its affiliates are widely recognized by the public, Congress, executive agencies of state and federal governments, and courts as a collective and representative voice on behalf of blind Americans and their families. The organization promotes the general welfare of the blind by assisting the blind in their efforts to integrate themselves into society on terms of equality and by removing barriers that result in the denial of opportunity to blind persons in virtually every sphere of life, including education, employment, family and community life, transportation, and recreation. 9. The ultimate purpose of the NFB is the complete integration of blind individuals into society on a basis of equality. This objective includes the removal of legal, economic, and social discrimination.","<pad>The National Federation of the Blind, Inc., The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc, and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the Department of Education and its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in March of this year.

DEVOS, in her official capacity as United States Secretary of Education; KENNETH L. MARCUS, in his official capacity as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the United States Department of Education; and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, Defendants. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. Nearly half a century since the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), sexual harassment and assault remain a widespread problem for students of all ages. In 1972, Congress delegated to Defendant U.S. Department of Education (“ED” or “the Agency”) the power and responsibility to hold educational institutions receiving federal funds accountable for their responses to sex discrimination. Since 1997, the Agency has set standards governing the responsibilities of funding recipients to address sexual harassment, including sexual assault, and to take steps to prevent it. Under statutes imposing virtually identical obligations, schools that receive federal funding have also been required to respond to and prevent harassment and assault on the basis of race, national origin, and disability.1 Until now, 1 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”); Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“Title II”). Compare Title VI, 42 ED has imposed the same responsibilities on recipients to respond to harassment based on sex that it imposes on them to respond to harassment based on race, national origin, and disability. With the promulgation of the Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance regulation (RIN 1870-AA14, Docket No. ED2018-OCR-0064) (the “Rule”), however, the Agency has radically reduced the responsibility of schools to respond to complaints of sexual harassment and assault, creating an arbitrary and wholly unexplained disparity between its treatment of sex discrimination on the one hand, and race, national origin, and disability discrimination on the other. 2. Defendant ED Secretary Elisabeth DeVos has discarded decades of ED’s experience addressing sexual harassment and assault by promulgating regulatory provisions that sharply limit educational institutions’ obligations to respond to reports of sexual harassment and assault. If allowed to be implemented at educational institutions nationwide, these provisions will make the promise of equal educational opportunities irrespective of sex even more elusive. This is true for all students, including students of color, LGBTQ students, and students with and without disabilities, in grade school, high school, and higher education. 3. Public statements by ED Secretary DeVos and former Deputy Assistant Secretary Candice Jackson echo the historical justifications and stereotypes that once animated the second- U.S.C. <unk>2000d (“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”); with Title IX, 20 U.S.C. <unk>1681 (“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.”); and Section 504, 29 U.S.C. <unk>794(a) (“No otherwise qualified individual with a disability... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”); and Title II, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12132 (“[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”). class legal treatment of women’s and girls’ accounts of sexual harassment or assault and enabled these accounts to be dismissed, belittled, and ignored. 4. For example, Jackson, who also led the Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, said that in most investigations, there is “not even an accusation that these accused students overrode the will of a young woman. Rather, the accusations—90 percent of them—fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk,’ ‘we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.’”2 5. Secretary DeVos similarly suggested that Title IX reports of sexual harassment are often frivolous: “Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes.

Both Proposal 2 and the University of Michigan's announcement that it would comply triggered litigation.  On November 15, 2012, the en banc Sixth Circuit held that Proposal 2 created a comparative structural burden that undermined the Equal Protection Clause (which the court called the ""political process"" argument).  Accordingly, the court found Proposal 2 unconstitutional.  On March 24, 2013, the Supreme Court granted review of the case.  Argument will be after the Court's summer break.  

On October 15, 2013 the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case.  In an opinion written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, the court reversed the Sixth Circuit.  There were two concurring opinions and a single dissent.  In his opinion Kennedy asserts that this is not a case about resolving the debate about racial preferences, but rather about whether it is constitutional for Michigan to allow its voters to decide the issue.  The court holds that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in this Court’s precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school admissions.

The plaintiffs BAMN, et al. assert that Proposal 2, which was placed on the ballot of the State of Michigan by racially-targeted voter fraud, and which was adopted by Michigan voters on November 7, 2006, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and is preempted by Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. As there is no state’s rights exception for federal anti-discrimination laws, the plaintiffs ask for declaratory and injunctive relief against the implementation of Proposal 2. (42 USC 1983) 2. In the absence of affirmative action, state actors will be prohibited from utilizing the only effective policies ever devised to desegregate universities, employment, and public contracting. No state Constitution can prohibit its state bodies from fulfuilling the federal mandate to desegregate. 3. In the absence of affirmative action, college admissions, state hiring and contracting will be conducted on a discriminatory basis. The irreparable harm to women and minorities in the absence of affirmative action has been clearly established in California. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4.

Plaintiff RA-G., hereinafter ""Student,"" attends school in the Buffalo City School District and brings this action by her parent and Plaintiff herein, RB. (hereinafter ""Parent""), who is a resident of the District. Said student and numerous similarly situated students (present and future) are educationally disabled and classified as such by the District's Committee(s) on Special Education (""CSE"")(s). 3. Defendants have failed to meet their statutory and regulatory obligations to Student and numerous similarly situated children attending the District, or who are entitled to services from the District, and to Parent and similarly situated parents of such children. 4. Defendants' practices, customs, policies and/or procedures fail to comply with the applicable statutes and regulations requiring that children with disabilities timely and promptly receive related services (e.g.- speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy) to be provided pursuant to their respective Individual Educational Programs (IEPs) as determined on an individual basis (rather than based on policy, practice, custom and/or procedure), and requiring that parents of such children be afforded meaningful participation in the educational decision-making process. 5. Defendants maintain and implement a policy by which the District does not provide the related services to be provided via students' IEPs during the first two weeks of the school year (or longer), irrespective of any individual student's need for such related services at the inception of the school year. 6. Defendants, consistent with their policy, did not implement the related services (i.e. speech and language therapy) to be provided via the Student's IEP until September 23, 2011, more than two weeks after the inception of the 2011-12 school year. Defendants delayed providing such services despite the absence of the Parent's approval, consent, or input into such decision. 7. Plaintiffs challenged Defendants' unlawful policy and exhausted their administrative remedies by filing a due process complaint, participating in an impartial hearing, and appealing to the New York State Review Officer (SRO). This action is, in part, an appeal of the SRO's erroneous decision that Defendants' application of their unlawful policy to R.A-G. did not deny the Student a FAPE. 8. The specific relief Plaintiffs request is as follows: a. a judgment declaring that Defendants' practices, customs, policies and/or procedures, deprive Plaintiff (Parent and Student) and similarly situated parents and students their statutory rights, are illegal and/or invalid, and are in contravention of Defendants' statutory duty to assure that Student and similarly situated students (1) promptly receive services at the start of the school year; and (2) receive services based on an individual assessment of the child, rather than based on general policy or practice; and that Parent and similarly situated parents are afforded their right to meaningfully participate in the decision-making process; b. a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring Defendants to cease their unlawful practices and activities, to rescind their unlawful policy, and to provide students with disabilities the related services determined appropriate by the CSE, at the start of the school year based on individual assessment; c. an order directing the provision of additional related services for the Student to compensate for Defendants' implementation of its unlawful policy and practice, which resulted in Defendants' failure to provide the Student with related services at the start of the school year; d. an order directing Defendants to pay the costs and disbursements incurred by Plaintiffs in commencing and maintaining this action, and reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to 20 U.S.C. <unk>1415(e)(4) and/or this Court's general equity powers; e. such other and further relief as to this Court may deem just and proper.

This is an action to enjoin the Pennsylvania Secretary of Education from frustrating the effective education of students with disabilities whose parents seek their education in regular class with supplementary aids and services. It is brought by students with disabilities and their parents, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, and by statewide and regional organizations created by parents, citizens with disabilities, advocates and professionals, to redress the violation of federal law which requires (a) comprehensive personnel development; (b) the ""adoption of promising educational practices and materials""; (c) an ""appropriate educational program"" for each child, that is, one reasonably calculated to confer real educational benefits, and (d) the education of children with disabilities ""to the maximum extent appropriate, with children who do not have disabilities."" 2. Federal law is plain that a school district, when determining whether a child with disabilities can be included in a regular classroom, ""'must consider the whole range of supplemental aids and services'"" that will make inclusion possible, including ""speech and language therapy, special education training for the regular teacher, behavior modification programs, or any other available aids and services appropriate to the child's particular disabilities.""

NEW YORK, NY 10004 T/21 2.549.2600 WWW.ACLU.ORG/LGBT To Whom it May Concern: We write to file a complaint against Gloucester County Public Schools (“GCPS”) on behalf of Gavin Grimm. On December 9, 2014, the Gloucester County Public School Board (the “School Board”) adopted a policy stating that the use of boys’ and girls’ restroom and locker rooms “shall be limited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with sincere gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative private facility.” Gavin, who is a tenth-grade student at Gloucester High School and a transgender boy, had been using the boys’ restroom facilities at school without any complaints from peers, prior to the adoption of this policy. GCPS adopted its “biological gender” policy in direct response to Gavin in order to prevent him from continuing to use boys’ facilities. The “biological gender” policy on its face and as applied to Gavin discriminates against Gavin on the basis of his sex in violation of Title DC of the Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. <unk>168 1(a) (“Title IX”). If the Educational Opportunities Section declines to pursue this complaint, we respectfully request that this complaint be referred to the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights. I. Contact Information for the Parties Gavin Grimm and his mother, Deirdre Grimm, may be contacted through undersigned counsel. This complaint is against Gloucester County Public Schools, 6099 T.C. Walker Road, Gloucester, VA 23061. It is represented by Edwin Wilmot, County Attorney. II. Facts Gavin is a sophomore at Gloucester High School. He is also a transgender boy with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Consistent with recognized standards of care for teens with gender dysphoria, Gavin’s medical and mental health providers have determined that living in accordance with his gender identity in every possible respect, including using the appropriate restroom, is essential for his treatment for gender dysphoria. Educational Opportunities Section U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Since the beginning of this school year, Gavin has been open about his gender identity with Gloucester High School’s administration, teachers, and students. At first, Gavin exclusively used unisex restroom facilities in the nurse’s office, but found that experience to be stigmatizing and isolating. Beginning on approximately October 20, 2014, Gavin has been allowed to use the boys’ restrooms on campus. Gavin’s use of the restroom appropriate to his gender identity has caused no disruption of any kind at the school during the ensuing month. To our knowledge, not a single student complained to school officials or expressed discomfort with Gavin using the boys’ restrooms on campus. In response to complaints from parents, GCPS adopted the following policy at a School Board meeting on December 9, 2014: Whereas the GCPS recognizes that some students question their gender identities, and Whereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support and advice from parents, professionals and other trusted adults, and Whereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all students and to protect the privacy of all students, therefore It shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male and female restroom and locker room facilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be limited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with sincere gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative private facility. According to news reports, at least one student at Gloucester High School, a freshman boy who is not transgender, said that some students are uncomfortable using the same restroom as a transgender boy but did not report any concerns to the administration for fear of being labeled as bullies or intolerant.1 Some parents expressed concern that “transgender students would be looking at other people’s private parts, especially in boys’ bathrooms.”2 During the School Board meeting, Gavin was referred to by some speakers as “a girl” and as “a freak.”3 The School Board adopted the policy by a vote of 6-1, despite the objections of the dissenting school board member that the proposed policy violated Title IX and exposed GCPS to the risk of losing federal funding. According to news reports, GCPS stated in a news release that it plans to increase privacy in restrooms by “adding or expanding partitions between urinals in male restrooms, and ‘Frances Hubbard, Gloucester School Board OKs policy restricting transgender students from using boys’ restroom, The Daily Press, Dec. 9, 2014, http://www.daily","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] December 9, 2014 | Gloucester County Public Schools | U.S. Department of Justice | ACLU ||| Title IX ||| Gloucester County High School ||| December 10, 2014 ||||| December 13, 2016 ||| January 5, 2017 ||| February 5, 2018 ||| March 3, 2018 .<n>On December 9, 2014, the ACLU filed this complaint on behalf of a transgender high school student in Gloucester County, Virginia.

The jury initially awarded the employee $132,347 in back pay, but it found that his damages should be reduced by $102,803 because he could have mitigated those damages by finding a comparable position.

Section: FIRST TOWER LOAN, LLC d/b/a TOWER LOAN OF LAKE CHARLES, COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND Defendant. COMPLAINT OF SEX DISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 Plaintiff Tristan Broussard (“Plaintiff” or “Mr. Broussard”), by and through his undersigned counsel, files this Complaint and Jury Demand against Defendant First Tower Loan, LLC d/b/a Tower Loan of Lake Charles (“Defendant” or “Tower Loan”). INTRODUCTION 1. This suit arises from Tower Loan’s decision to terminate Plaintiff Tristan Broussard because of his sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000e et seq. (“Title VII”). 2. In February 2013, Tower Loan extended a job offer to Mr. Broussard to work as a Manager Trainee in its Lake Charles, Louisiana branch. At the time that Tower Loan made that job offer, Mr. Broussard’s gender, gender identity, and gender expression were male. 3. Shortly after Mr. Broussard began working for Tower Loan in March 2013, Mr. Broussard’s supervisor at the Lake Charles branch Leah Sparks reviewed his employment paperwork and noticed that his driver’s license listed his sex as female Ms. Sparks asked Mr. Broussard to explain why his driver’s license listed his sex as female, and Mr. Broussard truthfully responded that he is a transgender man. 4. Less than a week after Tower Loan learned of the sex listed on Mr. Broussard’s driver’s license and that Mr. Broussard is a transgender man, Tower Loan Vice President David Morgan traveled to Lake Charles to meet with Mr. Broussard and his supervisor Mr. Morgan informed Mr. Broussard that he could continue working at Tower Loan only if Mr. Broussard signed a written statement agreeing to act and be treated as female rather than as male while working for Tower Loan, including by dressing as female. Because Mr. Broussard is a transgender man and could not so agree, he was terminated from his position at Tower Loan. 5. Tower Loan’s decision to terminate Mr. Broussard because he is a transgender man, and because of his inability to conform to Tower Loan’s stereotypical expectations of gender and its requirements that he should agree to be treated as female, including by dressing and conducting himself as female, violates Title VII’s prohibition on employment discrimination because of sex. Title VII makes it unlawful for employers to discriminate against their employees or applicants for employment because of their sex, which includes discrimination based on a person’s gender identity or transgender status; because a person has undergone, is undergoing, or intends to undergo a gender transition; or because a person fails to conform to gender- or gender-based stereotypes. In terminating Mr. Broussard for these reasons, Tower Loan violated Title VII. PARTIES 6. Plaintiff Tristan Broussard is a 21-year-old resident of Lake Charles, Louisiana Mr. Broussard is and was well qualified to serve as a Manager Trainee at Tower Loan. 7. Defendant Tower Loan is a limited liability company that maintains its principal Louisiana business establishment in Hammond, Louisiana. At all relevant times, Tower Loan has employed at least 15 employees, has done business within this District, and has been an employer engaged in an industry affecting commerce. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 8. This Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1343. 9. Venue is proper in this District because the unlawful acts of employment discrimination described herein occurred within Louisiana, and Tower Loan is found and maintains its primary Louisiana business establishment within this District. 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000e5(f)(3). FACTS 10. Tower Loan is a privately owned finance company that operates more than 180 branches in five States, including Louisiana. It employs more than 700 individuals and serves more than 200,000 customers. Its primary business is consumer installment lending. 11. In February 2013, Tower Loan sought applicants for a Manager Trainee position within its Lake Charles, Louisiana branch. Manager Trainees are generally responsible for lending, collecting, assisting with branch management, reviewing contracts, providing customer service, and assisting with hiring, training, and staff development. 12 Mr. Broussard applied for the Lake Charles Manager Trainee position in early February 2013 Mr. Broussard was well qualified for the position due to his previous sales experience dealing directly with clients and customers Mr. Broussard was excited about the possibility of working for Tower Loan because of the increased salary he would receive if hired, the potential for growth and advancement within the company","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] First Tower Loan, LLC d/b/a Tower Loan of Lake Charles, Louisiana | Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 | 42 U.S.C.<unk>2000e et seq. ||| March 2014 ||| May 2015 ||| June 2015 | ||| July 2015 | July 2016 | July 2017 | July 2018 | August 2018 | July 2019 | August 2019 | July 2020 | August 2020 | July 2021 | August 2021 | September 2020 | September 2021 | October 2020 | October 2021 | November 2020 | December 2020 | January 2020 | March 2021 | March 2020 | April 2020 | May 2020 | June 2021 | May 2021 | June 2020 | February 2019 | March 2019 | May 2019 | June 2020, July 2020, March 2020, April 2020, May 2020, March 2020 and May 2020, in the Eastern District of Louisiana, a transgender man filed this suit in March 2014 in the United States District Court for the district of Louisiana. The plaintiff was terminated from his position as a Manager Trainee in the Lake Charles branch of Tower Loan because of his gender identity and his inability to conform to Tower Loan’s stereotypical expectations of gender and its requirements that he should agree to be treated as female, including by dressing and conducting himself as female. In March 2014, the plaintiff filed a complaint against Tower Loan in the district court. On March 2015, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that Tower Loan had violated Title VII because the plaintiff had not consented to the terms of the consent decree. On July 2016, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiff. On May 2015, the parties entered a consent decree, which prohibited Tower Loan from discriminating against transgender employees or applicants for employment based on their gender identity. The consent decree also required Tower Loan to pay the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and costs. The parties agreed to a joint and several hundred thousand dollars to be divided among them. On June 2015, the defendant agreed to settle the case.</s>"

(“Friedman’s” or “the Company”) under federal law prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of race. Plaintiff Rondall Mitchell brings a related individual claim of unlawful retaliation under federal law by Friedman’s for his opposition to the Company’s racially discriminatory policies and practices. In addition, Plaintiffs bring this action against Federal Insurance Company and St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company (collectively the “Insurers”) to obtain declaratory judgment that the Insurers are contractually liable for, and obligated to indemnify Friedman’s on, Plaintiffs’ claims for monetary relief on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated persons, pursuant to insurance contracts between Friedman’s and the Insurers. This race discrimination in employment class action is brought by one African American applicant for employment, John O’Bannon, and two African American former employees, Sandra Moore and Ronald Hampton. Rondall Mitchell, who is white, brings an individual claim of retaliation for opposing Friedman’s racially discriminatory policies and practices while he worked as a manager for Friedman’s. Friedman’s has engaged, and continues to engage, in a companywide policy, pattern or practice of race discrimination in hiring, promotion, compensation and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment and has maintained a hostile environment for African American employees in violation of 42 U.S.C. <unk>1981.

Judge Garbis initially granted a motion for a preliminary injunction in September, but this was later stayed in 2019 when the Supreme Court issued a stay of this nationwide injunction in two factually similar cases contesting the ban. 

This case changed dramatically in 2018 when the government altered its policy on transgender service in the military, eliminating an outright ban and instead putting new guidance on transgender men and women entering the service. Judge Russell, reassigned to the case in 2018, dissolved the preliminary injunction, saying that it was only meant to stay a complete ban on transgender service in the military. This also dismissed all claims against the 2017 outright ban as moot, and removed all plaintiffs that were already in the service and not seeking to join.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. Thousands of transgender service members are serving honorably in this country’s Armed Forces. Some perform critical roles in intelligence analysis, disaster relief, medical care, and pre-deployment training at bases in the United States. Others have deployed to combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many transgender service members have received awards for their service, and some have served for decades. All have answered the selfless call of service to our nation by putting themselves in harm’s way to protect the rights and freedoms fundamental to this country. 2. The individual plaintiffs in this case (“Individual Plaintiffs”) are just some of those transgender service members. Petty Officer Stone has served in the U.S. Navy for 11 years, including a nine-month deployment to Afghanistan, and is currently assigned to a unit at Fort Meade, in Maryland. Staff Sergeant Cole has served in the U.S. Army for almost ten years, including a one-year deployment to Afghanistan where she served as a team leader and designated marksman. Senior Airman Doe has served for approximately six years on active duty in the U.S. Air Force, where he was awarded “Airman of the Year” for his flight. Airman First Class George has been enlisted in the Air National Guard since 2015. He is training as a nurse, and intends to seek a commission in the U.S Army. Petty Officer Gilbert has served in the U.S. Navy for 13 years, including a one-year deployment to Afghanistan, and currently serves as an information and space systems technician. Technical Sergeant Parker served in the Marine Corps for four years and has served in the Air National Guard for 26 years, now working as a fuel technician. 3. At the culmination of a thorough process of research and analysis, the Department of Defense (“DoD”) concluded in 2016 that there was no basis for the military to exclude men and women who are transgender from openly serving their country, subject to the same fitness requirements as other service members. This review process carefully considered and rejected the notion that medical costs, military readiness, or other factors presented any plausible reason to discriminate against service members who are transgender, many of whom had already been serving with honor in silence for decades. Accordingly, the Secretary of Defense issued a directive (the “Open Service Directive”) that service members who are transgender be permitted to serve openly without fear of discharge; that these service members receive medically necessary healthcare, as do others who serve their country; and that, beginning on July 1, 2017, men and women who are transgender be permitted to enlist in the military subject to stringent enlistment standards. 4. On the morning of July 26, 2017, President Trump declared on Twitter that the Individual Plaintiffs and all other men and women who are transgender would no longer be allowed to continue serving in the military “in any capacity.” This pronouncement was posted under the handle @realDonaldTrump: 5. The Trump Administration has provided no evidence that this pronouncement was based on any analysis of the actual cost and disruption allegedly caused by allowing men and women who are transgender to serve openly. News reports indicate that the Secretary of Defense and other military officials were surprised by President Trump’s announcement, and that his actual motivations were purely political, reflecting a desire to accommodate legislators and advisers who bear animus and moral disapproval toward men and women who are transgender, with a goal of gaining votes for a spending bill that included money to build a border wall with Mexico. 6.

INTRODUCTION 1. This is one of the saddest and most shocking cases this Court is likely to address. Three African American police officers, working for Pocomoke City, Maryland, experienced racial discrimination in employment and retaliation for the exercise of their federal civil rights in a manner that most Americans would have believed unthinkable in the second decade of the 21st Century. While Pocomoke City bills itself as the “Friendliest Town on the Eastern Shore,” its law enforcement community, including the Pocomoke City Police Department, the Department of Maryland State Police, the Worcester County Sheriff’s Office, and, most disappointingly, the State’s Attorney’s Office, acted more in the vein of “Jim Crow.” 2. Three model police officers, including the first African American chief of police in Pocomoke City and the first and only African American detective assigned to the local narcotics task force, were mocked, threatened, demeaned, demoted, punished, falsely accused of misconduct, ostracized, and humiliated because of their race. Ultimately, two of the Plaintiffs here, Franklin Savage (“Officer Savage”) and Kelvin Sewell (“Chief Sewell”), were fired by Pocomoke City in obvious retaliation for their filing of United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) complaints. The third officer, Lynell Green (“Lieutenant Green”), remains employed by Pocomoke City, but his terms of employment have been detrimentally altered, and he is ostracized by the entire department. The intervention of this Court is vitally necessary to make clear to some members of the law enforcement community on the Eastern Shore that this blatant disregard of federal constitutional and statutory rights will not be tolerated. 3. The use of the word “nigger” long ago ceased to be tolerated in any American workplace. So, too, did other forms of racial mockery, epithets, threats, humiliation, and discrimination based on race in the terms of employment. Yet, the three Plaintiffs in this action—Officer Savage, Chief Sewell, and Lieutenant Green—experienced unlawful conduct of this character, often on a daily basis. 4. Officer Savage endured a hostile work environment and employment discrimination throughout his four-year tenure with the Pocomoke City Police Department. He spent more than half of that time detailed to the","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2013 | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of Maryland | Pocomoke City, Maryland | African American Police Officers | Office of the Maryland Attorney General | Worcester County Sheriff's Office .<n>Three African American police officers filed a lawsuit against the city of PocomOKE City and Worcester County, Maryland in September 2013 alleging that they were discriminated against and retaliated against for filing complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

This is collective and individual age discrimination case. Seagate engaged in disparate treatment of older employees with regard to the terms and conditions of employment and termination. Seagate engaged in a pattern or practice of age discrimination in connection with terminations, selection process, opportunities for open positions and hiring. 2. Plaintiffs seek relief under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (""ADEA''), 29 U.S.C. <unk>621 et seq. This Court has original jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 u.s.c. <unk>1331. 3. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, relating to the enforceability of a purported release and waiver signed by many of the Plaintiffs. The EEOC determined that ""the evidence obtained during the course of the investigation establishes reasonable cause to believe that the Charging Part(ies) [have] been discriminated against based on age, and that a class of employees has been discriminated against based on age,"" and ""the evidence obtained establishes reasonable cause to believe that [Seagate's] Special Separation Agreement and Release violates EEO statutes because it requires an employee to waive his/her right to file an EEOC Charge of Discrimination."" 4. This action is brought under the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. <unk>216(b) on behalf of the Plaintiffs named above and all persons similarly situated who choose to opt in under procedures applicable to age discrimination claims. Declaratory relief is sought under 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201. 5. Venue of this action in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) because the Plaintiffs were employed and terminated here, and a substantial part of the events giving rise to these claims occurred here. 6. All conditions precedent to the filing of this lawsuit have been met. Plaintiffs Olson and Peterson timely filed charges of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC"") and cross-filled with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights (""MDHR""). Seagate, the EEOC and the MDHR were placed on notice that the claims were filed on behalf of all persons similarly situated, and that collective and class litigation was contemplated. Other terminated employees over age 40 that did not file charges within 300 days are ""piggybacking"" on the charges of Plaintiffs Olson and Peterson. The EEOC treated Plaintiffs Olson and Peterson's charges as class/collective charges. The EEOC issued Right to Sue letters on February 27,2007. Parties 7.

This class action seeks to vindicate the rights of the many AfricanAmerican detectives in the NYPD’s Intelligence Division1 whose promotions were denied or delayed solely based on race. For well over a decade, the NYPD’s Intelligence Division has implemented a secretive and unstructured promotions policy, administered by white supervisors 1 In 2013, the Intelligence Division changed its name to the Intelligence Bureau. For ease of reference, the Bureau will be referred to throughout this complaint as “Intelligence Division.” who refuse to promote deserving African-Americans detectives. As a result of these policies, Named Plaintiffs and other African-American detectives have been repeatedly denied welldeserved promotions—even when recommended by their direct supervisors—without explanation, while less qualified white detectives have been promoted above them. 2. Detectives Theodore Coleman, Jon McCollum and Roland Stephens were each highly experienced African-American detectives, who devoted over twenty years of their careers to law enforcement. Over the course of their careers in the NYPD, they were each repeatedly commended for their investigative successes, leadership, professionalism, and devotion to achieving the finest results. 3. In 2001, all three of them joined the NYPD’s elite Intelligence Division, which is tasked with preventing and investigating terrorism and other major crimes. On September 11, 2001, they risked their lives to rescue those in the towers and to maintain security. Following the attacks, they assisted with the cleanup and investigation, interviewing hundreds of suspected terrorists and following up on innumerable leads. They dedicated their careers to keeping New Yorkers safe. 4. In spite of their proven track records of achievement and strong recommendations from their direct supervisors, they were repeatedly passed up for promotion due to their race. More than one supervisor who recommended them said that if they had been white then they would have been promoted. Other supervisors were at a loss to explain why they were not promoted. 5. Other African-Americans detectives in the Intelligence Division have faced a similar fate. There is a stark disparity in the percent of African Americans in the Intelligence Division, as opposed to the police force in general. When Named Plaintiffs filed with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) a complaint in 2011, African Americans constituted 18% of all NYPD police officers and 16% of all detectives, but only 6% of Intelligence Division personnel and 7% of Intelligence Division detectives. 6. Of the African-American detectives in the Intelligence Division, the vast majority were of the lowest grade, Third Grade Detectives. Third Grade Detectives make approximately $20,000 less per year than Second Grade Detectives and approximately $30,000 per year less than First Grade Detectives. 7. The disproportionately small number of African-American detectives in the higher paying and more prestigious First and Second Grades is a direct result of the secret and standard-less promotions policy that gives high-level NYPD personnel in the Intelligence Division unchecked discretion to hand-pick white candidates for promotion while repeatedly overlooking more qualified African-American detectives. At the time Named Plaintiffs filed their charge with the EEOC, those making the decisions were overwhelmingly white. There were no African Americans in the senior levels of the Intelligence Division, with none holding a rank above sergeant—that is, no Lieutenants, Captains, Deputy Inspectors, or Chiefs. 8. After investigating the case for five years, the EEOC found that “black detectives do not receive equal treatment in promotion.” Specifically, the EEOC found that Named Plaintiffs “and black detectives in general, received lesser and later opportunities for promotion consistent with their qualifications.” That is, African-American detectives waited years longer than their white counterparts to be promoted. 9. Although Named Plaintiffs have complained for years about this discriminatory treatment and brought an EEOC charge, which was determined in their favor, the NYPD has yet to address these concerns and has failed to take even the basic step of adopting and implementing a formal, non-discriminatory promotions policy with clear criteria for promotion. As a result, African-American detectives continue to face the NYPD’s illegal promotion practices to this day. 10. The NYPD’s discriminatory promotion policy harms not only AfricanAmerican detectives but all of New York City. 11. The Named Plaintiffs thought that that by joining the NYPD they would not only help keep New York City safe but also make a difference in the primarily AfricanAmerican","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 11, 2001 | New York City Police Department ||| African-American Detectives ||| September 11, 2013 ||| New York ||| NYPD ||| The City of New York, New York Police Department, and NYPD Assistant Chief Thomas Galati (collectively, the defendants) filed this class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of the New York on September 11, 2001.

114,EE-NY-0298,"[ENTITYCHAIN] Black FDNY employees | FDNY | City of New York ||| May 2020 ||| February 11, 2021 [SUMMARY] Current and former Black FDNY employees sued the City of New York alleging racial discrimination in their hiring, promotion, and compensation practices. Plaintiffs sought to represent a class of individuals similarly situated who suffered from FDNY's policies that afforded too much discretion to higher-level individuals and fostered a culture of favoritism that harmed Black candidates for hiring and advancement.  The City filed a motion to dismiss and the Court partially granted the motion, but sustained the plaintiffs' claims related to the hiring and promotion practices with the FDNY. The City moved for partial summary judgment in May 2020, arguing that the retired class representatives could not seek relief. At the same time, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. Both motions were pending as of February 11, 2021.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ANNETTE RICHARDSON, DEBORAH BOWMAN, LIZA HORSLEY, DEBRA POE DINO RIOJAS, ARLENE SIMMONS, and STEPHANIE THOMAS On behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, v. CLASS ACTION CITY OF NEW YORK, Defendant. I. INTRODUCTION 1. For well over a century, the Fire Department of New York (the “FDNY”) has engaged in a pattern or practice of systemic, continuous, and intentional discrimination against African American emergency medical services (“EMS”) and non-uniformed (“Civilian”) employees and job applicants in hiring, placement, advancement, and compensation decisions. For about 100 years after the Civil War, white men, primarily of Irish and Italian descent, controlled the FDNY at all levels, from upper management to staff. Token integration began during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, but African Americans remained severely underrepresented at all levels of the agency and in all types of jobs. 2. As a result of the broad pattern of racial discrimination, the percentage of African American employees in FDNY as a whole is far less than in other agencies of the New York City government, the percentage of African American employees in higher paying EMS and Civilian jobs in FDNY is far less than in lower compensated jobs, and African American Civilian employees are paid lower salaries or wages than white employees in the same job positions. 3. The interaction of four factors produces these racial disparities in job selections and compensation. First, despite knowing of the statistical racial disparities, FDNY leadership has failed to adopt or implement systematically widely accepted human resources practices that reduce the opportunity for discrimination, including policies and practices in connection with performance appraisals, posting of vacant positions, and monitoring of decisions for patterns of racially skewed outcomes. Second, a culture of in-group favoritism under which white decisionmakers favor people with similar backgrounds to themselves has infected the FDNY for generations. Third, a very small group of decision-makers, most notably the Assistant Commissioner for Human Resources and the Assistant Commissioner for Budget Finance, have contributed to the racial disparities through their decisions to approve or disapprove most proposed job selection and compensation decisions for EMS and Civilian FDNY employees. Finally, the Mayor’s office and other City offices and agencies have failed to exercise control over FDNY’s human resources and diversity practices despite myriad lawsuits, unfavorable reports, and other beacons shining light on the racial discrimination at FDNY. These factors reflect intentional racial discrimination against African American employees, and FDNY’s practices have had a disparate impact on the hiring, advancement, and compensation of African American employees. 4. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and three classes of African Americans defined more precisely in paragraph 136 below – the “Job Selection Class”, the “Compensation Class,” and the “EMS Lieutenant Class.” They claim that the FDNY’s racial discrimination violates 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and the New York City Human Rights Law (“NYHRL”), N.Y.C Admin.

Kraft responds that Ms. Davis failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to the Title VII class claims. Kraft also argues that Ms. Davis cannot bring a class claim under Title VII or <unk>1981 because she does not meet the commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements for class certification. I agree with Kraft in part. Although it is a close question, I do not agree that Ms. Davis failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to her Title VII class claims. I agree with Kraft, however, that Ms. Davis cannot meet the law’s typicality requirements with respect to her job classification claims, and so deny certification of those claims with prejudice. As to the claims of discriminatory discipline, I deny class certification without prejudice so that Davis may obtain new counsel. Finally, Kraft has moved to strike the report of Plaintiff’s expert. I deny the motion without prejudice to the extent that it relates to disciplinary issues, and deny the remainder of the motion as moot. BACKGROUND I. Davis’s Class Allegations A. Job Classification Nabisco operated a bakery in the Northeast section of Philadelphia until December 2000, when Kraft acquired Nabisco, assuming all Nabisco’s assets and liabilities. (Pl.Ex. 6, Phillip Morris Cos., Inc. Form 10 K, dated December 31, 2000, at 12, Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet). The Philadelphia Bakery makes cookies and crackers. From November 1999 to the present, the Philadelphia Bakery has employed some 450 to 600 hourly workers and 60 to 70 salaried employees. (Pl.Ex. 8, Savoy Dep. at 63; Pl.Ex. 9, Beitzel Dep. at 91; Pl.Ex. 5, Phila. Bakery Supervisory Guidelines Handbook at 4). Approximately half the hourly workforce is African-American. (Pl.Ex. 8, Dep. of Savoy at 64). The hourly workers are represented by the Bakery, Confectionary and Tobacco Workers’ International Union AFL-CIO Local 492, which has negotiated a Collective Bargaining Agreement with Kraft. (Def Memo. of Law in Opp. to Class Cert. and in Support of Mot. to Strike Pl.’s Expert Rep., p. 3). The Bakery has seven departments comprised of skilled and semi-skilled positions. (Pl.Ex. 2, 2001-2004 Collect Barg Agmt. at p. 28; Pl.Ex. 9, Beitzel Dep. at 202-203). Plaintiff alleges that African-Americans are under-represented in the Bakery’s higher paying skilled jobs. See Pl.Ex. 4, Expert Report of David L. Crawford, Ph.D., at 19. Davis also alleges that Kraft discriminates against African-American employees in the assignment of entry-level positions. Labor Schedulers-who are salaried supervisors-make job assignment decisions at the Bakery. All new hourly employees are hired as trainees. (Pl.Ex. 11, Doyle Dep. at 275). Plaintiff alleges that after the training period, Labor Schedulers have discretion in assigning new hires to one of two permanent entry level hourly positions: “General Help” or “Floor Help.” (Id. at 319-320, 324). “General Help” is the lowest paid level of Bakery work; “Floor Help” employees receive higher pay and other advantages, such as preference in the assignment of overtime work. (Pl.Ex. 2, 2001-2004 Collect Barg Agmt. at 28, Appendix D; Pl.Ex. 12, Matthews Dep. at 115). Plaintiff alleges that nonminorities were assigned to the “Floor Help” category more frequently than minorities. (Pl.Ex. 12, Matthews Dep. at 115-117). *2 Job classifications at the Bakery are determined on a seniority-based bidding process. (Pl.Ex. 9, Beitzel Dep. at 210; Pl.Ex. 2, 2001-2004 Collect Barg Agmt. at p. 3, Article 5).

Moreover, Latrobe maintains its headquarters in this District, and Representative Plaintiffs, as well as the majority of Class Members, reside and/or worked for Latrobe in this District. FACTUAL BACKGROUND Allegations Concerning Hodczak 14. Hodczak was hired by Latrobe Steel Company (“LSC”) on July 23, 1973. At that time, he had a degree in Political Science and a minor in Economics. 15. In 1975, LSC was acquired by The Timken Company and renamed Timken Latrobe Steel. (“TLS”) 16. Over the years, Hodczak received a series of promotions and occupied a series of different positions at LSC, the Timken Co., and TLS. 17. In 2006, the Timken Company divested the stock of TLS which was acquired by the Watermill Group and Hicks Holdings, which renamed it Latrobe Specialty Steel (“LSS”). On October 1, 2007, Hodczak was promoted to the position of Manager of the Special Products Division. 18. On November 2, 2007, Hodczak received a phone call from Mark Webberding, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, telling him to come to a meeting in Rachel Grant’s office, in the Human Resources Department. When he arrived at the office, he was met by Webberding and Ms. Grant. 19. Webberding told him that he was being suspended without pay and that the reason was that he had been sending and receiving certain material at his LSS email address and that he was additionally guilty of sending emails critiquing management’s performance.

The unlawful employment practices involved subjecting Ann Boyd and Jennifer Wilson to harassment because of their sex and disciplining them in retaliation for opposing practices made unlawful by Title VII. 8. Boyd was hired by Defendant on or around June 2001, as a warehouse worker in its Memphis, Tennessee facility. 9. Around September 2004, a male co-worker exposed himself and masturbated in the presence of Boyd and co-worker Jennifer Wilson while they were taking a break in the employee lounge. 10.

On November 5, 2004, Boyd filed a charge of sexual harassment with the Commission. 13. Thereafter, the Warehouse Manager advised Boyd that, per company policy, there was nothing he could do about her allegations without first witnessing the offending conduct. 14.

Defendant again took no action to stop the offensive conduct. 17. On December 12, 2004, Boyd and Wilson both received written warnings for deliberately falsifying inventory records. These warnings were the first such disciplines either woman had ever received from Defendant. 18. On January 6, 2005, both Boyd and Wilson were suspended for three days without pay for allegedly falsifying inventory records again. 19. On March 29, 2005, Boyd filed a charge with the Commission alleging that the written warnings and suspensions had been issued in retaliation for Boyd’s initial charge of sexual harassment. 20.

The unlawful practices include, but are not limited to, discriminating against Earnestine Tolar and a class of African Americans who were seeking temporary work. 8. Defendant contracted with a local warehouse to place temporary workers into unskilled labor positions. Generally, individuals seeking work would line up outside the warehouse a couple of hours before the start of the shift. 9. The warehouse officials would tell Defendant’s onsite managers the number of employees needed in each department, each day. Then, after all of the positions were filled, the remaining individuals in line would be told to go home. 10 Ms. Tolar was hired by Defendant’s predecessor in January 2004. She was placed at the warehouse in the custom packaging department as an assembly line worker. She would perform whatever work was available on a particular day. She could perform the job duties for most of the positions in the plant. 11. After the warehouse contracted with Defendant, warehouse officials told Ms. Tolar that if she was interested in continued employment, she should contact Defendant. 12 Ms. Tolar went to Defendant’s office and completed another application. Defendant placed Ms. Tolar for a while, but later Defendant began to send her home when there were numerous assignments available. 13.

They claimed that they were unfairly charged fewer ""in service"" days which prevented them from bidding on a number of benefits including flight schedules, paid vacation time, and earned sick leave. Pilots who had taken comparable types of non-military leave were not similarly penalized.

American Airlines is a global air passenger carrier whose passenger division is the largest scheduled passenger airline in the world, employing over 10,000 pilots, of whom approximately 1,000 are members of the United States Anned Forces serving in National Guard and Reserve units. 9. Pursuant to the 1997 and 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreements between American Airlines and the Allied Pilots Association (the ""Collective Bargaining Agreements""), American Airlines has calculated earned vacation time for pilots based on their accumulated service time with American Airlines, as well the pilots' service time during the previous calendar year. Pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreements, American Airlines has calculated earned sick leave time based on the pilots' service time during the previous calendar year. The Collective Bargaining Agreements have required that a pilot be ""in service"" for fifteen (15) days in a calendar month in order for that month to be counted in figuring the pilot's service time. 10.. Pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreements. American Airlines has allowed pilots who are ""in service"" to bid on flight schedules for the upcoming month based on their seniority status. Pilots who are considered to be on ""leaves of absence"" may not bid for flight schedules. 11. Pursuant to the 1997 Collective Bargaining Agreement, American Airlines was required to credit each pilot with 1.33 days of sick leave for each month the pilot was ""in service"" during the year. Pursuant to the 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreemerit, American Airlines must credit each pilot with five (5) hours of sick leave for each month the pilot is ""in service"" during the year. 12. Upon information and belief, in January 2002, American Airlines conducted an audit of the flight records of pilots who took military leave during 2001. Based on that audit, American Airlines reduced the service time for pilots who had taken military leave during 2001, regardless of whether those pilots were scheduled to work on the days they took military leave. This reduction of service time resulted in the reduction of earned vacation time for certain pilots who had taken military leave, including the named plaintiffs Woodall and McMahon. American Airlines did not reduce earned vacation time for pilots who had taken comparable types of non-military leave. 13. Upon information and belief, from 2001 through 2002, American Airlines placed pilots who took military leave; including the named plaintiffs Woodall, McMahon, and Madson, on ""leave of absence"" status, which effectively denied them the ability to bid on flight schedules based on their seniority status and to earn other employment benefits, including earned paid vacation time and earned sick leave.

Box D Building No. 1., North Standing Rock Avenue Fort Yates, ND 58538, Plaintiff, v. U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS 441 G Street NW Washington, DC 20314-1000, Defendant. Case No. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. This is a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (“Tribe”) brings this action in connection with federal actions relating to the Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”), a 1,168-mile-long crude oil pipeline running from North Dakota to Illinois. The Tribe, a federally recognized American Indian Tribe with a reservation in North Dakota and South Dakota, brings this case because defendant U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) has taken actions in violation of multiple federal statutes that authorize the pipeline’s construction and operation. The construction and operation of the pipeline, as authorized by the Earthjustice Seattle, WA 98104 Corps, threatens the Tribe’s environmental and economic well-being, and would damage and destroy sites of great historic, religious, and cultural significance to the Tribe. 2. This complaint involves two kinds of claims. First, the Tribe brings an as-applied challenge to Nationwide Permit 12 (“NWP 12”), issued by the Corps in 2012 pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and Rivers and Harbors Act (“RHA”). DAPL crosses hundreds if not thousands of federally regulated rivers, streams, and wetlands along its route. The discharge of any fill material in such waters is prohibited absent authorization from the Corps. Federal authorization under these statutes, in turn, triggers requirements under the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”), intended to protect sites of historic and cultural significance to Tribes like Standing Rock. In issuing NWP 12, however, the Corps authorized discharges into federal waters without ensuring compliance with the NHPA. In essence, in enacting NWP 12, the Corps pre-authorized construction of DAPL in all but a handful places requiring federal authorization without any oversight from the Corps. In so doing, the Corps abdicated its statutory responsibility to ensure that such undertakings do not harm historically and culturally significant sites. 3. Second, on July 25, 2016, the Corps issued multiple federal authorizations needed to construct the pipeline in certain designated areas along the pipeline route. One such authorization allows DAPL to construct the pipeline underneath Lake Oahe, approximately half a mile upstream of the Tribe’s reservation. Others authorize the DAPL to discharge into waters of the United States at multiple locations in the Tribe’s ancestral lands. The Tribe brings this challenge because these authorizations were made in violation of the CWA and its governing regulations and without compliance with NHPA, and the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). Earthjustice Seattle, WA 98104 4. The Tribe seeks a declaration that the Corps violated the NHPA in issuing NWP 12, and an injunction preventing the Corps from using NWP 12 as applied to DAPL and directing the Corps to ensure full compliance with <unk>106 at all sites involving discharges into waters of the United States. The Tribe further seeks a declaration that the July 25, 2016 authorizations were made in violation of the CWA, NEPA, and NHPA, and an order vacating all existing authorizations and verifications pending full compliance with the CWA, NEPA, and NHPA. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This case states a claim under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. <unk>701 et seq. (“APA”), which authorizes a federal court to find unlawful and set aside any final agency action that is “arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” Id. <unk>706. Jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1362 (“district courts shall have original jurisdiction all civil actions, brought by any Indian Tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States”); <unk>2201 (declaratory relief); <unk>2202 (injunctive relief). 6. Venue in this district is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(e) because it is the district in which the defendant resides and in which “a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred.” PARTIES 7. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is a federally-recognized Indian tribe with a governing body recognized by the Secretary of the Interior. The Tribe is a successor to the Great Sioux Nation, a party to the two Treaties of Fort Laramie in 1851 and 1868. In those Treaties, the Sioux ceded a large portion of their aboriginal territory in the northern Great Plains, but Earthjustice Seattle, WA 98104 reserved land rights “set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation” of the Indians","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Standing Rock Sioux Tribe | U.S. Army Corps of Engineers | District of Columbia ||| Dakota Access Pipeline ||| July 25, 2016 ||| June 30, 2017 ||| August 5, 2017 | ||| December 31, 2018 ||| January 5, 2019 ||| March 2, 2019 .<n>On July 25, 2016, the standing rock Sioux Tribe filed this suit in the U.N.

CATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE ARCHDIOCESE OF WASHINGTON, INC.; 924 G Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20001 DATE STAMP: and THE CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA, 620 Michigan Avenue, N.E. Plaintiffs, v. KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; HILDA SOLIS, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor, TIMOTHY GEITHNER, in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR; and U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. Defendants. COMPLAINT 1. This lawsuit is about one of America's most cherished freedoms: the freedom to practice one's religion without government interference. It is not about whether people have a right to abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception. Those services are freely available in the United States, and nothing prevents the Government itself from making them more widely available. Here, however, the Government seeks to require Plaintiffs-all Catholic entities-to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs by providing, paying for, and/or facilitating access to those services. American history and tradition, embodied in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (""RFRA""), safeguard religious entities from such overbearing and oppressive governmental action. Plaintiffs therefore seek relief in this Court to protect this most fundamental of American rights. 2. Plaintiffs are Catholic religious entities that provide a wide range of spiritual, educational, and social services to residents in the greater Washington, D.C., community, Catholic and non-Catholic alike. For example, Plaintiff Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, a corporation sole (the ""Archdiocese"") not only provides pastoral care and spiritual guidance for nearly 600,000 Catholics, but also serves individuals throughout the D.C. area through its schools and multiple charitable programs. The Archdiocese's programs serve those who are most often overlooked in the community, including those with disabilities, those challenged by an unexpected prenatal diagnosis, those re-entering society from imprisonment, and those poor and marginalized with nowhere else to tum. Likewise, Plaintiffs Consortium of Catholic Academies of the Archdiocese of Washington, Inc. (""CCA"" or the ""Consortium"") and Archbishop Carroll H;igh School, Inc. (""Archbishop Carroll"" or ""Carroll"") are devoted to teaching a religiously and ethnically diverse student body consisting largely of inner-city children. And Plaintiff Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington, Inc. (""Catholic Charities""), the largest nongovernmental social service provider in the region, offers a host of social services to thousands in need throughout the District and Maryland. For those citizens in the community who could not otherwise afford them, Catholic Charities provides free physical and mental health care, legal assistance, immigration assistance, employment training, early childhood services, education, counseling, emergency shelter, housing, and dental services. For its part, Plaintiff Catholic University of America (""CUA"" or the ""University"") offers nearly 7,000 undergraduate and graduate students a rigorous education, while at the same time serving the larger community through, inter alia, its research centers, intellectual offerings, and charitable outreach. 3. Plaintiffs' work is in every respect guided by and consistent with Roman Catholic belief, including the requirement that they serve those in need, regardless of their religion. This is perhaps best captured by words attributed to S1. Francis of Assisi: ""Preach the Gospel at all times. Use words if necessary."" As Pope Benedict has more recently put it, ""[L]ove for widows and orphans, prisoners, and the sick and needy of every kind, is as essential to [the Catholic Church] as the ministry of the sacraments and preaching of the GospeL The Church cannot neglect the service of charity any more than she can neglect the Sacraments and the Word."" Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est, 22 (2006). Or as Cardinal James Hickey, former Archbishop of Washington, once commented on the role of Catholic educators: ""We do not educate our students because they are Catholic; we educate them because we are Catholic."" Thus, Catholic individuals and organizations consistently to create a more just community by serving any and all neighbors in need. 4. Catholic Church teachings also uphold the firm conviction that sexual union should be reserved to married couples who are so committed to one another that they are open to the creation of life; thus, artificial interference with the creation of life, including through abortion, sterilization, and contraceptive",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) | Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington | Catholic University of America (CUA) | Washington D.C.

VERIFIED COMPLAINT Plaintiffs, Tyndale House Publishers, Inc., a nd Mark D. Taylor (col lectively, hereinafter “Tyndale”), by their attorneys <unk>allege as follows: I. INTRODUCTION 1. This action arises because the federal government has deemed devout publishers of the Bible to be insuf ficiently “religious” to enjoy religious freedom in America. The federal government is m andating that Tyndale House Publis hers violate its and its owners’ beliefs by covering morally objectionable items in their health plan pursuant to th e Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Pub L. 111-148 (March 23, 2010), and Pub L. 111-152 (March 30, 2010) (hereinafter “PPACA”). The government has defined “religious employer” to exclude these Bible publishers from exe mptions that the government otherwise provides. Defendants have already been the subject of a preliminary injunction against the Mandate to protect a company owned by religious believers. See Newland v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 3069154 (D Colo. July 27, 2012). 2. Tyndale House Publishers or iginated with the vision of Dr. Kenneth N. T aylor, a publisher and Bible translator. To promote his paraphrases and translations of the Bible, he and his wife started Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. in 1962. In 1963, Dr. Taylor assigned his royalties from his books to the religious non-profit entity Tyndale House Foundation, which now owns 96.5% of Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. and has contribu ted more than $76 m illion to charitable causes using proceeds from Tyndale House Publishers Dr. Taylor structured Tyndale to be prim arily owned by the religious Foundati on, and prim arily directed by Tyndale Trust, whose trustees adhere to a biblical statem ent of faith and are the sam e individuals who serve as the board members of Tyndale House Publishers Dr. Taylor’s son Mark D. Taylor is President and CEO of Tyndale House Publis hers and is a m ember of the board of directors of Tyndale House Publishers and the Foundation, as well as being a trustee of the Tyndale Trust. 3. Tyndale and its owners are Chris tians who are comm itted to biblical princip les, including the belief that all human beings are created in the image and likeness of God from the moment of their concep tion/fertilization. But D efendants’ recently enacted regulatory mandate under PPACA forces Tyndale to pr ovide and pay for drugs and devi ces that it a nd its owners’ believe can cause the death of hum an beings created in the im age and li keness of God shortly after their conception/fertilization. The governm ent’s mandate exempts what it calls “religious employers,” but denies that status to Tyndale House Publishers through its arbitrary definition. 4. The mandate challenged in th is case (collectively referred to h ereinafter as the “Preventive Services Mandate” or the “Mandate”)1 was created and is enforced by D efendants the Departments of HHS, Labor and Treasury and their respective Secretaries. 5. The Mandate illeg ally and unconstitutionally requires Tyndale to violate its and its owners’ religious beliefs, and it subjects Tyndale to heavy fines and penalties if it chooses not to violate those beliefs. Defendants’ coercion tramples on the freedom of conscience, freedom of religious exercise, and freedom of speech of Tyndale and its owners. These believers, as well as millions of other Americans, simply wish to a bide by religious convictions decreed by God Himself through His Word, and to c ontribute to society in a way th at is consiste nt with their religious ethics. 6. Defendants’ refusal to accommodate the conscience of Tyndale is highly selective. PPACA not only conta ins a m ultitude of exemptions from the Mandate, but one of those exclusions renders the Mandate in applicable to 191 million Am ericans. Newland, 2012 WL 3069154 at *1.

Approximately 43 employees (and their dependents) of Plaintiff Encompass are currently covered by this group health insurance plan. 5. John Stewart is a believing and practicing evangelical Christian and believes the Holy Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God and that the Holy Bible instructs that each human life, which begins at conception, is created in God’s image, that God mandates respect for the sanctity of each human life, and that abortion and abortion-inducing drugs result in the wrongful taking of a human life. 6. With significant exceptions, all group health plans and health insurance issuers that offer non-grandfathered group or individual health coverage must provide coverage for certain preventive services without cost-sharing. 42 U.S.C. <unk>300gg-13.

In the category of “FDA-approved contraceptives” included in this HHS Mandate are several drugs or devices that may cause the demise of an already-conceived but not-yet- implanted human embryo, such as “emergency contraception” or “Plan B” drugs (the so-called “morning after” pill) and “ella” (the so-called “week after” pill) which studies show can function to kill embryos even after they have implanted in the uterus by a mechanism similar to the abortion drug RU-486. 8. Plaintiff Stewart and Encompass have always maintained objections on the basis of their religious beliefs to supporting either directly or indirectly the use of any drugs or procedures intended for the purposes of inducing an abortion or otherwise terminating an embryo. Such drugs or procedures are referred to collectively herein as “Abortifacients.” 9. Plaintiffs have become aware that many citizens of the United States who hold the same or similar religious beliefs as do the Plaintiffs have, as a result of such religious beliefs, challenged the application of the HHS Mandate to them and to their for-profit businesses. 10. Before 2013, Plaintiffs’ health insurance plan excluded coverage of any Abortifacients under their employee health policies. 11.

This is a case about religious freedom. Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father of our country, principal author of the Declaration of Independence, and our third president, when describing the construct of our Constitution proclaimed, ""No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority.""

This is a challenge to regulations ostensibly issued under the ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"" (Pub. 111-148, March 23, 2010, 124 Stat. 119) and the ""Health 2 Care and Education Reconciliation Act"" (Pub L. 111-152, March 30, 2010, 124 Stat. 1029) (collectively known and hereinafter referred to as the ""Affordable Care Act"") that force individuals to violate their deepest held religious beliefs. 3. One of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act.mandates that health plans ""provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for... with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings... as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration"" and directs the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services to determine what would constitute ""preventive care"" under the mandate. 42 U.S.C <unk>300gg-13(a)(4). 4. Without notice of rulemaking or opportunity for public comment, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Labor, and the United States Department of Treasury adopted the Institute of Medicine (""10M"") recommendations in full and promulgated an interim final rule (""the Mandate""), which requires that all ""group health plan[s] and... health insurance issuer[s] offering group or individual health insurance coverage"" provide all FDA-approved contraceptive methods and procedures. 76 Fed Reg. 46621 (published Aug. 3,2011); 45 C.F.R. <unk>147.130. 5. The Mandate requires all insurance issuers (e.g. Humana Health Insurance) to provide abortion, sterilization, contraception, and abortifacients in all of its insurance plans, group and individual. 6. Health Resources and Services Administration also issued guidelines adopting the 10M recommendations. (http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines, last visited Sept. 3, 2013). 7. Under the 10M guidelines, the Mandate requires all insurance insurers to provide abortion, because certain drugs and devices such as the ""morning-after pill,"" ""Plan B,"" and ""ella"" 8. The Mandate forces enlployers and individuals to violate their religious beliefs because it requires employers and individuals to pay for insurance from insurance issuers which fund and directly provide for drugs, devices, and services which violate their deeply held religious beliefs. 9. Since under the Mandate all insurance issuers must provide what the United States Department of Health and Human Services has deemed ""preventive care,"" employers and individuals are stripped of any choice between insurance issuers or insurance plans to avoid violating their religious beliefs. 10.

","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF IOWA WESTERN DIVISION DORDT COLLEGE and CORNERSTONE UNIVERSITY, Plaintiffs, vs. KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, in her official capacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services; THOMAS PEREZ, in his official capacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Labor; JACK LEW, in his official capacity as Secretary of the United States Department of the Treasury; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Case No. C13-4100 Defendants. COMPLAINT Plaintiffs Dordt College and Cornerstone University (hereinafter, “the Schools”), by their attorneys, state as follows: NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. This lawsuit challenges regulations issued by Defendants under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that compel employee and student health insurance plans to provide free coverage of contraceptive services, including so-called “emergency contraceptives” that cause early abortions. 2. The Schools are Christ-centered institutions of higher learning. They believe that God has condemned the intentional destruction of innocent human life. The Schools hold, as a matter of religious conviction, that it would be sinful and immoral for them intentionally to participate in, pay for, facilitate, enable, or otherwise support access to abortion, which destroys human life. They hold that one of the prohibitions of the Ten Commandments (“thou shalt not murder”) precludes them from facilitating, assisting in, or enabling the use of drugs that can and do destroy very young human beings in the womb. 3. Defendants have acknowledged that the Mandate challenged in this lawsuit should not be applied to certain religious employers. They exempted “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches” and “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.” Defendants contend that these employers “are more likely than other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under their plan.” The Schools fit this description, yet they do not qualify for the exemption. 4. In addition, the government has elected not to impose the challenged regulations upon thousands of other organizations. Employers with “grandfathered” plans, small employers, and favored others are exempt from these rules. 5. Defendants have offered entities like the Schools a so-called “accommodation” of their religious beliefs and practices. However, the alleged accommodation fails. It still conscripts the Schools into the government’s scheme, forcing the Schools to obtain an insurer or third-party claims administrator and submit a form that specifically causes that insurer or third-party administrator to arrange payment for the objectionable drugs, so that such coverage will apply to the Schools’ own employees as a direct consequence of their employment with the Schools and of their participation in the health insurance benefits the Schools provide them. 6. If Plaintiffs follow their religious convictions and decline to participate in the government’s scheme, they will face, among other injuries, enormous fines that will cripple their operations. 7. By placing the Schools in this untenable position, Defendants violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; the Free Exercise, Establishment and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and the Administrative Procedure Act. 8. Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request that this Court vindicate their rights through declaratory and permanent injunction relief, among other remedies.

CASE NO.: I. I 1 2 C V 1 5 9 <unk>C COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL 1. This lawsuit is about one of America's most cherished freedoms: the freedom to practice one's religion without government interference. It is not about whether people have a right to abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception. Those services are, and will continue to be, freely available in the United States, and nothing prevents the Government itself from making them more widely available. But the right to such services does not authorize the Government to force the Plaintiffs to violate their own consciences by making them provide, pay for, and/or facilitate those services to others, contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs. American history and tradition, embodied in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (""RFRA""), protects religious entities from such overbearing and oppressive governmental action. Plaintiffs therefore seek relief in this Court to protect this most fundamental of American rights. 2. This country was founded by those searching for religious liberty and freedom from religious persecution. And since the founding of this country, religious organizations such as Plaintiffs have been free to fulfill their religious beliefs through service to all, including the underprivileged and underserved, without regard to the beneficiaries' religious views. As a result, Plaintiffs and other such organizations have played a vital role in securing and protecting the civillibemes of all citizens. 3. The U.S. Constitution and federal statutes protect religious organizations from governmental interference with their religious views-'-particularly minority religious views. The founders recognized, through their own experiences, that the mixture of government and religion is destructive to both institutions and divisive to the social fabric upon which the country depends. The Constitution and federal law thus stand as bulwarks against oppressive government actions even if supported by a majority of citizens. This ""wall of separation between church and state"" is critical to the preservation of religious freedom. As the Supreme Court has recognized, ""[t]he structure of our government has, for the preservation of civil liberty, rescued the temporal institutions from religious interference. On the other hand, it has secured religious liberty from the invasion of civil authority."" Through this lawsuit, Plaintiffs do not seek to impose their religious beliefs on others. They simply ask that the Government not impose its values and policies on Plaintiffs, in direct violation of their religious beliefs. 4. Under current federal law described below (the ""U.S. Government Mandate""), many Catholic organizations must provide, or facilitate the provision of, abortifacients, sterilization, and contraceptive services to their employees in violation of the centuries' old teachings of the Catholic Church. Ignoring broader religious exemptions from other federal laws, the Government has crafted a narrow, discretionary exemption to this U.S. Government Mandate for ""religious employers."" Group health plans are eligible for the exemption only if they are ""established or maintained by religious employers,"" and only if the ""religious employer"" can convince the Government that it satisfies four criteria: • ""The inculcation of religious values is the purpose ofthe organization""; • ""The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the organization""; • ""The organization primarily serves persons who share the religious tenets of the organization""; and • ""The organization is a nonprofit organization as described in section 6033(a)(I) and section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended."" Thus, in order to safeguard their religious freedoms, religious employers must plead with government bureaucrats for a determination that they are sufficiently ""religious."" 5. It is unclear whether Plaintiffs' health benefits plans qualify for this religious exemption. 6. With respect to the fourth requirement, it is unclear whether Plaintiffs Franciscan Alliance and the University of Saint Francis's health benefits plans qualify for this religious exemption because, for example, while they are nonprofit charitable organizations that are firmly grounded in the tenets of Catholicism, they appear not to fall","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] April 2013 | U.S. District Court | Fort Wayne | Northern District of Indiana | Catholic Charities | Franciscan Alliance | University of Saint Francis ||| Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)<n>On April 2013, Catholic Charities, Franciscan Alliance, and the University of St. Francis filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern district of Indiana against the Departments of Health and Human Services and Treasury.

The plaintiff claimed that the department's provision of more than a million dollars of public funds to a ministry called ""The Silver Ring Thing"" (SRT) that uses federal abstinence education funding to bring ""unchurched"" students to Jesus Christ constituted an unlawful establishment of religion and a governmental endorsement and preference for religion in general and specific tenets of the ministry in particular. 

The ministry developed a three hour presentation that was meant to occur directly following a mandatory abstinence education assembly in public schools and which, according to the plaintiff, was ""permeated with religion."" 

In a two-year settlement agreement entered on February 22, 2006, the defendants acknowleged that they had terminated the SRT grant effective January 31, 2006.  The agreement provided that defendants would not fund SRT's abstinence eduction as it had been structured and implemented during the fiscal year 2005, that strict requirements would be made before considering funding any future proposals from SRT, and that extensive monitoring of SRT's activities would occur if SRT was given a grant.

The Silver Ring Thing is a ministry that uses abstinence education as a means to bring ""unchurched"" students to Jesus Christ.

He used his cell phone to record the arrest. The police officers admit in their report that they arrested Mr. Glik only after he told them his cell phone recorded sound as well as video. Massachusetts law does not prohibit openly recording sound. Documenting police conduct in public is expressive activity protected by the First Amendment. Criminal charges were pending against Mr. Glik for four months until the Commonwealth voluntarily dismissed one charge ffild a judge dismissed the other two charges because they werc not supported by probable cause. 2. The City of Boston is sued for failing to properly train Boston police officers that they cmmot arrest people for openly making video or audio recordings of their conduct in pUblic.

While he was walking, he saw three Boston police officers he now knows to be the Defendants John Cunniffe, Peter J. Savalis, and Hall-Brewster arresting a young man near a park bench. 11 Mr. Glik heard another young man standing nearby say something like, ""You are hurting him, stop."" 12 Mr. Glik was concerned that the police officers were using excessive force to make the arrest. 13 Mr. Glile stopped near the bench and took out his cell phone so that he could document the conduct of the police officers. 14 Mr. Glik recorded the incident from approximately ten feet away. He believes he recorded three short segments. 15 Mr. Glik did not speak to the police officers nor did they speak to him until the suspect was in handcutIs. 16 Mr. Glik did not interfere with the officers' actions during the arrest.

Civil Action No. Complaint Jury liial Demanded .' c Plaintiff Christopher Sharp, for his complaint against the defendants named above, avers on knowledge, information, and belief: NATURE OF THE CASE 1. This is a civil rights action challenging as unconstitutional the Baltimore City Police Department's warrantless arrest and detention ofplaintiffChristopher Sharp, as well as the seizure and destruction of Mr. Sharp's property, premised upon Mr. Sharp's exercise ofhis rights under the federal and Maryland constitutions to document the conduct of City police officers performing their public duties in a public place. 2. In May 2010, while attending the 135th running of the Preakness, plaintiff used his cell-phone camera to video and audio record the arrest and beating of an acquaintance at Pimlico Race Course. Officers of the Baltimore Police Department stopped him, seized his cell phone, and detained him while one officer left the area with the phone. After the officers returned the phone, Mr. Sharp discovered that the officers had deleted video ofthe arrest and all other videos that had been stored on the device, including numerous videos ofhis young son and other personal events. 3. Citizens have the right, protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 40 ofthe Maryland Declaration of Rights, to document the public performance of government officials, including police officers, through photography as well as audio and video recording. Neither federal nor Maryland law prohibits this activity, yet lawenforcement officers in the State of Maryland-specifically including Baltimore City police officers -routinely threaten to arrest or punish civilians who document police activity, using the Maryland Wrretap Act and related, inapplicable infractions to back up these threats. 4. This case involves just soch a misapplication of the Maryland Wrretap Act by Baltimore City police officers: they unlawfully detained a young man who had used his cell phone to record a public interaction between police and one ofhis friends; demanded that he surrender his cell phone; and deleted all videos from that cell phone, regardless of their content. 5. By destroying these videos -even ifpurporting to act under the Maryland Wrretap Act the officers violated Mr. Sharp's rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and several common-law rights. This civilrights action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief as well as monetary damages to remedy these violations. PARTIES 6. Plaintiff Christopher Sharp is a 37-year-old resident of Baltimore County and the State of Maryland. He is a person within the meaning ofthe constitutions of the United States and the State of Maryland. As explained below, Mr. Sharp has been injured and risks further harm as a result ofthe defendants' illegal acts and omissions. 7. Defendant Baltimore City Police Department is a government agency.

LOUIS and CATHOLIC CHARITIES OF ST. LOUIS, Plaintiffs, v. KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; HILDA SOLIS, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor; TIMOTHY GEITHNER, in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR; and U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY, Defendants. JURY TRIAL DEMANDED COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND 1. This lawsuit is about one of America’s most cherished freedoms: the freedom to practice one’s religion without government interference. It is not about whether people have a right to abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception. Those services are freely available in the United States, and nothing prevents the Government itself from making them more widely available. Here, however, the Government seeks to require Plaintiffs—all Catholic entities—to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs by providing, paying for, and/or facilitating access to those services. American history and tradition, embodied in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), safeguard religious entities from such overbearing and oppressive governmental action. Plaintiffs therefore seek relief in this Court to protect this most fundamental of American rights. 2. Plaintiffs are Catholic religious entities that provide a wide range of spiritual, educational, and social services to residents in the greater St. Louis community, Catholic and non-Catholic alike. For example, Plaintiff Archdiocese of St. Louis is a Missouri nonprofit corporation and is the civil law corporation for the community of Roman Catholics under the pastoral care of Archbishop Robert J Carlson. The Archdiocese not only provides pastoral care and spiritual guidance for over 520,000 Catholics, but also serves individuals throughout the St. Louis area through its schools and multiple charitable programs. The Archdiocese’s programs serve those who are most often overlooked in the community, including those with disabilities, those challenged by an unexpected prenatal diagnosis, those re-entering society after imprisonment, and those poor and marginalized with nowhere else to turn. The mission of the Archdiocese is carried out both by the Archdiocese on its own and through the work of its affiliated corporations (collectively with the Archdiocese, “Archdiocesan Entities”), including Plaintiff Catholic Charities of St. Louis (“Catholic Charities”). Catholic Charities, the largest non-governmental social service provider in the region, offers a host of social services to thousands in need throughout the greater St. Louis area. For those citizens in the community who could not otherwise afford them, Catholic Charities provides free physical and mental health care, legal assistance, immigration assistance, employment training, early childhood services, education, counseling, emergency shelter, housing, and dental services. 3. Plaintiffs’ work is in every respect guided by and consistent with Roman Catholic belief, including the requirement that they serve those in need, regardless of their religion. This is perhaps best captured by words attributed to St. Francis of Assisi: “Preach the Gospel at all times. Use words if necessary.” As Pope Benedict has more recently put it, “Love for widows and orphans, prisoners, and the sick and needy of every kind, is as essential to [the Catholic Church] as the ministry of the sacraments and preaching of the Gospel. The Church cannot neglect the service of charity any more than she can neglect the Sacraments and the Word.” Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est 22 (2006). Or as Cardinal James Hickey, former Archbishop of Washington, once commented on the role of Catholic educators: “We do not educate our students because they are Catholic; we educate them because we are Catholic.” Thus, Catholic individuals and organizations consistently work to create a more just community by serving any and all neighbors in need. 4. Catholic Church teachings also uphold the firm conviction that sexual union should be reserved to married couples who are so committed to one another that they are open to the creation of life; thus, artificial interference with the creation of life, including through abortion, sterilization, and contraceptives, is contrary to Catholic doctrine. 5. Defendants have promulgated various rules (collectively, “the U.S. Government Mandate”) that force Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. Under the U.S. Government Mandate, many Catholic and other religious organizations are required to provide health plans to their employees that include and/or facilitate coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs. Ignoring broader religious exemptions from other federal laws, the Government has crafted a narrow exemption to this Mandate for certain “religious employers” who can convince the Government that they satisfy four criteria: <unk>“The inculcation of religious values is the purpose of the organization”; <unk>“The organization primarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of the organization”; <unk>“The","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri | Catholic Charities | Archdiocese of St. Louis | Department of Health and Human Services ||| Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)<n>Plaintiffs are Catholic religious entities that provide a wide range of spiritual, educational, and social services to residents in the greater St.Louis community, Catholic and non-Catholic alike.

Sharpe, Judi Diane Schaefer and Rita Joanne Wilson, for their Complaint, state: NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. This case challenges regulations issued under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“Act”) that force the Plaintiffs to either (a) violate their sincerelyheld religious opposition to abortion on demand or (b) pay heavy fines and penalties (Sharpe Holdings, Inc. and Charles N. Sharpe) or lose health insurance coverage (Judi Diane Schaefer and Rita Joanne Wilson). 2. Sharpe Holdings, Inc. (“Sharpe Holdings”) is a Missouri for-profit general business corporation that employs more than 50 men and women in a variety of industries, including, but not limited to, farming, dairy, creamery, and cheese-making. Sharpe Holdings offers health insurance to its employees through its own self-insured program. 3. Charles N. Sharpe is the founder, owner, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Sharpe Holdings Mr. Sharpe is responsible for setting all policies governing the conduct of all phases of the business of Sharpe Holdings, and he strives to operate Sharpe Holdings’ business according to Christian principles and coinciding sincerely held religious beliefs. 4. Judi Diane Schaefer and Rita Joanne Wilson are Sharpe Holdings employees. Health insurance coverage is a benefit of Schaefer’s and Wilson’s employment at Sharpe Holdings. Schaefer and Wilson pay a portion of the premiums required in order to maintain their coverage. Said premiums partially fund medical services provided to other employees covered under the same plan. Schaefer and Wilson oppose the use, funding, provision or support of abortion on demand as a matter of sincerely held religious belief and practice. 5. The Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs forbid them from funding, participating in, paying for, sharing the costs of, training others to engage in, or otherwise supporting or providing a means of abortion on demand. 6. The Plaintiffs do not believe that abortion on demand constitutes medicine, health care, or a means of providing for the well-being of persons. Rather, Plaintiffs believe abortion on demand involves gravely immoral practices and the intentional destruction of innocent human life. 7. The Defendants have issued an administrative rule (“Mandate” or “Final Rule”) pursuant to authority created by the Act requiring that group health plans cover, without cost sharing, “all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity” in plan years beginning as early as August 1, 2012. Such contraceptive methods include certain drugs and devices such as the “Plan B” and “ella” pills and copper IUDs, all of which are widely known as abortifacients in that they frequently function to destroy fertilized eggs, which Plaintiffs consider to be abortion on demand. This not only forces the Plaintiffs to treat abortion on demand and related education and counseling as health care, but also subverts the expression of the Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs (which they share with millions of other Americans), by forcing them to fund, promote, and assist and participate in the provision of the acquisition of drugs and services which they believe involve gravely immoral practices, including the intentional destruction of innocent human life. 8. The Mandate unconstitutionally forces the Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs—under threat of heavy fines and penalties for Sharpe Holdings and Charles N. Sharpe, and under threat of lost health coverage or employment at Sharpe Holdings for Judi Diane Schaefer and Rita Joanne Wilson. The Mandate also forces the Plaintiffs to fund government-dictated speech that is directly at odds with their own speech and religious teachings. Having to pay a fine to government authorities for the privilege of practicing one’s religion or controlling one’s own speech is un-American, unprecedented, and flagrantly unconstitutional. Forcing an employee to fund government-dictated speech that is directly at odds with her own speech and religious teachings, in order to maintain insurance as a job benefit, is similarly wrong. 9. The Defendants’ refusal to accommodate conscience is selective. A patchwork of exemptions shows that Defendants do not believe every insurance plan in the country needs to cover these services. For instance, Defendants have issued thousands of waivers from the Act (in its entirety","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] April 2015 | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of Missouri | Sharpe Holdings, Inc. | United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ||| April 2016 ||| May 2017 ||| June 2018 ||| July 2018 | ||| August 2018 | August 2019 ||| September 2018 | July 2019 | July 2020 | August 2020 | July 2021 | August 2021 | September 2020 | May 2021 | June 2020 | June 2021 | July 2022 | August 2022 | September 2022 | June 2022 | July 2023 | July 2024 | September 2019 | August 2023 | September 2021 | March 2020 | March 2021 | April 2020 | April 2021 | May 2022 | March 2022 | May 2020</s>"

COMPLAINT 1. This lawsuit is an attempt to vindicate one of America's most fundamental freedoms: the freedom to practice one's religion without governmental interference. The United States Government (the ""Government"") is now attempting to force Plaintiffs all Catholic entities to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs. Plaintiffs acknowledge that individuals in this country have a legal right to these medical services; they are, and will continue to be, freely available in the United States, and nothing prevents the Government itself from making them more widely available. But the right to such services does not authorize the Government to co-opt religious entities into providing or facilitating access to them. Indeed, American history and tradition, embodied in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000bb et seq. (""RFRA""), prohibit just this sort of overbearing and oppressive governmental action. Plaintiffs therefore seek relief in this Court to protect this most cherished of American rights. 2. Plaintiffs are Catholic religious entities, which provide a wide range of spiritual, educational, social and medical services to residents, both Catholic and non-Catholic alike, throughout the State of Mississippi. 3. The Catholic Diocese of Biloxi, Inc. (the ""Diocese of Biloxi"") is the legal name ofa religious community inclusive of those Roman Catholic parishes and organizations located in the 17 southeastern counties of Mississippi under the pastoral care of the Most Reverend Roger P. Morin (""Bishop Morin""), and his successors in office. The Diocese of Biloxi carries out its mission directly, through the work of affiliated Catholic entities such as Plaintiffs Catholic Social and Community Services, Inc. (""Catholic Social Services"") and de l'Epee Deaf Center, Inc. (""de l'Epee""), and also through the education of students in Catholic schools, including Plaintiffs Resurrection Catholic School (""Resurrection Catholic"") and Sacred Heart Catholic School (""Sacred Heart"") (collectively, the ""Biloxi Diocese Plaintiffs""). 4. Plaintiff the Catholic Diocese of Jackson, a Mississippi nonprofit corporation (the ""Diocese of Jackson""), is a religious community inclusive ofthose Roman Catholic parishes and organizations located in the remaining 65 counties of Mississippi under the pastoral care of the Most Reverend Joseph N. Latino (""Bishop Latino""), Bishop ofthe Roman Catholic Diocese of Jackson and his successors in office. The Diocese of Jackson carries out its mission directly through the work of affiliated corporations such as Plaintiff Catholic Charities, Inc. (""Catholic Charities""), and also through the education of students in Catholic schools, including Plaintiffs St. Joseph Catholic School (""St. Joseph"") and Vicksburg Catholic School, Inc. (""Vicksburg Catholic"") (collectively, the ""Jackson Diocese Plaintiffs""). 5. The Catholic Church Extension Society recognizes the Dioceses of Biloxi and Jackson as ""Mission Dioceses,"" because the population of Catholics within Mississippi is too small and scattered to support all of the services and works required of and provided by the two Dioceses. The Dioceses of Biloxi and Jackson therefore receive financial support and assistance from Roman Catholics residing in other Catholic dioceses. 6 PlaintiffSt. Dominic-Jackson Memorial Hospital (""St. Dominic""), while not affiliated with","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Catholic Diocese of Biloxi, Inc. v.

This is a challenge to regulations issued under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that would force religiously-motivated business owners like Plaintiffs to violate their faith under threat of millions of dollars in fines. 2. Plaintiffs David Green, Barbara Green, Steve Green, Mart Green, and Darsee Lett (""the Green family"") are committed evangelical Christians. Through various trusts, they own and operate plaintiff Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (""Hobby Lobby""), a privately held retail business headquartered in Oklahoma City. Hobby Lobby currently operates over 500 stores in over 40 states and has over 13,000 full-time employees. 3. Through various trusts, the Green family also owns and operates plaintiff Mardel, Inc. (""Mardel""), a privately held bookstore and education company headquartered in Hobby Lobby's Oklahoma City complex that sells a variety of Christian-themed materials. Mardel currently operates 35 stores in 7 states and has 372 full-time employees. 4. Unless context indicates otherwise, ""Plaintiffs"" refers collectively to the Green family, Hobby Lobby, and Mardel. 5. The Green family believes they are obligated to run their businesses in accordance with their faith. Commitment to Jesus Christ and to Biblical principles is what gives their business endeavors meaning and purpose. 6. The Green family's business practices therefore reflect their Christian faith in unmistakable and concrete ways. For example, they employ full-time chaplains to meet their employees' spiritual and emotional needs. They pay all of their employees well above the minimum wage and provide them with excellent benefits. They monitor their merchandise, marketing, and operations to make sure all are consistent with their beliefs. They give millions of dollars from their profits to fund missionaries and ministries around the world. And, as is well known, they close all their stores on Sundays, even though they lose millions in annual sales by doing so. 7. The Green family's religious beliefs forbid them from patticipating in, providing access to, paying for, training others to engage in, or otherwise suppOliing abOltion-causing drugs and devices. 8. The administrative rule at issue in this case (""the Mandate"") runs roughshod over the Green family's religious beliefs, and the beliefs of millions of other Americans, by forcing them to provide health insurance coverage for abortion-inducing drugs and devices, as well as related education and counseling. 9. The Mandate illegally and unconstitutionally coerces the Green family to violate their deeply-held religious beliefs under threat of heavy fines, penalties, and lawsuits. The Mandate also forces the Green family to facilitate government-dictated speech incompatible with their own speech and religious beliefs. Having to pay fines for the privilege of practicing one's religion or controlling one's own speech is alien to our American traditions of individual liberty, religious tolerance, and limited government. It is also illegal and unconstitutional. 10. The Mandate does not apply to everyone equally.

COMPLAINT Plaintiffs Southern Nazarene University, Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Oklahoma Baptist University, and Mid-America Christian University (hereinafter, “the Universities”), by their attorneys, state as follows: NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. This lawsuit challenges regulations issued by Defendants under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that compel employee and student health insurance plans to provide free coverage of contraceptive services, including so-called “emergency contraceptives” that cause early abortions. 2. The Universities are Christ-centered institutions of higher learning. They believe that God has condemned the intentional destruction of innocent human life. The Universities hold, as a matter of religious conviction, that it would be sinful and immoral for them intentionally to participate in, pay for, facilitate, enable, or otherwise support access to abortion, which destroys human life. They hold that one of the prohibitions of the Ten Commandments (“thou shalt not murder”) precludes them from facilitating, assisting in, or enabling the use of drugs that can and do destroy very young human beings in the womb. 3. The Universities do not qualify for the extraordinarily narrow religious exemption from the regulations. That exemption protects only “churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations or churches” and “the exclusively religious activities of any religious order.” 4. For purely secular reasons, the government has elected not to impose the challenged regulations upon thousands of other organizations. Employers with “grandfathered” plans, small employers, and favored others are exempt from these rules. 5. Defendants have offered entities like the Universities a so-called “accommodation” of their religious beliefs and practices. However, the alleged accommodation fails. It still conscripts the Universities into the government’s scheme, forcing them to obtain an insurer or third-party claims administrator and submit a form that specifically causes that insurer or third-party administrator to arrange payment for the objectionable drugs, so that such coverage will apply to the Universities’ own employees as a direct consequence of their employment with the Universities and of their participation in the health insurance benefits the Universities provide them. 6. Under the supposed accommodation, Defendants continue to treat entities like the Universities as second-class religious organizations, not entitled to the same religious freedom rights as substantially similar entities that qualify for the exemption. Defendants’ rationale for entirely exempting churches and integrated auxiliaries from the regulations – their employees are likely to share their religious convictions – applies equally to the Universities. Yet, Defendants refuse to exempt them, offering only a flimsy, superficial, and utterly semantic “accommodation” that falls woefully short of addressing and resolving the substance of their concerns. 7. If Plaintiffs follow their religious convictions and decline to participate in the government’s scheme, they will face, among other injuries, enormous fines that will cripple their operations. 8. By unconscionably placing the Universities in this untenable position, Defendants have violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; the Free Exercise, Establishment and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and the Administrative Procedure Act. 9. Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request that this Court vindicate their rights through declaratory and permanent injunction relief, among other remedies.

After the Trump Administration took office, the parties settled and dismissed the case.","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA MOST REVEREND DAVID A. ZUBIK, BISHOP OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC DIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH, as Trustee of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, a Charitable Trust; THE ROMAN CATHOLIC DIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH, as the Beneficial Owner of the Pittsburgh series of The Catholic Benefits Trust; and CATHOLIC CHARITIES OF THE DIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH, INC., an affiliate nonprofit corporation of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, Plaintiffs, v. JURY TRIAL DEMAND KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, in her official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; THOMAS PEREZ, in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor; JACOB J. LEW, in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR; and U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY Defendants. COMPLAINT 1. This case is a continuation of Plaintiffs’ prolonged fight for their religious freedom. Federal law (the “U.S. Government Mandate”) has required religious organizations such as Plaintiffs to provide services that violate their long-standing teachings on abortion and the sanctity of human life by subsidizing, providing, and/or facilitating coverage for abortion- inducing drugs, sterilization services, contraceptives, and related counseling services (also referred to herein as the “objectionable services”). 2. In 2011, Defendants first issued regulations which violated Plaintiffs’ long and sincerely-held religious beliefs in an unprecedented manner. Since issuing those regulations, the Government has consistently promised that changes were coming and that these changes would accommodate Plaintiffs’ sincerely-held religious beliefs. 3. Two years later, it is clear that these promises were empty words. The Government ignored the views of religious organizations like Plaintiffs by promulgating a final rule that is more damaging than the initial regulations. 4. Despite repeated promises to protect Plaintiffs’ religious freedom, the Government has chosen not to do so. After the Government issued its proposed rule, Plaintiff the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh (the “Diocese”) submitted extensive public comments outlining how “the proposed rule continue[d] the surprising recent detour into requiring religious objectors to fund or facilitate coverage for abortifacients, contraception, sterilization, and related education and counseling.” 5. The Diocese’s comments were bolstered by a report from a renowned healthcare economist, whose report explained that “the accommodation will not operate as the Government claims it will” and that the scheme proposed by the Government would result in religious organizations funding and/or facilitating coverage of the objectionable services. In its comments, the Diocese “offer[ed] two proposals that could alleviate some or all of the issues raised in [its] comment[.]” These proposals were ignored. 6. Despite the Diocese’s comments, over 400,000 other public comments, repeated requests from Church leaders, and repeated promises from the Government that it would fix the problem, the Government has not changed the core principle of the U.S. Government Mandate. On June 28, 2013, the Government issued its Final Rule, which still requires Plaintiffs to subsidize and/or facilitate the provision of abortion-inducing drugs, contraception, sterilization, and related education and counseling, in violation of their religious beliefs. 7. The Government, through the U.S. Government Mandate, is forcing Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely-held religious beliefs. Plaintiff Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Inc. (“Catholic Charities”) is forced to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate or face significant fines and penalties. Plaintiffs Most Reverend David A. Zubik (the “Bishop”) and the Diocese are forced to facilitate coverage of the objectionable services because the insurance trust which the Diocese operates currently offers coverage to Diocesanaffiliated entities subject to the U.S. Government Mandate. 8. Not only is the Government continuing to attack Plaintiffs’ religious liberties, but it waited right up until the expiration of the safe harbor to announce its Final Rule. Although the Government extended the safe harbor until December 31, 2013, the Government still is forcing parties such as Plaintiffs, on a highly compressed schedule, to choose between violating their faith, paying massive fines, or discontinuing their health plans for their employees. 9. The Government’s violation of religious freedom is irreconcilable with the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and other laws. The Government has not demonstrated any compelling interest in forcing Plaintiffs to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception. Nor has the Government demonstrated that the U.S. Government Mandate is the least restrictive means of advancing any interest it has in increasing access to these services, which are already widely available and which the Government could make more widely available without conscripting Plaintiffs as vehicles for the dissemination of products and services to which they so strongly object",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2015 | Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh | U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | Department of Labor | Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare | Pennsylvania District Court | Western District of Pennsylvania ||| Catholic Charities | Catholic Benefits Trust ||| December 2013 ||| June 2014 ||| March 2015 ||| October 2015 | ||| November 2015 |</s>

MARY VILLA, INC.; DOMINICAN SISTERS OF ST. CECILIA CONGREGATION; and AQUINAS COLLEGE, Plaintiffs, v.

LEW, in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR; and U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY, Defendants. CASE NO.: COMPLAINT 1. This lawsuit is about one of America's most cherished freedoms: the freedom to practice one's religion without government interference. It is not about whether people have a right to abortion-inducing products, sterilization, and contraception. Those products and services are widely available in the United States, and nothing prevents the Government itself from making them more widely available. Here, however, the Government seeks to require Plaintiffs-all of which are Catholic entities-to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs by providing, paying for, and/or facilitating access to those products and services. American history and tradition, embodied in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (""RFRA""), safeguard religious entities from such overbearing and oppressive governmental action. Plaintiffs therefore seek relief in this Court to protect this most fundamental of American rights. 2. Plaintiffs provide a wide range of spiritual, educational, and social services to members of their communities, Catholic and non-Catholic alike. For example, Plaintiff The Catholic Diocese of Nashville (the ""Diocese"") not only provides pastoral care and spiritual guidance for approximately 79,000 Catholics, but also serves individuals throughout Middle Tennessee through its schools and various charitable programs. The Diocese's programs serve those who are most often overlooked and marginalized in the community, including individuals who are poor, elderly, disabled, and others in need. Plaintiff Catholic Charities of Tennessee (""Catholic Charities"") offers a host of social services to thousands in need. Its services feed the hungry, place children in adoptive families, improve the welfare of children from high-risk backgrounds, and provide assistance to refugees and new immigrants. Plaintiff Camp Marymount, Inc. (""Camp Marymount"") provides a spiritual summer camp experience for schoolage children from the Nashville Diocese and around the world. Plaintiff Mary, Queen of Angels, Inc. (""MQA"") provides housing to low-income, elderly individuals and seniors needing care, including those suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. Plaintiff St. Mary Villa, Inc. (""St. Mary Villa"") provides affordable daycare options to a diverse range of families with parents who are either working or in school. Plaintiff Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia Congregation (""Dominican Sisters"" or ""St. Cecilia Congregation"") is a congregation of religious sisters who own and operate multiple Catholic schools on The Dominican Campus in Nashville as well as Saint Rose of Lima Academy in Birmingham, Alabama. For its part, Plaintiff Aquinas College (""Aquinas College"" or the ""College"") educates over 600 students annually, charging tuition well below the average private college in Middle Tennessee. And the College's School of Nursing is uniquely positioned to respond to the critical shOliage of licensed nurses and nursing educators in Tennessee and the United States. 3. Plaintiffs' work is in every respect guided by and consistent with Roman Catholic belief, including the requirement that they serve those in need, regardless of their religion. This is perhaps best captured by words attributed to St. Francis of Assisi: ""Preach the Gospel at all times. Use words if necessary."" As Pope Benedict XVI expressed it, ""[LJove for widows and orphans, prisoners, and the sick and needy of every kind, is as essential to [the Catholic Church] as the ministry of the sacraments and preaching of the Gospel. The Church cannot neglect the service of charity any more than she can neglect the Sacraments and the Word."" Or as Cardinal James Hickey, former Archbishop of Washington, once commented on the role of Catholic educators: ""We do not educate our students because they are Catholic; we educate them because we are Catholic."" Thus, Catholic individuals and organizations consistently work to create a more just community by serving any and all neighbors in need. 4. Catholic Church teachings also uphold the firm conviction that sexual union should be reserved to married couples who are open to the creation of life; thus, artificial interference with the creation of life, including through abortion, sterilization, and contraceptives, is contrary to Catholic doctrine. 5.

In this action, Plaintiff seeks judicial review of the Defendants’ violations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000bb et seq. (“RFRA”), the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. <unk>701, et seq.

Plaintiff Criswell College is a Christ-centered institution of higher learning. As such, it believes that God, in His Word, has condemned the intentional destruction of innocent human life. Criswell believes that, as a matter of religious conviction, it would be sinful and immoral for it to intentionally participate in, pay for, facilitate, or otherwise support abortion, which destroys human life. It believes that the Sixth Commandment (“thou shalt not murder”) proscribes payment for and facilitation of the use of drugs and devices that can and do destroy very young human beings in the womb. 3. With full knowledge that many religious organizations hold the same or similar beliefs, Defendants issued regulations that, by forcing these organizations to pay for and otherwise facilitate the use of abortifacient drugs and related education and counseling, trample on the freedom of Criswell College and millions of other American organizations and individuals to abide by their religious convictions and to comply with moral imperatives they believe are decreed by God Himself. 4. The regulation—the HHS Preventive Services Mandate1 (the “Mandate”)—illegally 1 The Mandate consists of a conglomerate of authorities, including: “Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Relating to Coverage of Preventive Services Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” 77 Fed Reg. 8725-30 (Feb. 15, 2012); the prior interim final rule found at 76 Fed Reg. 46621-26 (Aug. 3, 2011), by which the Defendants adopted the exemption for certain religious employers from the requirement to provide certain preventative services for women endorsed in Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) guidelines—which the February 15 rule adopted “without change”; the guidelines by Defendant HHS’s HRSA, http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/, mandating that health plans include nocost-sharing coverage of “All Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, and unconstitutionally coerces Criswell College to violate the Sixth Commandment under threat of heavy fines and penalties. The Mandate also forces Criswell College to fund governmentdictated speech that is directly at odds with the religious message it wishes to convey to its students and to the broader culture. 5. Defendants’ refusal to accommodate conscience in this matter is highly selective. Upon information and belief, the government has provided thousands of exemptions from the ACA for various groups including large corporations. The Mandate does not apply to those employing less than 50 full-time employees. Moreover, the Mandate does not apply to countless “grandfathered” employer group health plans, through which millions of American women receive health insurance coverage, belying any contention that the Mandate advances any compelling government interest. Yet, the government refuses to exempt many religious groups (and religiously observant individuals) from this unprecedented Mandate. 6. Defendants’ actions violate Criswell’s right to freely exercise its religion, which is protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. 7. Defendants’ actions also violate Criswell’s right to the freedom of speech and right to the freedom of association, as secured by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as due process rights secured by the Fifth Amendment to the United States sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity” as part","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2013 | The Religious Freedom Restoration Act | U.S. District Court | Northern District of Texas | Health Resources and Services Administration | Department of Labor | Health and Human Services ||| Affordable Care Act .<n>On September 2013, The Criswell College filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the North Texas District Court against the Departments of Labor and HHS, alleging violations of the religious freedom and free speech rights of the college.

The U.S. claimed that the Bank had engaged in a pattern or practice of home-mortgage lending discrimination against black applicants. On November 18, 2009 an agreement was entered that required the Bank to change several of its practices and to pay monetary damages to some African-American borrowers. The terms of the agreement were satisfied and the case dismissed in April 2016. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, CIVIL ACTION NO. v. FIRST UNITED SECURITY BANK, Defendant. COMPLAINT The United States of America alleges: I. This action is brought by the United States to enforce the provisions of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601-3619, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.s.C. <unk>1691-1691f. 2. This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1345,42 U.S.c. <unk>3614, and 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691(h). Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391. 3. Defendant First United Security Bank (Bank) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Security Bancshares, Inc., a Delaware bank holding company. The Bank's principal office is in Thomasville, Alabama, and it does business primarily in the State of Alabama. 4. First United Security Bank was created in 1952 with five branches located in Clarke and Bibb counties in Alabama. The Bank currently operates nineteen banking offices in Clarke, Choctaw, Bibb, Shelby and Tuscaloosa counties in Alabama. 5. The Bank offers the traditional services of a financial depository and lending institution, including the receipt of monetary deposits and the financing of residential housing and commercial loans. As of December 31, 2007, the Bank had assets totaling just over $658 million. The Bank is subject to the regulatory authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 6. The Bank is subject to the federal laws governing fair lending, including the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and their respective implementing regulations, the fair housing regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 24 C.F.R. <unk>100.1, et seq., and Regulation B of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R. <unk>202.1, et seq. The Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportnnity Act prohibit financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of, inter alia, race and color in their home-mortgage lending practices. 7. In December 2005 the FDIC conducted a compliance examination of the Bank. Based on information gathered in its examination, the FDIC determined that it had reason to believe that in 2004 the Bank engaged in a pattern or practice of home-mortgage lending discrimination against black applicants, on the basis of race, in the pricing of conventional, first-lien refinance loans on owner-occupied, one-to-four family properties, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and their implementing regulations. 8. Pursuant to IS U.S.C. <unk>169Ie(g), the FDIC referred the matter to the Attorney General on October 23,2006, for appropriate enforcement action, following its determination as described in Paragraph 7. 9. Between at least January 2004 and December 2004, First United Security Bank loan officers did not use formal, written, uniform underwriting guidelines and procedures to set final interest rates for conventional, first-lien refinance loans on owner-occupied, one-to-four family properties. Loan officers were provided with standard rate sheets, but the Bank granted them broad discretion to engage in subjective decision-making and increase or decrease the rate up to one percentage point. 10. During the relevant time period referenced in Paragraph 9, First United Security Bank charged African-American borrowers higher rates of interest for conventional, first-lien refinance loans on owner-occupied, one-to-four family properties than it charged to similarlysituated white borrowers. The differences in the interest rates charged to African-American borrowers obtaining such refinance loans from the Bank and those charged to white borrowers cannot be explained fully by factors unrelated to race, such as differences in certain borrower and loan characteristics. The estimated interest rate differences, approximately 62 basis points (5/8 of a percentage point) between similarly situated African-American and white borrowers, are statistically significant. II. As of December 31, 2007, First United Security Bank's Alabama market area included all of Clark, Choctaw, Bibb, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa counties and portions of Marengo, Sumter, Washington, Wilcox, Chilton, Hale, Monroe, Perry, and Jefferson counties, according to United Security Bancshares SEC Form 10K report. That report does not specify which portions of the latter nine counties are included in the Bank's market area; therefore, in this Complaint, references to the ""Alabama Market Area"" include all of Clark, Choctaw, Bibb, Shelby, Tuscaloosa, Marengo, Sumter, Washington, Wilcox, Chilton, Hale, Monroe, Perry, and Jefferson counties. 12. According to the 2000 Census, the Alabama Market Area consisted of 285 census tracts, of which 99 were majority black in population. The Alabama Market Area also included five counties that were majority black in population: Hale, Marengo, Perry, Sumter and Wilcox. The total population of the Bank","<pad>The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Alabama filed this lawsuit against First United Security Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Security Bancshares, Inc., against the bank for violating the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The complaint alleged that the bank charged African-American borrowers higher rates of interest for conventional, first-lien refinance loans on owner-occupied, one-to-four family properties than it charged to similarly situated white borrowers. According to the complaint, between at least January 2004 and December 2004, the bank did not use formal, written, uniform underwriting guidelines and procedures to set final interest rates for the refinance loans. The bank agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay a total of $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.</s>"

Thompson ||| May 2012 | Alabama ||| May 2014 [SUMMARY] In November 2011, two undocumented Mexican immigrants and three fair housing groups filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama against the State of Alabama. The plaintiffs alleged that a state statute violated the Fair Housing Act and was preempted by federal immigration law because it required mobile home owners to pay for a government-issued registration while prohibiting undocumented residents from making payments to government officials. Because the law made it illegal to possess a mobile home without registration and because it was illegal for undocumented residents to obtain the registration, the law effectively made such persons homeless.  The District Court (Judge Myron H. Thompson) enjoined the State from enforcing the law. The State appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit rendered it moot because in May 2012 the Alabama legislature amended the statute to exclude mobile home registration.  The District Court dismissed the case in May 2014, upon stipulation of the parties.","C' IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA NORTHERN DIVISION ic A CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR HOUSING CENTER; FAIR HOUSING CENTER OF NORTHERN ALABAMA; CENTER FOR FAIR HOUSING, INC.; and JOHN DOE #1 and JOHN DOE #2, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Civil Action File No. a.

NATURE OF THE ACTION This is a civil rights action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought by Plaintiffs Central Alabama Fair Housing Center, Fair Housing Center of Northern Alabama, Center for Fair Housing, Inc., John Doe #1, and John Doe #2 for violations of the federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601 et seq., and the Supremacy Clause and Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. 2. Plaintiff John Doe #1 is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. He owns and resides in a manufactured home in Elmore County, Alabama, along with his partner, five-year- old U.S.-citizen son, and sixteen-year-old nephew. Plaintiff John Doe #2 is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. Like Plaintiff Doe #1, Plaintiff Doe #2 owns and resides in a manufactured home in Elmore County, along with his partner, his five-year-old U.S.-citizen son, and his partner's parents and three brothers. 4. This action is brought against Defendant Julie Magee in her official capacity as Alabama Revenue Commissioner and Defendant William Harper in his official capacity as the Revenue Commissioner of Elmore County, Alabama. 5. Section 30 of the Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act, 2011 Ala. Laws 535 (commonly referred to as ""HB 56""), forbids ""[a]n alien not lawfully present in the United States"" from entering into or attempting to enter into ""any transaction. [with] the state or a political subdivision of the state,"" with the sole exception of obtaining a marriage license.' It further forbids any person from entering into or attempting to enter into such a transaction on behalf of an ""alien not lawfully present in the United States."" An individual found in violation of Section 30 can be convicted of a Class C felony and subjected to up to ten years' imprisonment. 6. Section 40-12-255 of the Alabama Code requires that all individuals who own, maintain, or keep a manufactured home in Alabama engage in a ""transaction"" with the State, within the meaning of Section 30 of HB 56. Specifically, by no later than November30 of each calendar year, any such person must pay an annual registration fee and display a current identification decal in a conspicuous location on the outside of her manufactured home. Section 40-12-255 imposes progressive fines and penalties for non-compliance, including imprisonment. A copy of the enrolled Bill is attached as Attachment 1. HB 56 has not been codified yet but is unofficially reported in electronic databases at Ala. Code <unk>31-13-1 et seq. (West 2011) and Ala. Code <unk>31-9C-1 etseq. (Michie/LexisNexis 2011). 7. Defendants Magee and Harper have adopted and implemented a policy, pursuant to the requirements of Section 30 of HB 56, to reject annual manufactured home registration payments from, and thus deny identification decals to, individuals who are unable to demonstrate U.S. citizenship or lawful immigration status. In other words, Defendants' policy treats the act of complying with Alabama Code <unk>40-12-255 as a ""business transaction"" under HB 56 Section 30. Until the passage and implementation of Section 30 of HB 56, Plaintiffs Doe #1 and Doe #2 were allowed to register their manufactured homes pursuant to Alabama Code Section 40-12-255. 9. Defendants' policy for enforcing HB 56 Section 30 makes it impossible for Plaintiffs Doe #1 and Doe #2 to make the annual registration payment and obtain current identification decals for their manufactured homes, as they are required to do under Alabama Code Section 40-12-255 by no later than November 30, 2011. If Plaintiffs Doe #1 and Doe #2 attempt to pay their annual registration fees in order to obtain current identification decals, they could face Class C felony charges for attempting to enter into a transaction with the State, in violation of HB 56 Section 30. But if Plaintiffs Doe #1 and Doe #2 do not pay the annual registration fee and do not display a current identification decal by November 30, 2011, they will face fines, penalties, and Class C misdemeanor charges for violating the Manufactured Homes statute, Alabama Code Sec. 40-12-255. 10.

The action to enforce the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601-3619 (""FHA""), and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691-1691f(""ECOA""), is brought to redress the discrimination based on race and national origin that Countrywide engaged in from 2004 to 2008 during the mortgage boom. Countrywide was one of the largest single-family mortgage lenders in the United States, if not the largest, between 2004 and 2008. During that period, Countrywide originated over 4.4 million residential mortgage loans through its retail loan offices and its wholesale division using mortgage brokers. Between 2004 and 2007, the total annual volume of these loans ranged between $110 billion and $243 billion. During that four-year period, Countrywide reported total net earnings of approximately $6.7 billion. Part of Countrywide's business strategy was to target local Hispanic and African-American markets in order to expand its lending and ultimately gain market dominance in making residential loans in those communities. As a result of Countrywide's policies and practices, more than 200,000 Hispanic and African-American borrowers paid Countrywide higher loan fees and costs for their home mortgages than non-Hispanic White borrowers, not based on their creditworthiness or other objective criteria related to borrower risk, but because of their race or national origin. Additionally, as a result of Countrywide's policies and practices, Hispanic and African-American borrowers were placed into subprime loans when similarly- qualified non-Hispanic White borrowers received prime loans. Between 2004 and 2007, more than 10,000 Hispanic and African-American wholesale borrowers received subprime loans, with adverse terms and conditions such as high interest rates, excessive fees, prepayment penalties, and unavoidable future payment hikes, rather than prime loans from Countrywide, not based on their creditworthiness or other objective criteria related to borrower risk, but because of their race or national origin. The victims of Countrywide's discrimination were located in more than 180 geographic markets across at least 41 states and the District of Columbia. For example, the statistical analyses discussed below found high numbers of potential victims in metropolitan markets throughout the country. The top twenty markets with the highest number of victims are: Los Angeles; Riverside; Chicago; Houston; Miami; Atlanta; New York; Washington, DC; Phoenix; San Diego; Las Vegas; Fort Lauderdale; Orlando; Santa Ana; Dallas; Denver; Oxnard; Newark; Long Island; and Detroit. More than two-thirds of the victims of Countrywide'S discrimination are Hispanic, and nearly one-third of all Countrywide's discrimination victims were located in California. Countrywide's home mortgage lending policies allowed its employees and mortgage brokers both to set the loan prices charged to borrowers and to place borrowers into loan products in ways that were not connected to a borrower's creditworthiness or other objective criteria related to borrower risk. Countrywide's policies created financial incentives for its employees and mortgage brokers by sharing increased revenues with them. Countrywide knew or had reason to know based on its own internal monitoring and reporting that its policies of giving unguided discretion to its own loan officers as well as to brokers was resulting in discrimination. Countrywide did not act to adequately compensate borrowers who were victims of discrimination nor did it take effective action to change the discriminatory policies or",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2009 | Countrywide Financial Corporation |||Hispanic and African-American ||| 2004 to 2008 ||| 2006 ||| 2007 ||| 2010 ||| 2011 ||| 2012 ||| 2013 ||| 2014 ||| 2015 ||| 2016 ||| 2017 ||| 2018 ||| 2019 |</s>

'13CV2327 H RBB COMPLAINT Plaintiff, United States of America, alleges: INTRODUCTION 1. The United States brings this action against Plaza Home Mortgage, Inc. 28 (“Plaza” or “the lender”) for discriminating against African-American and Hispanic 1 borrowers in its residential mortgage lending. The action to enforce the Fair Housing 2 Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601-3619 (“FHA”), and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 3 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691-1691f (“ECOA”), is brought to redress the discrimination based on 4 race and national origin that Plaza engaged in from 2006 through at least 2010. 2. From 2006 through at least 2010, Plaza charged thousands of African- 6 American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers higher fees than non-Hispanic white 7 (“white”) borrowers. Th e higher fees were not based on their creditworthiness or 8 other objective criteria related to borrower risk, but because of race or national origin. 9 Plaza also permitted its mortgage brokers to charge fees in excess of the lender’s 10 stated fee caps, and these brokers charged African-American and Hispanic borrowers 11 excessive fees in violation of the lender’s stated policies more frequently than white 12 borrowers. It was Plaza’s business practice to a llow its mortgage brokers who 13 generated loan applications for Plaza to vary their fees and thus alter the price set 14 based on a borrower’s objective credit-related factors. This subjective and unguided 15 pricing discretion resulted in African-American and Hispanic borrowers paying more 16 than white borrowers for home mortgage loans,1 for reasons unrelated to borrower 17 risk, both on a nationwide basis and in numerous geographic markets across the 18 country. A s a result of Plaza’s discriminatory practices, an African-American or 19 Hispanic borrower paid, on average, hundreds of dollars more for a Plaza loan. 3.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND CONTINUING FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Violation of the Federal Fair Housing COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT 010346-11 691167 V1 I. NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. It is axiomatic that banks should not make discriminatory loans. Banks 3 must extend credit to minorities on equal terms as they do to other similarly situated 4 borrowers. Banks should not target minority neighborhoods for loans that 5 discriminate nor make loans to minorities on terms that are worse than those offered to 6 whites with similar credit characteristics. When banks engage in such discriminatory 7 conduct, the misconduct has profound financial consequences for the cities in which 8 mortgaged properties exist, and banks should be responsible for those financial 9 consequences. Banks should reimburse the City for lost tax revenues due to 10 discriminatory lending. And banks should pay the costs of repairing and maintaining 11 properties that go into foreclosure due to discriminatory lending. This lawsuit arises 12 because JPMorgan breached these legally mandated obligations and foreseeably 13 injured the City of Los Angeles. 14 A. JPMorgan Has Engaged in a Continuing Pattern of Discriminatory Mortgage Lending Practices in Los Angeles Resulting in Foreclosures 2. This suit is brought pursuant to","<pad>The City of Los Angeles filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Chase Manhattan Bank, alleging that the banks violated the Fair Housing Act of 1968 by targeting minority neighborhoods in foreclosure. The complaint alleged that the defendants targeted minority neighborhoods for predatory loan terms, and that the discriminatory loan terms caused a significant reduction in property tax revenues for the city. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in which the defendants agreed to pay the city a total of $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and other costs. The settlement is subject to court approval.</s>"

The women claimed they were subjected to offers of maintenance services in return for sex, pervasive, unwanted touching, gestures and remarks. The Plaintiff claimed these actions constituted a pattern and practice of sexual discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act. 

Though the owners had gone out of business during the course of the litigation, they entered into a five-year Consent Decree that included detailed prohibitions against sex discrimination, should they ever again engage in the business. The manager was forever banned from any job involved in any aspect of the operation of any dwelling.

N/K/A OPTION ONE MORTGAGE SERVICES, INC. Defendants. C.A NO. 08-10157 JURY TRIAL DEMANDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Plaintiffs, Cecil Barrett Jr., Cynthia Barrett, Jean Blanco Guerrier, and Angelique M. Bastien, (collectively “Plaintiffs"") on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, by their undersigned attorneys, allege as follows: This is a class action brought by Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated minority homeowners, against H&R Block, Inc., H&R Block Bank, and their wholly-owned subsidiaries, Option One Mortgage Corporation and H&R Block Mortgage Corp. (collectively ""Defendants""), under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691, et seq. (“ECOA”) and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601 et seq. Plaintiffs seek remedies for themselves and the Class (defined in 83, below) for the discriminatory effects of the Defendants' home financing policies and practices. 1 As described below, the Defendants have established a specific, identifiable and uniform credit pricing system, a component of which, referred to herein as the Discretionary Pricing Policy, authorizes unchecked, subjective surcharge of additional points and fees to an otherwise objective risk-based financing rate. In other words, after a finance rate acceptable to the Defendants is determined by objective criteria (e.g., the individual’s credit history, credit score, debt-to-income ratio and loan-to-value ratios), the Defendants' credit pricing policy authorizes additional discretionary finance charges. These subjective, additional finance charges have a widespread discriminatory impact on minority applicants for home mortgage loans, in violation of ECOA and the FHA. The Defendants have established policies for retail and wholesale access to their loan products that subject minority financing applicants to a significantly higher likelihood of exposure to discretionary points and fees. These costs drive up the average cost of a mortgage loan made by one of the defendants to minority homeowners. Plaintiffs seek damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, disgorgement and restitution of monies disparately obtained from minority borrowers. JURISDICTION AND VENUE Plaintiffs invoke the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331, which confers original jurisdiction upon this Court in a civil action arising under federal law.

The defendants' credit pricing policy authorized additional discretionary finance charges, in violation of ECOA, FHRA, and FHRA.

In 2003, Complainants decided to sell Unit 722, and, on or about December 12, 2003, Complainants listed Unit 722 with a real estate agent for $479,950. 14. Between March 2005 and December 2007, at least three potential buyers were discouraged from purchasing Unit 722 because of the adults-only provision of the Amended Master Deed and Declaration and the Defendants’ enforcement of that provision. 15. Each potential buyer was a family with one or more individuals under the age of eighteen domiciled with a parent within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. <unk>3602 (k). 16.

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants' redevelopment plan, which razed numerous homes in a minority neighborhood, was discriminatory.  The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's pretrial decision in favor of the town to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reversed, and found that the plaintiffs were entitled to a trial.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the question whether disparate impact claims were available under the Fair Housing Act.  About two weeks prior to the scheduled argument, the parties settled; the city will construct 44 new homes, 20 for current residents in exchange for allowing redevelopment.

I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This is a civil rights action challenging Mount Holly Township’s (“Township”) widescale redevelopment of the neighborhood known as Mt. Holly Gardens (“Gardens”). Plaintiffs are an asso ciation of residen ts, Mt. Holly Gardens Citize ns in Actio n, Inc., (“CIA”), and 29 individual residents (“R esidents”) living in th e Gardens, which is a cohesive, ethn ically diverse neighborhood within Mt. Holly Township that is predominantly African-American and Hispanic with m ostly low and moderate in come f amilies. CIA a nd Residents are cha llenging th e Township’s sweeping redevelopm ent project that is demolishing existing hom es, displacing numerous families, and dismantling and destroying the entire Gardens neighborhood. 2. The Township and its redevelopers have been and currently are aggress ively implementing their redevelopm ent project, ultim ately seeking acquisition, through p urchase and eminent domain, and t otal demolition of all 329 homes within the Gardens redevelopm ent area affordable to curr ent a nd displace d f amilies and replace ment with new, m uch higher-p riced market rate hom es intended for households th at are more affluent. In carrying out redevelopment, the Township and its redevelopers have greatly increased blighted conditions and have rendered the Gardens unsafe and unlivable. Among other things, under the implied threa t of em inent dom ain, the Township has sys tematically acqu ired, vacated and boarded up m ore than 200 previously occupied homes—approxim ately two-thirds of all residential properties within the Gardens—and has demolished to date approximately 70 properties. If not stopped, the Township and its redev elopers will succeed in irrevocably tearing do wn the m ost iden tifiable minority community within Mt.

","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK CORINNE VARGAS, KISHA TRENT, ANNIE SMITH and R.G., on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Case No. Plaintiffs, v. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT TOWN OF SMITHTOWN, Defendant. JURY TRIAL REQUESTED Plaintiffs Corinne Vargas, Kisha Trent, Annie Smith, and R.G. on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, by and through their undersigned attorneys, make the following representations for judicial relief: I. NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. By this housing discrimination action, Plaintiffs seek redress for ongoing exclusionary housing policies and practices by Defendant Town of Smithtown (the ""Town"" or ""Smithtown"" or ""Defendant""). This action challenges Defendant's ongoing discriminatory acts and long-standing practice of unlawfully restricting the ability of Black and Hispanic individuals (""minority individuals"" or ""minorities"") to obtain federally funded Section 8 rental assistance in Smithtown, New York. By making housing opportunities ""unavailable"" to minority individuals because of race, color, and national origin and other illegal and discriminatory acts, Defendant has violated Plaintiffs' rights under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601 et seq.; the Civil Rights Act of 1866,42 U.S.C. <unk>1981, 1982; the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983; the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000d et seq. II. INTRODUCTION 2. This class action is brought by four low-income minority individuals in need of affordable housing who live and work near Smithtown, New York. The Plaintiffs applied for the Section 8 Housing Voucher Program, a federal housing assistance program administered by Smithtown. They are on Smithtown's Section 8 waiting list to receive such housing vouchers, but are unlawfully being denied an opportunity to obtain a Smithtown Section 8 housing voucher because of their race, color or national origin. They are all United States citizens. 3. Plaintiffs bring this case to enjoin the racially and ethnically exclusionary Section 8 policies and practices that Smithtown has adopted. These policies and practices illegally deny equal access to housing and discriminate on the basis of race, color and national origin in violation of the United States Constitution and federal civil rights laws. Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, injunctive and equitable relief, compensatory damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. 4. Since the Section 8 program's inception, Smithtown has included an absolute preference for Town residents regardless of their housing needs (the ""residency preference""). This means that a person who does not live or work in Smithtown cannot receive a Section 8 housing voucher through Smithtown's Section 8 program, until every person on the waitlist who lives or works in Smithtown has received a voucher. 5. Smithtown's residents are overwhelmingly White and non-Hispanic (over 93%). This is a significantly greater percentage of White, non-Hispanic residents than in most towns in Suffolk County and on Long Island. 6. The residency preference and racial makeup of Smithtown operate to ensure that minorities rarely receive Section 8 housing vouchers from Smithtown. 7. In 1997, after a review of Smithtown's Section 8 program and these facts, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HVD"") wrote a letter to Smithtown recommending that Smithtown rescind the residency preference because of its racially exclusionary effect. Smithtown ignored this recommendation. 8. Smithtown has relied on its residency preference and related practices to deny Section 8 housing vouchers to minorities. The Town has improperly managed its Section 8 program to ensure that the waitlist always has a sufficient number of White, non-Hispanic residents to prevent Section 8 vouchers from being given to minority nonresidents. In this and other ways, the residency preference has actually operated as a residency requirement. 9. For example, in the summer of 2006, when the number of White, nonHispanic residents on the Section 8 waitlist began to dwindle, the Community Development Corporation of Long Island (""CDCLI""), which manages the Smithtown program under a contract with Smithtown, reopened the waitlist at Smithtown's direction despite the fact that there were several hundred names on the waitlist at the time, a majority of whom were minorities. The decision to reopen the waitlist was in contravention of Smithtown's written policy indicating that the waitlist will not be reopened unless there are fewer than 100 names on the waitlist. 10. Further, when CDCLI reached the lottery number of a minority nonresident Plaintiff who applied to Smithtown's Section 8 program in the summer of 2006, CDCLI sent a letter to that Plaintiff stating that she ""must reside or work within the Town of Smithtown in order to be eligible for this program."" 11. Smithtown's use of the residency preference as a residency requirement, as evidenced by its waitlist reopening practices and this letter, is a plain violation of","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2013 | Town of Smithtown | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of New York | Class Action | Section 8 | Fair Housing Act | Civil Rights Act of 1866 .<n>Four low-income minority residents filed this class action lawsuit against the Town ofSmithtown in September 2013 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District Of New York.

SANDCASTLE TOWERS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FUND CORP. 1465A Flatbush Ave. Brooklyn, NY 11210 SARASOTA GOLD LLC 1407 48th Street Brooklyn, NY 11219 and WEISSMAN REALTY GROUP LLC 45 Broadway, 12th Floor New York, NY 10006 Civil Action No. 1:14-cv-6410 COMPLAINT JURY DEMAND Defendants. NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. The Fortune Society (“Fortune”) brings this suit pursuant to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601 et seq., for injunctive, monetary and declarative relief against Defendants Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corporation (“HDFC”), Sarasota Gold LLC (“Sarasota Gold”), and Weissman Realty Group LLC (“Weissman”) for engaging in a pattern or practice of illegal discrimination on the basis of race and color at The Sand Castle, a multi-building apartment complex they own and manage in Queens, New York. Specifically, Defendants maintain and enforce a policy of automatically excluding any person with a record of a criminal conviction from renting or living in an apartment at The Sand Castle. Defendants explicitly confirmed this policy to Fortune twice in the summer of 2013. The policy excludes all such people regardless of the nature of the conviction, the amount of time that has lapsed since the conviction, evidence of rehabilitation, or any other factor related to whether a specific person poses any threat to safety. Pursuant to this stated policy, Defendants repeatedly refused to permit Fortune to rent apartments at The Sand Castle on behalf of its clients because those clients have criminal histories.1 Defendants’ policy has the purpose and effect of discriminating against African Americans and Latinos, including Fortune’s clients, in violation of the Fair Housing Act and New York State and City law. 2. Fortune is a not-for-profit organization that for nearly fifty years has been dedicated to the successful reentry and reintegration of formerly incarcerated individuals in New York City (“the City”). It is one of the leading organizations in the country addressing and helping individuals overcome reentry issues. Fortune has been lauded nationally and internationally for the innovation, quality, and effectiveness of its programs. Just this summer Fortune’s Senior Vice President of Programs, himself a formerly incarcerated African-American man, was named a “Champion of Change” by the White House for his work at Fortune. 3. Fortune serves approximately 5,000 clients a year. Approximately 95% of its clients are African-American or Latino. Fortune provides comprehensive services to these clients by operating housing, education, employment, health, and case management programs, among others. 1 For purposes of this Complaint, “criminal history” and “criminal record” refer to a prior criminal conviction. 4. One of Fortune’s principal tasks is to secure housing for its clients and their families. Fortune provides temporary and permanent housing for hundreds of formerly incarcerated individuals each year. It does so by running “scattered-site” programs that place clients in private rental housing throughout the City and by operating two housing facilities itself in West Harlem. The two facilities are The Fortune Academy and Castle Gardens. 5. Many of Fortune’s housing programs work as a pipeline, with individuals moving from emergency to “phased permanent” to permanent housing as part of their successful reintegration. Being able to move people to the end of the pipeline opens up more space at the beginning and allows Fortune to serve more clients. 6. In some of Fortune’s scattered-site programs, Fortune leases apartments and pays the rent itself. Its clients provide some reimbursement, which encourages a sense of personal investment and responsibility. Some of Fortune’s scattered-site programs serve specific segments of the formerly-incarcerated population, such as people who are HIV-positive, or certain regions of the City. Fortune has developed relationships with over 100 landlords to facilitate its scattered-site housing and regularly seeks out new locations for these programs. 7. The Fortune Academy includes an 18-bed emergency housing unit and a “phasedpermanent” unit that serves 41 people who transfer from the emergency unit when Fortune staff determine they are ready to live independently, subject to the availability of space. Individuals stay in the phased-permanent housing until they are ready to transition to permanent housing elsewhere. Such permanent housing is often located through Fortune’s scattered-site programs. At Castle Gardens, Fortune provides affordable permanent housing that integrates formerlyincarcerated people with other low-income families. The demand for space at Fortune Academy and Castle Gardens substantially exceeds the space that is available. 8.

The plaintiffs sued Nassau County and the Village of Garden City under the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with discriminatory zoning practices; to order Garden City to approve a proposed zoning that would allow for affordable housing; and to order the defendants to take all actions necessary to assure that the Social Service Site be redeveloped to maximize the availability of affordable and integrated housing. 

On February 15, 2012, Judge Arthur D. Spatt granted defendant County's motion for summary judgment dismissing all claims against it. 

On April 22, 2014, Judge Spatt issued a final order for the plaintiffs and ordered Defendant Garden City to take a number of steps to prevent discrimination and to increase access to affordable housing. After Judge Spatt's order, both parties appealed the decision. The Second Circuit affirmed in part and remanded in part. The case is back in the lower courts on remand. On remand, Judge Spatt found that the plaintiffs had met their burden at trial in demonstrating that the Garden City’s proffered reasons for its chosen zoning change could have been met by another practice, such as R-M zoning, that had a less discriminatory effect. Magistrate Judge Arlene R. Lindsay thereafter awarded plaintiffs $5,255,108.94 in attorneys fees and costs from Garden City. On March 15, 2019, Judge Spatt signed the parties’ stipulation of discontinuance with prejudice, except without prejudice as to the court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of interpretation or enforcement of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement required the County to pay $5,400,000 to the plaintiffs to be used for the purpose of furthering and promoting mixed-income affordable housing; $120,000 to NYCC to be used for activities related to fair and affordable housing; and $400,000 to plaintiffs’ counsel for attorneys’ fees.

This action is brought by the United States to enforce the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691-1691f (“ECOA”). 2. This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1345 and 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691e(h). Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391. 3. Defendant Nixon State Bank (“Nixon” or “the bank”) is an indep endent community bank based in Nixon, Texas. Chartered in 1906, Nix on is the seventh oldest state- chartered institution in Tex as. In addition to its location in Nix on, the bank op erates two additional branches located in La Vernia, Texas and China Grove, Tex as. Nixon offers a wide range of loan products, including mortgage loans, consumer loans, commercial loans, and agriculture loans. The bank originates its loans through loan officers at its three branches. 4. As of September 30, 2009, the bank had total assets of $68.88 million and total equity capital of $6.65 million. Nixon is subject to the reg ulatory authority of the F ederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). 5. Nixon is subject to feder al laws governing fair lending, including ECOA and the regulations promulgated thereunder. ECOA prohi bits financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of, inter alia, national origin in their lending pra ctices. Charging higher prices for loans on the basis of na tional origin, including charging higher rates of interest, is one of the discriminatory lending practices prohibited by ECOA. Nixon is a “creditor” within the meaning of section 702(e) of ECOA, 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691a(e). 6. Beginning in 2008, the FDIC conducted an examination of the lending practices of Nixon to evaluate compliance with ECOA. Based on analysis of the average rates of interest that Nixon charged in 2007 and 2008 for unsecu red consumer loans, the FDIC found reason to believe that Nixon had displayed a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of national origin against Hispanic borrowers. On April 14, 2010, followin g the examination described above, the FDIC referred the lendin g practices of Nixon to the United States Department of Justice pursuant to 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691e(g). 7. After receiving the referral from the FDIC, the United States analyzed the interest rates that Nix on charged between 2007 and 20 10 on unsecured consumer loans. The United States also reviewed Nixon’s loan policies and procedures from 2006 to 2010. 8. Prior to mid- to late- 2009, Nixon did not have a written loan pricing guideline for its unsecured consumer loans. The bank did not r equire a written application or credit report; utilize a uniform pricing system such as a matr ix or rate sheet; or d ocument loan denials. Instead, Nixon’s loan officers w ere granted b road discretion in handlin g all aspects of t he unsecured consumer loan transaction. 9. Nixon has been aware of the flaws with its unsecured consumer lending policies and procedures since at least 2006. In April 2006, an independent au ditor recommended to Nixon that an application and a current credit report be obtained for all unsecured consumer loan applicants. The auditor also recommended that an analysis should be documented in the loan file for applications denied due to excessive debt-to-income. As a result of the auditor’s report, bank management made a recommendation to the Board of Directors to amend the bank’s loan policy to define how often an appli cation and credit re port should be obtained for unsecured loans. Around the same time, Nixon’s Training and Controls Monitoring Committee resolved to (1) define the meaning of a n application; (2) defi ne the meaning of a r ecent application; and (3) determine how often a credit report is needed. 10. The bank failed to implement any changes to address its discretionary loan pricing procedures from 2006 to mid-2009. In June 2008, the FDIC criticized Nix on for failing to include applications, fi nancial statements, credit reports, and other docu mentation in its loan files. In May 2009, another independent auditor of the bank detected some inconsistencies with bank-wide pricing and recommended that the bank become structured in its pricing strategies. 11. In mid-2009, Nixon’s CEO acknowledged the following issues in a memorandum to all emplo yees: (1) inconsistent and sometimes non-existent loan under writing; (2) inconsistency in loan administration; (3) inconsistency in loan pricing; and (4) inconsistency in following loan pricing. After this memorandum was issued, Nixon introduced new policies and procedures to improve it s overall fair lending program, including: (a) new","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] April 2010 | Texas | Equal Credit Opportunity Act | Nixon State Bank | U.S. District Court | Western District of Texas ||| March 2011 ||| May 2011 | ||| June 2012 ||| July 2013 ||| August 2013 | July 2014 | August 2015 ||| September 2014 | July 2015 | August 2016 | July 2017 | August 2018 | September 2018 | July 2019 | August 2019 | July 2020 | August 2020 | September 2020 | July 2021 | August 2021 | September 2021 | July 2022 | August 2022 | July 2018 | August 2017 | July 2020, August 2020, September 2020, and August 2020 (the ""Complaints"") On April 20, 2010, the United States filed this lawsuit in the United District Court for the Western district of Texas.

The FDIC referred the case to the Department of Justice, which filed a consent decree in March 2011. The consent decree required the bank to: (a) implement a written loan pricing guideline for its unsecured consumer loans; (b) provide a written application or credit report; (c) determine how often a credit report is needed; (d) provide an analysis in the loan file for applications denied due to excessive debt-to-income; (e) establish a uniform pricing system; and (f) make changes to its loan policies and procedures.

PrimeLending, a Texas corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PlainsCapital Bank, a bank chartered by the Texas Department of Banking and a member of the Federal Reserve System. PlainsCapital Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PlainsCapital Corporation. PrimeLending's principal place of business is 2323 Victory Avenue, Suite 1400, Dallas, Texas, and it is subject to the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve System. 4. PrimeLending is a residential mortgage lender offering conventional prime loans and loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs. It operates through a retail model of accepting applications and originating loans using its own employees. Although its lending continues to be concentrated most heavily in Texas, particularly in the Dallas market, it had expanded by the end of 2009 to operate 168 offices in 32 states. In 2009, PrimeLending originated more than 30,000 loans secured by residential real estate, with an aggregate principal value of more than $5.5 billion, and it was one of the 20largest lenders in the Federal Housing Administration loan program. 5. PrimeLending is subject to Federal laws governing fair lending, including the FHA and the ECOA and the regulations promulgated under each of those laws. The FHA and the ECOA prohibit financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of, inter alia, race in their lending practices. Charging higher prices for loans on the basis of race, including charging higher annual percentage rates of interest, is one of the discriminatory lending practices prohibited by the FHA and the ECOA. 6.

PrimeLending also is subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 12 U.S.c. <unk>2803, which requires mortgage lenders to maintain data on the race of each borrower. 7. Beginning in 2008, the Federal Reserve System conducted an examination of the lending practices of PrimeLending to evaluate compliance with, among other laws, the FHA and the ECOA. Based on analysis of the annual percentage rates of interest that PrimeLending charged in 2006 and 2007 for conforming fixed-rate loans secured by residential real estate and for loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and Depat1ment of Veterans Affairs secured by residential real estate (collectively, ""the examined loan products""), the Federal Reserve System found reason to believe that PrimeLending had displayed a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of race against African-American borrowers. Further, the Federal Reserve System found that PrimeLending did not have robust fair lending controls. On December 15, 2009, following the examination described above, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System referred the lending practices of PrimeLending to the United States Department of Justice pursuant to 15 U.S.C. <unk>169Je(g). 8.

After receiving the referral from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the United States Department of Justice analyzed the annual percentage rates of interest that PrimeLending charged between 2006 and 2009 for the examined loan products. 10. Between at least 2006 and 2009, PrimeLending gave its employees wide discretion to charge ""overages"" or accept ""underages"" that raised or lowered, respectively, the annual percentage rate of interest paid by borrowers from the ""par"" interest rate at which PrimeLending would originate the loan. These par rates were communicated to employees through the daily distribution of ""ratesheets."" PrimeLending did not monitor or separately record overage or underage data for those years. 11.

Defendant FDSB is a state-chartered bank based in Fort Davis, Texas. FDSB operates three branches in Fort Davis, Alpine, and Presidio, Texas. Until early 2013, FDSB operated a fourth branch in Odessa, Texas. 6. FDSB offers a variety of loan products, including mortgage loans, consumer loans, commercial loans, and agricultural loans. The Bank originates its loans through loan officers operating at one or more of its branches. 7. As of September 30, 2012, the Bank had total assets of $78.5 million and total equity capital of $6.68 million. FDSB is subject to the regulatory authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (""FDIC""). 8. FDSB is subject to federal laws governing fair lending, including ECOA and the regulations promulgated thereunder. ECOA prohibits financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of, inter alia, national origin in their lending practices. Charging higher prices for loans on the basis of national origin, including charging higher rates of interest, is one of the discriminatory lending practices prohibited by ECOA. FDSB is a ""creditor"" within the meaning of section 702(e) of ECOA, 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691a(e). 9.

Based on analysis of the average rates of interest that the Bank charged on unsecured consumer loans made between November 1, 2009 and November 30, 2010, the FDIC found reason to believe that FDSB had engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of national origin against Hispanic borrowers. 10. On August 22, 2011, following its examination, the FDIC referred the lending practices of FDSB to the United States Department of Justice pursuant to 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691e(g). 11. After receiving the referral from the FDIC, the United States analyzed the interest rates that FDSB charged for unsecured consumer loans originated between January 1, 2008 and December 30, 2010. The United States also reviewed and evaluated the Bank's loan policies, procedures, and practices for that time period. 12. Prior to May 2011, FDSB had no written defined pricing guidelines or specific policies related to loan pricing of unsecured consumer loans. It did not use a uniform pricing system such as a matrix or rate sheet, and loan officers had broad subjective discretion to set interest rates on unsecured consumer loans. 13. Between at least January 1, 2008 and December 30, 2010, FDSB made approximately 750 unsecured consumer loans to Hispanic borrowers. During this period, FDSB charged interest rates to Hispanic borrowers for unsecured consumer loans that were 405 basis points1 higher, on average, than the rates charged to non-Hispanic borrowers. This disparity is statistically significant. 14. After accounting for relevant loan and borrower credit factors, including loan term, loan amount, debt-to-income ratio, and indicators of the borrower's credit history, FDSB charged interest rates to Hispanic borrowers between at least January 1, 2008 and December 30, 2010 that were from 100-228 basis points higher, on average, than the rates charged to similarly situated non-Hispanic white borrowers. These disparities are statistically significant. 15. The differences in interest rates charged to Hispanic borrowers and those charged to non-Hispanic white borrowers cannot be explained by factors unrelated to national origin. 16. The higher rates of interest that FDSB charged to Hispanic borrowers for unsecured consumer loans are a result of FDSB's policy or practice of giving its employees One basis point represents one hundredth of a percentage point (0.0 1%). broad subjective discretion in setting the interest rate for unsecured consumer loan transactions.

SOUTHPORT BANK, Defendant. COMPLAINT Case No. 13-C-1086 Plaintiff, United States of America, alleges: INTRODUCTION 1. The United States brings this action against Southport Bank of Kenosha, Wisconsin (“Southport” or “the bank”) for discriminating against African-American and Hispanic borrowers in its residential mortgage lending. The action to enforce the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601-3619 (“FHA”) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691-1691f (“ECOA”) is brought to remedy the discrimination based on race and national origin that Southport engaged in from 2007 to 2008 in its wholesale mortgage lending program. 2. In 2007 and 2008, Southport charged hundreds of African-American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers higher fees than non-Hispanic white (“white”) borrowers, not as a result of their creditworthiness or other objective criteria related to borrower risk, but because of their race and national origin. 3. It was Southport’s business practice to allow its mortgage brokers to vary their fees and thus alter the price set based on a borrower’s objective credit-related factors. This subjective and unsupervised pricing discretion resulted in African-American and Hispanic borrowers paying more than white borrowers for home mortgage loans. 4. As a result of the bank’s discriminatory practices, an African-American or Hispanic borrower paid, on average, thousands of dollars more for a Southport loan. 5. This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1345, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3614, and 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691e(h). Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391. PARTIES 6. Southport is headquartered in the City of Kenosha, Wisconsin. In 2007 and 2008, 96% of the bank’s home mortgage loans were made to borrowers in two Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Chicago-Naperville-Joliet and Milwaukee-Waukesha. Southport has two branches in Kenosha and a third in the Kenosha suburb of Salem. The bank is subject to the supervision of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). 7. Southport is subject to the federal laws governing fair lending, including the FHA and ECOA and their respective implementing regulations, the fair housing regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 24 C.F.R. <unk>100.1, et seq., and Regulation B of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 12 C.F.R. <unk>1002.1, et seq. The FHA and ECOA prohibit financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of, inter alia, race and national origin in their mortgage lending practices. 8. Southport is a “creditor” within the meaning of section 702(e) of ECOA, 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691a(e), and is engaged in “residential real estate-related transactions” within the meaning of section 805 of the FHA, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3605. The bank also is subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”), 12 U.S.C. <unk>2803, which requires mortgage lenders to maintain data on the race and ethnicity of each borrower. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 9. The FDIC’s regular statistical analyses of 2007 and 2008 HMDA data for Southport revealed substantial disparities in the amount paid by minority borrowers for wholesale mortgage loans. The agency determined through interviews with bank personnel that the bank permitted considerable discretion in compensation to wholesale brokers who delivered applications to the bank’s mortgage lending division, ComCor Mortgage Company,1 for origination. 10. Based on its analyses, the FDIC found reason to believe that Southport had engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination by allowing wholesale brokers to charge African-American and Hispanic borrowers higher fees for home loans than white borrowers. On May 21, 2012, the FDIC referred the lending practices of Southport to the United States Department of Justice pursuant to 15 U.S.C. <unk>1691e(g). After receiving the FDIC’s referral, the Department of Justice conducted its own analyses of HMDA data supplemented with information provided by the bank. 11. Wholesale loans, originated by more than 150 brokers, accounted for approximately 80 percent of Southport’s home mortgage loans2 in 2007 and 2008. During that period, the relationship of the bank with its brokers was governed by a Broker Agreement, which provided that the broker would submit applications for home mortgage loans to ComCor. 1 In September 2008, the bank began to wind down its mortgage lending activities and after November of that year made virtually no new home mortgage loans. On December 31, 2008, Southport closed ComCor. The bank does not currently originate mortgage loans. 2 For purposes of this Complaint, and consistent with HMDA, the term “home mortgage loan” or “home loan” refers to loans originated for the purchase or refinance of conventional","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] May 21, 2012 | Southport Bank of Kenosha | U.S. Department of Justice | Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ||| May 31, 2008 ||| August 31, 2009 ||| September 30, 2010 ||| October 31, 2011 ||| 2012 ||| 2013 ||| 2014 ||| 2015 ||| 2016 ||| 2017 ||| 2018 ||| 2019 |</s>"

The parties reached a preliminary settlement one year later and the final settlement was approved in January 2017. The settlement is ongoing and under court supervision through September 30, 2020. ","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON AT SEATTLE ADAM DUNAKIN, by and through his parent 10 and next friend, KIMBERLEE HOLLINGER individually, and on behalf of similarly situated NO. 2:14-cv-00567 11 individuals, COMPLAINT Plaintiff, (CLASS ACTION) v. KEVIN W. QUIGLEY, in his official capacity as 14 Secretary of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services; and DOROTHY F. 15 TEETER, in her official capacity as Director of the Washington State Health Care Authority, 16 Defendants. 17 I. OVERVIEW 18 1. Defendants, and their agencies, the Health Care Authority and the Department of 19 Social and Health Services, do not have an adequate system in place for persons with 20 intellectual disabilities and related conditions living in privately-operated Medicaid-certified 21 nursing facilities to be screened, assessed and/or receive specialized services, in violation of the 1 Medicaid Act and the Nursing Home Reform Act (NHRA). Defendants’ systemic failures have 2 caused plaintiff and putative class members to languish in institutional facilities, segregated 3 from family and friends, without the services that they need to maximize their independence 4 and without the opportunity to live in an integrated community-based setting. 2. Plaintiff’s counsel, Disability Rights Washington, has raised this issue with defendants repeatedly. After Disability Rights Washington conducted an extensive 6 investigation of Washington State’s failure to comply with NHRA requirements at just the state7 operated nursing facilities located at Lakeland Village, defendants disputed DRW’s findings. 8 Shortly thereafter, the federal government issued findings of over 40,000 violations of the 9 NHRA requirements for just 27 individuals residing at Lakeland Village. The problems found 10 at Lakeland Village are just the tip of the iceberg. Defendants’ failure to implement NHRA 11 requirements are systemic, statewide and occur in both state- and privately-operated nursing 12 facilities. 3. Defendants took action to address its NHRA violations in state-operated 14 Medicaid nursing homes. But they have left hundreds of Washington residents with 15 developmental disabilities languishing without NHRA screening, assessment and specialized 16 services at privately-operated nursing facilities. 4. This litigation seeks injunctive and declaratory relief to require defendants to 18 establish an adequate system to provide PASRR screenings, assessments, specialized services, and, when appropriate, community-based integrated placement for plaintiff and class members, 19 all of whom reside in privately-operated Medicaid-certified Nursing facilities. Without 20 injunctive and declaratory relief, hundreds of individuals with developmental disabilities will 21 1 continue to languish in institutions, isolated from their home communities, without the services 2 they need to maximize their potential and live as independently as possible. II. PARTIES 5. Plaintiff Adam Dunakin. Plaintiff Dunakin is a thirty-four (34) year old adult with a developmental disability who resides at Everett Care and Rehabilitation Center, a 5 privately-operated, Medicaid-certified nursing facility in Everett, Washington Mr. Dunakin is 6 eligible for Medicaid as well as for services from the Developmental Disabilities Administration 7 of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) Mr. Dunakin has 8 been confined to a nursing home for nearly eight (8) years without being evaluated for the 9 specialized services he needs to maximize his health and well-being as well as independence. 10 He would prefer to live in his home community, if appropriate services to support him were 11 offered by defendants. 6. Defendant Kevin W Quigley. Defendant Kevin Quigley is the Secretary of 13 DSHS, the state agency that includes the Developmental Disabilities Administration. DSHS, 14 through the Developmental Disabilities Administration, is responsible for implementing the 15 screening, evaluation and service delivery requirements under the Nursing Home Reform Act 16 (NHRA) and the Medicaid Act for developmentally disabled individuals living in privately- 17 operated Medicaid-certified nursing homes Mr. Quigley is sued in his official capacity only. All alleged acts by Mr. Quigley, DSHS and the Developmental Disabilities Administration were 18 taken under color of state law. 19 7. Defendant Dorothy F Teeter.

This action, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C Sec. 1983 and additional federal laws, is to redress the unconstitutional and illegal conditions imposed under color of state law on three hundred ninety-five (395) individuals with retardation on the rolls of the State Training School. 3. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin defendants from continuing to confine persons at the State Training School under inhumane conditions that violate their rights to adequate food, shelter, clothing, medical care, safe conditions, freedom from undue restraint, training or habilitation, proper care, treatment, education, right to privacy, and protection from harm.

COMPLAINT 15 The State of Arizona; and Janice K. Brewer, Governor of the State of Arizona, in her Official Capacity, Defendants. Plaintiff, the United States of America, by its undersigned attorneys, brings this civil 20 action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and alleges as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. In this action, the United States seek s to declare invalid and prelim inarily and 23 permanently enjoin the enforcement of S.B. 1070, as amended and enacted by the State of 24 Arizona, because S.B. 1070 is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the 25 Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. 2. In our constitutional system, the federal government has preeminent authority to 27 regulate immigration matters. This authority derives fromthe United States Constitution and 28 numerous acts of Congress. The nation’s immigration laws reflect a careful and considered 1 balance of national law enforcement, foreign relations, and humanitarian interests. Congress 2 has assigned to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, 3 and Department of Sta te, along with other federal agencies, the task of enforcing and 4 administering these im migration-related laws. In adm inistering these laws, the federal 5 agencies balance the com plex – and often com peting – objectives that anim ate federal 6 immigration law and policy. Although states may exercise their police power in a manner 7 that has an incidental or indirect effect on aliens, a state m ay not establish its own 8 immigration policy or enforce state laws in a m anner that interferes with the federal 9 immigration laws. The Constitution and the federal im migration laws do not pe rmit the 10 development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country. 3. Despite the preeminent federal authority and responsibility over immigration, the 12 State of Arizona recently enacted S.B. 1070, a sweeping set of provisions that are designed 13 to “work together to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens” by 14 making “attrition through enforcement the public policy of all state and local governm ent 15 agencies in Arizona.” See S.B. 1070 (as amended by H.B. 2162). S.B. 1070’s provisions, 16 working in concert and separately, seek todeter and punish unlawful entry and presence by 17 requiring, whenever practicable, the determination of immigration status during any lawful 18 stop by the police where there is “reasonable suspicion” that an individual is unlawfully 19 present, and by establishing new state criminal sanctions against unlawfully present aliens. 20 The mandate to enforce S.B. 1070 to the fullest extent possible is reinforced by a provision 21 allowing for any legal resident of Arizona to collect money damages by showing that “any 22 official or agency... [has]adopt[ed] or implement[ed] a policy” that “limits or restricts the 23 enforcement of federal immigration laws... to less than the full extent permitted by federal 24 law.” 4. S.B. 1070 pursues only one goal – “attrition” – a nd ignores the m any other 26 objectives that Congress has established for the federal im migration system. And even in 27 pursuing attrition, S.B. 1070 disrupts federal enforcement priorities and resources that focus 28 on aliens who pose a threat to national security or public safety. If allowed to go into effect, 1 S.B. 1070’s mandatory enforcement scheme will conflict with and underm ine the federal 2 government’s careful balance of im migration enforcement priorities and objectives. For 3 example, it will impose significant and counterproductive burdens on the federal agencies 4 charged with enforcing the national immigration scheme, diverting resources and attention 5 from the dangerous aliens who the federal government targets as its top enforcement priority. 6 It will cause the detention and harassm ent of authorized visitors, immigrants, and citizens 7 who do not have or carry identification documents specified by the statute, or who otherwise 8 will be swept into the ambit of S.B. 1070’s “attrition through enforcement” approach. It will 9 conflict with longstanding fede ral law governing the registration, sm uggling, and 10 employment of alie ns. It will altogether ignore hum anitarian concerns, such as the 11 protections available under federal law for an alien who has a well-founded fe ar of 12","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] May 2013 | U.S. District Court | District of Arizona | Arizona | S.B. 1070 | State of Arizona .<n>On May 2013, the United States of America filed this suit in the United District Court for the district of Arizona challenging the state's new immigration law.

The plaintiff, represented by organizations such as the ACLU and the National Immigration Law Center along with private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the recently enacted S.B. 1070 was a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Specifically, the plaintiff contends that S.B. 1070 conflicts with federal law and procedures and that local law enforcement agencies are ill equipped to deal with the complexities of immigration law.

The district court granted a preliminary injunction in February 2012, which the defendants appealed.  In a related case, Arizona v.

The plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction against the remaining provisions of S.B. 1070 and while the parties were going through discovery disputes, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on March 17, 2015. The plaintiff filed a response to the defendant's summary judgment and on September 4, 2015, the district court ruled in favor of the defendant with regard to plaintiff's claims under the Supremacy Clause, Equal Protection Clause, the Fourth Amendment, Article II, Section 8 of the Arizona Constitution, the Due Process Clause, and 42 U.S.C. §1981.

BACKGROUND The Arizona Legislature enacted a set of statutes and statutory am endments in the 25 form of Senate Bill 1070, the “Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act,” 26 2010 Arizona Session Laws, Chapter 113, which Governor Brewer signed into law on April 27 23, 2010. Seven days later, the Governor signed into law a set of amendments to Senate Bill 1 1070 in the form of House Bill 2162, 2010 Arizona Session Laws, Chapter 211.1 S.B. 1070 2 had an effective date of July 29, 2010. On July 28, 2010, the Court entered a preliminary 3 injunction in the related caseUnited States v. Arizona, CV 10-1413-PHX-SRB. (See United 4 States v. Arizona CV 10-1413-PHX-SRB, Doc. 87, Orde r Granting Prelim Inj. (“USA 5 Order”).) In the USA Order, the Court preliminarily enjoined certain provisions of S.B. 1070. Plaintiffs challenge S.B. 1070 in its entirety.2 (Compl. 183, Prayer for Relief b.) 8 Plaintiffs also raise specific challenges to Sections 2, 3, 5, and 6 of S.B. 1070. (Com pl. 9 180-218.) Section 2 of S.B. 1070 adds Arizona Revised Statute (“A.R.S.”) <unk>11-1051, which 10 requires law enforcem ent officials to check a person’s im migration status under certain 11 circumstances. Plaintiff principally contests the constitutionality of Subsection 2(B) of S.B. 12 1070, which requires officers to make a reasonable attempt, when practicable, to determine 13 an individual’s im migration status during any lawful stop, detention, or arrest where 14 reasonable suspicion exists that the person is unlawfully present in the United States. A.R.S. 15 <unk>11-1051(B). Subsection 2(B) also provides that all persons who are arrestedumst have their 16 immigration status verified prior to release. Id.

Ramsey, 831 P.2d 408, 413 (Ariz Ct App. 1992) (citingState v. 23 Prentiss, 786 P.2d 932, 937 (Ariz. 1989)). In determ ining whether potentially unconstitutional provisions of S.B. 1070 m ay be severed from the rem ainder of the 24 enactment, the primary concern is legislative intent. See id. at 715-16 (citing City of Mesa 25 v. Killingsworth, 394 P.2d 410, 413 (Ariz. 1964)). Section 12(A) of S.B. 1070 demonstrates that the Arizona Legislature intended the provisions of the enactment to be severable in order 26 to preserve the constitutional provisions of the Act. S.B. 1070, <unk>12(A). The Court will not ignore S.B. 1070’s severability clause or the obligation to preserve the constitutional provisions of a state legislative enactment.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF sf-3542449 INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs are civil detainees confined in a U.S. Customs and Border 3 Protection (“CBP”) facility within the Tucson Sector of the U.S. Border Patrol 4 (“Border Patrol”), a division of CBP. During their confinement, Plaintiffs and many 5 others like them—men, women, and children—have been subjected to inhumane and 6 punitive conditions. They have been packed into overcrowded and filthy holding cells 7 with the lights glaring day and night; stripped of outer layers of clothing and forced to 8 suffer in brutally cold temperatures; deprived of beds, bedding, and sleep; denied 9 adequate food, water, medicine and medical care, and basic sanitation and hygiene 10 items such as soap, sufficient toilet paper, sanitary napkins, diapers, and showers; and 11 held incommunicado in these conditions for days. These conditions exist in all of the 12 short-term detention facilities that CBP currently operates and maintains in its Tucson 13 Sector and thus Plaintiffs and putative class members are harmed no matter where they 14 are detained within the Sector. Plaintiffs bring this action challenging these harsh and 15 degrading conditions in Tucson Sector CBP facilities on behalf of themselves and all 16 those similarly situated. 2. Plaintiffs and putative class members have been or will be apprehended at 18 or near the U.S. border with Mexico and detained. Border Patrol apprehended more 19 than 200,000 people in its Tucson Sector in the past two years alone, among them 20 individuals seeking asylum, mothers with infants, and U.S. citizen children. Many of 21 the individuals CBP detains have fled dangerous conditions in their home countries, 22 and are seized following a lengthy, difficult, and perilous journey. They arrive 23 exhausted, thirsty and hungry, and often are suffering from dehydration, heat stroke, 24 diarrhea, bleeding and blistered feet, and other health conditions requiring medical 25 attention. A substantial number of the women are recent victims of sexually assault. 26 Many other adults and children arrive traumatized by the dangers they have escaped 27 and the harms they have suffered during their journey to the United States.1 The 28 1 See A Treacherous Journey: Child Migrants Navigating the U.S. Immigration Sys., Ctr. for Gender Refugee Studies Kids in Need of Defense (Feb. 2014), COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF sf-3542449 1 conditions in the holding cells—including the inadequate supply of water and food, the 2 extremely cold temperatures and the lack of access to medical care and medicines— 3 further endanger those already suffering from exposure-related medical impairments 4 and other pre-existing conditions. 3. In Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector (“Tucson Sector”), Defendants detain 6 apprehended individuals overnight—and often for multiple nights—in unsanitary 7 holding cells that are neither designed nor equipped for extended detention, and 8 certainly not for sleeping. Per Defendants’ own guidelines, holding cell use should be 9 limited to a period of no more than twelve hours. In practice, the vast majority of 10 detainees are held far longer. Defendants’ regular use of these filthy, cold, and often 11 overcrowded holding cells for longer-term detention is dangerous, inhumane, and 12 punitive. 4. As a result of Defendants’ policy and practice of using Tucson Sector 14 holding cells for overnight and even multiple night confinement, the named Plaintiffs 15 and putative class members are denied the ability to get adequate sleep—if any at all. 16 Defendants do not equip holding cells with beds and generally do not provide detainees 17 mattresses or other bedding.

The Court gives its preliminary 27 approval to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, subject to a Final Approval Hearing 28 to be held for the purpose of deciding whether to grant final approval to the settlement. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED AS 2 FOLLOWS: DEFINITIONS 1. For purposes of this Order, the Definitions in Section III of the Settlement 5 Agreement shall apply. RULE 23(a) 2. The Court finds that each of the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) is satisfied. a. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical. Defendants stipulate that the Primary Class contains thousands of members, and common sense indicates that Classes 2 and 3 are sufficiently numerous. See Newberg on Class Actions <unk>3.3 (4th ed.2002) (where “the exact size of the class is unknown, but general knowledge and common sense indicate that it is large, the numerosity requirement is satisfied”). b. There are numerous questions of law or fact common to the class. All class members are individuals whose Guest Information was provided to Federal Immigration Authorities or who were questioned or placed in immigration removal proceedings as a result of Guest Information being provided to Federal Immigration Authorities. c. The claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the class. Defendants’ records indicate that six Plaintiffs are members of the Primary Class. All but one Plaintiff was arrested at a Motel 6 property, placed in removal proceedings, and is either a Primary Class member or shared a room at Motel 6 with a Primary Class member at the time of his or her arrest. They are thus members of Class 3. The remaining proposed class representative was interrogated by Federal Immigration Authorities at a Motel 6 property while sharing a room with a Primary Class member, but was not placed in removal proceedings. She is thus a member of Class 2. d. The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Plaintiffs do not have interests that conflict with the proposed Settlement Class. Plaintiffs allege that they, like all Class Members, contracted for hospitality services and had their Guest Information disclosed to Federal Immigration Authorities or were interrogated and/or placed in removal procedures as a result of Guest Information being disclosed to Federal Immigration Authorities. Plaintiffs’ counsel also satisfies the adequacy requirement, as is evidenced by their thorough investigation, detailed Complaint, and extensive work in mediating and negotiating the proposed Settlement. Plaintiffs’ counsel has numerous years’ experience, and demonstrated success, in bringing class action claims. MALDEF, one of Plaintiffs’ counsel, is a longstanding non-profit whose mission is to provide legal services to individuals such as Plaintiffs and members of the Settlement Class. Proposed Class Counsel are competent and qualified and will more than adequately protect the Class’ interests. RULE 23(b) 3.

Pursuant to policy of the Coconino County Sheriff’s Office (“CCSO”), Coconino County will prolong the jail time of inmates suspected of residing in the 4 United States without lawful immigration status, even if Coconino County lacks any 5 state law basis for continued detention. 6 2.

On at least two occasions since December 12, 2017, individuals have 12 attempted to post bond on Plaintiff’s behalf. 13 5. Despite numerous individuals being willing to post bond for Tenorio-Serrano, 14 Plaintiff remains detained in the Coconino County Detention Facility (“CCDF”) due 15 to CCDF’s unconstitutional policy of prolonging detention of inmates for whom it 16 receives a “detainer” request from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 17 agency (“ICE”). 18 6. CCDF’s policy violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United 19 States Constitution and Article II, Section 8 of the Arizona Constitution by requiring 20 Plaintiff to remain in jail after meeting all conditions of pre-trial release, without any 21 1 independent probable cause determination that Mr. Tenorio-Serrano has committed 2 an additional crime, and without any recognized exception to the Warrant Clause of 3 the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security; U.S. Customs and Border 24 Protection; and Elaine Duke, in her official capacity as Acting Secretary, U.S. Department of 26 Homeland Security, Defendants. 17cv01215 INTRODUCTION 1. In this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiff Center for 3 Biological Diversity (“the Center”)—an environmental conservation organization 4 that works to protect native wildlife species and their habitats—challenges the 5 failure of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and U.S. Customs 6 and Border Protection (“CBP”) (collectively, “the Agencies” or “Federal 7 Defendants”) to comply with the requirements of the National Environmental 8 Policy Act (“NEPA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>4321 et seq., the Endangered Species Act 9 (“ESA”), 16 U.S.C. <unk>1531 et seq., and the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 10 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, in relation to border wall construction projects in San Diego 11 County, including: (1) the border wall prototype project, which would also serve 12 as the first new segment of border barrier built in California in several years 13 (“border wall prototype project”); and (2) the replacement of the westernmost 14 portion of the existing border fence (14 miles of existing primary and double layer 15 border fencing running from the Pacific Ocean to the eastern edge of Otay Mesa) 16 (“border wall replacement project”). 2. The border wall prototype project and border wall replacement 18 project are each federal actions that will impact the environment as well as several 19 threatened and endangered species, and are thus subject to the procedural and 20 substantive requirements of NEPA and the ESA, respectively. 3. Federal Defendants have not provided the Center or the general 22 public with notice or opportunity to comment under NEPA for the border wall 23 prototype project or border wall replacement project. Indeed, the Agencies have 24 not prepared any NEPA or ESA analysis for either the border wall prototype 25 project or the border wall replacement project. 4. Although NEPA does not require a plaintiff to provide federal 27 agencies with notice of alleged violations prior to filing suit, on June 1, 2017, the 28 Center wrote to the Agencies to provide notice of NEPA violations in relation to 17cv01215 1 the border wall prototype project. The Agencies have not acknowledged or 2 responded to this Notice. 5. In addition, on June 1, 2017, the Center also provided the Agencies 4 with formal notice of violations of the ESA for their failure to consult with U.S. 5 Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) in order to ensure that the border wall 6 prototype project does not jeopardize the continued existence of threatened or 7 endangered species, or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their 8 critical habitat. Similarly, on July 7, 2017, the Center provided the Agencies with 9 formal notice of ESA violations for their failure to consult with FWS in relation to 10 the border wall replacement project. Federal Defendants have failed to remedy 11 the alleged ESA violations during the 60-day notice period, and thus this second 12 amended complaint includes those violations. 6. In light of the Agencies’ failure and/or refusal to provide the public 14 with any information regarding their compliance with NEPA, the ESA, and other 15 environmental laws in relation to the border wall prototype project, on May 2, 16 2017, the Center submitted two requests for public records pursuant to FOIA, one 17 to DHS and one to CBP, seeking records pertaining to the Agencies’ NEPA 18 environmental analysis, as well as compliance with other environmental laws, for 19 the border wall prototype project. 7.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CASE NO.__________________ INTRODUCTION 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 3 et seq., to enforce the public’s right to information about U.S. Immigration and Customs 4 Enforcement’s (“ICE”) use of surveillance technology to track the movements of drivers on 5 America’s streets. 2. Automated License Plate Reader (“ALPR”) systems combine a camera, an image- 7 processing device, and a database to recognize and store license plates associated with date, time, 8 and location recorded at the time of recognition. ALPRs are deployed by local police 9 departments, private companies, tow trucks, and repossession services to collect data on millions 10 of drivers on the street, in apartment complexes, at shopping centers, and large employee parking 11 lots. Millions of license plate scans are collected each month and shared by local law 12 enforcement agencies with dozens of out-of-state and federal agencies. Private companies can 13 accumulate billions of pieces of data on a driver’s location stretching back months or years. 3. While local law enforcement agencies seek to use license plate data for criminal 15 investigations, the excessive collection and storing of this data in databases—which is then 16 pooled and shared nationally—results in a systemic monitoring that chills the exercise of 17 constitutional rights to free speech and association, as well as essential tasks such as driving to 18 work, picking children up from school, and grocery shopping. 4. Earlier this year, the public learned that ICE had purchased access to two private 20 databases of ALPR data. The potential use by ICE of data for civil immigration enforcement, an 21 entirely different purpose for which it was originally collected by local police—local criminal 22 investigations—has generated widespread media interest and public concern. Access to 23 information about ICE’s use of ALPR databases is necessary to inform meaningful public debate 24 over the scope of government conduct that potentially threatens core civil rights and liberties 25 protected by the Constitution. 5. Over two months ago, on March 19, 2018 and March 21, 2018, respectively, 27 Plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California (“ACLU-NC”), a non-profit COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1 civil rights organization, submitted two FOIA requests to Defendant Immigration and Customs 2 Enforcement (“ICE”) seeking records relating to contracts between ICE and private companies 3 for access and use of ALPR databases, along with relevant training material, privacy policies, 4 and other guidance regarding the appropriate use by ICE of this surveillance technology. 6. Since that time, ICE has provided ACLU-NC with no records. 7. ACLU-NC now brings this action to obtain the information to which it is 7 statutorily entitled. PARTIES 8. Plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California is an affiliate of 10 the American Civil Liberties Union, a national, non-profit, non-partisan organization with the 11 mission of protecting civil liberties from government incursions, safeguarding basic 12 constitutional rights, and advocating for open government. ACLU-NC is established under the 13 laws of the state of California and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. ACLU-NC has 14 approximately 169,000 members. In support of its mission, ACLU-NC uses its communications 15 department to disseminate to the public information relating to its mission, through its website, 16 newsletters, in-depth reports, and other publications.

The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (""ICE""), the agency 3 within the Department of Homeland Security (""DHS"") that is charged with the investigation and 4 enforcement ofthe immigration laws (collectively, ""Defendants""), is improperly withholding 5 records pertaining to the Trump administration's immigration prosecutorial discretion policies 6 and practices.

Prosecutorial discretion-the authority of an agency or an officer to decide to 13 what degree to enforce a law against a particular individual-has long been a key component of 14 Defendants' immigration enforcement strategy. Since January 20, 2017, however, immigration 15 attorneys and the public have received information suggesting a change in Defendants' 16 prosecutorial discretion policies. In practice, Defendants appear to have abolished virtually all 17 use of prosecutorial discretion. Even though these changes potentially affect hundreds of 18 thousands of people, Defendants have been unwilling to disclose publicly their current 19 prosecutorial policies and procedures. Defendants' lack of transparency around this issue has 20 caused profound fear, anxiety, and hardship throughout immigrant communities across the 21 country. 3. Plaintiffs sent Defendants the Request on March 2, 2017, to address the lack of 23 public knowledge and growing public concern about Defendants' prosecutorial discretion 24 procedures. The Request sought records dated on or after January 20, 2017, pertaining to 25 Defendants' prosecutorial discretion policies and practices.

INTRODUCTION 1. When proclaiming January 16, 2018, as Religious Freedom Day, President Trump 8 called the United States “the paramount champion for religious freedom around the world” and 9 promised to “be undeterred in our commitment to monitor religious persecution and implement 10 policies that promote religious freedom.”1 But just one month later, his administration took the 11 unprecedented step of denying en masse the refugee applications of nearly 90 Christians, 12 Mandaeans, and other persecuted religious minorities from Iran who had applied for refugee 13 status under the Vienna-based Lautenberg-Specter program (“Vienna Lautenberg-Specter 14 program”). They all received the same stock response—that their refugee applications had been 15 “denied as a matter of discretion.” Each such unexplained denial was contrary to law. 2. In 1989, Congress enacted the Lautenberg Amendment to facilitate refugee 17 admission of persecuted religious minorities and other vulnerable groups from certain specified 18 countries by lowering the evidentiary burden of eligibility and mandating certain procedural 19 protections. Congress specifically added Iranian religious minorities to these protections in 2004 20 through the Specter Amendment and has consistently reauthorized both Amendments, including 21 as recently as March 23, 2018. The Vienna Lautenberg-Specter program allows persecuted 22 religious minorities in Iran to have a U.S. person sponsor their refugee application process, travel 23 to Vienna after they pass initial screening, and apply for refugee status there under the special 24 protections of the Lautenberg Amendment. Until the mass denial, nearly 100% of the Iranian 25 refugee applicants who were invited to travel to Vienna were granted refugee admission within a 26 few months.

SESSIONS III, Attorney General of the United States, LAURA L. 20 ROGERS, Acting Assist. Attorney General of the United States, UNITED STATES 21 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, DOES 1-100, Defendants. INTRODUCTION 1. During his campaign, President Trump pledged to end federal funding to sanctuary 3 cities. Despite the determination by these cities that their sanctuary laws and policies make their own 4 communities safer, healthier and stronger, his Administration has spent more than eighteen months 5 trying to coerce them to abandon those laws and policies by threatening to defund them. The Trump 6 Administration’s two attempts to do so have been rebuffed by the federal courts. 2. First, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Attorney General and 8 Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that “sanctuary jurisdictions” did not receive federal 9 funds. A court in this district struck it down. Next, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) attempted to 10 impose immigration-related requirements on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds. Every single court that has 11 examined the validity of these requirements has found them to be unconstitutional. 3. DOJ’s latest effort should fare no better. DOJ recently announced that it is again 13 attempting to coerce sanctuary jurisdictions into changing their laws and policies by imposing 14 unconstitutional requirements on important criminal justice grant funding. Some of the new 15 requirements DOJ has imposed on the FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds (e.g., those that require jurisdictions 16 to give immigration authorities both unfettered access to their jails and 48 hours’ notice before 17 releasing an individual believed to be in the country illegally) are nothing more than repackaged 18 versions of the FY 2017 requirements that courts across the country have struck down. But others go 19 much further. Indeed, the new requirements cast a threatening pall over sanctuary jurisdictions by 20 implying that they may be violating federal criminal laws simply by having laws or policies that limit 21 entanglement with federal immigration policies. 4. These extortive requirements are unlawful. As a threshold matter, DOJ lacks the 23 statutory authority to impose them. The Constitution establishes a balance of power between the state 24 and federal governments, as well as among the coordinate branches of federal government, to prevent 25 the excessive accumulation of power in any single entity and reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse 26 from any government office. An executive branch agency of the federal government may not seize for 27 itself the power that the Constitution reserves for Congress. Nor may it intrude on authority that the 28 Constitution has preserved for state and local governments. The FY 2018 grant requirements violate 1 both of these precepts. DOJ is improperly attempting to wield powers that only Congress is entitled to 2 invoke, and is seeking to compel San Francisco to bend its considered policy judgments, which the 3 Constitution allows it to make for its community, to the federal government’s will. 5. And even if DOJ has the authority to impose some conditions on the FY 2018 Byrne 5 JAG funds, each of the Challenged Requirements at issue here relating to federal immigration 6 enforcement would still be unlawful under other constitutional limits. Those limits prevent DOJ from 7 requiring compliance with the funding requirements because (1) they leave localities unclear about 8 how to comply with each of the requirements, and (2) they lack a nexus between the congressionally 9 mandated purpose of Byrne JAG funds and immigration enforcement. 6. San Francisco faces the immediate prospect of losing over $1.4 million in this fiscal 11 year if it does not receive FY 2018 Byrne JAG funds. San Francisco uses these funds for a variety of 12 important law enforcement purposes, including programs designed to reduce recidivism, provide 13 alternative forms of prosecution, or enable drug treatment for underserved populations. 7. San Francisco faces an unacceptable choice that is precisely what the Trump 15 Administration wishes it to have: either comply with DOJ’s unconstitutional new grant conditions and 16 abandon local policies that San Francisco adopted to promote public safety and foster trust and 17 cooperation","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2019 | San Francisco | U.S. District Court | Northern District of California | Department of Justice ||| January 2020 ||| San Francisco v.

This case challenges the federal government’s new policy of forcing asylum seekers to 3 return to danger in Mexico while they await their removal proceedings, in violation of the 4 humanitarian protections to which they are entitled under United States and international law. Plaintiffs are individual asylum seekers from Central America who are now living in fear in 7 Mexico because they were returned there under the new policy, as well as legal organizations 8 whose missions to provide representation to such asylum seekers are being thwarted by the physical 9 removal of those asylum seekers from the United States. 10 3. Since the enactment of the 1980 Refugee Act nearly forty years ago, U.S. law has prohibited 11 the return of individuals to countries where they are likely to face persecution, while providing an 12 asylum procedure by which individuals fleeing persecution can seek and obtain permanent safety. 13 But at the end of January, the government began to implement a new policy that eviscerates both of 14 15 these fundamental protections. 16 4. Under the new policy, immigration authorities are forcing asylum seekers at the southern 17 border of the United States to return to Mexico—to regions experiencing record levels of 18 violence—where they must remain for the duration of their asylum proceedings. By placing them in 19 such danger, and under conditions that make if difficult if not impossible for them to prepare their 20 cases, Defendants are depriving them of a meaningful opportunity to seek asylum.","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2019 | ACLU | U.S. District Court | Northern District of California ||| Central American Resource Center ||| Mexican Legal de la Raza ||||||| January 2020 ||| March 2020 .<n>On January 2019, the ACLU and Mexican legal organizations filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern district of California challenging the government's new policy of forcing asylum seekers to return to Mexico while they await their asylum proceedings in Mexico.

Relief INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs are three immigration attorneys and two noncitizens who filed Freedom 3 of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests for individual immigration case files, also known as Alien 4 Registration Files or A-Files. These A-File FOIA requests are pending with Defendants U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 6 7 (“ICE”), both component agencies within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). 8 Defendants have failed to make determinations within the statutory timeframe mandated by the 9 FOIA statute. 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(6)(A), (B). Instead, Plaintiffs and the classes of similarly 10 situated FOIA requesters they seek to represent must wait for prolonged periods—generally 11 months—before receiving complete A-Files. 12 2. A-Files contain information that is critical to determining noncitizens’ eligibility 13 14 to apply for an immigration benefit or status, including lawful permanent resident status, or to 15 defend against deportation. The ability to do either is stymied for as long as an individual’s A- 16 File FOIA request continues to linger—unprocessed—at USCIS or ICE. 3. Plaintiffs seek to represent two nationwide classes of similarly situated 18 individuals to challenge Defendants’ pattern or practice of violating the FOIA statute in making 19 timely determinations: (1) all individuals who filed, or will file, A-File FOIA requests with 20 USCIS which have been pending, or will be pending, with USCIS for more than 30 business 22 days without a determination; and (2) all individuals who filed, or will file, A-File FOIA requests 23 with USCIS that USCIS has referred, or will refer, to ICE and which have been pending, or will 24 be pending, for more than 30 business days from the date of the initial filing with USCIS without 25 a determination. 26 4. Defendants USCIS and ICE both have FOIA backlogs which contribute to delays 27 in processing A-File FOIA requests. FOIA backlogs are defined as “[t]he number of requests or Complaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief 1 administrative appeals that are pending at an agency at the end of the fiscal year that are beyond 2 the statutory time period for a response.”1 3 5. Neither agency has allocated sufficient resources to the handling of FOIA 4 requests. Defendant DHS is aware of these backlogs and has not acted to reduce them. 5 6. Plaintiffs and members of the proposed classes they seek to represent suffer harm 7 due to Defendants’ failure to make timely determinations on their A-File FOIA requests. Without 8 the information that they have requested through FOIA, Plaintiffs lack the documentation needed 9 to assess their or their clients’ immigration history. This history includes past applications or 10 petitions filed with USCIS and past interactions with DHS enforcement agencies, which are 11 often critical to assessing immigration options and potential defenses against deportation. 12 7. Defendants’ delays also prevent Plaintiffs and members of the proposed classes 13 14 from moving forward with petitions and applications for which they or their clients may be 15 eligible. This causes unnecessary emotional and financial hardship for individuals left in legal 16 limbo while they wait to obtain the records that",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] December 2010 | U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services | Department of Homeland Security ||| Alien 4 Registration Files (A-Files) ||| January 2011 ||| March 2012 ||| May 2013 ||| June 2013 | May 2014 ||| July 2013 | July 2014 | August 2013 | September 2013 | October 2013 | December 2014 | January 2015 | March 2015 | May 2015 | July 2015 | December 2013 | January 2016 | March 2013 | March 2014 | July 2016 | May 2013</s>

195,IM-CA-0166,"[ENTITYCHAIN] ICE | DHS ||| the Administrative Procedure Act ||| July 15 | July ||| July 6 | March ||| October 1, 2020 [SUMMARY] Seven unnamed individuals sued ICE and DHS over their new directive that would effectively force international students to take in-person classes or risk deportation. The suit alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Due Process Clause. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the enforcement of the directive and an order vacating the directive. 

On July 15, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance, but the plaintiffs in this case filed an amended complaint that sought a formal declaration that the July 6 directive was improperly issued and an order that the government administer the student visa program in accordance with the March guidance for the duration of the emergency. The court found that the students' claims were mooted by the rescission and granted the government's motion to dismiss on October 1, 2020.","1 Mark D.

This politically motivated directive 10 upended the lives of foreign students who are lawfully present in this country and who 11 contribute immeasurably to the quality of education at the institutions they attend. 12 These students chose to come to the United States to pursue degrees in law, medicine, 13 engineering, and every other academic field. They wish to prepare themselves to lead 14 productive lives that serve and build community wherever they ultimately settle. 15 Access to our outstanding institutions of higher education is one of the greatest gifts 16 that the United States gives the world, and that gift is repaid many times over by the 17 contributions that foreign students make to the United States and to the world as a 18 whole by virtue of the learning they receive. Those contributions reflect their 19 intelligence, compassion, and hard work. 2.

As of March 25, 2021, a settlement has been reached as to the evidence, but litigation continues for the plaintiff's attorney's fees and costs.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT CENTER, Plaintiff, v. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY and UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, Defendants. NATURE OF THE CASE 1. In this action, brought pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, et seq., Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to effect the release by the Defendants of agency records that Plaintiff has requested from the Defendants pursuant to FOIA. 2. Plaintiff, Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center (“CREEC”), is a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Colorado that is dedicated to protecting and defending the civil rights of individuals and educating the public concerning civil rights issues. 3. Defendants, agencies of the U.S. Government, maintain a network of detention facilities at which individuals who are not United States citizens are confined under authority exercised by the Defendants. With few exceptions, these individuals are confined in county jails or private facilities that are operated by public or private entities pursuant to contracts with the Defendants. 4. In recent years, there has developed significant public interest and controversy over the conditions of confinement of immigrant detainees placed into custody by the Defendants. 5. Defendants’ network includes the Adelanto Detention Facility (“ADF”) located in or near the city of Adelanto, California. ADF is operated by GEO Group, Inc., a private entity, pursuant to a contract between the City of Adelanto and the Defendants, and an operating agreement between GEO Group and the City, under which ADF undertakes responsibility for confinement of individuals detained under authority and oversight of the Defendants. ADF has been the subject of numerous complaints of substandard conditions of confinement, investigations of such complaints and conditions by non-governmental civil rights organizations, and reports to the public concerning substandard conditions of confinement issued by such organizations. On information and belief, the Defendants possess considerable records and data regarding substandard conditions of confinement at ADF that have not been made available to the public. 6. Defendants’ network of detention facilities also includes the Etowah County Detention Center (“ECDC”), situated in the town of Gadsden, Alabama. ECDC is operated by the Etowah County Sheriff’s Office pursuant to a contract with the Defendants under which ECDC undertakes responsibility for confinement of individuals detained under authority and oversight of the Defendants. ECDC has been the subject of numerous complaints of substandard conditions of confinement, investigations of such complaints and conditions by nongovernmental civil rights organizations, and reports to the public concerning substandard conditions of confinement issued by such organizations. On information and belief, the Defendants possess considerable records and data regarding substandard conditions of confinement at ECDC that have not been made available to the public. 7. In August and September of 2017, CREEC submitted to Defendants FOIA requests seeking agency records concerning conditions of confinement at ADF and ECDC of individuals detained pursuant to authority exercised by Defendants. CREEC seeks the requested agency records in order to inform public debate regarding conditions of confinement at ADF and ECDC, and accountability and oversight measures that may be needed to address substandard conditions of confinement. 8. Defendants have failed to comply with the statutory deadline for responding to CREEC’s requests pursuant to FOIA. 9. Defendants should not be permitted to ignore FOIA’s requirements. This Court should order Defendants to respond to CREEC’s FOIA requests and disclose the requested records. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 10. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331. 11.

CREEC is a non-profit organization that provides legal assistance, advocacy, and public education concerning actions, practices, and policies that abridge or threaten the civil rights of individuals in the United States. CREEC has formed an internal immigration detainee task force charged with investigating suspected substandard conditions of confinement of noncitizens who have become immigration detainees pursuant to authority exercised by Defendants and, where warranted and appropriate, to consider litigation to vindicate the rights of such individuals. CREEC’s work that is the subject of this action has been undertaken by its immigration detainee task force. 13. Disclosure of the requested records will shed light on Defendants and their subcontractors’ operations and activities related to the confinement of immigration detainees.

MILLER, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Assistant Director of Field Operations for Enforcement and Removal Operations, in his official capacity, 500 12th St., S.W., Washington, DC 20536, Defendants. Civil Action No. Class Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief CLASS COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs R.I.L.R., J.L.S., K.L.S., Z.M.R., J.L.P.M., W.M.C., C.M.A.C., and G.A.P.C., and the class they seek to represent, are all mothers and their children who have fled severe violence in their countries—predominantly Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador—in order to seek asylum in the United States. Each Plaintiff and similarly situated individual has been found by an immigration officer or immigration judge (“IJ”) to have a “credible fear” of persecution, meaning there is a “significant possibility” she or he will be granted asylum. Nonetheless, Plaintiffs and other members of the proposed class remain in detention pursuant to a Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) policy of locking them up and refusing to consider them for release on bond, recognizance, or other conditions (the “No-Release Policy”). DHS applies the No-Release Policy to Plaintiffs and those similarly situated not because they individually pose a danger to the community or flight risk that requires their detention, but in order to deter other Central American migrants from coming to the United States. 2. Immigration detention is civil; it is not intended as punishment. The purposes of immigration detention are to ensure that individuals appear for their removal proceedings (and for removal if it is ultimately ordered), and to protect the public from danger that might result from an individual’s release. Immigration detention is not designed to serve the goal of general deterrence, which is properly the function of the criminal justice system. 3. Prior to June 2014, DHS adhered to these traditional principles and generally did not detain families that arrived in the United States seeking asylum. In addition, it was DHS policy that individuals who, like Plaintiffs, passed a credible fear screening and were pursuing asylum claims before the immigration court, should generally be released from detention, as long as they could establish their identity and show that they were not a flight risk or danger to the community. 4. However, beginning in June 2014, faced with increased numbers of Central American migrants entering or seeking to enter the United States through the southwest border, DHS decided to start detaining families in large numbers. Thus, DHS has moved to expand its detention capacity from 96 beds to more than 3,000 beds, with plans for further expansion of the family detention system. 5. At the same time, DHS adopted a blanket No-Release Policy for Central American families in order to deter additional migrants from coming to the United States. Under this policy, even though Plaintiffs have all demonstrated a credible fear of persecution—entitling them to pursue their asylum claims before the immigration court—and even though they are eligible under the immigration laws to be considered for release on bond, recognizance, or other conditions, Defendants are refusing to consider them for release and instead ordering their continued detention. Defendants do so without making any individualized determination as to whether their detention is necessary to prevent flight or protect the community. 6. The clear consequence of DHS’s policy is that numerous individuals for whom detention serves no legitimate purpose are being deprived of their liberty. This detention in a prison-like setting exacerbates the trauma that Plaintiffs have already experienced in their countries of origin and during their flight to the United States. Indeed, mental health experts have condemned family detention because of the detrimental—and often permanent—effect it has on the psychological well-being of detained children. 7. The No-Release policy violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), applicable regulations, and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibit the blanket detention of asylum-seekers for purposes of general deterrence. It is also arbitrary and capricious.

U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Defendant. Civil Action No.: 1:17-cv-00708 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Introduction 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA” or “the Act”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, seeking unlawfully withheld agency records relating to actions taken by Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) to revoke, suspend, or terminate participation in the Global Entry System (“GES” or “Global Entry”) for certain Arab and Muslim U.S. Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (“LPRs”) without any legal justification. 2. Global Entry is a CBP trusted traveler program that allows expedited security clearance and admission for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival in the United States. Approved GES travelers enter the United States through automatic kiosks at select airports and are normally exempted from the normal interview process. 3. Shortly after the November 2016 presidential election, and accelerating significantly following the new administration’s rollout of its first attempt at a Muslim travel ban, Plaintiff American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Council (“ADC”) began receiving reports that Arabs and Muslims who were previously approved for GES had these approvals inexplicably revoked by CBP. 4. As documented by ADC, and subsequently, by several media outlets, these Global Entry revocations were not isolated incidents. Rather, they are part of a wider pattern in which GES-approved travelers with Arab or Muslim names or ancestry are singled out for revocation in absence of any material change in circumstance or security risk. 5. ADC documented cases of physicians, bankers, students, and businesspeople who are long-time GES participants and who saw their approvals inexplicably and simultaneously revoked. 6. This pattern corresponded with the unexplained, heightened scrutiny—and in many cases, abusive questioning by CBP officials—directed at Arab and Muslim travelers in the wake of the new administration’s Muslim travel bans. 7. In early March 2017, ADC filed FOIA requests with CBP seeking records maintained by the agency in relation to Global Entry revocations, suspensions, terminations, confirmations, and policy practices. Specifically, ADC sought: a. All agency records relating to each revocation, suspension, or termination of Global Entry System (GES) participation from November 9, 2016 to the date of the agency’s response to this request; b. All agency records showing the annual total of revocations, suspensions, or terminations of (GES) permissions between January 1, 2012 and November 8, 2016. c. All agency records showing reversal or confirmation of CBP’s GES revocation decisions by the CBP Ombudsman’s office; d. Any agency policy, practice, memorandum, training, guidance, communication, or other similar record created on or after November 9, 2017 relating to the suspension, revocation, or termination of GES; e. Any agency policy, practice, memorandum, training, communication or other similar record created on or after November 9, 2016 that alters, modifies, or in any way affects CBP’s prior practices and policies with respect to GES screening, investigation, or revocation; and f. Any agency records created on or after November 9, 2016 relating to operation or functioning of the GES program containing any of the following the words or phrases, whether in their singular or plural forms: “Muslim”, “Arab”, “Ban”, “Muslim Ban”, or “Travel Ban.” 8. ADC sought expedited processing of these requests, citing the urgent need to inform the public about CBP’s actions in suspending, revoking, or terminating GES authorization for Arabs and Muslims. 9. CBP has failed to disclose the requested agency records within the time period specified by Congress or offer any meaningful estimate of when these records will become available. 10. Accordingly, ADC seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under the Act to compel DHS to search for and produce the records requested. Jurisdiction and Venue 11. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B). Jurisdiction lies to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201-2202. Venue is proper under 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B) because ADC brings this action in the District of Columbia. Parties 12. Plaintiff ADC is a civil rights organization committed to defending the rights of people of Arab descent and promoting their rich cultural heritage.

On January 25, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing DHS to hire an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents “as soon as is practicable” and stating that OPM “shall take appropriate action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order.”1 In a separate Executive Order issued on the same date, President Trump directed DHS to hire an additional 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) officers.2 9. On February 20, 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly issued memoranda to CBP and ICE directing the agencies to begin the process of hiring 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents and 10,000 additional ICE officers3 – in effect, this was an order to increase the Border Patrol’s staff by 25% and to triple ICE’s workforce.4 To meet these hiring needs, Administration officials have suggested that they will seek to reduce what they view as overly restrictive hiring barriers, including with respect to polygraph examinations and background checks. 10.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Plaintiff Muslim Advocates brings this action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 et seq. for declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief to compel the disclosure and release of documents from Defendants U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) (collectively, “Defendants”). PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Muslim Advocates is a not-for-profit legal advocacy and educational organization. On January 11, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA Request (the “Request”) for materials related to denaturalization efforts by the federal government, including but not limited to “Operation Janus,” a joint initiative between DOJ and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), where federal agencies reviewed the files of naturalized citizens for the purpose of identifying misrepresentations in their naturalization applications that could render American citizens eligible for denaturalization. The Request was sent to the DOJ’s National Security Division (“NSD”), DOJ’s Civil Division (“Civil Division”), DHS, and DHS’s component agency, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). See Ex A. On January 25, 2018 DHS referred the Request to its component agency, ICE. On February 13, 2018, Muslim Advocates submitted a revised FOIA request to ICE after the agency requested clarification on the scope of the request (hereinafter, the “Second ICE Request”). See Ex. C. 2. As of this filing, Defendants have wholly failed to comply with their obligations under FOIA: Defendant DOJ wrongfully denied Plaintiff’s Request and has thereafter failed to adjudicate Plaintiff’s administrative appeal of the Civil Division’s denial within the time limit. Defendant ICE has outright refused to process either Muslim Advocates’ initial Request or the Second ICE Request and has likewise failed to respond to any appeals. To date, neither of the Defendants have produced a single document in response to Plaintiff’s FOIA requests. 1 3. The interests at stake in government transparency on the issue of denaturalization could not be more important. An aggressive pursuit of denaturalization by the federal government is unprecedented in recent history and has the potential to disrupt thousands of U.S. citizen lives and families.2 The documents and information Muslim Advocates seeks would help provide much- 1 Neither NSD nor USCIS are named in this action. NSD issued a final determination on Muslim Advocates’ request on July 6, 2018.

Plaintiff brings this action to compel Defendants to immediately process and release to Plaintiff all responsive records that they have unlawfully withheld. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This Court has original jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1346. This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction over this action and personal jurisdiction over all parties pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B). 6.

Second, the Rule violates 8 U.S.C. <unk>1225 by mandating a denial of a credible fear determination, even in situations where a noncitizen in expedited removal proceedings shows a significant possibility that she could establish eligibility for asylum. For this reason, the Rule is again contrary to law under the INA and the APA. 6. Third, the Rule violates The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 8 U.S.C. <unk>1158 (b)(3)(C), by denying unaccompanied children the opportunity to first present the substance of their claims for asylum in a non-adversarial proceeding before an asylum officer. 7. Fourth, by adopting, without notice and the opportunity to comment, an interim final rule depriving certain asylum seekers of the statutory protection outlined in the INA simply because they enter the country without inspection, the responsible government officials have acted in excess of their statutorily prescribed authority, contrary to law, and arbitrarily and capriciously, all in violation of the APA. 8. Fifth, the promulgation of the Rule was invalid because the current Acting Attorney General who putatively authorized promulgation of the Rule is ineligible to serve in that role under 28 U.S.C. <unk>508 and the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, art.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE UNDER PSEUDONYMS Petitioners in the above-captioned matter hereby respectfully request leave of Court to file this action under pseudonyms pursuant to the legal standards articulated in United States v. Microsoft Corp., 56 F. Petitioners are thirteen asylum-seeking transgender women who are being held at various immigration detention centers in the United States. Petitioners are detained in the legal custody of the Department of Homeland Security, which seeks to deport them. Most Petitioners are currently in the asylum process, yet each fears persecution, death or torture should they be returned to their countries of origin. RECEIVED Clerk, U.S. District Bankruptcy Court for the District of Columbia In the usual case, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a) requires that a complaint state all of the names of the parties Fed. R Civ P. 10(a); see Doe v. George Wash. Univ., 369 F. Supp. In I.A v. Barr, this Court recently granted plaintiff asylum seekers leave to proceed using pseudonyms No. 1:19-cv-2530, 2019 U.S Dist. LEXIS 142234 (D.D.C Aug. 21, 2019). In so holding, the Court found “[t]hese allegations are sensitive and highly personal in nature, and identifying the individuals making them could place them and their families at risk of further harm. The public’s interest in judicial transparency, though substantial, is outweighed by the acute privacy interests and safety concerns implicated here.” Id. at *8. The same reasoning applies here with additional force as Petitioners here have disclosed sensitive details of their medical histories and current medical treatments in connection with their claims. Petitioners easily meet the burden to demonstrate a legitimate basis for proceeding under pseudonym by demonstrating both that identification creates a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm, and that “anonymity is necessary to preserve privacy in matters of a sensitive and highly personal nature.” See Doe v. U.S. Dep’t of State, Civ. Action No. 1:15-01971, 2015 U.S Dist. LEXIS 173937, at *5-6 (D.D.C Nov. 3, 2015). Petitioners are transgender women seeking the protection of the United States from persecution and torture (in the form of asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture). The federal government protects the confidentiality of asylum-seekers by regulation. See 8 C.F.R. <unk>208.6. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Asylum Confidentiality Fact Sheet, attached as Exhibit A, the reason for that protection is as follows: Public disclosure of asylum-related information may subject the claimant to retaliatory measures by government authorities or non-state actors in the event that the claimant is repatriated, or endanger the security of the claimant’s family members who may still be residing in the country of origin. Moreover, public disclosure might, albeit in some limited circumstances, give rise to a plausible protection claim where one would not otherwise exist by bringing an otherwise ineligible claimant to the attention of the government authority or non-state actor against which the claimant has made allegations of mistreatment. Because refugee applicants face similar negative consequences when their information is disclosed to a third party, as a matter of policy, USCIS extends the same protections outlined in 8 C.F.R. <unk>208.6 to refugees. As such, revealing the names of the Petitioners will subject them to the prospect of serious retaliatory harm should Petitioners be subjected to removal from this country. They are persons who have left countries suffering tremendous violence, who are seeking protection in the United States. For example, one petitioner was terrorized by a gang and subjected to beatings and rape on multiple occasions. Another was detained and tortured for participating in a transgender rights group. Petitioners are immigrants from countries where their status as transgender women puts them at risk.

F Eden Prairie, MN 55347, on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated, PLAINTIFFS, v. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 1000 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC 20301, JAMES MATTIS, in his official capacity as Secretary of Defense of the United States Department of Defense 1000 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC 20301, DEFENDANTS. No. COMPLAINT AND PRAYER FOR DECLARATORY, PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, AND MANDAMUS RELIEF COMPLAINT 1. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and similarly-situated United States soldiers who are the victims of a misguided and unlawful attempt to deprive them of their right to seek United States citizenship. As non-citizen soldiers serving honorably during wartime, Plaintiffs have an absolute statutory right to apply to become naturalized U.S. citizens, but Defendants are refusing to certify their naturalization application eligibility as required by law, leaving these soldiers to languish in immigration limbo, notwithstanding their ongoing military service to this Nation. Defendants’ actions are contrary to law and lack the honor, loyalty, and respect that Defendants owe to these Plaintiff-soldiers. 2. Defendants recruited and enlisted each Plaintiff into the United States Army under the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (“MAVNI”) program, a program under which non-U.S. citizens with critical language and/or medical skills deemed by the Department of Defense (“DoD”) to be “vital to the national interest” serve in the United States Armed Forces. DoD recruits individuals into this “vital” program, in part, by promising enlistees a “fast track” to U.S. citizenship. 3. Each MAVNI Plaintiff here is serving in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve (“Selected Reserve”) and is entitled to apply for naturalization under federal law, including 8 U.S.C. <unk>1440. An initial step in the naturalization application process is the certification of Plaintiffs’ honorable service in the Selected Reserve. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), which is the federal agency responsible for processing and adjudicating all naturalization applications, requires these certifications to be made via DHS Form N-426, a form specifically designated for this purpose. Completing the N-426 certification is a ministerial task. The service member’s military branch simply indicates – by checking a box “yes” or “no” – whether the soldier (e.g., a Plaintiff or a Class member) is serving honorably based on the existing military record for that soldier. The military has performed this ministerial task thousands of times before without complication or ordeal, including approximately 500 times in recent months alone. 4. Due to their status as soldiers serving in the Selected Reserve, Plaintiffs and the Class satisfy the threshold legal condition necessary to obtain the Form N-426 certifications. The federal statute enabling naturalization for these soldiers, 8 U.S.C. <unk>1440, is clear and unambiguous: [a]ny person who, while an alien or a noncitizen national of the United States, has served honorably as a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve or in an active-duty status in the military, air, or naval forces of the United States... during any... period which the President by Executive order shall designate as a period in which Armed Forces of the United States are or were engaged in military operations involving armed conflict... may be naturalized as provided in this section.... 8 U.S.C. <unk>1440(a) (emphasis added). 5. Notwithstanding this express and well-established federal law, Defendants have implemented a new policy by which they are refusing to issue Form N-426s to Plaintiffs and other similarly-situated eligible soldiers on the grounds that the soldiers have not yet served in an active-duty status. Defendants’ policy of withholding issuance of N-426s has no lawful basis and contravenes their duty to act. And Defendants have implemented this policy in blatant disregard for the immense suffering and mounting harm that their actions have caused to soldiers under their command. 6. Defendants’ new policy of denying N-426 certifications to Plaintiffs and other Selected Reservists stands in stark contrast to the prior policy. Until recently – i.e., before DoD instituted this new policy and before it began otherwise interfering with the naturalization process for MAVNI applicants – soldiers in Plaintiffs’ position sought (and obtained) naturalization through a well-established and orderly process that was consistent with the law: STEP ONE: MAVNI soldiers obtained N-426 certifications of their honorable service from the military, STEP TWO: DHS expedited the naturalization paperwork, and STEP THREE: DHS adjudicated the applications using the same fundamental citizenship factors that apply to all persons seeking to","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2015 | U.S. Department of Defense | Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) ||| August 2016 ||| September 2017 ||| October 2018 ||| March 2019 ||| May 2019 | May 2020 ||| June 2020 | May 2021 | June 2021 | July 2020 | July 2021 | August 2020 | August 2021 | September 2020 | September 2021 | October 2020 | January 2020 | March 2020 | February 2020 | April 2020 | December 2020 | June 2019 | March 2021 | May 2022 | June 2022 | July 2022 | August 2022 | January 2021 | March 2022 | September 2022 | April 2021 | April 2022 | May 2020, June 2020, May 2020, May 2021, March 2020, April 2020, March 2020, and May 2020 [redacted] On September 2015, a group of non-citizen soldiers filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Homeland Security (DHS) were violating the Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by refusing to issue them Form N-426 certification of their honorable service in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve or an active-duty status in the military, air, or naval forces.

COMPLAINT 1. Plaintiffs are enlisted non-citizen United States Army soldiers who are serving honorably in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve (“Selected Reserve”). Defendants are depriving Plaintiffs of their lawful opportunity and right to become naturalized United States citizens. As set forth below, by virtue of their honorable service in the Selected Reserve, federal law, including 8 U.S.C. <unk>1440, specifies that each Plaintiff-soldier is entitled to prompt processing of his/her application to become a naturalized United States citizen. Yet, Defendants are not processing these naturalization applications as required by law. Instead, via improper inter-agency instructions and other unlawful means, Defendants are impeding and delaying the naturalization of these soldiers by imposing on them additional citizenship qualifications/criteria which have no lawful basis. And, by so doing, Defendants are acting unlawfully and depriving Plaintiffs of the valuable rights due to them under the law. Through this action, on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated United States soldiers, Plaintiffs seek injunctive, declaratory, and other relief from this Court in order to compel and enjoin Defendants as necessary to allow for the processing of Plaintiffs’ naturalization applications as required by law. 2. The United States recruited and enlisted each Plaintiff into the Armed Forces of the United States under the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (“MAVNI”) program, a program touted by Defendant United States Department of Defense (“DoD”) as “vital to the national interest,” under which certain non-U.S. citizens with critical language skills and/or specialized medical training enlist and serve in the United States Armed Forces. DoD recruits individuals into the MAVNI program by, among other things, representing that enlistees will be granted an “expedited” path to U.S. citizenship via naturalization. Indeed, DoD mandates – via written enlistment contracts – that Plaintiffs and other MAVNI recruits apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as the service branch (e.g., the Army) has certified their honorable service. 3. Each Plaintiff-soldier has kept his/her end of the bargain. Equipped with the specialized skills – such as medical training and foreign language capabilities – sought by military leaders to fill critical personnel needs, each Plaintiff (a) enlisted in the Army, (b) is serving honorably, and (c) has applied for naturalization with Defendant United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). As enlisted soldiers in the Selected Reserve, Plaintiffs are obliged to serve and proudly stand ready to be called to active duty in the service of this Nation at the direction of their military commanders. 4. However, in violation of federal law, including 8 U.S.C. <unk>1440, Defendants have reneged on the representations made to these soldiers and are failing to process their naturalization applications as the law requires. Thus, Defendants are blocking and delaying the valuable benefit afforded by law to these highly sought after military enlistees – namely, the prospect of expedited United States citizenship. 5. Among other actions, DoD improperly has instructed DHS and its component agency, Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), to place Plaintiffs’ naturalization applications on “hold” pending the successful completion of specialized background investigations done by the military for DoD purposes (and not required by the laws governing naturalization). There is no lawful basis for DoD’s instruction and interference, nor is there any legal basis for DHS","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2015 | U.S. Department of Homeland Security | United States Citizenship and Immigration Services | Department of Defense ||| September 2016 ||| July 2017 ||| August 2018 ||| December 2018 | ||| January 2019 ||| March 2019 | 2019 | .<n>On September 29, 2015, a group of enlisted non-citizens enlisted in the United States Army's Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve filed this class action lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Columbia.

INTRODUCTION 1. This case challenges the government’s unprecedented new system for restricting immigration along the Canadian and Mexican borders in the name of public health and under the purported authority of 42 U.S.C. <unk>265. This system is established in a set of agency documents— a new regulation, several orders, and an implementation memo—which Plaintiff collectively refers to as the “Title 42 Process.” 2. Among other things, the Title 42 Process authorizes the summary expulsion of unaccompanied minors without any procedural protections—even if the children show no signs of having COVID-19, and even if the children are fleeing danger and seeking protection in the United States. 3. Plaintiff P.J.E.S. is a 16-year-old boy from Guatemala who came to the United States unaccompanied. P.J.E.S. was forced to flee to the United States to escape severe persecution in Guatemala. His father currently lives in the United States and is awaiting immigration proceedings. After P.J.E.S. came to the United States, CBP apprehended him and subjected him to the Title 42 Process. He is currently in CBP custody in the McAllen, Texas, area 4. Prior to the Title 42 Process, and pursuant to longstanding immigration statutes protecting children and those seeking protection, Plaintiff should have been given shelter in a children’s facility until he could be released to his father or another suitable sponsor in the United States, and is entitled to a full hearing, and appeals, to determine his right to remain in the United States with his father. 5. Through the Title 42 Process, the Administration has sought to usurp Congress’s role and bypass the entire immigration statutory scheme. Specifically, the Administration contends that public health provisions in Title 42 of the U.S. Code—provisions that have rarely been used and never in this way—entitle it to set aside the immigration laws. 6. But those public health provisions do not authorize this unprecedented Title 42 Process. Title 42 authorizes various powers, such as testing and quarantines, but has never been interpreted to authorize the broad powers the government is claiming here. The statutes protecting children and those seeking protection were enacted after the Title 42 provisions and contain no exception for individuals with communicable diseases. 7. In fact, Congress has a long history of squarely addressing communicable diseases in the immigration laws. Under the specific immigration provisions enacted by Congress, if a border official suspects that an arriving noncitizen has a communicable disease deemed serious by the government, the official has numerous options, including testing and even quarantine. But unaccompanied children may under no circumstances be deported without a proper opportunity to determine their right to remain in the United States. The Administration’s use of Title 42 is a transparent end-run around Congress’s considered decision to provide protection to children and others","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] May 20, 2018 | U.S. District Court | District of Columbia ||| Title 42 Process ||| May 21, 2018 | ||||| May 31, 2018 ||| June 6, 2018 [Verse] On May 20, 2018, the ACLU of the United States filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of a 16-year-old boy from Guatemala who was detained by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) under Title 42 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1961 (INA) and the Health and Human Services (HHS) Act of 1986 (H&S) for the purpose of deporting him without due process.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and United States Constitution) i PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This case concerns the Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to abrogate the refugee protections codified in the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. <unk>1101 et seq., through agency rulemaking. 2. The Refugee Act of 1980 amended the INA to establish the contemporary asylum system in the United States. A landmark piece of legislation, it formalized the U.S. refugee admissions process and expressly aligned the U.S. asylum scheme with international law. The Act was drafted with bipartisan Congressional support in “an atmosphere of calm, compassionate, and careful deliberations.”1 It passed unanimously in the Senate and with strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. 3. By design, the Refugee Act codified the United States’ longstanding commitment to providing safe refuge for individuals fleeing persecution. Beyond offering asylum applicants protection from their persecutors, the Refugee Act also offers them a path to a new life and full integration into U.S. society, extending asylum status to the refugee’s spouse and children and allowing asylees to apply for permanent residence. 8 U.S.C. <unk>1158(b)(3), 1159. 4. The Trump Administration has made no secret that it seeks to make the United States inhospitable for refugees fleeing persecution, in direct contradiction to Congress’s intent in passing the Refugee Act, as well as to the Act’s plain language and international law. 5. President Trump has publicly and falsely called the asylum system “ridiculous,”2 1 Joint Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Immigration and Policy of the S Comm. on the Judiciary and Subcomm. on Immigration, Refugees and International Law of the S Comm. on the Judiciary, 97th Cong. 4 (1981) (statement of Hon.

People that look like they should be fighting for the UFC.”4 6. The Trump Administration has done all it can, and much it cannot legally do, to gut the rights of refugees seeking protection in the United States as codified in the INA. Given the foundational place the Refugee Act occupies in the U.S. immigration system, it is unsurprising that human rights groups and individuals seeking protection have challenged such actions in court. And courts have stayed and ultimately rejected the Administration’s unrelenting efforts to undermine the U.S. asylum system.5 7.

MICHAEL W. MEADE, et al., Respondents-Defendants. PETITIONERS EMERGENCY MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION FOR PROPOSED CLASS AND INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF LAW INTRODUCTION Petitioners-Plaintiffs are women and men detained by Respondents-Defendants in civil immigration detention at three Florida detention centers within the jurisdiction of the Miami Field Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). All Petitioners are at imminent risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) as a result of their inability to follow Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) guidelines and state and local directives due to their continued detention. This action challenges the refusal of Respondents to release Petitioners, and others in the class they represent, so that they can shelter in place, follow CDC guidelines, and reduce their likelihood of infection and illness. COVID-19 threatens every woman and man detained at Krome Service Processing Center (“Krome”), Glades County Detention Center (“Glades”), and Broward Transitional Center (“BTC”). A chart of the reported COVID-19 cases of people in ICE detention depicts an alarming steep curve. See Chart (Appx. I, Exh. 1); Declaration of Dr. Joseph Shin, MD, MSc dated April 13, 2020 (“Shin Dec.”) 39-41(Exh. 2); Declaration of Dr. Pedro J. Greer, Jr. (“Greer Dec.”) (Exh. 3). The spread of COVID-19 in ICE detention in Florida has been marked by secrecy and cover-up. As early as March 27, 2020, local attorneys have reported to their voluntary bar association that their “clients have indicated there are sick individuals in detention locally, quarantined individuals, and detainees wearing protective gear.” (Appx I, Exh. J, at 357-59, 357 1.). ICE, however, would not confirm any positive testing Id. On April 6, 2020, the Miami Herald broke the news that ICE did indeed have COVID-19 cases in Florida. ICE told the Herald that two officers working at Krome Service Processing Center in Miami had tested positive for COVID-19, and many others were awaiting results from their tests. (Appx I, Exh. C, at 33-38.) On that same day, ICE told the Herald that no detained individuals in Florida had tested positive. (Appx I, Exh. D, at 39-46, 40-41) (“For weeks—and as recently as Monday—US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has repeatedly told the Herald that no detainees in their custody in Florida have tested positive for the virus.”). ICE’s statement was false. On April 7, the Herald ran a second story explaining that a detained individual at Krome had tested positive. A federal official with first-hand knowledge told the Herald: “While that is true that no detainee currently at the detention center tested positive for COVID-19, it’s also not completely accurate as testing is not conducted on site and detainees are sent to an offsite hospital to be tested.” (Appx I, Exh. D, at 41.) ICE had also decided not to disclose whether third-party contractors test positive for COVID-19, providing them a “loophole” to reporting the actual number of COVID-19 cases among its employees in detention centers. Third-party contractors comprise a large portion of employees in detention centers. See Monique O. Madan, Two Workers at ICE Detention Center in Miami-Dade Test Positive for Coronavirus, Miami Herald (April 6, 2020).1 Each of the three detention centers either has confirmed cases of the virus or has groups of individuals herded together in “cohort quarantine” because they have been exposed. Rather than mitigate the risk of transmission, these cohort quarantines drastically increase the possibility of transmission, infection, and facility-wide outbreak by grouping together people who have already been exposed to the virus. See Shin Dec. 40 (Exh. 2) (“The analysis that I provide above regarding screening, ‘cohorting’ and social distancing is not theoretical. In fact, there are a growing number of facilities throughout the country where the rate of infection is growing exponentially amongst both people detained as well as staff. In these settings, hundreds, and 1 Available at: https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article241791511.html. potentially thousands of people will become infected, and many will die.”); Greer Dec. 30 (Exh. 3).

On March 28, 2013, the District Court (Judge Barker) ruled in favor of plaintiffs, granting their motion for summary judgment, and permanently enjoining defendants from enforcing Sections 18 and 20 of SEA 590.

On May 10, 2011, the Governor of the State of Indiana signed into law Senate Enrolled Act 590 (""SEA 590""), the relevant portions of which will be codified at Indiana Code <unk>34-28- 8.2-1, et seq. and Indiana Code <unk>35-33-1-1, et seq., effective July 1, 2011. The law allows state and local law enforcement officers to make warrantless arrests of a person who has ""a removal order issued for the person by an immigration court,"" or ""a detainer or notice of action issued"" for them, even though they have been lawfully released by federal immigration officials, and even though they have committed no crime. Additionally, the law expansively allows law enforcement officials to arrest anyone solely because he or she ""has been indicted or convicted of an aggravated felony, as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43),"" regardless of whether the person is a U.S. citizen, was never actually convicted of the offense, has been released on bail, or has already served the sentence tor the aggravated felony. Finally, the law makes it unlawful for foreign nationals in Indiana to offer their foreign government-issued consular identification card for identification purposes, and for any governmental or private entity to accept a consular identification card for identification purposes. 2. This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of a class of persons who have either ""a removal order issued for the person by an immigration court,"" or ""a detainer or notice of action issued"" for them, or who have ""been indicted for or convicted of one (1) or more aggravated felonies (as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43),"" even though they have been lawfully released by federal or state law enforcement officials. Insofar as SEA 590 authorizes state and local law enforcement officers to arrest persons without reasonable suspicion or probable cause of any unlawful conduct, much less criminal activity, it violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable seizures. SEA 590 also conflicts with and is preempted by the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. <unk>1101, et seq., which provides a comprehensive statutory framework for the regulation of immigration that among other things, contains detailed provisions governing the detention and release of non-citizens in removal proceedings. 3. This action also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of a class of persons who regularly use their consular identification cards for identification purposes, including, among other things, when banking or interacting with consular officials. When SEA 590 goes into effect July I, 2011, the class will no longer be able to use this method of identification without violating Indiana law, and their consular identification cards will become useless in the state of Indiana. SEA 590's prohibition on consular identification cards is directly preempted by federal regulations that authorize banks to accept foreign government-issued photo identification for verifying the identity of account holders. See 31 C.F.R. <unk>1020.220. The law is also preempted by the President's constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs insofar as state restrictions on the use of consular identification cards interferes with the United States carrying out certain treaty obligations with foreign countries and might result in foreign governments retaliating by imposing similar restrictions on U.S. nationals abroad. Finally, the prohibition on the use of consular identification cards violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because it is not rationally related to any legitimate governmental purpose.

TOMPKINS, Sheriff of Suffolk County, Respondents. Civ. No. PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS UNDER 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241 ORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTED INTRODUCTION 1. Petitioner Lilian Pahola Calderon Jimenez is in immigration detention—and faces the prospect of removal—because she was seized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while following the very instructions that the government gave her for seeking to stay in this country while applying to become a lawful permanent resident. On January 17, 2018, ICE abruptly detained Ms. Calderon after she and her U.S. citizen husband appeared for an interview at the offices of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Without this Court’s intervention, the government will continue to detain Ms. Calderon, and may undertake efforts remove her, in violation of federal law, federal regulations, and due process—and at great risk to her already-traumatized children. 2 Ms. Calderon is 30 years old and has lived in the United States since she was three. She has been subject to a final order of removal since her father’s asylum application was denied when she was 15. She is now married to a U.S. citizen and has two U.S. citizen children, ages four and one. 3. In 2016, new regulations created a streamlined process for certain individuals—who had unlawfully entered the country and were living with final orders of removal—to seek lawful permanent residency based on a family relationship to a United States citizen Ms. Calderon and her husband availed themselves of these regulations. In November 2016, they filed the immigration petition that constitutes the first step in this process. 4. To confirm their relationship, Ms. Calderon and her husband appeared for a USCIS interview on January 17, 2018. But after her interview, Petitioner was unexpectedly detained by ICE. Upon information and belief, ICE intends to remove Ms. Calderon based on her 2002 removal order. 5. This seizure occurred even though Ms. Calderon followed procedures that the government itself has prescribed for avoiding such a tragedy. In effect, the government’s left hand beckoned her forward, and its right hand grabbed her. 6 Ms. Calderon’s detention and intended removal violate and would violate the Immigration and Nationality Act and its regulations, the Administrative Procedures Act, and the U.S. Constitution’s due process guarantee. Unless habeas relief is granted, she faces removal to a country she does not know, and continued detention away from her U.S. citizen husband and children. PARTIES 7. Petitioner Lilian Pahola Calderon Jimenez was detained by ICE on January 17, 2018. She remains in immigration custody at the Suffolk County House of Correction in Boston, Massachusetts. 8. Respondent Kirstjen M. Nielsen is the Secretary of Homeland Security and is Petitioner’s ultimate legal custodian. She is sued in her official capacity. 9. Respondent Christopher Cronen is the Field Office Director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in ICE’s Boston Field Office. He is one of Petitioner’s legal custodians, and is sued in his official capacity. 10. Respondent Yolanda Smith is the Superintendent of the Suffolk County House of Correction and is Petitioner’s immediate custodian. She is sued in her official capacity. 11. Respondent Steven W.

This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241 (habeas corpus) and Article I, Section 9, Clause 2, of the United States Constitution (Suspension Clause). 13.

BRAZILIAN WORKER CENTER, CHELSEA COLLABORATIVE, INC. and CENTRO PRESENTE, Plaintiffs, v. DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States in his Official Capacity, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, UNITED STATES BUREAU OF THE CENSUS, STEVEN DILLINGHAM, Director of the U.S. Census Bureau in his Official Capacity, and WILBUR ROSS, Secretary of the Department of Commerce in His Official Capacity, Civil Action No. 20-11421 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Defendants INTRODUCTION 1. In an act of breathtaking unconstitutionality, Defendant Donald Trump seeks to undo over two hundred years of legal precedent by declaring that undocumented immigrants are not “persons” within the meaning of constitutional and statutory law. Plaintiffs urge this court to act immediately to prevent Defendant Donald Trump, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, the Department of Commerce, Director Steven Dillingham, and the Census Bureau from impeding the conduct of Census 2020 by, in violation of the United States Constitution and federal statutory law, excluding undocumented immigrants from the population data created for the purposes of congressional apportionment. Immediate intervention is necessary to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful conduct, which was intended to and has had the effect of chilling participation by immigrant communities and communities of color in Census 2020, which will in turn deprive these communities of the political representation and federal financial resources to which they are entitled. 2. On July 21, 2020, President Trump issued a Memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce titled “Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census” (hereinafter, the “July 21 Memorandum”) in which he: a) states that he has determined that “respect for the law and protection of the integrity of the democratic process warrant the exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base”; and b) directs the Secretary of Commerce to “take all appropriate action... to provide information permitting the President... to exercise the President’s direction to carry out the policy” of excluding undocumented individuals from the apportionment base. 3. This direction is patently and unquestionably illegal. The fourth sentence of the Constitution, Article I, Section 2, as amended by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, makes clear that congressional representatives are to be apportioned among the states according to their respective numbers, “counting the whole number of persons in each State.” U.S Const. Amend XIV. Undocumented immigrants are now and have always been persons as a matter of fact, law, and basic human decency. 4. Plaintiffs are membership-based, non-profit organizations that serve immigrants of color across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. They seek immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to ameliorate the immense harm provoked by the July 21 Memorandum. Issued in the midst of census-taking for Census 2020 and with a national census selfresponse rate at just barely over 60%, the July 21 Memorandum has instilled considerable fear and confusion in immigrant communities; it has already imperiled and threatens to further derail efforts by Plaintiffs to encourage households in hard-to-count communities to complete Census 2020. 5. In declaring that undocumented individuals will not be counted for the purposes of congressional apportionment—in the midst of Census 2020 operations—Defendants have ensured that immigrant communities will eschew completing Census 2020, thereby depriving residents of those communities of both political representation and billions of dollars in census-linked funds and programs. 6. Without immediate action from this Court, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm to their memberships and organizational interests. Their advocacy on behalf of Census 2020, which is currently ongoing, will be entirely undermined. Without an injunction from this Court, immigrants of color, non-citizens, foreign-born citizens and undocumented residents will refrain from completing Census 2020, in recognition of Defendants’ open, unambiguous, and public declaration that undocumented individuals are not persons. 7. The July 21 Memorandum is also motivated by a racially discriminatory scheme to reduce the political representation of communities of color and increase the overrepresentation of white voters. By complying with the July 21 Memorandum and producing population tabulations excluding undocumented individuals for congressional apportionment, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Director Steven Dillingham, the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce (together, the “Agency Defendants”) will deny immigrants of color, foreign-born residents, undocumented residents, and non- citizens the political representation and census-linked federal funding to which they are entitled, on the basis of their race and national origin. 8. The Court should enjoin compliance with the July 21 Memorandum as violative of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) for multiple reasons. First, the July 21 Memorandum instructs the Secretary of Commerce to perform an unconstitutional task contrary to law: to exclude undocumented immigrants from the congressional apportionment base, in violation of Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, as amended by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. In addition and in the alternative, compliance with the July 21 Memorandum is intended to and will discriminate against immigrants of color, non-citizen","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] July 21, 2020 | U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ||| Census 2020 ||| Donald Trump, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Department of Commerce, Director Steven Dillingham, and the Census Bureau .<n>On July 21, 2020, a group of non-profit organizations filed a lawsuit in the United States district court for the district of Massachusetts, alleging that President Donald Trump's decision to exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 Census was in violation of the Constitution and federal statutory law.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY; ELAINE COSTANZO DUKE, in her official capacity; and KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, in her official capacity, Defendants. Civil Action No. 18 Civ. 239 COMPLAINT PRELIMINARY STATEMENT The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (“NAACP” or “Plaintiff”) brings this action against the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”); Elaine C. Duke (“Defendant Duke”) in her official capacity as former Acting DHS Secretary; and Kirstjen Nielsen (“Defendant Nielsen”) in her official capacity as the current DHS Secretary. Plaintiff seeks to enjoin DHS’s November 2017 decision to rescind Temporary Protective Status (“TPS”) for Haitian immigrants, as it reflects an egregious departure from the TPS statute’s requirements and an intent to discriminate on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by one of the deadliest earthquakes in modern history. It killed hundreds of thousands of Haitians, left millions homeless, and nearly destroyed Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital. Haiti’s extensive recovery efforts have been hobbled by two additional large-scale catastrophes: the outbreak of cholera in October 2010 and a Category 4 hurricane in October 2016. Each exacerbated the dire situation created by the 2010 earthquake. These extraordinary circumstances led to Haiti’s 2010 TPS designation and to DHS’s repeated extension of that designation over the last seven years. TPS allowed eligible Haitians to remain in the United States without fear of deportation and to obtain work authorization. Nevertheless, despite persistent food insecurity, a housing shortage, and a cholera epidemic, and despite a formal extension request from the Haitian government and various American officials from across the political spectrum, DHS terminated TPS for Haitians in November 2017, with a delayed effective date of July 22, 2019. As such, an estimated 58,000 Haitians with TPS may face deportation to a country that is ill-prepared to receive them. The Haitian community is alarmed by the termination of TPS. As Marleine Bastien, a South Florida Haitian activist explained, “Haiti is not ready to absorb 58,000. It’s going to be a disaster for the 58,000 families in the U.S. and a disaster for Haiti.”1 U.S. Senator Bill Nelson echoed that sentiment when he tweeted, “There is no reason to send 60,000 Haitians back to a country that cannot provide for them.”2 DHS stated that the rescission decision followed an objective review of the conditions that supported the original designation. For the reasons detailed below, DHS’s explanation is demonstrably spurious. Instead, DHS’s true motive for terminating TPS for Haitians reflects racial discrimination. In early 2017, DHS officials searched for evidence that Haitians in the United States were criminals and receiving public assistance. Those efforts were grounded in longstanding and particularly noxious anti-Black stereotypes. In fact, of the approximately 58,000 1 Jacqueline Charles Patricia Mazzei, Haitian quake victims in the U.S. will lose deportation protection in 2019, Miami Herald (Nov. 21, 2107 6:14 A.M.), http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nationworld/world/americas/haiti/article185716193.html. 2 Sen. Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson), Twitter (Jan. 24, 2018 6:20 A.M.), https://twitter.com/SenBillNelson. Haitian TPS recipients, 6,200 are part of a household with a mortgage. Their median household income is $45,000. Their labor force participation rate is 81 percent (the labor force participation rate for the total U.S. population is 63 percent). Ninety-six percent speak at least a little English and 75 percent speak English well, very well, or only English. Seventy-one percent have completed high school or more and 37 percent have some college or a college degree.3 Unable to find evidence to support their discriminatory stereotypes, DHS’s Acting Secretary ultimately offered rationales for rescinding TPS that failed to acknowledge—much less address—the ongoing conditions in Haiti that warranted extending that status. DHS’s actions are consistent with the Trump Administration’s (the “Administration”) larger, racialized goals concerning immigration. President Trump has long made clear his antipathy towards Latin American and Black immigrants, and his preference for white immigrants. In June 2017, upon learning that 15,000 Haitians and 40,000 Nigerians had received visas to enter the United States, the President reportedly exclaimed that Haitians “all have AIDS,” and that, upon seeing the United States, Nigerians would never return to their “huts” in Africa. On January 11, 2018, during a meeting on immigration with several U.S. Senators, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, and Defendant Nielsen, the President stated that he did not want immigrants from African countries, which he derided as “shithole countries.” The President also asked, “Why do we need","<pad>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in November 2017. The suit seeks to enjoin DHS's decision to rescind Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for Haitian immigrants, as it reflects an egregious departure from the TPS statute's requirements and an intent to discriminate on the basis of race and/or ethnicity. According to the suit, the Haitian community is alarmed by the termination of TPS for Haitians. The suit alleges that DHS officials searched for evidence that Haitians were criminals and receiving public assistance, and that the decision was based on noxious anti-Black stereotypes. The complaint also alleges that the Department of Justice (DOJ) violated the Constitution's due process and equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to comply with the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment.

Today’s global pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, has been characterized as the worst the world has seen since 1918. Several states and countries around the world—including the State of Maryland—have put in place significant restrictions on public gatherings, and many have imposed “shelter-in-place” orders in an attempt to control the spread of the disease. Public health experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), have instructed that the only effective way to reduce the risk of severe illness or death for vulnerable individuals is social distancing and improved hygiene. Such distancing and hygiene measures are impossible to achieve in crowded detention centers. For this reason, more than 3,000 medical health professionals have urgently requested that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) immediately release immigration detainees in their custody, and two doctors who are medical experts for the Department of Homeland Security have sent a warning to Congress that keeping immigration detainees detained poses “an imminent risk to the health and safety of immigration detainees” and to the general public.1 2. The coronavirus has already begun to spread to immigration detention facilities, including in Maryland. There is currently a quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure in the Worcester County Detention Center. Yet Respondents-Defendants (“Defendants”) continue to hold in detention thousands of individuals, including those at severe risk of serious illness or death if they were to contract COVID-19, despite the ready 1 Catherine E. Shoichet, Doctors warn of 'tinderbox scenario' if coronavirus spreads in ICE detention, CNN (Mar. 20, 2020), available at https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/20/health/doctors-ice-detentioncoronavirus/index.html. availability of community-based alternatives to detention such as release on conditions or on bond. 3. To date, nearly 350,000 individuals worldwide have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and the United States is one of the worst hit countries. Many more are likely infected, especially in the United States where testing for the virus has been extremely limited. Confirmed cases have begun to appear in several detention centers across the country,2 including at the Worcester County Detention Center, and it is likely that many more detention centers have unconfirmed COVID-19 cases. It is impossible for people confined in prisons, jails, and detention centers to engage in the necessary social distancing and hygiene because people eat, sleep, and engage in activities in close proximity to each other, and basic supplies such as soap and hand sanitizer are often in short supply or completely unavailable at those facilities.3 Even with the measures ICE has purported to take to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in its facilities, immigration detention centers are a hotbed for spread of the virus. 4. Under these circumstances, release is the only meaningful way to mitigate the spread of the virus among immigration detainees.

This case presents a request for immediate relief on behalf of seven PetitionerPlaintiffs (“Plaintiffs”), who are highly vulnerable to serious injury and death if they contract COVID-19, the lethal disease that is sweeping the globe. Respondent-Defendants (“Defendants”) are holding Plaintiffs in Adams County Detention Center (“Adams”), a civil immigration detention facility in Natchez, Mississippi. The coronavirus feeds on precisely the unsafe, congregate conditions in which Plaintiffs are being held, putting Plaintiffs at imminent risk of contracting the lethal COVID-19 disease. 2. The risks and consequences of COVID-19 cannot be overstated. COVID-19 has reached global pandemic status. As of April 12, 2020, nearly 1.7 million individuals worldwide have confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 individuals worldwide have died.1 Those numbers are growing exponentially, with more than 85,000 new cases worldwide in a 24hour period between April 11 and April 12 alone.2 In the United States, more than 579,000 have confirmed cases, and more than 22,000 have died.3 By the time the Court reads this complaint, there will be more diagnoses, and more death, with no end in sight. 3. As of April 15, 2020, there were 3360 COVID-19 cases in Mississippi and, according to ICE, 5 known positive cases within Adams.

This is a class action to enforce the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and Article II, <unk>4 and 11 of the Montana Constitution. Plaintiffs seek prospective declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants Colonel Tom Butler, sued in his official capacity as acting Chief Administrator of the Montana Highway Patrol, and Attorney General Tim Fox, sued in his official capacity as head of the Montana Department of Justice (collectively, ""Defendants""). 2. As described below, Defendants have implemented a custom, policy and practice of seizing Latino residents and visitors of Montana and prolonging their detention longer than necessary to resolve the alleged violations of the law that Defendants have authority to enforce. The sole purpose of prolonging these individuals' detention is to hold them as Defendants contact agencies within the Department of Homeland Security (""DHS""), including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (""ICE"") and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (""CBP""), based on suspicions of civil immigration status violations. 3. Montana Highway Patrol has a custom, pattern, policy, and practice of seizing drivers and passengers it suspects of being in the country without authorization for a prolonged period, often between forty minutes to two hours, while attempting to make contact with DHS to ascertain their immigration status and determine if an immigration enforcement officer wishes to assume custody of them. These drivers and passengers are seized, at least initially, upon the prerogative of the Montana Highway Patrol and not at the direction ofDHS. 4. After Montana Highway Patrol officers detain individuals they suspect of immigration status violations for a prolonged period of time, DHS officers may or may not instruct patrol officers that they wish to assume custody of the individuals. However, Montana Highway Patrol's custom, policy, and practice is to seize an individual before DHS officers provide any instructions. 5. The Montana Highway Patrol has no statutory, constitutional, or inherent authority to arrest or detain people for civil violations of federal immigration law. 6. On information and belief, this custom, policy and practice is implemented in a discriminatory manner, as patrol officers use race and ethnicity as a motivating factor in forming a suspicion that a person is in the United States without valid immigration status. This policy disparately impacts Latinos who reside in, or are passing through, Montana. 7. The inferences that the Montana Highway Patrol uses to form a suspicion that a person is here without valid immigration status are based heavily on race. For example, the Montana Highway Patrol has attempted to justify this policy and practice based on observation of ""inconsistencies"" in vehicle registration or msurance documents. However, white, non-Latino individuals with vehicle registration inconsistencies are not detained solely to contact DHS to confirm their immigration status, while Latino residents and visitors to Montana are. 8. On information and belief, the Montana Highway Patrol has also attempted to justify this policy and practice based on the pretense of needing a Spanishspeaking interpreter, and detaining Latino residents and visitors to utilize CBP for interpretation services. In the course of providing these ""services,"" Montana Highway Patrol prolongs the detention of these Latino residents and visitors while CBP attempts to ascertain their immigration status. 9. These activities have been occurring with great frequency for at least three years. As described below, at least two former Chief Administrators of the Montana Highway Patrol with final decision-making control over the Montana Highway Patrol's customs, policies, and practices have explicitly sanctioned this unlawful activity. 10. Defendants have admitted in a collateral proceeding that the recentlyretired Chief Administrator, Colonel Kenton Hickethier, ordered patrol officers ""to arrest suspects [they] believed might be illegally in the country regardless of whether the facts supported an offense for which a person could be arrested under Montana law. His instructions were to get them to jail one way or another so Federal authorities could place detainers on them.""

Document 1 S PREUMINARY STATEMENT 1. This lawsuit is being brought by men and women who fled from political persecution and violence in their countries only to encounter cruel and abusive treatment at the hands of the United States government and its agents. These men and women applied for political asylum in the United States, pursuant to this country's laws. Instead of fmding a safe haven here, they were subjected to unremitting physical and psychological abuse, including beatings, sexual abuse, and racial hatred, at the hands of Defendant Immigration and Naturalization Service (""I.N.S."") and its agents. 2. Defendant ]I.N.5. warehoused these men and women in a detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Pursuant to a multimillion-dollar contract (hereinafter the ""Contract""), this facility was run by Defendant Esmor Correctional Services, Inc. (""Esmor Corporation""), a private prison corporation. At this detention center (hereinafter ""Esmor Elizabeth"") Plaintiffs were served food that was not fit for human consumption, and were given dirty and ill-fitting clothing, including underwear that contained vestiges of human waste. In the ""dorm rooms"" where these men and women slept, dinirg tables and beds were inches away from filthy toilets and showers. The cruelty inflicted on these men and women lasted 24 hours a day. Guards who worked at Esmor Elizabeth would not let the men and women sleep. Overhead bright fluorescent lights were kept on night and day. The guards also blared music and television programs and held loud parties throughout the night. The guards would deliberately wake the men and women up as they nodded off to sleep and would conduct head counts during the night to taunt the asylees. Document 1 . Filed 06/16/1997 3. When the men and women asked for supplies to clean their clothes or the dorms, or complained about not being able to sleep, or not being able to practice their religious rituals, they were thrown into ""segregation"" tiny solitary confinement rooms where they were shackled, often to their beds, and deprived of access to sunlight and exercise. 4. The men and women complained about these abusive conditions to officials of Defendant I.N.S. stationed at Esmor Elizabeth and Esmor Corporation supervisors. They took no action to correct these abuses.

This class action seeks declaratory, injunctive and other relief to redress Defendants’ reckless deprivation of Plaintiffs’ rights arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States. This action arises out of a pattern and practice of harassment, intimidation and unlawful arrest by Defendants of persons of Latino origin in the New York City and surrounding suburban areas. As described in detail below, Defendants’ wrongful actions include, inter alia, unreasonable and unlawful entries into the homes of Plaintiffs and other Latinos in the New York area in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, unlawful detainment, psychological and physical abuse, and the destruction of private, personal property. 2. In 2006, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Division of the Department of Homeland Security (commonly known as “ICE”) initiated a program titled “Operation Return to Sender.” Under this program, Defendants conducted and have continued to conduct unconstitutional and abusive raids of homes occupied by persons of Latino origin in New York City and the surrounding areas, including the homes of the named Plaintiffs. 3. The raids are ostensibly performed to arrest and remove fugitive aliens, i.e., immigrants who have been previously ordered to leave this country. However, the raids are performed in a manner that tramples on Fourth Amendment rights and leaves a trail of harm affecting innocent members of our society, including U.S. citizens and/or persons who have been granted permanent residency in the United States, and/or other lawful immigration status. 4. The modus operandi of “Operation Return to Sender” is to have teams of six to ten armed ICE agents raid homes of Latinos without court-issued search warrants and to do so in a manner that will obtain entry to the targeted homes without providing the occupants an opportunity to consent or refuse entry. 5. The raids are conducted late at night or in the pre-dawn hours. Though the agents know the occupants are likely to be Spanish-speaking, ICE does not ensure that Spanishspeaking agents are present. Acting in a manner that terrifies sleeping residents, ICE agents pound on and/or break down doors and windows while screaming as loudly as possible, often representing themselves as “police,” which of course they are not. When the unsuspecting residents have the opportunity to open the door to inquire about what is going on, the agents then bully or force their way into homes without first obtaining the occupants’ consent to entry. 6. Without explanation or lawful justification, the agents immediately sweep through the home, searching the premises as if an armed fugitive were present, even though they have no reasonable basis for such belief. All of these actions are conducted without good cause in a manner highly abusive and psychologically harmful to both the adults and children present. 7. Moreover, despite the inherently intrusive nature of these raids, the agents do not conduct an investigation prior to the raid to ensure that the fugitive alien they might be seeking is in fact inside the target home. As a result, the agents regularly raid homes where the fugitive is not present and could not reasonably have been believed to be present. Instead, the unstated goal of these raids is to gain access to constitutionally protected areas in the hope of seizing as many undocumented persons as possible. In this manner, the agents try to meet the increased arrest quotas recently imposed upon them by their superiors at ICE. 8. While ICE has been aggressively increasing the number of raids performed, ICE has not kept pace in providing adequate training to its agents to protect the constitutional rights of persons affected by ICE’s actions. 9. ICE has similarly failed to promulgate adequate rules and procedures for conducting these raids within permissible constitutional",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2015 | Southern District of New York | Immigration and Customs Enforcement | Office of Detention and Removal Operations | Department of Homeland Security | | | Class Action ||| 2006 ||| 2011 ||| 2012 ||| 2013 ||| 2014 ||| 2015 ||| 2016 ||| 2017 ||| 2018 |||</s>

MUKASEY, in his official capacity as Attorney General of the United States, and ROBERT S. MUELLER, III, in his official capacity as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 08 Civ. (ECF CASE) COMPLAINT PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. The United States government is failing to fulfill one of its core responsibilities: adjudicating applications for citizenship in a timely manner. Hundreds of thousands of naturalization applicants are waiting far longer than the law permits, many of them for as many as two to three years. This failure imposes severe hardships and irreparable harm on the applicants who are forced to wait. They cannot vote. They are deemed ineligible for numerous important benefits and jobs. They cannot sponsor their immediate relatives for citizenship. They cannot travel freely. 2. Named Plaintiffs, all lawful residents in the United States for the past five to twenty-five years, have submitted complete applications for naturalization that have not been adjudicated within a reasonable time. Some have been waiting for more than three years for a decision, despite repeated requests for adjudication. All of them have suffered egregious harm as a result of the delay. For example, OMAR MIGUEL FARFAN, a decorated veteran of the United States Navy, cannot get a United States Government job because he is not a citizen. He has already waited over three years. MANUEL ALBERTO MARTINEZ, who has waited over two years, is unable to apply for a visa for his elderly mother to leave Mexico and join him in the United States. 3. With the presidential election less than nine months away, these delays take on particular significance, as hundreds of thousands of applicants, many of them Latino, could wrongfully be denied the ability to vote and participate in determining the future of their country. During this time of widespread anti-immigrant and anti-Latino sentiment, Latinos across the country have sought citizenship, in part, so as to be able to vote in this year’s elections. They are being denied this opportunity because of Defendants’ delays. 4. Plaintiffs bring this class action on behalf of themselves and a proposed class of similarly situated lawful permanent residents residing in the counties served by the New York City District Office of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (hereinafter “USCIS”), who have submitted or will submit applications to be naturalized as United States citizens, and whose applications have not been or will not be adjudicated within 180 days of the date of submission, and on behalf of a sub-class composed of those members of the class who reside in the Southern District of New York and whose applications have not been or will not be adjudicated within 120 days of the date of their initial examinations. 5.

The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and LatinoJustice PRLDEF, sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees and costs, claiming that the defendants, through the passage of an ordinance prohibiting the solicitation of labor from the town's streets and sidewalks, unlawfully prohibited speech related to employment and had a discriminatory animus against predominately Latino immigrant day laborers. After defeating the defendant's partial motion for summary judgment due to lack of standing, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was successful. On September 3, 2015, the District Court enjoined the ordinance and declared it unconstitutional as it violated the first amendment.

","1 0 UNlTED STATES DISTCrVOu;'T EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK rq r<unk>LONG ISLAND OFFICE Plaintiffs, (£:J/ COMPLAINT -versus- TOWN OF OYSTER BAY; JOHN VENDITTO, Town Supervisor of the Town of Oyster Bay, PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This is a civil rights action about the ability of predominantly Latino, immigrant day laborers to exercise their right to solicit work on the streets and sidewalks of their towns and villages without fear of being targeted because of their race and national origin. Plaintiffs represent residents of the Town of Oyster Bay who for years have successfully obtained temporary jobs by standing on local street corners and soliciting work from homeowners, contractors and other employers who pick them up and take them to job sites. These residents' ability to seek work has been significantly curtailed by the recent passage of Chapter 205.32 of the Code of the Town of Oyster Bay (the ""Ordinance""), which unlawfully prohibits speech related to employment and was enacted specifically in response to and as a result of discriminatory community animus regarding this group of workers, 2. While the purported purpose of the Ordinance is to address traffic and pedestrian safety, it does nothing to accomplish that goal. Instead, it sweeps in a wide variety of speech that has no adverse impact on traffic and pedestrian safety, fails to regulate speech that is indistinguishable from prohibited speech except in terms of the content of its communicative message, and is superfluous because the Town of Oyster Bay and the State of New York already have a range of laws and regulations in place to ensure traffic and pedestrian safety. 3. The reason for the poor fit between the Ordinance and its purported safety purpose is that, upon information and belief, such concerns did not motivate its passage. Rather, upon information and belief, the Ordinance was passed to prevent a group of predominantly Latino, immigrant day laborers from soliciting work in Oyster Bay so as to drive them out of their communities and out of the sight of residents who wish they were not there. 4. In pursuit of this true goal, the Ordinance reaches so far as to prohibit individuals and groups from engaging in general speech and advocacy intended to promote the security of employment. 5. Since the passage of the Ordinance, the day laborers that Plaintiffs represent have had great difficulty obtaining work. The Town has clearly signaled its intent to enforce the Ordinance by, among other things, posting warning signs, stationing law enforcement officials in areas where the day laborers have traditionally sought work, and threatening day laborers and their prospective employers. As a result, an entire community has lost its ability to earn a living wage. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331, 1343(a)(3-4). 8. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) in that Plaintiffs' claims arise in the Eastern District of New York. PARTIES 9. Plaintiff CENTRO DE LA COMUNIDAD HISPANA DE LOCUST VALLEY (""Centro"") is an unincorporated membership organization located in Locust Valley, New York. Its membership consists primarily of day laborers and their families who live and work in the Town of Oyster Bay and in particular in Locust Valley. The mission of Centro is to promote the right to work with dignity, respect and justice for the Locust Valley community. In particular, Centro's mission is to provide educational courses aimed at enhancing day laborers' professional and language skills and thus their ability obtain work, to operate as a gathering place for day laborers to exchange ideas and come together as a community, and to engage in community political advocacy intended to secure employment and the employment-related rights of day laborers. 10. Plaintiff THE WORKPLACE PROJECT is an incorporated membership organization located in Hempstead, New York. Its membership is made up in part of Latino immigrant workers who live in Nassau County, Long Island and in particular in the Town of Oyster Bay. Its members fmance the Workplace Project's activities, and elect and serve as its leadership. The mission of the Workplace Project is to end the exploitation of Latino immigrant workers on Long Island and achieve socioeconomic justice for its members in the communities in which they live. One of its core projects is a day labor organizing project, through which members push for government policies that respect the rights of day laborers to seek work in peace. The Workplace Project also engages in political advocacy that is intended to secure employment and the employmentrelated rights of day laborers. 11.

The government has similarly failed to disclose information concerning the physical characteristics of its detention facilities; the timing and scheduling of credible fear interviews at Artesia; the resources available to individuals in detention to understand their rights in the expedited removal process, access documents, and obtain and communicate with counsel; and access to detained persons by non-government organizations (""NGOs"") offering to provide pro Bono legal assistance.

The states sought to enjoin the federal government from carrying out portions of the DHS memorandum and from using information about DACA grantees gathered in their applications to enforce immigration policy. While the district court granted in part the government’s motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction. On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that DHS's decision to rescind DACA was subject to judicial review under the APA and that the rescission was unlawful. Shortly thereafter, the Acting DHS Secretary issued a memorandum suspending DACA while DHS reviewed it. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that the Acting Secretary lacked the authority to issue the memorandum because he had not been lawfully appointed to his position. The district court agreed. Accordingly, the court vacated the memorandum and ordered DHS to resume processing DACA applications. This case is ongoing.

DONALD TRUMP, in his official capacity as President of the United States; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY; ELAINE C. DUKE, in her official capacity; U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES; U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT; and the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Defendants. INTRODUCTION 1. The States of New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Connecticut, Delaware, District Of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia (the “States”) bring this action to protect the States— including their residents, employers, regulatory systems, and educational institutions—against the illegal actions of the President and the federal government. On September 5, 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) issued a Memorandum (the “DHS Memorandum”) ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”), a program that has protected from deportation approximately 800,000 young people who grew up in this country, most of whom have known no home other than the United States. Pursuant to the DHS Memorandum, the federal government will only issue renewals for grantees whose terms expire before March 5, 2018, provided they apply for renewal by October 5, 2018. DHS will immediately cease accepting new applications under DACA. 2. Since 2012, DACA has allowed hundreds of thousands of young people to live, study, and work in the United States, and to become stable and even more productive members of their communities, without fear that they could be arrested and placed in deportation proceedings at any moment. Throughout the country, DACA grantees are employed by various companies and State and municipal agencies, which benefit from their skills and productivity. DACA grantees also contribute significantly to State and local revenues and tax bases. DACA recipients will also lose their eligibility for public and employer-based health insurance programs that reduce the States’ health expenditures and promote public health. They also will lose their right to enroll in higher education institutions with in-state admissions preferences and tuition; thus, public universities will be deprived of a means by which they enrich the experience of all students and faculty through diversity and new perspectives. 3. More than 78 percent of DACA grantees are of Mexican origin, See Ex. 1 (USCIS, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Fiscal Years 2012-2017, June 8, 2017), which is more than double the percentage of people of Mexican origin that comprise of the overall foreign-born population (29 percent) of the United States. See Ex. 2 (U.S. Census Bureau, The Foreign-Born Population in the United States). 4. Ending DACA, whose participants are mostly of Mexican origin, is a culmination of President’s Trump’s oft-stated commitments—whether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination thereof—to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots. The consequence of the President’s animus-driven decision is that approximately 800,000 persons who have availed themselves of the program will ultimately lose its protections, and will be exposed to removal when their authorizations expire and they cannot seek renewal. The individuals who have relied on DACA are now more vulnerable to removal than before the program was initiated, as they turned over sensitive information to the federal government in their applications. Despite the federal government’s repeated promises that it would not use such information to conduct enforcement measures, the DHS Memorandum does not explain how the government will keep that information secure, nor does it provide any assurances that immigration enforcement agents will not use such information to find and remove those who applied for DACA. 5. Rescinding DACA will cause harm to hundreds of thousands of the States’ residents, injure State-run colleges and universities, upset the States’ workplaces, damage the States’ economies, hurt State-based companies, and disrupt the States’ statutory and regulatory interests. The States respectfully request that this Court invalidate the portions of the DHS Memorandum challenged here. Further, the States ask that the Court enjoin the federal government from using data gathered for the DACA program in immigration enforcement. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6.

","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK STATES OF NEW YORK, CONNECTICUT, NEW JERSEY, and WASHINGTON, and COMMONWEALTHS OF MASSACHUSETTS and VIRGINIA, Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE; and JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS III, in his official capacity as Attorney General of the United States, Defendants. CIVIL ACTION NO. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. In our federal system, States have primary responsibility for the design of law enforcement policies to keep our communities safe and promote trust between law enforcement agencies and the residents they serve. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (“Byrne JAG”) program is a mandatory formula grant that Congress created to provide States with a reliable source of funding to promote public safety while maximizing their discretion to tailor their law enforcement efforts to local needs. Congress has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars in annual grant funds to that end. Contrary to this congressional intent, however, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has now decided to coerce States and localities into enforcing the federal government’s civil immigration priorities by conditioning Byrne JAG funding on compliance with immigration-related conditions that have nothing to do with the program’s purpose. Plaintiffs—the States of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Washington and the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Virginia (“the States”)—challenge these unconstitutional and illegal conditions, and seek declaratory and injunctive relief to protect their ability to pursue their own law enforcement prerogatives in the manner that best achieves the safety and security of their communities. 2. The Byrne JAG program is the primary source of federal criminal justice funding for States and localities and is designed to “give state and local governments more flexibility to spend money for programs that work for them rather than to impose a ‘one size fits all’ solution.” H.R Rep No. 109-233, at 89 (2005). Byrne JAG funds have been used to support a diverse array of programs tailored to local law enforcement needs, including initiatives to combat gun violence, reduce violent crime, provide substance abuse services, support diversion and re-entry programs, improve criminal records systems, fight organized crime, prevent sexual abuse, and fund domestic violence legal advocacy. 3. On July 25, 2017, DOJ announced that it was imposing three immigration-related conditions on Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2017 Byrne JAG funds. The conditions require States and localities to (1) provide access to their correctional facilities for federal immigration enforcement agents (the “access condition”); (2) provide advance notice—i.e., as early as practicable upon request—to federal immigration authorities before an individual’s scheduled release from custody (the “notice condition”); and (3) accept various conditions relating to 8 U.S.C. <unk>1373, which prohibits States and localities from restricting their officials from communicating with federal immigration authorities “regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual” (collectively, the “Section 1373 conditions”). In addition, States are required to monitor their subgrantees to ensure their compliance with the notice and access conditions, and report to DOJ if they believe that a subgrantee has violated Section 1373. 4. DOJ’s decision to impose these sweeping conditions on Byrne JAG grantees represents an unlawful, ultra vires attempt to force States and localities to forsake their own policy judgments and aid in federal civil immigration enforcement. Nothing in the Byrne JAG statute “grant[s] the Attorney General the authority to impose conditions that require states or local governments to assist in immigration enforcement, nor to deny funds to states or local governments for their failure to comply with those conditions.” City of Chicago v. Sessions, 888 F.3d 272, 283 (7th Cir. 2018). 5. DOJ has thus forced the States into an untenable position: accept unlawful and unconstitutional conditions that diminish our sovereign ability to set our own law enforcement priorities and protect our communities, or forfeit Byrne JAG funding, thus undermining the vital programs that such funding supports. 6. Accordingly, the States file this action seeking a declaratory judgment that the notice, access, and Section 1373 conditions are unlawful, and a permanent injunction enjoining DOJ from imposing these conditions on any Byrne JAG applicant in order to receive the funds. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 2201(a). Jurisdiction is also proper under the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. <unk>702. 8.

The plaintiffs claimed that by excluding “undocumented immigrants from: (a) the tabulation of the total population of the states; (b) the calculation and statement of the whole number of persons in each state; and (c) the calculation and statement of the apportionment of the House of Representatives among the states” the federal government were violating the Enumeration and Apportionment clauses of the United States Constitution, Equal Protection under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Separation of Powers, the Census Act, and.

Civil Action No. Plaintiffs, v. DONALD J. TRUMP, in his official capacity as President of the United States, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE; WILBUR L. ROSS, JR., in his official capacity as Secretary of Commerce, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS, an agency within the United States Department of Commerce; and STEVEN DILLINGHAM, in his official capacity as Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, Defendants. COMPLAINT 1. This action challenges President Trump’s lawless attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the “persons” who must be counted in the Census for purposes of apportioning congressional seats to states. This xenophobic effort to deny the basic humanity of undocumented immigrants violates Article I’s mandate to count all “persons” in the Census, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s requirement that “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State....” (emphasis added). These words leave no room for doubt: they expressly mandate counting “the whole number of persons” living in the United States for purposes of congressional apportionment. As the Supreme Court held just four years ago, “the Fourteenth Amendment calls for the apportionment of congressional districts based on total population,” including all non-citizens living in the United States, regardless of legal status. Evenwel v. Abbott, 136 S Ct. 1120, 1129 (2016). 2. Despite this exceedingly clear constitutional command and binding Supreme Court precedent, on July 21, 2020, Defendant Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum addressed to Defendant Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross titled, “Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census” (the “Memorandum”). The Memorandum purports to declare—for the first time in our nation’s history—that it is “the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).” In other words, the Memorandum directs Secretary Ross: do not count undocumented immigrants at all for purposes of congressional apportionment.1 1 The Memorandum appears to potentially exclude both those with no form of status whatsoever as well as those currently authorized to remain and work in the U.S., such as holders of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, who are nonetheless not “in lawful status under the Immigration and Nationality Act.” See Regents of the Univ. of California v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476, 487 (9th Cir. 2018) (“recipients of deferred action enjoy no formal immigration status”) (quotations omitted), rev’d in part, vacated in part sub nom Dep’t of Homeland Sec v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S Ct. 1891 (2020); Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 279 F. Supp. 3. Rarely does any government actor, much less the President of the United States, so openly and obviously violate the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment mandates “counting the whole number of persons” for congressional apportionment. As the Supreme Court reaffirmed nearly four decades ago, an undocumented individual living in the United States “is surely ‘a person’ in any ordinary sense of that term,” “[w]hatever his status under the immigration laws.” Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210 (1982). The President cannot change the fact that undocumented individuals are human beings. 4. The new “policy” also breaks an uninterrupted line of history: every Decennial Census in our nation’s history has included every person who lives in the United States, regardless of citizenship or immigration status, for purposes of apportioning congressional representation. Defendant Trump’s new policy set forth in the Memorandum therefore not only violates the plain and unequivocal text of Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment and related Supreme Court precedent, it also departs from hundreds of years of consistent Census practice. 5. In addition to contravening the plain text of the Constitution, Supreme Court precedent, and an unbroken line of historical practice, the policy conflicts with the Department of Justice’s own longstanding position—asserted repeatedly over decades in litigation in courts around this country, including to this Court in 2018—that undocumented immigrants are “persons” who must be counted in the Decennial Census (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (“Deferred action does not... confer lawful immigration status”), vacated and remanded sub nom.

On remand to the District Court, the case was stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in United States v.

Preliminary Statement Attorneys Donald Driscoll and Evalynn Welling on behalf of Wilmer Urbina and Rutilo Romero-Ramirez, parent of Omar Romero-Villegas, a minor, and on behalf of Omar RomeroVillejas in his own right and all others similarly situated petition this Court for a Writ of Habeas Corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241. Wilmer Urbina, Omar Romero-Villegas and others have been detained in the Allegheny County Jail without due process nor any other lawful authority. In support thereof the following is stated: II. Jurisdiction and Venue 1. This Court has jurisdiction and may issue relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241 (habeas corpus), 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 (federal question) and 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 (civil rights). 2. Venue is proper in the Western District of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241 because Wilmer Urbina, Omar Romero-Villegas and others on whose behalf this matter is brought are in custody at the Allegheny County Jail in Pennsylvania. III. Parties 3. Petitioner Wilmer Urbina is an adult individual who is presently detained in the Allegheny County Jail. 4. Petitioner Rutilo Romero-Ramirez is an adult individual and the father of Omar Romero-Villegas, who is 17 years old and is presently detained in the Allegheny County Jail. 5. Respondent Ramon C. Rustin is the Warden of the Allegheny County Jail and is the immediate custodian of Mr. Urbina, Mr. Romero-Villegas and others who are similarly situated IV. Class Action Allegations 6. This action is brought, as in Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) and (3), on behalf of a class consisting of all who are or will be detained in the Allegheny County Jail without being provided due process and based solely on an immigration detainer which does not authorize their detention. 7. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Although the precise size of the class is unknown, in one recent month it is believed that there were as many as 76 individuals being improperly held on immigration detainers and without due process. 8. There are questions of law or fact common to the class, specifically whether an immigration detainer authorizes the Respondent Warden to detain members of the class indefinitely and without due process. 9. The claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the class. Each have been detained pursuant to the same alleged authority. 10. The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Their counsel is experienced in class actions raising civil rights claims. 11. Adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the interests of the class who are not parties or substantially impair their ability to protect their interests. 12. The Respondent has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate relief with respect to the class as a whole. 13. To the extent there are individual issues among class members involving relief, these are subordinate to the common question raised, making a class action a superior method for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy V. Factual Allegations 14. Wilmer Urbina was arrested following a traffic stop in Wilkinsburg, Pa. on April 3, 2008. 15. At the request of the charging police officer his preliminary hearing was continued from April 10, 2008 until June 26, 2008 and upon the initiation of the Magisterial District Judge from June 26, 2008 until July 3, 2008. All pending charges were dismissed on July 3, 2008. 16. Omar Romero-Villegas was arrested after leaving his place of employment in Ross Township Pa. on June 11, 2008. 17. All criminal charges against Omar Romero-Villegas were withdrawn on or before June 27, 2008. 18. Petitioners and others have been continuously confined in the Allegheny County Jail due to detainers placed on them by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 19. At most these detainers provide that those subject to them be held for no more than 48 hours from the time state authorized custody has ended. 20.

CRANE, DAVID A. ENGLE, ANASTASIA MARIE CARROLL, RICARDO DIAZ. LORENZO GARZA, FELIX LUCIANO, TRE REBSTOCK, FERNANDO SILVA, SAMUEL MARTIN, and JAMES D. DOEBLER Plaintiffs, v. JANET NAPOLITANO, in her official capacity as Secretary of Homeland Security, and JOHN MORTON, in his official capacity as Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Defendants. Civil Action No. 3:12-CV-_____ COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs are law enforcement officers of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). 2. On June 15, 2012, Defendant Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano issued a Directive entitled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children” (hereinafter “the Directive”). The Directive, attached to this Complaint as Appendix A, instructs ICE officers to refrain from placing certain aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States (“illegal aliens”) into removal proceedings, and to take actions to facilitate the granting of deferred action to aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States. The Directive also directs DHS personnel to grant employment authorization to certain beneficiaries of the Directive. 3. The requirements that an unlawfully present alien must assert to be granted the privileges described in the Directive are that the alien: • came to the United States under the age of sixteen; • has continuously resided in the United States for a least five years preceding June 15, 2012, and was present in the United States on June 15, 2012; • is currently in school, has graduated from high school, has obtained a general education development certificate, or is an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; • has not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or multiple misdemeanor offenses, and does not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety; and • is not above the age of thirty. 4. The Directive commands ICE officers to violate federal law, as detailed below, commands ICE officers to violate their oaths to uphold and support federal law, violates the Administrative Procedure Act, unconstitutionally usurps and encroaches upon the legislative powers of Congress, as defined in Article I of the United States Constitution, and violates the obligation of the executive branch to faithfully execute the law, as required by Article II, Section 3, of the United States Constitution. 5. Plaintiffs bring this civil action to seek injunctive relief preventing the implementation of this unlawful and unconstitutional Directive. 6. This lawsuit seeks to prevent law enforcement officer Plaintiffs from being forced to either violate federal law if they comply with the unlawful Directive or risk adverse employment action if they disobey the unlawful orders of the DHS Secretary. This lawsuit also seeks to preserve the balance of legislative and executive powers established by the United States Constitution. THE PARTIES Plaintiffs 7. Plaintiff Christopher L.

The plaintiffs sued Dallas County and the Dallas County Sheriff under 42 USC §1983 for violations of the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought damages and an injunction preventing the defendants from detaining the plaintiffs solely based on a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an immigration hold, or an immigration detainer. Over time, the case was consolidated with two other lawsuits with identical claims. The state of Texas also intervened as a defendant.

DALLAS COUNTY, TEXAS, and LUPE VALDEZ, Defendants. COMPLAINT Freedom from pretrial detention is a fundamental right protected by the United States Constitution. “This traditional right to freedom before conviction permits the unhampered preparation of a defense, and serves to prevent the infliction of punishment prior to conviction.” Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 3 (1951). “The consequences of prolonged detention may be more serious than the interference occasioned by arrest. Pretrial confinement may imperil the suspect’s job, interrupt his source of income, and impair his family relationships.” Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 114 (1975). Defendants held Plaintiffs in Dallas County jail for months pending trial, even for purported misdemeanors, without allowing immediate release on bond. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983. PARTIES 1. Plaintiffs were held by Dallas County in detention. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) requested that Dallas County detain each Plaintiff for up to 48 hours after the time that each Plaintiff otherwise would have been released to facilitate ICE’s arrest of that Plaintiff. As a result, an “immigration hold” appears in each Plaintiff’s file. No Plaintiff is currently in Dallas County custody. 2. Dallas County is located in North Texas. Process for Dallas County may be effected on Clay Jenkins, County Judge, who is located at 411 Elm St., Dallas, Texas, 75202 Tex. Civ Prac Rem. Code <unk>17.024(a). 3. Lupe Valdez is the Sheriff of Dallas County and is the highest ranking lawenforcement officer in Dallas County. She is responsible for the Dallas County Sheriff’s Department, Dallas County jails, and Dallas County inmates. Sheriff Valdez lives and works in Texas and in this District. Plaintiffs sue Sheriff Valdez in her personal and official capacity. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. This is a civil-rights case arising under the United States Code, title 42. The Court thus has subject-matter jurisdiction over this lawsuit. 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331. 5. Defendants work and reside in Texas and in this District. Defendants regularly conduct business in Texas and this district. Defendants’ acts in Texas form the basis of this lawsuit. The Court thus has personal jurisdiction over Defendants. 6. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391 because many of the complained-of acts in this case occurred in Dallas County, Texas, and because Defendants reside and work in this District. 7. Plaintiffs were arrested and placed in Dallas County custody within the last two years. On information and belief, ICE requested that Dallas County detain each Plaintiff for up to 48 hours after the time that each Plaintiff otherwise would have been released to facilitate ICE’s arrest of that Plaintiff. As a result, each Plaintiff’s file includes an “immigration hold.” As an example, the following appears in the file for Plaintiff Moises Martinez: “Illegal Alien” is often used by Dallas County as shorthand for an immigration hold. At times, the hold indicates that no bond is allowed, as shown by the file for Plaintiff Efren Perez Villegas: Similarly, the file for Plaintiff Jose Lopez-Aranda states “H/F IMMIGRATION/NO BOND.” 8. ICE often provides a form to Dallas County entitled “Immigration Detainer.” The Immigration Detainer for Plaintiff Andres Torres Cabrera is attached as Exhibit A. The Torres Cabrera Immigration Detainer states that “there is reason to believe [Mr. Torres Cabrera] is subject to removal from the United States.” Under federal law, being “subject to removal” is not a crime. The Immigration Detainer states that Mr. Torres Cabrera has a prior felony, but does not state (in form or substance) facts showing probable cause that would support arrest under the the Fourth Amendment, such as probable cause to believe that Mr. Torres Cabrera has committed a different criminal offense or is committing a different criminal offense. The Immigration Detainer requests that Dallas County maintain custody over Mr. Torres Cabrera: IT IS REQUESTED THAT YOU: Maintain custody of the subject for a period NOT TO EXCEED 48 HOURS excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, beyond the","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Dallas County, Texas | Immigration and Customs Enforcement | U.S. District Court | Northern District of Texas ||| March 2015 ||| May 2016 ||| June 2017 ||| July 2018 ||| August 2018 | July 2019 | August 2019 ||| September 2019 | July 2020 | August 2020 | July 2021 | August 2021 | September 2020 | September 2021 | October 2020 | October 2019 | May 2020 | June 2021 | July 2022 | August 2022 | September 2022 | October 2022 | May 2021 | June 2022 | July 2023 | August 2023 | September 2018 | September 2023 | July 2024</s>"

THE STATE OF TEXAS; and GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT; ATTORNEY GENERAL KEN PAXTON; DIRECTOR STEVE MCCRAW, THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, all sued in their official capacity, Defendants. CIVIL ACTION NO. PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Senate Bill 4 (“SB 4”), also known as the “Show Me Your Papers Bill,” is an unprecedented, cruel, and vague law that is aimed at the heart of Texas. It violates the Constitution of the United States, the Texas Constitution, and federal law and should be immediately and permanently enjoined. 2. There are many legal flaws with SB 4. Racial animus fueled SB 4’s enactment, tainting the entire law with an impermissible legislative purpose. The law’s language is unconstitutionally vague, chills policy dissent in violation of the First Amendment and leaves those potentially subject to its mandates without meaningful notice of what acts are forbidden. SB 4 will make all Texans less safe by eroding the discretion of our local law enforcement and law enforcement on college campuses, interfering with the chain of command and the existing decision-making processes of local officials, and preventing the reporting of crimes. Finally, SB 4 invites racial profiling, permitting local officers to demand “papers” from virtually any person in Texas at any time. History and logic supports that all Texans will not be equally subject to this harassment: Texans of Hispanic heritage and immigrants and their families, particularly those from Mexico, Central American and other Spanish-speaking countries, will be targeted. 3. This historic and unconstitutional attack on the core values and identity of Texas is especially harmful to the County of El Paso — comprised of residents, employees, and visitors — and to the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund (TOPEF) the population it serves. 4. El Paso is unique among Texas counties: it is bilingual, bi-national, multi-cultural, and geographically distinct. For instance, El Paso has over 800,000 residents, is over 82% Hispanic and over 25% of its residents are foreign born. It is part of the largest border community in the United States, and one of the safest communities in the nation, leading the country in public safety. El Paso takes great pride in protecting all its residents and its values, and has been a leader in the fight against discrimination of all types for decades, with a special focus on protecting the civil rights of its immigrant communities. In its attack upon immigrants of all nationalities, against Mexican Americans, and against Hispanic communities, SB 4 stands in stark contrast to El Paso’s history and identity. 5. It is insulting to the people and leaders of El Paso that the Texas Legislature continues to erode the policy decision-making and sovereignty of local communities based on irrational, unfounded “fears” of immigrants. As it has done for hundreds of years, El Paso will protect its heritage, identity and adherence to constitutional values such as equality and justice — and will do so with everything that it has. It is for these reasons and more, that El Paso files this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. 6. TOPEF is an education organization based in San Antonio, Houston and Dallas. More than half of TOPEF’s employees and the people they serve identify as Latino; many are from immigrant, mixed-status families. As an organization, TOPEF will be particularly injured by SB 4’s unconstitutional provisions and harms, including racial profiling. 7. The County of El Paso and its Sheriff, Richard Wiles, along with TOPEF on behalf of their employees and the people they serve (collectively, the Plaintiffs), seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the State of Texas, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Director Steve McCraw of the Texas Department of Public Safety for the following legal violations in connection with the enactment, administration, and prospective enforcement of SB 4: 1) SB 4 was adopted with an impermissible purpose which violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of the equal protection of laws; 2) SB 4 is unconstitutionally vague and violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause; 3) SB 4 violates the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures; 4) SB 4 violates the supremacy clause, Art.

Lucero, Field Office Director for the San Antonio Field Office, and John Doe 1-5 (employees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement); Defendants. CIVIL ACTION NO. 5:16-cv-855 PLAINTIFF’S ORIGINAL COMPLAINT The Plaintiff, Julio Trujillo Santoyo, through counsel, respectfully brings this action seeking damages against the Defendants for unlawfully detaining him in the Bexar County Jail from March 24, 2016 until June 7, 2016 without charge, warrant, or probable cause. In furtherance of this claim, he alleges as follows. INTRODUCTION 1. This action is brought to redress the unlawful and prolonged imprisonment by law enforcement officials of the Plaintiff Julio Trujillo Santoyo. 2. Defendant Bexar County imprisoned the Plaintiff for approximately 75 days after his criminal charges were dismissed pursuant to a policy and practice under which Defendant Bexar County routinely detains individuals whenever Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents request them to do so. Defendant Bexar County’s policy and practice violates the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and expends significant law enforcement resources in an unlawful attempt to enforce federal immigration law. Defendant Bexar County’s illegal and wasteful conduct has caused, and if not addressed will continue to cause, substantial harm to Texas residents. 3. Plaintiff also brings constitutional claims under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), against the ICE officers and employees responsible for his illegal detention. These federal officers left the Plaintiff to languish in county jail for approximately 75 days without a warrant for arrest, without notice of any charges against him (there were none), without any opportunity to be considered for release on bond, and without any other legal process of any kind.

In this case, a coalition of immigrant rights groups and individual immigrants challenged Utah's law, HB 497, on preemption grounds and as a violation of equal protection, the right to travel, and the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. A preemption case brought by the Department of Justice was later consolidated with this case. In 2011, the District Court for the District of Utah has issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the statute. Following the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Arizona, the Court ruled on the motions for preliminary injunctions in June 2014 and ruled against the key provisions of HB 497. In November 2014, the parties filed a joint report, in which the State of Utah agreed to permanently scrap the key problematic provisions of HB 497. On December 4, 2014, the Court entered a judgment per the parties' proposed final agreement and dismissed the remaining claims without prejudice. The parties settled on attorney fees and costs and the case closed. ","1 Linton Joaquin* Karen C. Tumlin* 2 Shiu-Ming Cheer* Melissa S.

This action challenges Utah’s immigration enforcement law, House 4 Bill (“HB”) 497. HB 497 was enacted by the State of Utah along with two other 5 immigration laws—HB 469 and HB 116—to create a comprehensive system of 6 immigration regulation. This Utah scheme includes: (1) a punitive immigration 7 enforcement system requiring state and local law enforcement officers to verify the 8 immigration or citizenship status of individuals they encounter in numerous 9 circumstances, to detain those deemed by Utah law enforcement officers to be 10 unlawfully present in the United States, to arrest individuals on immigration- 11 related grounds that differ from federal standards, and to enforce Utah-specific 12 criminal immigration laws (HB 497); (2) a state scheme to admit non-citizens from 13 outside the United States to live, work, or study in Utah (HB 469); and (3) a state 14 program to provide state work authorization for non-citizens without federal 15 employment authorization (HB 116). 2. The laws were signed by Governor Gary Herbert on March 15, 2011, 17 and HB 497 is scheduled to take effect on May 10, 2011, long before the other 18 laws are to have any effect. 3. If allowed to take effect, HB 497 will significantly harm Utahans, 20 particularly Utahans of color. According to law enforcement officials in Utah and 21 elsewhere, HB 497 will cause widespread racial profiling and will subject many 22 persons of color—including countless U.S. citizens and non-citizens who have 23 federal permission to remain in the United States—to unlawful interrogations, 24 searches, seizures, and arrests. People of color in the state will be compelled to 25 carry additional paperwork on them at all times in order to prove to law 2 enforcement officials that their presence in the country is approved by the federal 3 government. 4.

On January 21, 2020, the plaintiffs and the DMV settled, and the DMV agreed to implement new protocols to protect against disclosing immigration and citizenship information with ICE. The plaintiffs then settled with the remaining defendants on October 28, 2020. The settlement agreement included $100,000 in damages, deferred action for the plaintiffs so they would not be deported, and ICE informing its employees that all immigrants are protected by the First Amendment.","t<unk>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF VERMONT 3 MIGRANT JUSTICE, a Vermont corporation, on its own behalf and on behalf of its members; 4 JOSE ENRIQUE BALCAZAR SANCHEZ; ZULLY PALACIOS RODRIGUEZ; JOSE 5 VICTOR GARCIA DIAZ; MIGUEL ALCUDIA GAMAS; Plaintiffs, 7 v. 8 KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, Secretary of the U.S. 9 Department of Homeland Security (DHS); RONALD VITIELLO, Deputy/Acting 10 Director, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); MATTHEW ALBENCE, 11 ICE/DHS Executive Associate Director, Enforcement and Removal Operations; 12 WANDA MINOLI, Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Commissioner; 13 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; Defendants. Case No. 16 INTRODUCTION 1. Migrant Justice organizes and advocates for Vermont's immigrant farmworkers-a 18 community of approximately 1,500 people who labor long hours under grueling and often dangerous 19 conditions. The organization has achieved remarkable success in organizing workers to assemble, 20 publicly protest, march, and assert their perspectives in the larger marketplace of commerce and 21 ideas. Migrant Justice's members have identified four core areas of organizational focus: dignified work and quality housing, freedom of movement and access to transportation, freedom from 23 discrimination, and access to healthcare. In the course of its advocacy, Migrant Justice has loudly and publicly criticized U.S. 25 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (""ICE'""). ICE has retaliated, and continues to retaliate, by disrupting Plaintiffs' advocacy and infringing upon their First Amendment rights. ICE has infiltrated Migrant Justice's private meetings; targeted, surveilled, and engaged in disinformation campaigns to sow distrust among its members; and arrested and/or detained no fewer than twenty active Migrant Justice members, including the Individual Plaintiffs- 2 each of whom played and continues to play a critical role in Migrant Justice's advocacy. 4. ICE takes these actions because Plaintiffs are engaged in First Amendment activities 4 and to deter them and others from engaging in similar activity. 5. ICE advances its retaliatory agenda with the assistance of the Vermont Department of 6 Motor Vehicles (""DMV""). Motivated by racial and xenophobic animus, DMV employees give ICE 7 private driver information, including the personal information and location, of non-white, 8 predominately Latino, individuals. 6. ICE's actions have chilled and continue to chill Migrant Justice's ability to organize IO and advocate for migrant workers. Fewer members attend community assemblies, events, protests, 11 and rallies. Migrant Justice finds it more difficult to enlist members to speak at public events. ICE 12 has also frustrated Migrant Justice's ability to advocate for fair labor practices and economic justice. 13 Time and money once dedicated to this mission are now used to advance funds towards immigration 14 bonds and attorneys' fees and to fight detentions of members. 7. As for the Individual Plaintiffs, not only has ICE chilled their speech and interfered 16 with their association, but ICE's surveillance, harassment, arrest, and detention of them has caused 17 and continues to cause them significant emotional distress. 8. Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to end Defendants' unlawful and 19 discriminatory practices, as well as monetary damages against the United States. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 9.

MCALEENAN; U.S. 17 DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY; U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 18 STATE; and U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION, Defendants. INTRODUCTION 1. This lawsuit challenges Defendants’ implementation of the waiver provision of 23 Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, “Enhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for 24 Detecting Attempted Entry into the United States By Terrorists or other Public-Safety Threats” 25 (“Proclamation”). The Proclamation indefinitely bans millions of nationals of five Muslim- 26 majority countries from entering the United States. For many thousands of individuals and 27 families indefinitely separated by the President’s ban, the Proclamation’s waiver provision has, 1 as a practical matter, amounted to nothing more than an empty promise—in the words of Justice 2 Breyer, merely “window dressing.” 2. Under the Proclamation, the only way that banned individuals can now gain 4 entry to the United States is by obtaining a waiver. See Section 3(c), Proc No. 9645 (hereinafter 5 “waiver provision”). But the Proclamation’s waiver provision has been implemented in such a 6 haphazard, opaque, and capricious manner, and so few visa applicants have actually been 7 granted waivers under the Proclamation, that the process by which waivers are supposedly 8 granted has become part and parcel of the ban itself. 3. Indeed, a former consular official and State Department employee has stated in 10 a sworn declaration “that there really is no waiver,” because consular officers have been 11 instructed “to determine at all possible cost that the [visa applicant] was not eligible to even 12 apply for the waiver.” See Exhibit A. 4. What is publicly known about Defendants’ implementation of the 14 Proclamation’s waiver provision is consistent with this assessment. 5. When the Proclamation went into effect, there were mass denials of waivers, 16 regardless of whether the applicant had already had a consular interview, whether the applicant 17 had any meaningful notice of the availability of a waiver, or whether the applicant had an 18 opportunity to present evidence of eligibility for a waiver. 6. There is no application form for a waiver from the Proclamation’s ban. There is 20 no information about how an individual seeking a visa can demonstrate his or her eligibility 21 under the criteria set out in the Proclamation. There is no formal opportunity provided in the 22 visa application process for an individual to demonstrate eligibility for a waiver. Nor do there 23 appear to be consistent processes by which to accept and consider requests for waivers. 7. As implemented by Defendants, moreover, the process and standard by which 25 waivers are granted are dramatically different from what the Proclamation sets out. The few 26 public disclosures about how the State Department is implementing the Proclamation’s waiver 27 provision indicate that consular officers are assessing visa applicants’ waiver eligibility 1 pursuant to an arbitrary and ad hoc process, and under far narrower criteria than those actually 2 set forth in the Proclamation. Numerous individuals—including every individual Plaintiff in 3 this action—fall within the circumstances identified by the Proclamation as warranting a waiver, 4 but have nevertheless been unable to obtain a waiver. 8. Given the unduly restrictive manner in which Defendants have implemented the 6 Proclamation’s waiver provision, families from the five majority-Muslim banned countries 7 remain unnecessarily separated, and cannot celebrate traditional milestones together like births, 8 graduations, weddings, and birthdays, or provide support through illness and hardship. 9 Institutions of higher learning cannot bring academics and students from the banned countries 10 to pursue research or study in the United States. Employers are unable to hire or employ 11 qualified individuals from the banned countries. 9. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit are individuals facing indefinite separation from 13 their families, for whom a waiver from the ban is the only way they can reunite with their 14 families, and organizations who serve individuals in similar straits. They respectfully request 15 that the Court enjoin Defendants from implementing or enforcing any part of the Proclamation’s 16 waiver provision in a manner that violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the INA, 17 the Constitution, or the Proclamation itself.

PET. FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS COMPL. FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF I. INTRODUCTION The novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has led to a global pandemic. In only a few 3 months, 153,517 people worldwide have received confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19, and over 4 5,735 of those people have died. There is no vaccine against COVID-19, and there is no known 5 cure. No one is immune. COVID-19 is most likely to cause serious illness and elevated risk of 6 death for older adults and those with certain medical conditions or underlying disease. The 7 COVID-19 virus can cause severe damage to lung tissue, sometimes leading to a permanent loss 8 of respiratory capacity, and can damage tissues in other vital organs including the heart and liver. 9 Patients with serious cases of COVID-19 require advanced medical support, including positive 10 pressure ventilation and extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation in intensive care. Patients who 11 do not die from serious cases of COVID-19 may face prolonged recovery periods, including 12 extensive rehabilitation from neurologic damage and loss of respiratory capacity. The only 13 known effective measures to reduce the risk for vulnerable people of serious illness or 14 death caused by COVID-19 are social distancing and improved hygiene, which have led to 15 unprecedented public health measures around the world. According to preliminary data from 16 China, 20 percent of people in high risk categories who contracted COVID-19 there died. People in congregate environments, which are places where people live, eat, and sleep in 18 close proximity, face increased danger of contracting COVID-19, as already evidenced by 19 the rapid spread of the virus in cruise ships and nursing homes. People who are confined 20 in prisons, jails, and detention centers will find it virtually impossible to engage in the 21 necessary social distancing and hygiene required to mitigate the risk of transmission, even with 22 the best-laid plans. For this reason, correctional public health experts have recommended the 23 release from custody of people most vulnerable to COVID-19. Release protects the people with 1 the greatest vulnerability to COVID-19 from transmission of the virus, and also allows for 2 greater risk mitigation for all people held or working in a prison, jail, or detention center. Release 3 of the most vulnerable people from custody also reduces the burden on the region’s 4 limited health care infrastructure, as it lessens the likelihood that an overwhelming number of 5 people will become seriously ill from COVID-19 at the same time. Petitioners-Plaintiffs (hereinafter Plaintiffs) are people who are particularly vulnerable to 7 serious illness or death if infected by COVID-19 and who are held in civil detention 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Tacoma Northwest Detention 9 Center (NWDC) in Tacoma, Washington as they await the adjudication of their immigration 10 cases. Plaintiffs are older adults or have medical conditions that lead to high risk of serious 11 COVID-19 infection, including lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy, kidney disease, 12 autoimmune disorders, asthma, and hypertension. The NWDC is located in the Seattle, 13 Washington metropolitan area, the epicenter of the largest COVID-19 outbreak in the United 14 States, and one of the largest known outbreaks in the world. As detailed below, the danger posed 15 by Plaintiffs’ detention during the current outbreak of COVID-19 is “so grave that it violates 16 contemporary standards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk” and violates 17 their constitutional right to safety in government custody.

Fresno is a rapidly growing county and has been releasing prisoners from its jail facilities per a Federal Court order when the population reaches 90% of its capacity. The county is faced with the prospect of expanding its jail system to meet the increasing demands. In an initial letter dated August 2006, the Board of Supervisors and County Administrative Officer requested a local system assessment to determine the county’s short and long term needs and the factors that are driving the demand for jail space. In addition they requested assistance to identify the physical requirements of the jail that they would need. A letter from the county dated September 20, 2006 to NIC was amended to include the signatures of the District Attorney, Presiding Judge, Sheriff, Chief Probation Officer, Public Defender, County Administrator and the Chair of the Board of Supervisors. On October 10, 2006, after considerable discussion at formal Board of Supervisor sessions, the Board approved a significant increase in staffing to the District Attorney, Public Defender and Probation offices. The strategy approved was to increase positions in these agencies to lessen the processing delays at the pre-trial stage of the system and re-instate a pre-trial release/supervision program. All of these changes came after an analysis revealed that the jail population was made up of 75% pre-trial detainees. ABOUT ASSESSMENT PROCESS The Assessment process used by this consultant team, through the course of interviews (interview list at the end of this report) and publicly available data from the system and community, documents how the system is operating from a process referred to as “decision point analysis”. The criminal justice community and the National Institute of Corrections (NIC) over a period of years have learned that the criminal justice system workload is driven by at least the following seven decision points (outlined in more detail later in this report) in the system: 1. Decision to arrest; 2. Decision to detain pretrial; 3. Decision to release from pre-trial detention; 4. Decision to prosecute; 5. Adjudication outcome; 6. Sentencing decision; and 7. Sentence modification decisions The consultants, based on the interviews and material gathered give an overview NIC Jail and Justice System Assessment Fresno County of the system centered on these seven decisions and offer suggestions for what the officials and community might consider in changes intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. In addition the team has toured the county jail facilities and done an assessment of their condition and usable status as jailing resources for the county.

INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs bring this case to remedy the inaccessibility of the Santa Clara County 10 Jail system (“County Jails,” “Jails,” or “Jail”) for inmates with mobility disabilities. The Jail 11 system is the fifth largest jail system in the State of California. Due to the lack of accessible 12 cells, showers, and living units in the County Jails, many individuals with mobility disabilities 13 are segregated in restrictive medical units despite the fact they do not require ongoing medical 14 care, and/or are held in higher security and more restrictive settings than they otherwise would be 15 but for their disabilities. They are further denied access to educational, religious, and 16 rehabilitative programs due to physical and programmatic barriers, and cannot even use the toilet 17 and shower safely due to a lack of accessible features. Inmates are not informed of their rights, 18 are not provided with a method for requesting reasonable modifications to policies and practices, 19 and are denied access to a functioning and meaningful grievance system. 2. There are approximately 4,000 people incarcerated in the Jails at any given time 21 and over 65,000 individuals are booked into the Jails every year. The Jails include facilities at 22 the Santa Clara County Main Jail Complex (“Main Jail”), consisting of Main Jail North and 23 Main Jail South, in San Jose, California; facilities for male inmates at the Elmwood Correctional 24 Complex in Milpitas, California (“Elmwood”); and the Elmwood Complex Women’s Facility in 25 Milpitas, California (“Elmwood Women’s Facility”). 3. In the entire County Jail system, there is not a single housing unit that is fully 27 accessible in compliance with state and federal disability laws. As a result, inmates with 28 mobility disabilities cannot use the toilet safely and independently, take a shower safely and CIVIL CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF 1 independently, or otherwise have equal or meaningful access to programs and services offered at 2 the Jails. Further, this lack of accessible housing puts the physical safety of inmates with 3 mobility disabilities at risk. 4. Additionally, there is no functioning system of screening inmates upon intake to 5 ensure inmates with mobility disabilities are identified and accommodated. To the extent 6 Defendants are able to identify individuals with mobility disabilities, the County Jails lack a 7 system to track the location and needs of inmates identified as having a mobility disability, 8 causing Jail staff to fail to accommodate the inmates’ disability needs.. 5. Inmates with mobility disabilities regularly are housed in a medical setting and/or 10 a higher custody level than warranted based solely on their disability. Inmates in the Main Jail 11 with mobility disabilities who need a wheelchair are required to be housed in “special housing 12 units” including the Main Jail Infirmary, Unit 13 Housing, Unit 14 mobility disabilities who need a wheelchair and who would otherwise be eligible for housing at 15 the less restrictive Elmwood facility are housed at in these special housing units at the Main Jail 16 instead.","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] December 2015 | Santa Clara County | Disability Rights Advocates | Rosen Bien Galvan Grunfeld LLP | U.S. District Court | Northern District of California ||||| December 2016 ||| December 2018 ||| January 2019 ||| March 2019 | ||| June 2019 | December 2019 | January 2020 ||| May 2020 | June 2020 | May 2021 | June 2021 | July 2020 | July 2021 | August 2020 | September 2020 | October 2020 | December 2020 | January 2021 | March 2020 | February 2020 | March 2021 | April 2020 | April 2021 | May 2019 | May 2021, June 2020, May 2021, March 2020, March 2020, April 2020, May 2020, June 2020, and May 2021, plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern district of California against the County of Santa Clara, the County Department of Corrections, and the Santa Clara Office of the Sheriff.

In December 2015, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that the defendants had violated the ADA. The final judgment required the defendants to provide access to programs and services for inmates with disabilities, provide housing in a manner that is accessible to inmates who need a wheelchair, and provide a system to track the location and needs of inmates identified as having a mobility disability.</s>"

COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL Upshaw et al v. Alameda County, United States District Court, Northern District of California, Case No. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This is a civil rights class action in which the Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a 3 class of similarly situated individuals, seek relief from Defendants’ violations of Plaintiffs’ rights and 4 privileges secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. 2. Alameda County Jails consists of two facilities, Glen Dyer Jail in Oakland and Santa Rita 6 Jail in Dublin. Women, including pregnant women are held only at the Santa Rita Jail. Pregnant women are housed with other prisoners. The conditions described herein apply equally to pregnant prisoners. 7 3. In the cells, the lights are never off. Even at night the lights are only slightly dimmed and 8 the lighting is bright enough to read. Outside of the cells are tier lights. The jail schedule calls for the 9 overhead tier lights, and the lights in the common areas to go out at 11 p.m., and breakfast is served 10 between 4 and 4:30 a.m. This schedule designed by defendants at Santa Rita jail prevent any prisoner 11 from being able to have sleep durations of more than five and a half (5.5) hours a night, assuming that the 12 prisoner is able to sleep with 24-hour lights in their cells. In addition, although the schedule theoretically permits a sleep duration of up to five and a half hours; on a regular basis, and with great 13 frequency, sheriff deputies routinely disrupt prisoners’ limited sleep duration, often hourly, through their 14 activities and conduct including repeatedly shining bright white flashlights into prisoners’ eyes; banging 15 keys and flashlights on metal doors; forcing prisoners to wake up and acknowledge the presence of 16 sheriff deputies; turning on and leaving on overhead lights; yelling and shouting; creating loud noises; 17 operating machines; making announcements over the public address system; and having prisoner 18 activities including medical appointments and medication distribution at 3 a.m. 4. Prisoners at the Santa Rita Jail suffer from chronic deprivation of sleep and disturbance of 19 sleep. This ongoing, daily sleep deprivation and disturbance has created significant negative impacts on 20 prisoners’ abilities to function at many levels. Prisoners are negatively impacted cognitively, 21 functionally, and psychiatrically. Cognitive impairment adversely impacts pretrial prisoners’ ability to 22 assist in their legal defense. Prisoners’ overall health and immune systems are negatively impacted 23 resulting in health issues including bacterial and viral infections. Pregnant women are subject to more 24 significant negative health impacts from sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation creates higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum that are associated with postpartum depression and preterm delivery. 25 5. Prisoners’ efforts to grieve this situation were prevented by defendants’ refusal to permit 26 grievances through withholding of blank grievance forms, destruction of completed grievance forms, or 27 retaliation for the filing of grievances. Grievances submitted and received were overwhelmingly denied. COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL Upshaw et al v. Alameda County, United States District Court, Northern District of California, Case No. 6. As a result of this significant sleep deprivation and sleep disruption, and the resulting 2 emotional and cognitive impairment, prisoners find themselves short tempered and irritable, experience 3 difficulty exercising emotional control, unable to handle frustration and often lack the necessary behavior controls demanded by the jail system. Sleep deprivation causes more sensitivity to physical pain.

This is a civil rights action in which the Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a class of 11 similarly situated individuals, seek relief for Defendants’ violations of Plaintiffs’ rights and 12 privileges secured by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United 13 States Constitution. 14 3. This civil rights lawsuit arises out of the unlawful, unconstitutional and inhumane manner 15 in which defendant ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE, its staff and employees and 16 multiple for-profit contractors, operate the largest county jail in the San Francisco Bay Area. 17 Although 85 percent or more of inmates at Santa Rita Jail are pretrial detainees, both state and 18 federal, Defendants operates this county jail as a penal institution which has as its primary 19 purpose, the lock down of inmates. Inmates are treated as the inventory in defendants’ business of 20 incarceration. Defendants expend a minimum effort to meet state and federal standards. 21 Although defendants assert that they fully comply with statutory and regulatory standards, in 22 reality, defendants have implemented policies and procedures and a system, which deliberately 23 avoids and then obfuscates their refusal to comply with these state and federal statutes and 24 regulations, which are directed at setting a constitutional standard for conditions of confinement. 25 4. Unable to tolerate these unsanitary and inhumane conditions, plaintiffs and other inmates 26 after failing to obtain a response through defendants’ purported grievance process, then engaged 27 in a multi-prong strike, including a hunger strike, a work strike, and a strike against participating 28 in jail activities such as going to court.

The plaintiffs sued Alameda County and the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for violations of their rights under the U.S. Constitution and state law.  On April 12, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.  The plaintiffs elaborated on the allegations in the original complaint of the mistreatment against pregnant women prisoners and discrimination against women prisoners in general.  The second amended complaint also added additional causes of action under California state law and identified additional named defendants beyond the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office and individuals employed therein, including the California Forensic Medical Group, retained to provide medical services to prisoners and Aramark Correctional Services, a for-profit food services provider at the Jail.

The plaintiffs requested that the court certify a plaintiff class of women prisoners and the subclass of pregnant women prisoners, and that the court issue emergency remedy, by decree, to ensure that the women prisoners receive the medical care and other accommodations they needed to be safe while in custody at the Alameda County Jail.  Finally, in addition to the injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages requested in the original complaint, the plaintiffs requested that the court affirmatively direct the defendants to fully comply with all state statutes and regulations regarding medical treatment, nutrition, activities, and personal hygiene for women prisoners.

Plaintiffs JACLYN MOHRBACHER, ERIN ELLIS, DOMINIQUE JACKSON, CHRISTINA 27 ZEPEDA, ALEXIS WAHL, and KELSEY ERWIN, on behalf of themselves and others similarly 28 situated, allege as follows: Mohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. INTRODUCTION 1. This case arises from a strong and highly reprehensible pattern and practice of aggressively 2 misogynist, apparently programmatic, maltreatment of women prisoners—so severe as to 3 have resulted in two recent miscarriages, and a third woman giving birth, alone and 4 unattended, in a solitary confinement cell—at the Alameda County jail at Santa Rita, California. Several of the named plaintiffs (including those three) complain of specific, purposeful and aggravated violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and parallel provisions of the California Constitution, detailed within, resulting in serious injury and deprivation under federal and state civil rights laws. 2. At any given time, Alameda County has approximately 250 women prisoners under its custody and control. On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that of these 250 women prisoners, at any given moment, approximately 10 are pregnant, and that over 2500 women with 150 of 12 whom are pregnant, cycle through Santa Rita Jail in a year. 13 3. Plaintiffs Jaclyn Mohrbacher, Erin Ellis, Dominique Jackson, are three pregnant, female 14 prisoners, currently incarcerated in Santa Rita Jail, who urgently seek emergency relief against defendants because they are pregnant, two of them four or five months pregnant and experiencing frequent “spotting” and bleeding from their vaginas, but have been repeatedly abused by being held in isolation cells, kept outdoors without sufficient warm clothing, and subjected to repeated accusations of drug abuse and strip searched. In concert with this abuse, plaintiffs and proposed class members are denied medical attention, denied required medication and all other needed accommodation —including warm clothing, blankets, healthy nutritious and sufficient food, fresh air, etc—by defendant staff members. Instead, defendants have repeatedly demanded that plaintiffs agree to have an abortion, accused said plaintiffs of 22 being a drug addict, and refused all other recognition and assistance for each plaintiff’s 23 delicate condition. Other pregnant women—including those who miscarried—have similarly been scorned, branded and mistreated in the jail in recent times—to a further, under a regime marked by intense general hostility to women prisoners, and studied indifference to their serious medical and hygienic needs. 4.. In addition, all named plaintiffs herein, including the three mentioned above and others whose injuries and deprivations at the hands of defendants do not involve pregnancy—but Mohrbacher v. Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. very often do involve nasty and hostile refusals to acknowledge or respond to feminine hygienic needs—complain of extensive, systematic discrimination against the women 2 prisoners at Santa Rita, compared to the men, in all aspects of life in the jail: food, access to 3 clean clothes, fresh air and out-of-cell jobs, education, exercise and activities, counseling, 4 phone calls, family visits, and more. 5. These women also seek injunctive relief, under the First, Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments requiring a total cessation of inhumane and sexually biased treatment and forms of treatment of women prisoners by defendants, and effective, outside monitoring—on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, namely all women prisoners currently held or to be held in the future at the Santa Rita Jail, as a Class, per Rule 23, F.R.

Plaintiffs sought habeas corpus, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. 

The district court granted class certification and partially granted a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which mandated more social distancing, providing for more PPE, and improved sanitation policies. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, and applied in both the district court and the Ninth Circuit to stay the case in the lower court until the appeals court had ruled. Both denied these applications, however the Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court saying that the defendants could try to modify the injunction if there were any changed circumstances. Defendants did so, but the district court denied any modifications once again. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which likewise rejected the defendants' motion. Finally, the defendants went to the Supreme Court and asked them to stay the injunction while the Ninth Circuit heard the case on the merits. The Supreme Court obliged on August 5, staying the injunction.

","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WILLIAM PIERCE 1313 R Street, NW Washington, DC 20009 Plaintiff, v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Office of the Attorney General 441 Defendant. COMPLAINT (Seeking damages for disability-based discrimination: violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act) INTRODUCTION 1. This is an action for damages and other relief by William Pierce, who was denied equal access to programs, services and activities of the District of Columbia because of the absence of accommodations for deaf inmates at the District of Columbia’s Correctional Treatment Facility, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Defendant District of Columbia intentionally discriminated against Mr. Pierce on the basis of his disability by denying him adequate and effective means to communicate with individuals both inside the jail and by telephone with individuals outside the jail. The defendant also retaliated against him for seeking accommodation to which he was entitled Mr. Pierce seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and other appropriate relief. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 (federal question). 3. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) because the events giving rise to the plaintiff’s claim occurred in the District of Columbia. PARTIES 4. Plaintiff William Pierce is a resident of the District of Columbia and is profoundly deaf. 5. Defendant District of Columbia is a municipal corporation and the local government of Washington, DC. The Department of Corrections (“DOC”) is an agency of the District of Columbia, the functions of which include overseeing the operation of the Correctional Treatment Facility. FACTS 6. William Pierce is a profoundly deaf individual. He communicates primarily using American Sign Language (“ASL”), which he considers his native language. He relies on sign language interpreters or other auxiliary aids to communicate with people who do not use sign language. Written English is a second language for Mr. Pierce, as it is for many individuals who are born deaf. His proficiency in reading and writing is not at the same level as it would be if he were a hearing person. 7. On February 1, 2012, Mr. Pierce was sentenced in D.C. Superior Court to 60 days in jail for simple assault arising from a domestic dispute. The court also ordered Mr. Pierce to enter and complete domestic violence intervention and to receive mental health and substance abuse assessments. He was admitted to the Correctional Treatment Facility that same day. On information and belief, Mr. Pierce was placed at the Correctional Treatment Facility rather than the D.C. Jail because DOC believed that the Correctional Treatment Facility provided those services and had better accommodations for deaf prisoners. 8. The Correctional Treatment Facility is a medium security facility in the District of Columbia that incarcerates male and female inmates. In 1997, the Corrections Corporation of America (“CCA”), a private prison company, entered into a 20-year contract with the District of Columbia to operate, maintain and manage the Correctional Treatment Facility as an annex to the D.C Jail. That contract obligates CCA to operate the Correctional Treatment Facility in compliance with the Constitution and the laws of the United States and the District of Columbia.

RENFORD, Chief Executive Officer of GRADY HEALTH SYSTEM, in their official capacities, Defendants. FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT I. INTRODUCTION 1. This action is brought by Fulton County Jail inmates infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) whose lives are threatened by the denial of even the most minimal medical care by the defendants. As a result, plaintiffs suffer excruciating and unnecessary pain, develop resistance to life-saving medication, and are needlessly vulnerable to infection, disease, and premature death. 2. The defendants, Fulton County, Correctional Healthcare Solutions, Inc., the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, and their officials and employees, act with deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of HIV-infected inmates in failing to provide these inmates with life-saving HIV medication, adequate and timely treatment for opportunistic infections, access to qualified medical providers, appropriate medical tests and counseling, and palliative care for those who are terminally ill. Through these policies, customs, and practices, defendants deprive HIV-positive inmates of minimally adequate medical treatment. Moreover, because defendants’ mistreatment of inmates leads to the development of drug-resistant strains of HIV, defendants recklessly endanger the lives of not only HIV-infected inmates, but also the general public. 3. Prior to March 1, 1999, the Correctional Healthcare Solutions medical staff at the Fulton County Jail referred HIV-positive inmates to the infectious disease clinic at Grady Hospital. The infectious disease specialists at Grady Hospital provided necessary medical attention and prepared detailed treatment regimens and prescriptions based upon each inmate’s medical condition. The Correctional Healthcare Solutions medical staff at the Jail, however, continuously failed to carry out the prescribed treatment plans of the Grady specialists, thereby endangering the lives and health of HIV-positive inmates. 4. On March 1, 1999, Grady Hospital ceased providing treatment to HIV-positive inmates confined at the Fulton County Jail. As a result, the medical staff at the Jail, which had already failed miserably to follow the regimens prescribed by the Grady infectious disease clinic, is now solely responsible for examining HIV-positive inmates and planning and carrying out their treatment regimens. The County and CHS staff continue to deprive inmates of minimally adequate treatment. As a result, people charged with even minor offenses, and even those who are innocent, may be condemned to a death sentence as a result of the grossly inadequate medical care at the Jail. 5. Defendants’ denial of adequate medical treatment violates plaintiffs’ rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and all HIVpositive persons who are now or will be in the future incarcerated at the Fulton County Jail.

Defendant Marion County Sheriff is located in Marion County, Indiana, and is a political subdivision of the state of Indiana. IV. Facts 8. The Marion County Sheriff has instituted a policy and practice to keep individuals detained in its correctional system for an unreasonable period of time after they have been ordered released or satisfied conditions to be released. 9. The experiences of plaintiffs Michael Driver and Terry Clayton are representative of experiences of numerous detainees. Michael Driver 10. On Saturday, December 13, 2014 Michael Driver was arrested for operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of.08 mg/dl or greater, a Class C Misdemeanor. 11 Mr. Driver was transported to the Arrestee Processing Center and then transferred to the Marion County Jail. 12. A bond was set for Mr. Driver at $1,500. 13 Mr. Driver’s lawyer petitioned the court to lower or eliminate the bond. 14. On Monday, December 15, 2014, at approximately 1:30 p.m., the court having jurisdiction over Mr. Driver held a hearing on his bond reduction motion. The court found that Mr. Driver had only one other very old minor criminal conviction, that he was employed, and that he was not a flight risk. The court then vacated the order setting the bond and ordered Mr. Driver released on his own recognizance. 15. After the hearing, Mr. Driver was returned under guard to the Marion County Jail for processing out of the jail. 16. Rather than being released promptly, Mr. Driver was kept at the jail an additional two days, and not released until Wednesday, December 17, 2014 at approximately 6:00 p.m. 17 Mr. Driver missed two full days of work as a result of the defendant’s practice. Terry Clayton 18. Terry Clayton was a pretrial detainee in the Marion County Jail awaiting trial. 19. On Wednesday, December 10, 2014, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Mr. Clayton’s jury returned a non-guilty verdict in his favor. 20. The judge presiding over the trial informed Mr. Clayton that he would forward paperwork to the Sheriff’s office for Mr. Clayton’s immediate release. 21. Instead of being promptly released, Mr. Clayton was held at the jail for almost another two days and not released until Friday, December 12, 2014 until approximately 4:00 p.m. 22 Mr. Clayton complained about the delay in his release and was told by correctional officers and a correctional sergeant that the jail had 72 hours to release inmates. 23. The experiences of these two individual plaintiffs, of being held past the time they should have been released, is part of a policy, pattern, and practice of the Marion County Sheriff in holding incarcerated persons longer than legally authorized. 24. It is not uncommon for prisoners who have been released by the courts on their own recognizance, paid a bond, found not guilty, or pled guilty for time served, to be held by the Marion County Sheriff longer than legally authorized, including days, past the time they should have been released. 25. A number of individual class members, their family members, and their lawyers, have complained to the sheriff about this practice, but to no avail. 26. The Marion County criminal courts have recognized this as a problem","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] December 2015 | Marion County Sheriff | Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 | 42 U.S.C.<unk>1983 | Southern District of Indiana ||| December 2016 ||| January 2017 ||| February 2017 | ||| March 2018 ||| May 2018 | May 2019 ||| June 2018 | June 2019 | July 2018 | July 2019 | August 2018 | August 2019 | September 2018 | December 2018 | January 2019 | March 2019 | December 2019 | January 2020 | March 2020 | May 2020 | June 2020 | July 2020 | August 2020 | September 2020 | January 2021 | March 2021 | May 2021 | June 2021 | July 2021 | August 2021 | September 2019 | May 2020, June 2020, May 2020, July 2020, March 2020, and August 2020 [ENTITIESCHAIN], December 2015 [ENTities] On December 29, 2015, two individuals filed a class action suit in the United States District Court for the Southern district of Indiana against the Sheriff of Marion County, Indiana.

The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and the parties entered a consent decree.

In the weeks before this lawsuit was filed in the district court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, on April 29, 2005, the jail's population reached a high of 276 prisoners, many of whom were forced to sleep on the floor.  Many of the inmates were awaiting transfer to the Kentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC), which was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.  The KDOC addressed overcrowding at the jail by simply reducing the required floor space for each prisoner from 50 to 40 square feet. This lawsuit, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by attorney Robert B. Newman of the Cincinnati, Ohio, law firm Newman & Meeks, alleged the overcrowding violated the prisoners' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT On April 29, 2005, Plaintiffs, James Hollingsworth, Charles Breckenridge, Khalil Rahim, Thomas Elliott, Tray James, Chance Hall, Jeff Deal, Ron Gregory, Leon Marshall, Danale Sneed, Dennis Marshall, Chris Dale, Walter Long, Keith Lawson, Arthur Singleton, James Davenport, Ed James, Larry Gaines, Rick Steele, Paul Sandman, Anthony Jordan, James Woodruff, Jason Sumpter, Sean Black, Jacob Bowen, James Smith and Dale Myerhoff (hereinafter “Plaintiffs”) filed the above-captioned case against Defendants, Campbell County, Greg Buckler, in his official capacity as Campbell County Jailer and in his individual capacity, and John D. Rees, in his official capacity as Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Correction. Plaintiffs alleged that they were subject to unconstitutional conditions of confinement at the Campbell County Detention Center as a result of the number of inmates housed therein. In addition, Plaintiffs moved to have this proceeding certified as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule 23. Plaintiffs purported to represent “all persons presently and in the future incarcerated in the Campbell County Detention Center” (“the Class”) on their own behalf and on behalf of the Class, Plaintiffs sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, as well as nominal damages. The parties hereby agree that the Class shall consist of all persons presently and in the future incarcerated in the Campbell County Detention Center. Counsel for all parties represent and warrant that they have the authority to enter into this Agreement and Consent Decree. Defendants Campbell County and Buckler acknowledge that the Campbell County Detention Center (“Detention Center”) has experienced periods of time in the last year during which it housed more inmates than it was originally designed to accommodate, given regulations that were in effect when the Detention Center was designed. All of the parties acknowledge that a number of factors have contributed to this situation, many of which are beyond Defendants’ control, including but not limited to: stiffer penalties and more aggressive enforcement efforts for certain crimes such as driving under the influence of alcohol, flagrant non-support, and domestic violence; the length of time required for a criminal case to work its way through the state court system; the inability to transfer inmates to correctional facilities in other counties due to the lack of available space in those facilities; the inability to transfer certain convicted inmates to Campbell County’s less-populated Restricted Custody Center until the Kentucky Department of Corrections appropriately classifies an inmate as eligible for such a transfer; and the Detention Center’s dependence on the Kentucky Department of Corrections to promptly remove convicted and finally sentenced inmates fiom the Detention Center. However, Defendants deny that the number of inmates housed at the Detention Center has ever caused the conditions of confinement at the Detention Center to fall below the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities, which all parties concur is the standard for adjudicating Plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, assert that the number of inmates housed at the Detention Center violates their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This Agreement and Consent Decree represents a mutual effort to resolve Plaintiffs’ concerns about the number of inmates housed at the Detention Center and how they perceive that number to affect the conditions of their confinement, within the financial, practical and other constraints facing the Campbell County Fiscal Court, Buckler and the Department of Corrections as they administer criminaljustice in their respective jurisdictions. 11. COMMITMENT TO SAFE AND CIVILIZED CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT Campbell County is committed to providing safe and civilized conditions of confinement consistent with the constitutional rights of those incarcerated in its jurisdiction, as it has demonstrated even before this action was initiated. In that respect, the parties recognize that Campbell County and Buckler have taken the following steps to reduce the number of inmates housed at the Detention Center: 0 Prior to June 2004, the Detention Center consistently housed between ten and twenty federal prisoners each day, for which Campbell County was paid $36 per prisoner per day. In June 2004, and in an effort to reduce the population at the Detention Center, Campbell County requested that federal corrections officials immediately remove all federal prisoners who were then housed at the Detention Center. From that point forward, Campbell County has refused to accept federal prisoners for lodging at the Detention Center, resulting in a significant loss of available funding for the operation of the Detention Center. Prior to June 2004, the Detention Center consistently housed between 40 and 50 state inmates each month, for which Campbell County was paid $26.51 per felon per day by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. In June 2004, and in an effort to reduce the population at the Detention Center, Campbell County began removing those inmates from the Detention Center, resulting in a significant loss",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] May 2005 | Campbell County Detention Center | Kentucky | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of Kentucky ||| Kentucky Department of Corrections ||| Campbell County |||Plaintiffs ||| May 2006 ||| July 2007 ||| August 2008 ||| September 2009 ||| 2010 ||| 2011 ||| 2012 ||| 2013 |</s>

","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND GREENBELT DIVISION KEITH SETH, DAVID SMITH, MARIO BURCH, and JOHN DOES 1–5, Individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, Plaintiffs-Petitioners, v. MARY LOU MCDONOUGH, In her official capacity as Director of the Prince George’s County Department of Corrections, Defendant-Respondent. Case No. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND PETITION FOR WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241 STATEMENT OF THE CASE 1. There is an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19 at the Prince George’s County Jail (“the Jail”).1 2. The Jail’s actions fueled this outbreak, and it has also failed to take appropriate action in response. 1 Since Defendant McDonough is being sued in her official capacity, “Defendant McDonough” and “the Jail” are used interchangeably in this motion. 3. The prisoners2 housed there—predominantly pretrial detainees—are under a constant and substantial threat of contracting the disease, and those already infected receive grossly substandard medical treatment (if they receive treatment at all). 4. Because jails, prisons, and other detention and correctional facilities are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended basic measures these facilities should take to control the spread of the virus and treat infected prisoners—for example, providing prisoners with free access to soap and evaluating prisoners for symptoms. 5. The Jail has ignored these and other public health recommendations. 6. As a result, the nearly 600 people now imprisoned at the Jail are denied even the minimal precautions necessary to mitigate against the risks of COVID-19. 7. The people confined in the Jail do not have adequate soap (the Jail charges money for it). They regularly wait a week or more for medical attention (that costs money too). The spaces they share with other prisoners are not adequately sanitized. They are denied basic hygienic supplies. Symptomatic inmates are regularly turned away by medical staff, returning to general housing where they will surely infect others. 8. Prisoners who test positive for COVID-19 are confined in filthy isolation cells, where the walls are covered in feces, mucus, and blood. They are barely monitored and receive no real treatment. 9. By maintaining these conditions, Defendant McDonough has needlessly exposed the people imprisoned in the Jail to a highly infectious and potentially fatal disease. This violates prisoners’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. 2 For simplicity, the term “prisoner” is used throughout to describe the people who are currently incarcerated at the Prince George’s County Jail, both pretrial and post-conviction. 10. The Jail also refuses to release COVID-positive prisoners—even when they have no legal basis to detain them—until the Jail deems them non-contagious. This violates prisoners’ Fourteenth Amendment rights. 11. Plaintiffs3 seek class-wide relief requiring the Jail to take the necessary steps to safeguard prisoners’ health and safety. A subset of Plaintiffs also request a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241 for prisoners whose age or underlying medical conditions make them particularly vulnerable to severe illness and death from COVID-19 (the “Medically Vulnerable Subclass”). JURISDICTION AND VENUE 12. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331, 1343(a), and 2241(a). This Court has jurisdiction over Medically Vulnerable Subclass’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241. 13. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) because the events giving rise to the claims asserted in this complaint occurred in this District. PARTIES 14. Plaintiff Keith Seth is detained pretrial in Housing Unit 17 at the Prince George’s County Jail. He has chronic bronchitis for which he was hospitalized last year. He is currently experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, including loss of taste, diarrhea, coughing and severe shortness of breath.

On March 20, 2002, we notified you of our intent to investigate the Detention Center pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (""CRIPA""), 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997. On May 7-10 and 29-31, 2002, we conducted on-site inspections of the facility with expert consultants in corrections, medical care, mental health care, and sexual misconduct/gender issues. While at the Detention Center, we interviewed correctional and administrative staff, inmates, medical and mental health care providers, and programming, training, safety, food service and sanitation personnel. Before, during and after our visit we reviewed an extensive number of documents, including policies and procedures, incident reports, medical and mental health records, inmate grievances, use of force records, and investigative reports. We commend the staff of the facility and the County for their helpful and professional conduct throughout the course of the investigation. The staff have cooperated fully with our investigation and have provided us with substantial assistance. Consistent with the statutory requirements of CRIPA, we write to advise you of the results of this investigation. As described more fully below, we conclude that certain conditions at the Detention Center violate the constitutional rights of inmates. We find that persons confined suffer harm or the risk of serious harm from deficiencies in the facility’s provision of medical and mental health care, suicide prevention, protection of inmates from harm, fire safety, and sanitation. In addition, the facility fails to provide inmates sufficient access to the courts and opportunity to seek redress of grievances. I. BACKGROUND A. FACILITY DESCRIPTION Santa Fe County opened the Detention Center in 1998. Management and Training Corporation (“MTC”), a private corporation, has managed and operated the facility by contract with the County since October 2001. The facility has a housing capacity of approximately 672 inmates. On the first day of our visits to the facility, the total inmate population was 598. There were 532 adult male and 66 adult female inmates. At the time of our visits, the Detention Center housed inmates from nineteen jurisdictions, including federal inmates by agreement with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the United States Marshals Service. Since that time, the facility has entered into a contract to house a large number of inmates from the State of New Mexico Department of Corrections, as well. Inmate housing includes double cells and dormitories. Some inmates are singly housed in double cells. Housing is divided into four housing unit pods of six areas each, centrally managed by a unit control center. The Detention Center also has administrative areas, classrooms, a booking and intake area, four outdoor recreation yards, food service, laundry and medical facilities. Physicians Network Associates (“PNA”) provides the medical care at the facility by subcontract with MTC. B. LEGAL BACKGROUND CRIPA gives the Department of Justice authority to investigate and take appropriate action to enforce the constitutional rights of inmates in jails and prisons. 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997. With regard to sentenced inmates, the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment ""imposes duties on [prison] officials, who must provide humane conditions of confinement; prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care."" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994). Prison officials have a further duty ""to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners."" Id. at 833. The Eighth Amendment protects prisoners not only from present and continuing harm, but from the possibility of future harm as well. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993). It also forbids excessive physical force against prisoners. Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1 (1992). Medical needs which must be met include not only physical health needs, but mental health needs as well. Bowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir. 1977); Young v. City of Augusta ex rel Devaney, 59 F.3d 1160 (11th Cir. 1995). With regard to pre-trial detainees, the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits imposing conditions or practices on detainees not reasonably related to the legitimate governmental objectives of safety, order, and security.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT This is a class action brought on behalf of people with mental disabilities arrested and detained in the Do<unk>a Ana County Detention Center (“DACDC”), to redress violations of their rights by Defendants. There are two groups of Defendants in this matter. The first group includes the Board of County Commissioners for the County of Do<unk>a Ana, which is responsible for all county operations, the Do<unk>a Ana County Detention Center, and Defendant Barela, as well as all John or Jane Doe Defendants involved in the operation of the Do<unk>a Ana County Detention Center (collectively “DACDC Defendants”). The second group of Defendants is comprised of two subgroups (collectively “Law Enforcement Defendants”). The first subgroup of Law Enforcement Defendants includes the City of Las Cruces, Defendant Miyagishima, Defendant Moore, the Las Cruces Police Department, and Defendant Romero, as well as all John and Jane Doe Defendants involved in the operation of the Las Cruces Police Department (collectively “LCPD Defendants”). The second subgroup of Law Enforcement Defendants includes Todd Garrison, the Do<unk>a Ana County Sheriff’s Office, the Board of County Commissioners for the County of Do<unk>a Ana, and all John and Jane Doe Defendants involved in the operation of the Do<unk>a Ana County Sheriff’s Office (collectively “DACSO Defendants”). At least thirty percent of DACDC’s approximately nine hundred detainees have mental disabilities. Yet, the DACDC Defendants have continually and persistently ignored the mental health needs of detainees, and have failed to provide them with constitutionally adequate mental health services. They have never instituted an effective system for making routine, comprehensive assessments of detainees with symptoms of mental illness. Nor have they implemented an effective system for tracking the number and identities of detainees in need of mental healthcare. The DACDC Defendants have failed to provide regular monitoring of detainees’ mental healthcare needs, and have failed to provide Plaintiffs and other detainees with mental disabilities with the treatment they need. Because the DACDC Defendants fail to provide a sufficient range of appropriate treatment options, they rely far too heavily upon the use of segregation for detainees with mental healthcare needs. Although a significant number of detainees in the segregation units exhibit obvious symptoms of serious mental illness, the DACDC Defendants have failed to conduct regular medical or mental health rounds in these units. Nor have they regularly reviewed the mental health status of detainees in segregation, to assess their ongoing treatment needs or the appropriateness of continued segregation. The DACDC Defendants insist on housing detainees with serious mental healthcare needs in segregation, despite the fact that isolation has particularly harmful effects on the mental health of these detainees. The DACDC Defendants have also never engaged in meaningful discharge planning for detainees with mental disabilities. Instead, the DACDC Defendants routinely discharge these persons into the community, without even a prescription or a limited supply of the psychotropic medications they may have been taking in jail, without referrals to community mental health programs, and without any other essential discharge planning services needed to manage their mental illnesses. The predictable result is often recidivism and a cycle of arrests and detentions, at a great personal cost to the individual and at a great financial and social cost to the public at large. The Law Enforcement Defendants are well aware of the DACDC Defendants’ failure to meet the serious mental healthcare needs of detainees. Nevertheless, the Law Enforcement Defendants persist in a discriminatory pattern and practice of arresting persons with mental disabilities and transporting them to DACDC, instead of taking them to appropriate community based services or otherwise diverting them from the criminal justice system. In addition, the Law Enforcement Defendants have failed to reasonably accommodate the mental disabilities of Plaintiffs and other class members","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Ana County Detention Center (DACDC) | District of New Mexico | U.S. District Court | Ana County | Las Cruces | City of Las Cruces (LCPD) | County of Do<unk>a Ana (D.C.) | Defendants | [redacted] This is a class action brought on behalf of people with mental disabilities arrested and detained in the DACDC to redress violations of their rights by Defendants.

THE COUNTY OF LANCASTER, THE LANCASTER COUNTY PRISON BOARD, and JOHN DOES 1 20, Civil Action No. Defendants. Jury Trial Demanded INTRODUCTION This is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights secured to the Plaintiff and the proposed Class under the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States of America. The Lancaster County Prison Board, an agency of the County of Lancaster, has a uniform practice and procedure of strip-searching all individuals who enter the Lancaster County Prison and are placed in prison clothing, regardless of the crime or violation for which they are detained. Upon information and belief, this uniform practice and procedure is, in part, derived from the written procedures of the Lancaster County Prison Board, and was promulgated by senior Board members. It is well established that individuals charged with misdemeanors, summary violations, or other similar charges and/or crimes cannot be strip searched upon entry or transfer to the Lancaster County Prison absent particularized suspicion that those detainees possess weapons or contraband. In short, the uniform practice and procedure of Lancaster County and the Lancaster County Prison Board to force those charged with such crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon transfer and/or entry into the Lancaster County Prison is not only clearly ifiegal, but is insensitive, unnecessary, and offensive. What is particularly troubling is that Defendants have continued to engage in this misconduct notwithstanding an overwhelming number of cases, within this Circuit and others, that have squarely declared these practices to be unlawful and unconstitutional. Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and a class of thousands of others who were unconstitutionally strip searched to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violations of their civil rights. Plaintiff was charged with a nonfelony offense and was subjected to a strip search in violation of his rights against unreasonable searches guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which is made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiff seeks monetary damages for himself and on behalf of the proposed class, a declaration that the Prison Board's uniform practices and procedures are unconstitutional, and an injunction preventing Lancaster County and the Lancaster County Prison Board from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody. With this as a background, Plaintiff complains as follows: JURISDICTION 1. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331, 1341 and 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1981 and 1983. This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the policies of a local government. 2. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to Plaintiff's claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. PARTIES 3. Plaintiff Sajan Kurian (""Kurian"" or ""Plaintiff"") is an adult male individual who resides in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. On or about Tuesday, April 11th, 2006, Kurian was arrested and placed in the Lancaster County Prison for a technical violation of parole for a driving while intoxicated arrest in York County. 4. Defendant County of Lancaster (the ""County"") is a county government organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The County can be served at 50 North Duke Street in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. At all times relevant hereto, the County, acting through its Prison Board, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Lancaster County Prison and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Prison Board personnel, including those working in the Lancaster County Prison. In addition, at all relevant times, the County was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Lancaster County Prison, and for ensuring that Prison Board personnel employed in the Prison obey the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 5.

FACTUAL ALLEGAnONS ON THE MERITS 10. Northampton County Prison (""NCP"") has a history of inhumane conditions and recklessly indifferent administration and staffing. 11. As a result, the prison has become a breeding ground for disease. 12. Due to Defendants' actions and inactions over the past years, the prison has experienced repeated outbreaks of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (hereinafter, ""MRSA""), a potentially deadly bacterial infection that is resistant to certain antibiotics. 13. According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, MRSA infections occur in otherwise healthy people. 14. MRSA often first appears as a pimple or boil which can become red, swollen, and extremely painful; as it advances, the boils often have pus or other drainage and result in the formation of a mass below the surface of the skin. 15. Drainage of skin boils or abscesses requires the attention of a healthcare provider. 16. Once a MRSA boil drains and the mass is removed, a hole is left behind and becomes a scar which deforms the affected area. 17. More serious infections may cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, surgical wound infections, and death. 18. Factors associated with the spread of MRSA skin infections include exposure to contaminated items and surfaces, crowded living conditions, exposure to dirty and unsanitary living environments, and openings in the skin such as cuts and abrasions. Prison Conditions 19.

THE COUNTY OF DAUPHIN, Defendant. Civil Action Number CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT JURY TRIAL DEMANDED INTRODUCTION This is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendant County of Dauphin of rights secured to the Plaint iffs and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States of Am erica. Da uphin County has a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the Dauphin County Prison a nd are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon which they are charged, and has had such a policy during the duration of the class period proposed in this com plaint. Upon inform ation and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from the written procedures of Dauphin County, and was promulgated by senior Dauphin County Prison officials. It is well established in this judicial circuit that individuals charged with misdemeanors or summary offenses cannot be strip-searched absent particularized reasonable suspicion that they possess weapons or contraband. In short, the policy of Dauphin County to force those charged with minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Dauphin County Prison is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class of thousands of others who were strip search ed after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violatio n of their civil righ ts and those of t he class m embers they propose to represent. Plaintiffs were all charged with summary offenses, and all were subjected to a strip search, in violation of their rights against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Cons titution. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for them selves and each member of the proposed class, a declaratio n that the D auphin County Prison policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding Dauphin County from continuing to violate the rights of th ose placed into th eir custody. W ith this as a background, Plaintiffs complains as follows: JURISDICTION 1.

This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, as it is filed to obtain de claratory relief relative to the Constitutionality of the policies of a loca l government. 2.

ALLEGHENY COUNTY; ORLANDO HARPER, Warden of Allegheny County Jail, Defendants-Respondents. Case No. 20-496 ELECTRONICALLY FILED IMMEDIATE RELIEF SOUGHT CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. Petitioner-Plaintiffs are three individuals held at Allegheny County Jail (“ACJ”) who have a serious pre-existing medical condition which the United States Centers for Disease Control has determined puts them at significantly higher risk of severe disease and death if they contract COVID-19. They claim that the conditions of confinement now existing at ACJ create a heightened and unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19 for any person confined at the jail and a substantial risk of severe illness or death for those who are elderly and/or medically vulnerable to COVID-19. They bring this class action claim seeking immediate release of all individuals 55 and older and those with medical conditions that place them at heightened risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19, which would both remove these individuals from a life threatening situation at the jail and permit social distancing measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public health officials to be implemented for those remaining at the jail. Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief to require Defendants to comply with recommended safety and health measures to prevent the spread of the virus for those confined at the jail, which they are unconscionably not now implementing. For example, Defendant Harper blatantly disregarded those recommendations when, after the release of 600 people from the jail, has closed an entire floor of ACJ, consolidating, rather than distancing, the remaining population at ACJ. 2. Prisons and jails are quickly becoming the epicenter of COVID-19 in cities throughout the country, including New York, Chicago and Philadelphia. ACJ is poised to join these ignoble ranks due to the congregate nature of jails, exacerbated by ACJ’s unnecessary crowding, inadequate sanitation, denial of hygiene products and non-existent quarantine procedures. The current conditions at ACJ create an extreme risk for rapid, uncontrollable spread of COVID-19 throughout the facility with grave outcomes for both the incarcerated population and the surrounding communities. 3. A substantial number of people currently held at ACJ face serious risks of life- threatening injury due to their age and/or underlying medical conditions. Issuing a writ of habeas corpus, a foundational element of the constitutional order, is both a proper and essential action to prevent unnecessary loss of life. 4. For those who remain incarcerated at ACJ, conditions must be substantially altered to accord with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations for social distancing and enhanced sanitation and hygiene practices. Defendants must immediately be enjoined to eliminate double-celling; provide adequate hygiene supplies; ensure that increased sanitation practices conform to CDC standards; conduct recreation and meal service in a manner that allows for appropriate social distancing; and require the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for staff and all incarcerated people. 5. Accordingly, Petitioners/Plaintiffs, on behalf of classes of persons incarcerated at the ACJ, bring this action and request immediate release of all Petitioners/Plaintiffs and medically vulnerable individuals, coupled with appropriate support and conditions upon release, as informed by public health expertise. If this Court does not grant immediate release on the basis of this Petition-Complaint, Petitioners/Plaintiffs request a hearing as soon as possible. Given the exponential spread of COVID-19, there is no time to spare. I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6. Petitioners/Plaintiffs bring this putative class action pursuant to 22 U.S.C. <unk>2241, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983, 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, 2202, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12101 et seq.

The plaintiff alleged that the defendant violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments in failing to prevent the spread of scabies in the prison. The case is ongoing. The plaintiff has not yet filed a motion to certify class.,"IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE AT NASHVILLE JOHN DOE, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, Civil Action No. Plaintiffs. CLASS ACTION V. CORECIVIC OF TENNESSEE, LLC f/k/a CORRECTIONS CORPORATION OF AMERICA Defendant. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT COMES NOW the Plaintiff, John Doe, individually and on behalf of all others similarly sitiated, and for their causes of action against the Defendant would allege as follows: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. The Plaintiff and the proposed class, as defined in Paragraphs 74 et seq., include those individuals currently and formerly housed at the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility in. Davidson County, Tennessee, a private prison owned and operated by CoreCivic, an entity formerly doing business as Corrections Corporation of America (""CCA""). During the time of incarceration, the Plaintiff and proposed class were entirely dependent on the Defendants to provide them with access to basic health care. However, they have been, and with regard to those still incarcerated, continue to be deprived of access to basic healthcare. 2. Plaintiff files this Class Action seeking damages on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated due to the Defendant's deliberate indifference to their serious medical needs while they were incarcerated, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and their prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. 3. Plaintiff and all Class Members were exposed to Sarcoptes scabiei (hereafter ""Scabies"") caused by the spread ofparasitic mites. Scabies is most easily transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, bedding, clothing and towels. Female mites burrow under the skin, lay their eggs at the end of the tunneled burrows, and larvae hatch two to three days after the eggs are laid. The mites cause intense itching, which facilitates re-infestation and skin eruptions that transfer the mites to new hosts. 4. Defendant operates a private for-profit prison and therefore had direct control of the prisoners and detainees in its charge infected with scabies. The Defendant deliberately failed to adequately screen those entering its facility, respond to inmate requests for medical attention, treat those infested with the parasite, quarantine the infected individuals in its care, or to take any other precautions to prevent the spread of scabies outside the facility. This caused a foreseeable and preventable systematic outbreak which spread to the Plaintiff and all others similarly situated. THE PARTIES 5. Plaintiff John Doe is a citizen of the State of Tennessee and a resident ofDavidson County, Tennessee. He is a former inmate who was housed in the Defendant's facility in Davidson County. Plaintiff wishes to use the pseudonym ""John Doe"" because he fears retaliation. 6. The Defendant, CoreCivic of Tennessee, LLC, f/k/a Corrections Corporation of American (""CCA""), is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Tennessee, with its principal place of business located at 10 Burton Hills Blvd., Nashville, TN 37215. CoreCivic's registered agent for process in the State of Tennessee is C T Corporation System, 800 S. Gay St., Suite 2021, Rnoxville, TN 37929-9710. The Defendant owns and operates the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility, housing prisoners sentenced to confinement in the Tennessee Department of Correction. As such, CCA performs a public function traditionally reserved to the state and is therefore subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 seeking to redress a deprivation of the Plaintiffs' rights by the Defendants acting under color of law, which rights are secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 8. This complaint concerns the violation of civil rights, and this Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343. 9. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claims pursuant to 28 10. All of the claims alleged herein arose in the Middle District of Tennessee, and Venue is therefore proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391. ALLEGATIONS OF FACT 11. As the allegations of this Complaint will demonstrate, the Defendant refused to provide the healthcare needed and requested by Plaintiff and members of the class. The Defendant refused to provide access to doctors and necessary medicine to treat the scabies infestation of the inmate population, during which time the infestation spread and the Plaintiff class's condition worsened. 12. In the Winter and Spring of 2017, there was a scabies outbreak in the Defendant's 1,300bed jail facility in Nashville, Tennessee. The outbreak spread through various facilities in and around Nashville, Tennessee, which infested inmates, detainees, and those likely to come in contact with them, including court staff in Davidson County.

Plaintiffs sought class action certification to represent children subject to solitary confinement in DJJ-run detention centers. The defendant's summary judgment motion on the merits was denied on December 6, 2019, and the case is in ongoing mediation talks.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA TALLAHASSEE DIVISION G.H., a minor, by and through his parent and legal guardian, GREGORY HENRY; R.L., a minor, by and through her parent and legal guardian, ANGEL CARTER; B.W., a minor, by and through her parent and legal guardian, LEROI LUZUNARIS; on behalf of themselves and all persons similarly situated, Case No.: Plaintiffs, v. SIMONE MARSTILLER, in her official capacity as Secretary of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice; and the FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE, an agency of the State of Florida, CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Subjecting children to solitary confinement and depriving them of even minimal meaningful social interaction can cause trauma, depression, and anxiety, increase the risk of suicide and self-harm, and permanently interfere with children’s development. Despite these well-known risks of serious harm, the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) isolates thousands of children in solitary confinement every year. The risk of harm for children begins immediately when they are isolated in solitary confinement. 2. Solitary confinement is unnecessary, unproductive, and can be permanently damaging to the individuals subjected to it. A national consensus is emerging that solitary confinement poses a risk of harm for anyone, but is especially harmful for children, who are still developing physically, psychologically, and socially. For children with mental illness, developmental disabilities, or histories of trauma, the risk of harm from isolation is even greater. Among other authorities, the U.S. Department of Justice, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care have recognized that solitary confinement is harmful and should be eliminated for children. 3. The named Plaintiffs, and the class they seek to represent, are, or will be, subject to solitary confinement, in one of the 21 DJJ-operated secure detention centers (Secure Detention) throughout the state. They bring this action to address the violations of their rights. 4. DJJ, through policy and practice, subjects children to solitary confinement, often the same child repeatedly, without any time limit, to manage their behavior as a first response to any situation. In solitary, children spend hours or days behind locked steel doors in tiny cells. DJJ denies them access to outdoor recreation and schooling, and deprives them of normal human interactions. Children have nothing to do while in solitary confinement but cry, sit idly, bang on the door, yell to try to get the staff’s attention, or sleep. DJJ requires them to eat in their tiny cells next to toilets smelling of, and contaminated by, human waste. The cumulative effect of these deprivations in isolation presents a substantial risk of serious harm to these children, all of whom are vulnerable due to their continuing development. 5. DJJ subjects children with mental illness, who have engaged in selfharming behaviors, or are at risk for suicide, to solitary confinement despite their heightened risk for harm. DJJ fails to provide a mental health examination prior to confinement or meaningful mental health treatment during confinement to prevent the onset or exacerbation of mental illness and reduce the risk of suicide. DJJ’s failure to provide even these basic mental health services is especially troubling considering the strong correlation between isolation and the risk of suicide in juvenile detention: fifty percent (50%) of youth who committed suicide in juvenile facilities were in isolation for behavioral sanctions at the time of their death. DJJ is not only aware of this risk of serious harm to children, it has actually studied it, yet still refuses to take appropriate and necessary actions to prevent it. 6. Depriving a child of meaningful social interaction, programming, or mental stimulation is harmful and counterproductive to the goals of ensuring the safety and security of juvenile facilities. For these reasons, there is a national trend among juvenile and correctional entities to eliminate or dramatically reduce disciplinary or punitive isolation for juveniles and, instead, use more appropriate techniques for managing behavior. These entities use very brief, short-term separation of a youth from others, if at all, and only as a last resort when other options fail to de-escalate situations which pose an acute immediate risk of physical harm to the youth or others. During these brief separations, youth receive mental health services, access to basic necessities, programming, and procedural safeguards such as individualized assessments, supervisory approvals, and reviews. Despite the national shift away from using solitary confinement based on a consensus among scientific, medical, and mental health professionals about the psychological and physiological risks of serious harm, DJJ has ignored these risks and continues to subject children in secure detention centers to frequent and repeated solitary confinement. 7. Defendant Simone Marstiller is aware of and has deliberately disregarded the substantial risk of harm to the rights of Plaintiffs, and other similarly situated children, by authorizing and subjecting them to illegal conditions of confinement, including a policy and practice of using harmful solitary confinement in violation of the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) | Florida | U.S. District Court | Northern District of Florida ||| March 2015 ||| May 2016 ||| June 2017 ||| July 2018 ||| August 2018 | July 2019 ||| September 2019 | July 2020 | July 2021 | August 2019 | August 2020 | September 2020 | August 2021 | July 2022 | August 2022 | September 2021 | September 2022 | June 2021 | June 2022 | July 2020, July 2020, August 2020, and August 2020 [ENTITIESCHAIN], March 2015, a group of children in Florida's juvenile detention center filed this class action lawsuit on behalf of children subject to solitary confinement.

This case was brought to retain jurisdiction of the district court of Hawaii's jurisdiction over the case until a final order is entered to dismiss the case with prejudice. ","The Honorable Linda Lingle Governor, State of Hawaii Executive Chambers State Capitol Honolulu, HI 96813 Re: Investigation of the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility, Kailua, Hawaii Dear Governor Lingle: I am writing to report the findings of the Civil Rights Division’s investigation of the conditions at the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility (“HYCF”) in Kailua, Hawaii. On August 16, 2004, we notified you of our intent to conduct an investigation of HYCF pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997, and the pattern or practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. <unk>14141 (“Section 14141”). CRIPA and Section 14141 give the Department of Justice authority to seek remedies for any pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of children in juvenile justice institutions. From October 5, 2004 to October 8, 2004, we conducted an on-site inspection of HYCF aided by our expert consultant in the field of juvenile justice. We interviewed administrators, the acting correctional supervisor, youth corrections supervisors, youth correctional officers (“YCOs”), medical staff, mental health staff, educators, social workers and youth at HYCF. On October 26, 2004, we conducted individual interviews with each of the girls from HYCF temporarily placed at the Salt Lake Valley Detention Center (“SLVDC”) in West Salt Lake City, Utah, regarding the conditions at HYCF. Before, during, and after our tour, we reviewed an extensive number of documents including, but not limited to, incident reports, juvenile correctional records, youth grievances, discipline records, medical files, mental health progress notes, shift logs, staff training materials, and school records. Consistent with our commitment to provide technical assistance and conduct a transparent investigation, we provided two extensive de-briefings following our tour: one with Sharon Agnew, the Executive Director of the Office of Youth Services (“OYS”), and Kaleve Tofono-Iosefa, the Administrator of HYCF; and another with Attorney General Mark Bennett, then-First Deputy Attorney General Richard T. Bissen, Jr., and Ms Agnew. During the de-briefings our consultant expressed his initial impressions and concerns, and attorneys for the Civil Rights Division also presented their discoveries regarding dangerous suicide risks at the facility. Shanetta Y. Cutlar, Chief of the Special Litigation Section, sent an October 15, 2004 letter to Mr. Bissen documenting suicide hazards at HYCF and requesting that the State of Hawaii (“State”) take immediate remedial action.1 We commend the Administrator and her staff at HYCF, as well as Ms. Agnew and administrators at OYS, for their helpful and professional conduct throughout the course of our investigation. The State granted immediate and unfettered access to HYCF, permitted us to interview the staff and residents, and provided all documents we requested regarding the facility and the youth confined there. We also appreciate the State’s receptiveness to our consultant’s on-site recommendations. Indeed, we note that Hawaii has stated that it has implemented a number of the recommendations. Consistent with the statutory requirements of CRIPA, we now write to inform you of the findings of our investigation, the facts supporting them, and the minimum remedial steps that are necessary to address the deficiencies we have identified. As more fully described below, we conclude that certain deficiencies violate the constitutional and federal statutory rights of the youth confined at HYCF. In particular, we find that youth confined at HYCF suffer harm or risk of harm from constitutional deficiencies in the facility’s confinement practices, suicide prevention procedures, and provision of access to mental health Mr. Bissen responded to Ms. Cutlar’s letter on November 23, 2004. In his letter, Mr. Bissen identified remedial measures the State had taken to address our concerns. and medical care services. We also find that the State fails to provide access to required education services pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. <unk>1401, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. <unk>794.

HYCF, a 71-bed facility, is comprised of two separate facilities with three housing units: two boys’ housing units and a girls’ housing unit. With certain exceptions, HYCF houses boys confined for long terms at the main secure custody facility (“SCF”) and places boys adjudicated for short terms at the Ho’okipa Makai (“Ho’okipa”), a cottage unit located approximately one-quarter mile from the main facility.2 The SCF is comprised of a central courtyard surrounded by three housing modules, with ten cells and a common area in each module, a school, a gymnasium, kitchen facilities, offices for administrative and medical staff, and two isolation cells. Ho’okipa has two dormitories, with bunk-bed space for 12 boys in one room and six boys in the other, and","<pad>In 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division conducted an investigation of the conditions at the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility (HYCF) in Kailua, Hawaii.

Prior to the Department of Justice investigations of Scioto and Marion, the State hired a team of expert consultants, led by Mr. Fred Cohen, to evaluate the Shortly thereafter, on April 15, 2005, we notified you of our intent to conduct an investigation of the Marion Juvenile Correctional Facility in Marion, Ohio (“Marion”) regarding similar issues. Our findings regarding Marion are addressed in a separate letter. constitutional conditions at the girls’ section of the Scioto facility.2 Mr. Cohen issued an Interim Report on August 16, 2004 and an Action Plan on September 28, 2004. In each of these documents, Mr. Cohen found constitutional deficiencies in the areas of protection from harm, medical care, mental health care, grievances, and provision of special education. The State agreed to adopt and stipulate to Mr. Cohen’s findings, for the purpose of our investigation, and to apply those findings to the entire Scioto facility and the Marion facility. Given the State’s stipulation that the conditions identified in our March 16, 2005 notice letter are constitutionally deficient, we agreed to conduct limited facility tours.3 On June 29-July 1, 2005, we conducted an on-site inspection of Scioto, accompanied by expert consultants in mental health care and medical care. During our inspections, we interviewed mental health providers, medical providers, other staff, youth residents, and facility administrators. Before, during, and after our visit, we reviewed an extensive number of documents, including policies and procedures, mental health records, youth detention records, unit logs, and orientation materials. Consistent with our commitment to provide technical assistance and conduct a transparent investigation, we conducted an exit conference with facility staff and Ohio Department of Youth Services officials upon the conclusion of the tour, during which our expert consultants conveyed their initial impressions and concerns. Although the main Scioto facility houses female youth, a separate section of the facility acts as state-wide intake for all male youth. This investigation is anomalous because Mr. Cohen's 2004 factual findings regarding the conditions of confinement at Scioto revealed significant deficiencies in each of the areas that were the subject of our investigation and because the State has stipulated to all of Mr. Cohen's generally well-supported findings. Together, these factors created the unusual circumstance in which it was not necessary for the Department to conduct a facility tour regarding each of the specific subject areas of our investigation. However, we did tour Scioto regarding areas in which we required additional factual information to make a thorough and complete finding or to frame appropriate corrective measures. For example, as Mr. Cohen's 2004 report is admittedly not thorough regarding its assessment of medical and mental health care, we reviewed these subjects on- site with expert consultants before issuing our findings. We commend the Scioto staff for their helpful, courteous, and professional conduct throughout the course of this investigation. We also wish to express our appreciation for the cooperation of Ohio Department of Youth Services officials and staff. Consistent with our statutory obligation under CRIPA, we set forth below the findings of our investigation, the facts supporting them, and the minimum remedial steps that are necessary to address the deficiencies we have identified. As described below, we conclude that youth confined at Scioto suffer harm or the risk of harm from constitutional deficiencies as to: protecting residents from harm; certain discrete elements of medical care; mental health care; grievances; and special education services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are pleased to report that our review indicates that Scioto’s general medical programs are, for the most part, good. In particular we find that Scioto’s medical quality improvement program, environmental conditions, and management of special dietary needs for youth are appropriate.

Jury Demanded FILED NOV 0 1 2000 COMPLAINT Plaintiff Jodie Smook, by her parents, Vicky and Randy Smook, and by counsel, complains of defendants Miunehaha County, South Dakota, James Banbury, individually and as Director of the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center (""Juvenile Detention Center""), and individual John and Jane Doe Officers, as follows: NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. This action is brought pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983, (""Section 1983""), and the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, seeking to redress the defendants' unlawful policy and practice of strip searching minors without probable cause and questioning them regarding their religious beliefs and practices. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343. 3. Venue is proper because all of the defendants reside or are located in the District of South Dakota, Southern Division and all of the conduct complained of occurred within this District. PARTIES 4. Plaintiff Jodie Smook (""Smook"") is a minor who resides with her parents, Vicky Smook and Randy Smook, in Luverne, Minnesota. 5. Defendant Minnehaha CollOty is and, at all times relevant to this cause of action, was a political subdivision of the State of South Dakota that operates, manages, directs and controls the Minnehaha CollOty Juvenile Detention Center. Defendant James Banbury, at a1l times relevant to this cause of action, was Director of the Minnehaha CollOty Juvenile Detention Center who, upon information and belief, had final authority to establish certain policies for the Detention Center including but not limited to policies concerning the strip searching and questioning of minors detained and/or arrested. Banbury is sued in his individual capacity for his llOlawful acts llOder color of law. 7. John and Jane Doe Detention Center Officers are the officers, employees and agents of the other defendants who conducted the unlawful strip search in the Minnehaha CollOty Juvenile Detention Center. CLASS ALLEGATIONS 8. Smook brings this action in an individual capacity and as a representative of a1l others similarly situated minors who have been arrested for alleged violations of curfew laws or other minor offenses and detained at the Minnehaha County Detention Center and strip searched (Count I) and/or questioned about their religious beliefs or practices (CollOt II). 10. Questions of fact and/or law exist which are common to all members of the putative classes. These questions include, but are not limited to: a. Whether the defendants' conduct was violative of the laws and protections of the United States of America and/or the State of South Dakota; b. Whether the defendants' conduct is the subject of injunctive relief; and c. What is the proper measure of damages and other remedies for the defendants' violations of law II. The plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect and represent the interest of the classes. Plaintiff seeks no relief antagonistic or adverse to the members of either class. Plaintiffs rights and damages suffered are typical of all members of each class. The defendants have acted or have refused to act on grounds applicable to each entire class. Plaintiffs counsel are able and experienced in the prosecution of class actions. 12. A class action is the only appropriate method for the adjudication of this controversy. Individual actions by individual members would create a risk of inconsistent results and would be unnecessary and duplicative of this litigation. Such individual actions would work a hardship on each and every member of each class and the court system. STATEMENT OF CLAIMS 13. On August 8,1999, Smook, who was 16-years-old at the time, and three other minor female friends were detained by Sioux Falls Police after having car trouble. It was after 11 :00 p.m., which was the beginning of the curfew period for persons nnder the age of 18 in Sioux Falls. 14. The police officers handcuffed Smook and the other young women and transported them to the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center. 15. At the Detention Center, Smook and the other girls were questioned about their religious beliefs and practices, and ordered to answer those questions as part of the detention process. 16. After being questioned, the plaintiff and each of her three friends were individually ordered into a bathroom and strip searched at the direction ofthe Juvenile Detention Center's personnel. 17.

WARRING, Commissioner of the Division of Medical Assistance, Defendants. COMPLAINT I. INTRODUCTION 1. Rosie D., Tyriek H., Joshua D., Sheena M., Devin E., Anton B., Nathan F., Shaun E., and Jerry N. are Medicaid-eligible children who have been screened and diagnosed with behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric disabilities, but who are not being provided with the preventive and rehabilitative treatment required by the federal Medicaid program. 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396a et seq. In particular, each child needs and has requested more appropriate mental health services, but is not receiving intensive home-based mental health services, including behavioral support services, psychiatric and other clinical services, professionally acceptable assessments, crisis services, and case management (hereafter, collectively, ""intensive home-based services""), in order to treat or ameliorate their impairments. Most have been hospitalized because of the lack of intensive home-based services. Each has been and is being harmed because s/he is not receiving medically necessary, intensive home-based services. 2. The nine named plaintiffs are part of a class of similarly disabled and needy children who are eligible for, but have not been promptly assessed and considered for, intensive home-based services. The class includes thousands of children who have been hospitalized or are at risk of hospitalization because of the absence of intensive home-based services. The individual plaintiffs and those like them are either forced to leave their families and communities in order to obtain the very limited, episodic mental health services which have been made available by the defendants, or are compelled to forego these limited and unduly restrictive services altogether, leaving them with inadequate treatment and supports. 3. As Medicaid-eligible children under the age of 21, the plaintiffs are entitled to receive Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment Services (EPSDT services), which include <unk>necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures <unk>to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services <unk>.<unk>42 U.S.C. <unk>1396d(r)(5). The defendants have failed to establish an adequate and effective screening and assessment process for children with behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric conditions. The plaintiffs are eligible for and would benefit from intensive homebased mental health services. Nevertheless, they are not receiving these Medicaid-covered services which are necessary to treat their conditions in a manner that allows them to remain with their families and in their home communities and thus avoid unnecessary and often harmful institutionalization. 4. In violation of federal law, the defendants have failed to provide these medically necessary, intensive home-based services to the plaintiffs at all, let alone in a timely manner. As a result of the defendants' actions and inactions, many of the most vulnerable children in the Commonwealth who have behavioral, emotional, and psychiatric impairments are inadequately assessed and denied the care and medically necessary treatment which they desperately need to function successfully in the community, including case management, crisis, and in-home supports. The denial of these medically necessary services at a critical point in the plaintiffs' development has caused and will continue to cause serious, long term, and potentially irreversible harm. 5. The plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive relief ordering the defendants to provide the intensive home-based services that the plaintiffs need and that they are entitled to receive in accordance with federal law II.

Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Office of the Assistant Attorney General Washington, D C. 20530 The Honorable Haley R. Barbour Governor State of Mississippi Walter Sillers Building, 19th Floor 550 High Street Jackson, MS 39021 Re: United States' Investigation of the State of Mississippi's Service System for Persons with Mental Illness and Developmental Disabilities Dear Governor Barbour: The United States has completed its investigation of the State of Mississippi's system for delivering services and supports to thousands ofpersons with mental illness and/or developmental disabilities I (""DD""). This letter is a report of our findings. Our review reveals that the State of Mississippi has failed to meet its obligations under Title II of the Amel;lcans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""), 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131-12134, and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R pt. 35, by unnecessarily institutionalizing persons with mental illness or DD in public and private facilities and failing to ensure that they are offered a meaningful opportunity to live in integrated community settings consistent with their needs. The United States looks forward to working with the State of Mississippi to develop an appropriate remedy to resolve these concerns. During our investigation, we assessed the State's compliance with the ADA, as interpreted in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), requiring that individuals with disabilities, including mental illness and developmental disabilities, receive services and supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. The Department has authority to seek a remedy for violations of Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12133; 28 C.F.R. <unk>35.170-174, 190(e). We also initiated our investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights ofInstitutionalized Persons Act (""CRIPA""), 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997, which authorizes the Onited States to seek a remedy for conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of individuals with disabilities who are in public institutions. Under CRIPA, we assessed the State's compliance with other federal laws, 1 In this letter, we use the global term ""developmental disabilities"" or ""DD"" to include people with an intellectual and/or developmental disability, including, but not limited to, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, autism, as well as acquired brain injury. including the Medicaid portion of the Social Security Act, and its Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (“EPSDT”) provisions, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396 et seq and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. <unk>1400 et seq. In our investigation, we did not assess or reach conclusions about the quality of clinical care in the various facilities and programs, focusing instead on potential issues related to the unnecessary segregation of people with disabilities. In accordance with the statutory requirements under CRIPA, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997b(a), the implementing regulations of the ADA, 28 C.F.R. <unk>35.172(a), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000d-1, this letter provides notice of the State’s failure to comply with federal law, most notably, by failing to provide services to individuals with mental illness and/or developmental disabilities in the most integrated setting as required by the ADA. We have also set forth in this letter the steps Mississippi needs to take to meet its obligations under federal law. By implementing the remedies below, the State will correct identified ADA and other unlawful deficiencies, fulfill its commitment to individuals with disabilities, and spend taxpayer dollars far more effectively. We would like to express our appreciation to the State for its cooperation. We would like to acknowledge the consistent hospitality, courtesy, and professionalism shown to us by State officials and staff at all levels and at all times. It was evident that State personnel regularly demonstrated true concern for and commitment to the people they serve. It was a pleasure for us to meet the individual board members on the Mississippi Board of Mental Health, led by Board Chair Robert Landrum. We would also like to extend a special thanks to DMH Executive Director LeGrand for repeatedly taking time out of his busy schedule to meet with us, and for generally facilitating our review. We hope to continue to work with the State in the same cooperative and collaborative manner as we work to resolve our findings. I. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS “I’m really wanting to get out.” These words were spoken to DOJ civil rights investigators by a person confined to a Mississippi facility. They illustrate the urgency of our findings. Thousands of Mississippi residents with mental illness or developmental disabilities are institutionalized. While confined in these institutions, they are segregated from non-disabled persons and lead lives of limited choice or independence. They are deprived of meaningful opportunities to choose friends, participate in employment, or make choices about activities, food or living arrangements.

Civ P. 12(b)(1) and (6). Preliminary Statement The amended complaint purports to state causes of action under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (“FHA”), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the “Rehab Act”). However, plaintiff’s claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment, except insofar as plaintiff seeks prospective injunctive relief against the individual defendants. Plaintiff’s claims under the FHA are also barred by her lack of standing under that statute, since the College’s provision of free housing to plaintiff is not a sale or rental within the meaning of the Fair Housing Act, which applies only to transactions for “consideration.” The Amended Complaint also fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Plaintiff is not “otherwise qualified” under the Rehab Act or Title II of the ADA, for residence within the Hunter College dormitory, because she engaged in conduct that violates the school’s housing contract and demonstrates a lack of capacity for independent living. Moreover, the decision to remove plaintiff from College housing does not rest on her disability, which her doctor diagnoses as Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Rather, plaintiff’s removal from housing was pursuant to the Hunter College Housing Contract, which was triggered by her attempted suicide. The policy applies equally to disabled and to nondisabled students who engage in such conduct. A suicide attempt may occur in an array of circumstances, such as intoxication or a romantic breakup, which have nothing to do with a mental disability. To the extent that plaintiff’s claim rests on an allegation of discrimination on the basis of the severity of her disability, the courts have recognized that there is no cause of action for discrimination based on the severity of a disability. Finally, the ADA and the Rehab Act does not provide a right of action for punitive damages; accordingly, plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages must be dismissed.

Peabody, Jr. Assistant Attorney General ft Chief Civil Rights Divisionv* Special ""Eltigation Section Introduction We recommend initiation of an investigation into conditions of confinement at the Memphis Mental Health Institute (MMHI) in Memphis, Tennessee, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. Section 1997. The information we have obtained indicates that conditions at MMHI deprive residents there of their constitutional rights. These conditions include inadequate psychiatric care and treatment, inadequate supervision of patients and neglect caused, at least in part, by an inadequate number of professional and direct care staff. Other allegations suggest general medical care deficiencies, including overuse and misuse of medication, and an unsafe and unsanitary environment. These conditions may be subjecting MMHI residents to undue bodily restraint and undue risks to personal safety as well as denying them of their constitutional rights to adequate medical care and reasonable safety Cf. Youngberg v Romeo. 457 U.S. 307 (1982). Background The Memphis Mental Health Institute is located in northern Memphis. The facility is approximately 27-30 years old and serves a population of 160-175 patients. There are presently 217 beds at the facility although there are plans to reduce that number by 44 beds. 1/ Although currently certified by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), an October 1989 report following a review of the facility by HCFA surveyors cited major problems. 2/ 1/ The Commercial Appeal, July 15, 1990, at p.Bl. 2/ Although MMHI is currently HCFA certified, such certification does not conclusively determine whether a facility meets constitutional standards. See Woe v Cuomo. 729 F.2d 96 (2d Cir. 1984), cert, denied. 105 S.Ct. 339 (1984). The HCFA Survey Report is dated October 3 0-31, 1989. Sources of Information Allegations regarding alleged inadequate conditions at MMHI first came to our attention when attorneys traveled to Memphis to conduct investigatory activities at the Arlington Developmental Center. During the course of the Arlington investigation, numerous allegations of grossly inadequate conditions of confinement at MMHI came to our attention. We obtained further information from a variety of sources including a 1989 HCFA report of MMHI, interviews with present and former members of the staff at MMHI and parents of MMHI patients and former patients, numerous articles from the local newspaper xn Memphis, documents from the Alliance for the Mentally 111 (AMI) of Memphis, and documents from the facility itself from present and former employees. Inadequate Supervision and Unsafe Environment Our information indicates that there are insufficient numbers of qualified professional and direct care staff to adequately supervise residents. Because of these deficiencies, MMHI appears to be unable to protect its residents from harm. Based on our information, environmental conditions at MMHI also endanger the health of residents. The failure to have sufficient numbers of staff has resulted in physical harm to patients. A parent of a former patient told us that her daughter was raped and that the facility has been trying to cover up the incident since it occurred. 3/ The patient had been admitted to MMHI only a short time before the incident. A local rape crisis center confirmed that the patient had, in fact, been raped. The patient's mother believes the rape to have resulted directly from the inadequate supervision of patients due to insufficient staff at MMHI. 4/ The facility did not contact the patient's parents until the day after the incident and refused to allow the patient go to a rape crisis center until after the police intervened in the matter. 5/ The sister of another former patient also informed us of a sexual incident at the facility. 6/ The source's sister was 2/ Telephone interview with Joanne Woodford, mother of a former MMHI patient, August 30, 199 0. 4/ Id. 5/ Id. 6/ Telephone interview with Diane Billings, sister of a former patient at MMHI, August 13, 1990. have been fired due to their own drug abuse and mental illnesses. 15/ The shortage of staff members and the lack of training for the facility personnel continue to be primary concerns of our sources. As one source stated, ""MMHI is one of the worst institutions in the South"" and also that she believes that ""very few patients are actually helped by receiving treatment there."" 16/ Many of our sources indicated that the staff seems inadequately trained to handle even minor situations at the facility and is generally ineffective in helping the patients. 17/ Additionally, one former employee of MMST told us that he was criticized by the MMHI Joy the administration for being ""too involved and overly concerned about his patients."" Furthermore, he alleges that often patients are intimidated and threatened by the staff and that the overall attitude of the staff toward patients is ""deplorable."" 18/ This source stated that many employees are","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Memphis Mental Health Institute (MMHI) | U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee | Memphis ||||| August 1, 1990 ||| September 30, 2000 ||| December 31, 2000 .<n>On August 1, 1990, the United States Department of Justice (D.C.) filed this complaint against the Memphis mental health facility.

On February 19, 2004, a settlement agreement was entered with the cour, and two years after the settlement agreement, the government found that the Nim Henson Nursing Home had been complying with all the terms of the settlement agreement.","Mr. Lewis H. Warrix County Judge Executive Breathitt County 1137 Main Street Jackson, KY 41339 Re: Nim Henson Geriatric Center Dear Mr. Warrix: On March 20, 2002, we informed Breathitt County that we were investigating conditions at Nim Henson Geriatric Center (“Nim Henson”), in Jackson, Kentucky, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997. In June 2002, we visited Nim Henson. At an exit interview conducted on the last day of the visit, we verbally conveyed our preliminary findings to the facility’s administrative personnel. Consistent with the requirements of CRIPA, we are now writing to apprise you of our findings. As a threshold matter, we wish to acknowledge, and express our appreciation for, the cooperation and assistance provided to us, particularly by the facility’s administrator, Mr. Phillip Litteral, and Director of Nursing, Ms. Patricia Lutes. We hope to work with Breathitt County and Nim Henson administrators and staff in the same cooperative manner in addressing the problems that we found. Further, we note that it was apparent that many Nim Henson staff are dedicated individuals who are genuinely concerned for the well-being of the persons in their care. We conducted our investigation by reviewing medical and other records relating to the care and treatment of individuals; interviewing administrators, staff and patients; and conducting an on-site review of the facility. Our findings are supported by the assessments contained in our expert consultants’ reports. At the time of our visit, Nim Henson had a bed capacity of 122; its actual census was 104. The facility is divided between a “skilled” care unit and an “intermediate” care unit. The skilled care unit has 44 beds, 42 of which were occupied when we visited. The remaining 78 beds are on the intermediate care unit, 62 of which were occupied during our tour. In addition t residents’ rooms, the facility has one large dining room, a “Florida” room designated for resident activity, such as group programs and rehabilitation services, and a large activity annex in the rear of the building. Residents of state and county-operated facilities have a right to receive adequate health care, along with habilitation, and other supports and services, to ensure their safety and freedom from unreasonable restraint, prevent regression and facilitate their ability to exercise their liberty interests. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982). Similar protections are accorded by federal statute. See, e.g., Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396; 42 C.F.R. Part 483 (Medicaid Program Provisions); 42 U.S.C. <unk>135li-3; 42 U.S.C. <unk>483 Subpart B (Medicare). The County also is obligated to provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate to individual residents’ needs. Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. <unk>35.130 (d); see Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). I. Facility Conditions Areas in which the facility appears to be performing reasonably well include cleanliness in the kitchen and throughout the facility, the adequacy of staffing, and dietary supports. However, in the areas of general medical care, chemical restraints, wound and nutritional care, restorative care, psychiatric care, and incident management and quality assurance, Nim Henson does not provide levels of care that are consistent with the Constitution or statutory or regulatory requirements. Our findings, the facts supporting them, and the remedial steps that we believe are necessary are set forth below. A. General Medical Care As a nursing home, Nim Henson is required to provide medical, nursing and related services to “attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial wellbeing of each resident.” 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396r(b)(4)(A). Nim Henson is not meeting these standards. More particularly, its medication management practices; its medical notes and documentation; and its oversight and management of medical care do not meet generally accepted standards of care. These deficiencies place residents at risk of harm. Generally accepted standards of care dictate that use of medications, especially those having potentially harmful side effects, be clinically justified. This is particularly true when drugs are used in combinations that increase the risk of harm and when drugs are used that pose particular risks for the elderly. Generally accepted standards of care also dictate that, for drugs having therapeutic ranges, below which the drug is ineffective and above which it is potentially toxic, monitoring be conducted pursuant to generally accepted protocols to ensure that the drug is helping, not harming, the patient. Generally accepted standards of care further dictate that consideration routinely be given to whether continued use of drugs, and the amounts in which they are consumed, remains appropriate, or whether the drugs can be tapered down or replaced by others having fewer adverse side effects.","<pad>On March 20, 2002, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sent a letter to Breathitt County, Kentucky, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1997 (CRIPA) to investigate conditions at Nim Henson Geriatric Center in Jackson, Kentucky. The letter was sent to the county's county judge executive, Mr. Lewis H. Warrix. The complaint alleged that Nim Henson did not provide levels of care consistent with the Constitution or statutory or regulatory requirements, and that its medication management practices and oversight and management of medical care did not meet generally accepted standards of care. In response to the complaint, the county agreed to implement corrective measures. The county also agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty to the federal government. The settlement is subject to approval by the court.</s>"

This case challenges the legality of Defendants' participation in a secret and illegal 8 government program to intercept and analyze vast quantities of Americans' telephone and Internet 9 communications, surveillance done without the authorization of a court and in violation of federal I 0 electronic surveillance and telecommunications statutes, as well as the First and Fourth Amendments I I to the United States Constitution. 3. In December of 2005, the press revealed that the government had instituted a 13 comprehensive and warrantless electronic surveillance program that violates the Constitution and 14 ignores the careful safeguards set forth by Congress. This surveillance program, purportedly I5 authorized by the President at least as early as 200I and primarily undertaken by the National 16 Security Agency (""NSA"") without judicial review or approval, intercepts and analyzes the 17 communications ofmillions ofAmericans. Prior to this revelation, Plaintiffs and class members had I8 no reasonable opportunity to discover the existence ofthe surveillance program or the violations of 19 law alleged herein. 4. But the government did not act-and is not acting-alone. The government requires 21 the collaboration ofmajor telecommunications companies to implement its unprecedented and illegal 22 domestic spying program. 5. Defendants AT&T Corp. and AT&T Inc. maintain domestic telecommunications 24 facilities over which millions of Americans' telephone and Internet communications pass every day. 25 They also manage some of the largest databases in the world containing records of most or all 26 communications made through their myriad telecommunications services. 6. On information and belief, AT&T Corp. has opened its key telecommunications 28 facilities and databases to direct access by the NSA and/or other government agencies, intercepting COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF LDSSW.COM and disclosing to the government the contents ofits customers' communications as well as detailed 2 communications records about millions of its customers, including Plaintiffs and class members. 7. This collaboration began before AT&T Corp. was acquired by AT&T Inc. (fonnerly 4 known as SBC Communications, Inc.). On infonnation and belief, Defendants continue to assist the 5 government in its secret surveillance of millions ofordinary Americans. 8. Plaintiffs are suing to stop this illegal conduct and hold Defendants responsible for 7 their illegal collaboration in the surveillance program, which has violated the law and damaged the 8 fundamental freedoms of the American public.

This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, 3 to enforce the public’s right to information about the federal government’s searches of electronic 4 devices at airports. Government agencies routinely search travelers’ phones, computers, tablets 5 and other devices, which hold within them vast quantities of information—photographs, emails, 6 text and audio messages, address books—that reveal intimate and deeply personal details of an 7 individual’s life. 2. The federal government’s searches of electronic devices at airports—along with 9 intrusive questioning, lengthy detentions, and even refusal to allow certain travelers to enter the 10 country—has generated widespread media interest and public concern. Recent statistics 11 demonstrate that the number of these searches have multiplied year after year. Access to 12 information about electronic device searches at airports is necessary to inform meaningful public 13 debate over the scope of government conduct that potentially threatens core civil rights and 14 liberties protected by the Constitution. Federal agencies have published their policies regarding 15 searches of electronic devices at international borders. But the federal government’s policies on 16 searching electronic devices of domestic air passengers remains shrouded in secrecy. 3. Over two months ago, on December 20, 2017, Plaintiff American Civil Liberties 18 Union of Northern California (“ACLU-NC”), a non-profit civil rights organization, submitted 19 two FOIA requests to Defendant Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) seeking 20 records about policies, procedures, and protocols regarding the search of airplane passengers’ 21 electronic devices; training of relevant personnel related to the search or examination of 22 electronic devices; and equipment used to search, examine, or extract data from electronic 23 devices. Since that time, TSA has provided ACLU-NC with no records. 5. ACLU-NC now brings this action to obtain the information to which it is 26 statutorily entitled. 27 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PARTIES 6. Plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California is an affiliate of 3 the American Civil Liberties Union, a national, non-profit, non-partisan organization with the 4 mission of protecting civil liberties from government incursions, safeguarding basic 5 constitutional rights, and advocating for open government. ACLU-NC is established under the 6 laws of the state of California and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. ACLU-NC has 7 over 90,000 members. In support of its mission, ACLU-NC uses its communications department 8 to disseminate to the public information relating to its mission, through its website, newsletters, 9 in-depth reports, and other publications. Defendant Transportation Security Administration is an agency within the 11 meaning of 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(f). The agency has its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, and field 12 offices all over the country, including San Francisco, California. JURISDICTION 8. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the 15 parties pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B) and 552(a)(6)(C)(i). This Court also has subject 16 matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1346. VENUE AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT 9.

According to the complaint, the FOIA requests sought greater understanding of the administration's immigration enforcement policies out of a concern that the defendants have targeted individuals on the basis of actual or perceived religion, ethnicity, race, or national origin in enforcing their immigration policies. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought ""disclosure of agency policies, communications, and statistics related to visa processing and visa issuances for individuals applying abroad; to adjudication of entry document applications; and to screening and searching of individuals arriving at U.S. ports of entry.""

U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION, and U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Civil Action No. 3:17-cv-1061 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATION OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 et. seq. Defendants. This action seeks to enhance public understanding of an urgent concern: discrimination in immigration enforcement against Muslims, Latinos, and other members of disfavored groups by the U.S. Department of State (“DOS”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The contemporary importance of this issue is no accident. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald J. Trump asserted he would ban all Muslims, including refugees fleeing war-torn regions of the world, from entering the United States. Candidate Trump also perpetuated harmful and racially charged stereotypes about Mexican and other Latino immigrants, to whom he referred as murderers, rapists, and “bad hombres.” He subsequently called for “extreme vetting” of immigrants. In his first week in office, President Trump continued his anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric and moved promptly to issue a thinly veiled “Muslim Ban” executive order that indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days, and prohibited individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. Numerous lawsuits challenging the order’s constitutionality were swiftly brought, and courts around the country preliminarily enjoined that ban. Undaunted, the Administration replaced it with a second executive order, which multiple courts again enjoined. During this time, protests erupted at airports across the country, and media coverage focused on allegations and instances of discrimination in immigration enforcement. The same day he signed the second Muslim Ban executive order, the President issued a memorandum directing the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to develop procedures for “enhanced vetting” for applications for visas and immigration benefits. Since then, however, the Trump Administration has disclosed little information concerning its policies and practices regarding targeted immigration enforcement. These events and concerns directly implicate the work of the Plaintiff nonprofit organizations, the Council on American-Islamic Relations – Connecticut (“CAIR-CT”) and Make the Road New York (“MRNY”) (together, “Plaintiffs”). Plaintiff CAIR-CT endeavors to enhance the public’s understanding of Islam, while Plaintiff MRNY strives to empower immigrant and working-class communities. As a critical component of its work, each Plaintiff disseminates information through publications, educational sessions, and electronic communications. In furtherance of their missions, on April 12, 2017 Plaintiffs submitted three specific and narrow requests pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 et seq., as amended (“FOIA”), to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), and U.S. Department of State (“DOS”) (collectively, “Defendants”). The requests seek disclosure of agency policies, communications, and statistics related to visa processing and visa issuances for individuals applying abroad; to adjudication of entry document applications; and to screening and searching of individuals arriving at U.S. ports of entry. The requests are not limited to policies, communications, and statistics produced pursuant to, or as a result of, the President’s travel ban orders, but encompass immigration enforcement policies broadly. Plaintiffs are concerned that in recent months, either as a result of the travel ban orders or otherwise, Defendants have been targeting individuals based on their actual or perceived religion, ethnicity, race, national origin, and/or other group identity for special treatment with respect to entry document applications, visa processing, and screening of individuals arriving at U.S. ports of entry. Plaintiffs also sought expedited processing and waiver of fees on multiple grounds. Despite the intense and justified public scrutiny surrounding these issues, the Defendants failed to timely respond to Plaintiffs’ requests. Instead, over 60 days after Plaintiffs submitted their FOIA requests, Defendants have failed to disclose a single record. Plaintiffs accordingly bring this action pursuant to FOIA for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to compel the disclosure and release of urgently needed records that Defendants have improperly withheld from public scrutiny.

As a result of the misunderstanding, the plaintiff’s name was erroneously placed on government watchlists, and she was fired from her job as a nurse working at the Federal Reserve Board. After unsuccessfully filing a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records relating to the error, she brought this lawsuit against several federal agencies, seeking to force the agencies to produce the requested records.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NANCY CRISMAN 8339 Forrester Boulevard Springfield, VA 22152, and NATIONAL SECURITY COUNSELORS 1200 South Courthouse Road, Suite 124 Arlington, VA 22204, Plaintiffs, v.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), Justice Management Division (“JMD”), National Security Division (“NSD”), and Office of Information Policy (“OIP”) are DOJ components. 7.

Defendant Office of the Director of National Intelligence (“ODNI”) is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(e), and is in possession and/or control of the records which are the subject of this action. BACKGROUND 10. In 2004 Crisman was employed as a nurse by Corporate Nurse, Inc. (“CNI”), a federal government contractor. Crisman was stationed at FRB Headquarters. 11. On 26 March 2004 the Florida-based Financial Institution Security Association sent a document with the heading “FISA Alert Report Form” to FBI’s Miami Field Office regarding Crisman. It was marked “CONFIDENTIAL” by an unknown source to reflect the fact that it included confidential personal information, such as Crisman’s Social Security Number and Date of Birth. This document was marked by FBI as Serial 2974 and placed in File 66F-MMA55222. This document will hereinafter be referred to as the “FISA Alert.” 12. The FISA Alert did not identify Crisman as a suspect in any criminal activity. It simply provided her identifying information and stated in boilerplate language, “We are looking for any and all information on the above subjects or businesses, including, but not limited to checking or savings accounts, safety deposit boxes, or any other pertinent information where these individuals/businesses may have accounts.” FBI has previously stated that it was not even the target of this inquiry, and that it was merely forwarded a copy of a FISA Alert sent from the Florida Attorney General’s Office of Statewide Prosecution to the Financial Institution Security Association. 13. Confusion surrounds the classification of this record as a “66F” file. According to previous FBI testimony, a 66F file “is maintained for administrative matters with regards to financial institution fraud.” Def.’s Mem P.

In December 2005, plaintiffs American Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (collectively, “the ACLU”) and the National Security Archive Fund, Inc. (the “Archive”) filed FOIA requests seeking the release of records related to the NSA’s secret surveillance program to intercept, without prior judicial authorization, the telephone and Internet communications of people inside the United States (“the Program”). Jurisdiction and Venue This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action and personal jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B) and 552(a)(6)(C)(i). This Court also has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331. Venue is proper in this district under 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B). Parties The ACLU is a national organization that works to protect civil rights and civil liberties. The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that provides free legal representation and educates the public about civil rights and civil liberties issues. The American Civil Liberties Union is a separate non-profit, non-partisan, 501(c)(4) membership organization engaged in public education and analysis of pending and proposed legislation. As a leading defender of freedom, equality, privacy, and due process rights in the United States, the ACLU has provided direct representation to individuals and organizations with a well-founded belief that their communications are being intercepted by the NSA under the Program. 5. Plaintiff National Security Archive Fund, Inc. (“the Archive”) is an independent non-governmental research institute and library located at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. The Archive collects and publishes declassified documents acquired through the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”). The Archive is the world’s largest nongovernmental library of declassified documents, has published more than 500,000 pages of declassified documents in various formats, and has become the leading non-profit user of FOIA. The Archive has made extensive requests for records regarding the NSA’s surveillance activities. 6. Defendant United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is a Department of the Executive Branch of the United States Government. The DOJ is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(f)(1). The NSA’s Secret Domestic Spying Program 7. According to published news reports, in the fall of 2001 the NSA launched a secret surveillance program (“the Program”) to intercept, without prior judicial authorization, the telephone and Internet communications of people inside the United States. James Risen and Eric Lichtblau, Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts, New York Times, Dec. 16, 2005, at A1, A16. President Bush ratified the Program in 2002. Since then, the President has reauthorized the Program more than 30 times. 8. Under the Program, the NSA intercepts vast quantities of the international telephone and Internet communications (hereinafter collectively “communications”) of people inside the United States, including citizens and lawful permanent residents. 9. The legality and propriety of the NSA’s warrantless spying is the subject of sustained, intense public concern. It took less than a day for Arlen Specter, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to pledge that the Senate would hold hearings to investigate the NSA’s warrantless surveillance.

In a FOIA Request letter (“Request”), Requestor sought documents and information relating to the government’s border searches of electronic devices in the possession of persons from the seven Muslim-majority countries covered by President Donald Trump’s January 27, 2017 Executive Order, in addition to its border searches of electronic devices in the possession of persons – including U.S. citizens – whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) agents perceived to be Muslim. As discussed widely in news reports, these searches – which may include the physical retention of an individual’s electronic devices and demand for their passwords – appear to have dramatically increased following the issuance of the Executive Order.1 3. Despite Requestor timely exhausting its administrative remedies, DHS has failed to comply with its obligation under FOIA to promptly make the requested documents and information available.

On January 27, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order, Executive Order 13769 (“Executive Order I”), barring persons from seven Muslim-majority countries – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen – from entering the United States for 90 days, indefinitely blocking refugees from Syria from entering the United States, and prohibiting all refugees from entering the United States for 120 days. 9. Following the issuance of Executive Order I, numerous publications reported that CBP agents searched the electronic devices of individuals, including U.S. citizens, who were originally from the seven countries covered by Executive Order I, in addition to searching the electronic devices of others who arrived in the United States on international flights and whom CBP agents perceived to be Muslim. These publications further reported that CBP agents demanded travelers’ passwords and potentially seized their electronic devices either physically or through the electronic duplication of their contents. 10. On February 2, 2017, CBP issued a guidance document entitled “Q&A for Executive Order: Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” which states: “Keeping America safe and enforcing our nation’s laws in an increasingly digital world depends on [the CBP’s] ability to lawfully examine all materials entering the United States.” It also provides that “inspection [of international travelers arriving to the U.S.] may include electronic devices.” 11. On March 6, 2017, President Donald Trump issued another executive order (“Executive Order II”), scheduled to go into effect on March 16, 2017, that replaced Executive Order I and continued to generally bar persons from six Muslim-majority countries – Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen – from entering the United States on new visas for 90 days and reinstated the prohibition on all refugees entering the United States for 120 days.2 12.

JAMES N. MATTIS, in his official capacity as SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, 1400 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC 20301-1400 Respondent. PETITION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS Petitioner John Doe is an American citizen currently being unlawfully detained by the United States military in Iraq without charge, without access to counsel, and without access to a court. The U.S. military has refused to disclose publicly Petitioner’s name or location. Respondent, General James N. Mattis, is the United States Secretary of Defense and Petitioner’s ultimate military custodian. Respondent’s failure to present Petitioner to a federal court or to otherwise justify his detention violates the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241 et seq., the Non-Detention Act of 1971, 18 U.S.C. <unk>4001(a), and the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to, and the Suspension Clause of, the United States Constitution. It also exceeds any detention authority granted by the Authorization for Use of Military Force, Pub L. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (2001), the Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq Resolution of 2002, Pub L No. 107-243, 116 Stat. 1498 (2002), and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Pub L. 112-81, 125 Stat. 1298 (2011). Petitioner, through his next friend, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, petitions this Court for a writ of habeas corpus directing Respondent to: (1) provide attorneys from the ACLU Foundation with prompt access to Petitioner to inform Petitioner of his legal rights and to afford him the opportunity of legal assistance; (2) transfer Petitioner into civilian law-enforcement custody to face criminal charges or release him; (3) provide Petitioner with a meaningful opportunity to challenge his detention before a federal judge; and, (4) halt any continued interrogation of Petitioner. PARTIES 1. Petitioner John Doe (“Petitioner”), a citizen of the United States, is currently being detained by the U.S. military in Iraq. The U.S. military has detained Petitioner since on or around September 14, 2017. The U.S. military has not disclosed publicly Petitioner’s name or the place of his detention, and has not provided Petitioner with access to a court or to counsel. 2. Respondent General James N. Mattis (“Respondent”) is the United States Secretary of Defense. As the nation’s highest-ranking official in the Department of Defense, Respondent maintains custody and control over Petitioner and is therefore Petitioner’s ultimate military custodian. Secretary Mattis is sued in his official capacity. 3. Next friend the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (“ACLUF”) employs lawyers who provide legal representation free of charge in cases involving civil liberties, and educates the public about civil liberties. The ACLUF and the American Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”), a nationwide, non-profit, non-partisan public interest organization of more than 1.6 million members, are both dedicated to defending the civil liberties guarantees by the Constitution. The ACLUF has previously represented individuals detained by the United States as “enemy combatants” and sought to vindicate their individual legal and constitutional rights in the federal courts. The ACLU has written to Respondent expressing concern about Petitioner’s unlawful detention and requesting access to Petitioner to inform of him of his rights and provide legal assistance, but Respondent has failed to respond. Because Respondent is denying Petitioner both access to counsel and the ability to challenge his executive detention himself, the ACLUF submits this Petition as next friend of Petitioner to inform Petitioner of his rights and to afford him the opportunity of legal assistance in challenging that detention. JURISDICTION 4. Respondent is detaining Petitioner under or by color of the authority of the United States and in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States. Petitioner accordingly brings this action under 28 U.S.C <unk>2241 et seq.

COMPLAINT 1. On November 10, 2020, Defendant Andrew McCabe testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Hearing that “any material misrepresentation or error in a FISA application is unacceptable Period. The FBI should be held to the standard of scrupulous accuracy that the [FISA] court demands.” When pushed to explain “Who is responsible for ruining Mr. Carter Page’s life?” McCabe finally responded, “We are all responsible for the work that went into that FISA.” This lawsuit seeks that accountability and damages against the individuals and agencies who wronged Plaintiff, Carter W. Page (“Dr. Page”). 2. Specifically, Dr. Page seeks relief herein for Defendants’ multiple violations of his Constitutional and other legal rights in connection with unlawful surveillance and investigation of him by the United States Government Dr. Page was targeted because of his lawful association with the 2016 Presidential campaign of Donald Trump Dr. Page is entitled to relief for Defendants’ unjustified and illegal actions (including violations of federal criminal law), which violated federal statutes enacted to prevent unlawful spying on United States persons, as well as the Constitution. 3. The complained of misconduct occurred in connection with the submission of four false and misleading warrant applications to engage in electronic surveillance of Dr. Page, ostensibly pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”). Four separate Article III judges unwittingly approved the false applications, submitted in October 2016, January 2017, April 2017, and June 2017, thereby unlawfully resulting in spying on Dr Page. As has now been admitted by (i) the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), (and (ii) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and/or has been acknowledged by (iii) the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”), the four separate applications for FISA warrants and renewals (collectively, the “FISA Warrants”1) to surveil Dr. Page were submitted despite there being no probable cause to suspect that Dr. Page was acting as a Foreign Agent of Russia. Consequently, the Defendants’ unlawful actions allowed them to illegally spy (domestically and internationally) on Dr. Page, a patriotic American citizen. 4. The Defendants’ conduct, which began not later than August 2016, and continued through at least September 2017, constituted a fraud on the FISC and violated the Constitutional and other rights of Dr. Page. I. OVERVIEW OF THE VIOLATIONS 5. On July 31, 2016, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation named Operation Crossfire Hurricane, putatively concerning the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), to determine whether “individual(s) associated with the Trump campaign are witting of and/or 1 For clarity, the four separate FISA Warrants when discussed individually are referred to herein in the order of the application submitted to the FISC. For example, the October 2016 FISA application is the “First FISA Warrant”, and first renewal submitted in January 2017 is referenced as the “Second FISA Warrant”, while the April and June 2017 FISA renewal applications are referenced as the “Third FISA Warrant” and “Fourth FISA Warrant,” respectively. coordinating activities with the Government of Russia.” Soon thereafter, Dr. Page and three other individuals with whom he had little or no relationship were targeted by the FBI in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. 6. The FBI investigation soon devolved into an effort to obtain from the FISC a FISA warrant authorizing spying and electronic surveillance on Dr. Page. 7. The FBI did not have probable cause to lawfully obtain a FISA warrant. Instead, the FBI used documents furnished by Christopher Steele, a Confidential Human Source (“CHS”). As the Crossfire Hurricane team knew, CHS Steele had been paid by the Democratic Party and/or the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign to perform “political opposition research” and dig up dirt on a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia in order to divert attention from the investigation of Clinton’s email",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2019 | Federal Bureau of Investigation | Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court | Department of Justice | Carter W.

The Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit after the federal government removed the individual Plaintiff's name from the Specially Designated Terror List.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS EASTERN DIVISION MUHAMMAD A. SALAH; AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE; and AMERICAN-ARAB ANTI-DISCRIMINATION COMMITTEE, Plaintiffs, No. v. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY; TIMOTHY GEITHNER, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Treasury; and ADAM J. SZUBIN, in his official capacity as Director, United States Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Asset Control, Defendants. COMPLAINT Plaintiffs, by counsel, complain of defendants as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. For more than seventeen years, Muhammad Salah (“Salah”), a U.S. citizen residing in Bridgeview, Illinois, has lived under an unprecedented “embargo” imposed on him by the U.S. Department of Treasury in August 1995, when it designated him a “Specially Designated Terrorist.” Upon information and belief, Salah is the only U.S. citizen residing in the United States subject to such a designation. Pursuant to the designation, all of Salah’s assets were blocked indefinitely, without a warrant, probable cause of criminal activity, or a hearing. Salah was provided no notice of the charges, no evidence upon which the designation was based, and no opportunity to respond to the charges and evidence. 2. Absent advance approval from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Salah is prohibited from purchasing virtually anything, including food, clothing, and lodging, and it is a crime for any United States citizen, permanent resident, entity organized under U.S. law, or any other person in the United States or its territories to engage in virtually any transaction with Salah, including providing him with food, shelter, clothing, or many medical services<unk>even if they are provided free of charge. Salah may not work for a living, spend money, or give or accept any donations absent advance approval by OFAC. The restrictions are so onerous that they are practically impossible to comply with. 3. OFAC has at various times granted Salah licenses that in theory authorize him to do limited things, such as get a job, open a bank account, and pay for and receive “goods and services essential to [his] basic maintenance.” But they have come with onerous obligations, and OFAC has unfettered discretion to grant or deny such licenses, subject to whatever conditions it chooses. Salah survives, in other words, only at the sufferance of OFAC. Moreover, because OFAC has authorized only basic maintenance, he is prohibited from engaging in transactions necessary to do anything that might not be deemed “basic maintenance,” and thus is left to guess at whether spending money for any of the following activities are permissible: attending a lecture, concert, or movie with his wife; taking his children to a sporting event; buying his children birthday presents; contributing to a political campaign; purchasing a book or newspaper; or satisfying his religious charitable obligations by donating to his local mosque or other charitable entities. As a result of his designation and the onerous reporting requirements OFAC has attached to licensing a bank account, Salah has been unable, with one short-lived exception, to identify a bank that will accept an account on his behalf. It has also been all but impossible for him to find employment. Salah has lived under these unprecedented conditions for more than seventeen years, with no end in sight. No other U.S. citizen must seek such specific advance approval from the government for his every transaction. 4. Defendants imposed these restrictions without a criminal or civil trial, administrative hearing, or even notice and an opportunity to respond. They did so under the authority of Executive Order 12947, which in turn was promulgated pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. <unk>1701 et seq. Defendants provided Salah no notice of the factual basis for their action, and no opportunity to respond. He was not even provided with the administrative record upon which the designation was presumably based. There is no endpoint to the designation and its restrictions. Nor is there any requirement that defendants review the designation at any point. Defendants have never sought or received any judicial approval of their actions. They did not seek a judicial warrant in advance of imposing these restrictions, which amounted to an indefinite seizure of the entirety of his assets. And they did not go to a court after the seizure to demonstrate their basis for doing so, as they would have to do in a civil forfeiture action. While regulations permit designated persons to request reconsideration, the regulations impose no standards for that process nor any deadline for OFAC to rule on such requests. OFAC need not even issue a statement of reasons for its designations. 5. The restrictions on designated persons also prohibit U.S. citizens and entities and persons in the United States or its territories from providing any support, specifically including “services,” to designated persons. Defendants have taken the position that the restrictions bar any “coordinated advocacy” by U.S. entities or persons with and on behalf of a designated entity",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] U.S. District Court | Northern District of Illinois | Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) ||| August 1995 ||| September 1996 ||| October 1997 ||| 2004 ||| 2006 ||| 2007 ||| 2010 ||| 2012 ||| 2013 ||| 2014 ||| 2015 ||| 2016 ||| 2017 ||| 2018 ||| 2019 |||</s>

This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, for injunctive and other appropriate relief, seeking the immediate processing and release of agency records requested by Plaintiffs American Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union Foundation from Defendant Department of Justice (“DOJ”). 2. On March 29, 2013, Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request (the “Request”) to the DOJ seeking records related to the government’s use of evidence derived from surveillance authorized by the FISA Amendments Act, 50 U.S.C. <unk>1881a et seq. (“FAA”), in criminal prosecutions and the government’s provision of notice in prosecutions involving FAA surveillance. 3. While some components of DOJ have processed Plaintiffs’ request, most have not, and no component has released any responsive record or explained why responsive records are being withheld. 4. The failure of these DOJ components to process and release responsive records is of particular concern because the Request relates to a highly controversial surveillance authority whose wisdom, effectiveness, and legality is a matter of intense and ongoing public debate. Indeed, the debate over FAA surveillance has only grown more pitched since Plaintiffs filed the Request six months ago. Revelations concerning the National Security Agency’s (“NSA”) interception of electronic communications pursuant to the FAA—including the emails, text messages, and phone calls of Americans—have prompted public outcry and calls for legislative reform. The public interest in the release of the requested records is substantial. 5. Plaintiffs now ask the Court for an injunction requiring the DOJ—in particular, its components the National Security Division, the Criminal Division, the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (“EOUSA”), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”)—to process the Request immediately. Plaintiffs also seek an order enjoining Defendant from assessing fees for the processing of the Request. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6.

The ACLU is also committed to principles of transparency and accountability in government, and seeks to ensure that the American public is informed about the conduct of its government in matters that affect civil liberties and human rights. 9.

This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, for injunctive and other appropriate relief. Plaintiffs American Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (together, the “ACLU”) seek the immediate processing and timely release of agency records from Defendants National Security Agency (“NSA”), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (“ODNI”), U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”). 2. On September 14, 2016, Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request (the “Request”) to NSA, ODNI, DOJ, and CIA seeking records related to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”), 50 U.S.C. <unk>1881a. The Request seeks information concerning the scope of the government’s warrantless surveillance programs operated under Section 702, as well as related records showing how this surveillance affects Americans. 3. To date, none of the Defendants has released any responsive record. 4. The failure of Defendants to identify and release responsive records is of particular concern because the Request relates to a sweeping surveillance authority that implicates core privacy and free speech rights of Americans. 5. The government relies on Section 702 to engage in the warrantless surveillance of Americans’ international communications. This authority is set to expire in 2017, and Congress has already begun holding hearings about whether it should be reauthorized. However, the public still lacks essential information about the breadth of surveillance under Section 702, the ways in which this surveillance is used, and its impact on American citizens and residents. Timely disclosure of these records is critical to the ongoing public debate about the lawfulness of Section 702. Without additional information, the public will be unable to engage in an informed debate concerning Section 702’s potential reauthorization. 6. Plaintiffs now ask the Court for an injunction requiring NSA, ODNI, DOJ, and CIA to process the Request immediately. Plaintiffs also seek an order enjoining Defendants from assessing fees for the processing of the Request. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7.

COMPLAINT Plaintiffs THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY and CHARLIE SAVAGE, by their undersigned attorneys, allege for their Complaint: 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 (“FOIA”), to obtain an order for the production of agency records from Defendant in response to three FOIA requests properly made by Plaintiffs. 2. In the aftermath of September 11, Defendant U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) played a key role in establishing new counterterrorism legal policies. The policies, which dealt with such subjects as the detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects and the expanded use of surveillance, are of significant public interest because they attempt to balance national security with the protection of civil liberties and compliance with the law. 3. The three requests at issue in this action, all brought by Plaintiffs in the last year, all address post-September 11 counterterrorism policies. In each instance, DOJ failed to respond to the request in twenty business days as required under FOIA, 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(6)(A). PARTIES 4. Plaintiff The New York Times Company publishes The New York Times newspaper and www.nytimes.com. The New York Times Company is headquartered in this judicial district at 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York. 5. Plaintiff Charlie Savage is a reporter for The New York Times and an employee of The New York Times Company. 6. Defendant U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is an agency of the federal government that has possession and control of the records that Plaintiffs seek. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B). 8. Venue is premised on the place of business of Plaintiffs and is proper in this district under 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B). 9. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies available in regard to the three requests at issue. In each of them, Defendant has failed to make an initial determination within the time frame set by FOIA, and therefore Plaintiffs are deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(6)(C). FACTS 10. The documents sought by the three FOIA requests at issue all relate to Plaintiffs’ ongoing reporting on DOJ’s counterterrorism legal policies developed in the aftermath of September 11. A. The Task Force Request 11. On October 28, 2015, Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA Request to DOJ (the “Task Force Request”) seeking “the final reports by the Special Interagency Task Force on Detainee Disposition established by Executive Order 13,493 and the Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies established by Executive Order 13,491.” 12. Because of a typographical error in the original Task Force Request, Plaintiffs initially listed that the Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies was established by Executive Order 13,493. Plaintiffs corrected the error for DOJ on January 15, 2016. 13. DOJ acknowledged the Task Force Request on January 15, 2016. 14. Also on January 15, 2016, DOJ informed Plaintiffs that DOJ was engaged in litigation with the International Counsel Bureau (“ICB”) over FOIA requests submitted by ICB (the “ICB Litigation”) and that the reports at issue in Plaintiffs’ Task Force Request were responsive to the FOIA requests in the ICB Litigation (Int’l Counsel Bureau v. U.S. Dep’t of Def. et al., 13-cv-01591 (JDB) (D.D.C. 2013)). 15. A representative for DOJ’s FOIA Office told Plaintiffs that, as a result, he thought DOJ would be able to respond to the Task Force Request by the end of January 2016. 16. In February 2016, ICB voluntarily dismissed its claims against DOJ. 17. On August 8, 2016, DOJ informed Plaintiffs that its Office of Information Policy was still processing the Task Force Request. 18. DOJ has failed to issue a response to the Task Force Request within 20 business days as required under FOIA. B. The Rowan Memo Request 19. On January 7, 2016, Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA Request to DOJ (the “Rowan Memo Request”), seeking “the memo on discovery issues raised by Stellarwind written by Pat Rowan and dated May 4, 2005.” 20. “Stellarwind” is the code name for the U.S. Government’s warrantless wiretapping and bulk data collection program that President George W. Bush secretly authorized in the aftermath of September 11. 21.

Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1391 as the Plaintiffs reside in this district and complained actions occurred at minimum partially in this district and complained of records generated from this district and the Defendants have substantial ties to this district. STANDING 6. Plaintiffs have standing under Article III. And have suffered an injury because they are current cell phone subscribers whose communications have already been monitored by the government and whose communications continue to be monitored. The injury is plainly traceable to the conduct they challengethat is, to the government's collection of Plaintiffs records. To any extent a government argument is that the ""mere"" collection of Plaintiffs' call records does not inflict an injury, that argument goes to whether Plaintiffs have a reasonable expectation of privacythat is, to the meritsnot standing. As the Supreme Court has observed, the definition of Fourth Amendment rights ""is more properly placed within the purview of substantive Fourth Amendment law than within that of standing.""Carter,525 U.S.83 As a recent federal court stated ""indeed everyone 's metadata is analyzed, manually or automatically"".

MCALEENAN, Acting Commissioner United States Customs and Border Protection; in his official capacity, and, NICHOLAS J. RASMUSSEN, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, in his official capacity; Defendants. COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF Plaintiff, Yusuf Awadir Abdi, by and through his attorneys, CAIR National Legal Defense Fund, Inc. (“Council on American-Islamic Relations” or “CAIR”) and Parker McConkie, states as follows: Introduction 1. Through its No Fly List, the federal government is preventing an American citizen who is in Kenya now from returning to Utah where he lives. 2. To make matters worse, by preventing this citizen—who is a religious leader of his community—from flying back to the United States, the Defendants are preventing him from providing religious services to Muslims in Utah during the holy month of Ramadan. 3. These injuries are attributable to the Defendants systematically compiling a terrorist watch list, inventing consequences to inflict on listees, and disseminating this list to anyone willing to receive it. 4. It is why there is no exaggeration in stating that our federal government is imposing an injustice of historic proportions upon people such as Plaintiff Yusuf Awadir Abdi —who has not been arrested, charged, or convicted of any type of terrorism-related offense—as well as thousands of other Americans. Through extra-judicial and secret means, the federal government is ensnaring innocent Americans into an invisible web of consequences that are imposed indefinitely and without recourse because of the shockingly large federal terror watch list that now includes hundreds of thousands of individuals. 5. Indeed, many Americans, including children, end up on this secret federal terror watch list – which the Defendants have named the Terrorist Screening Database (“TSDB”) – based on mere guesses, hunches, and conjecture, and even simply based on matters of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion or the exercise of their constitutional rights. 6. These consequences include the inability to fly on airplanes, to go through security without having all screeners receive a message for the remainder of a listee’s life that he or she is a ""known or suspected terrorist,"" to obtain licenses, to exercise their Second Amendment right to own a firearm, and to be free from the unimaginable indignity and real-life danger of having their own government communicate to hundreds of thousands of federal agents, private contractors, businesses, state and local police, the captains of sea-faring vessels, and foreign governments all across the world that they are a violent menace. 7. And unfortunately, the federal government has designed its No Fly List to be accountability-free. Persons placed on the federal terror watch list have no means of challenging the constitutionality of their listing. Indeed, people on the federal terror watch lists only learn of their placement when they feel the web of consequences burdening their lives and aspirations, and they never learn the circumstances that led to their listing. 8. Media accounts have made clear that the secret federal terror watch list is the product of bigotry and misguided, counterproductive zeal. Americans are dumped onto the watch list without being charged, convicted, or in some stomach-churning cases, even subject to an ongoing investigation. 9. Instead, two leaked government documents and a governmental report, which include the March 2013 Watchlisting Guidance (Exhibit 2), the Directorate of Terrorist Identities (DTI): Strategic Accomplishments 2013 (Exhibit 3), and the Department of Justice's March 2014 Audit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Management of Terrorist Watchlist (","<pad>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on behalf of a Somali-American man who was denied entry into the United Kingdom because he was on the federal government's terrorist watch list. The suit alleged that the defendants violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution by placing the plaintiff on the TSA's No Fly List and by denying him access to religious services during the holy month of Ramadan. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the suit, which was denied by the court. The parties agreed to a settlement in which the defendants agreed to remove the plaintiff from the watch list and allow him to travel to the UK to attend religious services.</s>"

I. INTRODUCTION 1. Defendants James Elmer Mitchell and John “Bruce” Jessen are psychologists who designed, implemented, and personally administered an experimental torture program for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”). 2. To create a torture program with a scientific veneer, Defendants drew on experiments from the 1960s in which researchers taught dogs “helplessness” by subjecting them to uncontrollable pain. Defendants theorized that if human beings were subjected to systematic abuse, the victims would become helpless and unable to resist an interrogator’s demand for information. The CIA adopted Defendants’ approach and paid Defendants to devise, supervise, refine, and evaluate the resulting torture program. With Defendants’ support, the CIA sought and obtained authorization from U.S. government agencies and officials for use of torture and cruel methods, and, over time, for the program’s continuation and expansion. 3. Plaintiffs Suleiman Abdullah Salim and Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud were kidnapped by the CIA and tortured and experimented upon in accordance with Defendants’ protocols. They were subjected to solitary confinement; extreme darkness, cold, and noise; repeated beatings; starvation; excruciatingly painful stress positions; prolonged sleep deprivation; confinement in coffin-like boxes; and water torture. Plaintiffs Salim and Ben Soud suffered lasting psychological and physical damage from this torture. Gul Rahman was tortured in many of the same ways, including after Defendant Jessen trained and supervised CIA personnel to apply these methods. Shortly after that training, Mr. Rahman died as a result of hypothermia caused by his exposure to extreme cold, exacerbated by dehydration, lack of food, and his immobility in a stress position. His family has never been officially notified of his death and his body never returned to them. 4. Plaintiffs Salim, Ben Soud, and Mr. Obaid Ullah on behalf of Mr. Rahman’s estate bring this action against Defendants for their commission of torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; non- consensual human experimentation; and war crimes, all of which violate well-established norms of customary international law. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 (federal question); 28 U.S.C. <unk>1332 (diversity jurisdiction); and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1350 (Alien Tort Statute). 6. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant John “Bruce” Jessen because he is domiciled in Spokane, Washington. 7. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant James Elmer Mitchell because these causes of action arise from or are connected with his extensive business activities and residence in Washington State. 8. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b)(3). III. PARTIES 9. Plaintiff Suleiman Abdullah Salim is a Tanzanian citizen. In March 2003, the CIA and Kenyan Security Forces captured Mr. Salim in Somalia, where he was working as a fisherman and trader, and rendered him to Kenya. From there the CIA rendered Mr. Salim to an Agency prison in Afghanistan, referred to in an official U.S. government report as COBALT Mr. Salim was held at COBALT from March 2003 until May 2003. He was then transferred to a second CIA prison in Afghanistan, referred to as the “Salt Pit,” where he was held for 14 months. In July 2004, Mr. Salim was transferred from the custody of the CIA to the custody of the U.S. military and held at a prison at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan for four years. He was released from U.S. custody on August 17, 2008 and given a memorandum from the U.S. Department of Defense stating that he “has been determined to pose no threat to the United States Armed Forces or its interests in",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2013 | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of Washington | American Civil Liberties Union ||| September 2014 ||||| September 2015 ||| August 2016 ||| October 2018 ||| January 2019 ||| February 2019 | ||| March 2019 | July 2019 | May 2020 ||| June 2020 | May 2021 | July 2020 | June 2021 | August 2020 | March 2020 | July 2021 | January 2020 | February 2020 | September 2020 | August 2021 | September 2019 | October 2020 | December 2020 | January 2021 | June 2020</s>

Plaintiffs v. CLASS ACTION JURY DEMAND CARNIVAL CORPORATION; and FATHOM TRAVEL LTD. CORPORATION. Defendants. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Plaintiffs, Amparo Sanchez and Francisco Marty (""Plaintiffs""), individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, file this Class Action Complaint against the Defendants, Carnival Corporation and Fathom Travel Ltd., Corporation for violation of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. INTRODUCTION 1. Defendants, Carnival Corporation (""Carnival"") and Fathom Travel Ltd., Corporation, (""Fathom"") (hereinafter collectively referred to as ""Defendants"") are refusing to allow Cuban-born persons to board its Fathom cruise line to Cuba, the first American cruise line to cruise to Cuba in over 50 years. 2. Cuban law currently prohibits Cuban Nationals from traveling to or from Cuba by ship, including cruise lines and ferries. 3. Defendants have adopted Cuba's policy to disallow Cuban-born persons from traveling to Cuba by ship. 4. Defendants will start operating their first cruise from the port of Miami to Cuba on May 1, 2016. 5. This case presents a model situation for class treatment. Defendants' conduct including its refusal to allow any Cuban-born on the Fathom cruise line to Cuba is uniform among all passengers. The application of Florida federal law to a shared course of conduct will determine liability for members of the putative class as a whole, ensuring that the rights of thousands of individuals are vindicated through the efficiency of a single trial. PARTIES, JURISDICTION VENUE 6. During the Class Period, Plaintiff Amparo Sanchez resided in, and continues to reside in, the Southern District of Florida. 7. During the Class Period, Plaintiff Francisco Marty resided in, and continues to reside in, the Southern District of Florida. Francisco Marty is a United States Army Veteran and a frequent passenger on Carnival cruise lines. He is an actual VIP cruiser with Carnival. 8. This is an action for injunctive relief and this Court has federal question jurisdiction as this case arises under federal law- 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000a. 9. Defendant Carnival Corporation is a Florida Corporation with its principal place of business in the Southern District of Florida. 10. Defendant Fathom Travel Ltd., Corporation is a corporation incorporated in the United Kingdom authorized to transact business in Florida. Fathom is a cruise line company wholly owned by Carnival Corporation. 11. The Court has jurisdiction over Carnival because it is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in the Southern District of Florida. By conducting business in the Southern District of Florida, Carnival has sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Florida, or otherwise intentionally availed itself of the Florida consumer market through the systematic sale of its cruise line reservations to Florida citizens. This purposeful availment renders the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court over Carnival permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. 12. This Court has jurisdiction over Fathom because it is a foreign corporation authorized to do business in the State of Florida, and is regularly and systematically engaging in business in the Southern District of Florida. By conducting business in the Southern District of Florida, Fathom has sufficient minimum contacts with the State of Florida, or otherwise intentionally availed itself of the Florida consumer market through the systematic sale of its cruise line reservations to Florida citizens. This purposeful availment renders the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court over Fathom permissible under traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. 13. Venue is proper in this forum pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391 because a substantial part of the practices complained of herein occurred in the Southern District of Florida. Further, at all times material to the allegations contained in this Complaint, Defendants personally and/or through an agent: a. Operated, conducted, engaged in, and carried on a business venture in the Southern District of Florida or had an office or agency in the Southern District of Florida; and/or b.

309,PA-NC-0006,"[ENTITYCHAIN] North Carolina | transgender individuals | Eastern District Court of North Carolina [SUMMARY] After the DOJ indicates that it believes a North Carolina law limiting transgender individuals access to bathrooms violates federal law, president Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate and the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives bring suit in federal court asking the Eastern District Court of North Carolina to declare that the law doesn't violate the laws cited by the DOJ and to declare that the DOJ action is illegal and unconstitutional. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA PHIL BERGER, in his official capacity as President pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate; TIM MOORE, in his official capacity as Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Plaintiffs, v. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE; LORETTA E. LYNCH, in her official capacity as Attorney General of the United States; VANITA GUPTA, in her official capacity as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF Defendants. INTRODUCTION 1. When people find themselves in the intimate settings of public bathrooms, locker rooms, or showers, they expect to encounter only other people of the same biological sex. Until very recently, that simple expectation of bodily privacy would have been taken for granted. Yet when North Carolina sought to protect that expectation in law—by enacting the “Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act” (the “Act”), commonly known as HB2—a torrent of vicious criticism was unleashed against the State, its officials, and its citizens. The abuse has now reached its apex with the unprecedented threats by the United States Department of Justice (“Department”), the defendant here. Last week, the Department sent letters to North Carolina public officials and agencies informing them that, by complying with the Act, they were engaging in a “pattern or practice” of discrimination in violation of three federal civil rights laws. They were bluntly ordered to repudiate the Act within five calendar days—that is, by today—or else face enforcement actions that would drastically impact North Carolina, including the potentially catastrophic elimination of more than two billion dollars in federal funding. Instead of meekly complying, plaintiffs—the leaders of both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly—have filed this declaratory judgment action. 2. A declaratory judgment is urgently needed for two basic reasons. First, it is needed to vindicate the sovereign right of North Carolina’s citizens to decide how best to protect their own bodily privacy and dignity in intimate public settings. Second, it is needed to instruct the Department in no uncertain terms that its overbearing abuse of executive authority flouts our Constitution’s limitations on federal power and tramples on the sovereign dignity of the States and their citizens. 3. The ideological extremity—and utter unworkability—of the Department’s position on the issues in this case is astonishing. Unlike the people of North Carolina, the Department believes that the only valid approach to issues of gender dysphoria is to allow anyone to use any communal public bathroom, locker room, or shower based solely on that person’s self-declared “gender identity.” Never mind that no federal statute or regulation remotely requires the Department’s policy. Never mind that the Department’s policy will inevitably lead to women and girls in public changing facilities encountering individuals who, whatever their gender identity, still have fully functional male genitals. Never mind that the Department’s policy, on its face, demands that North Carolina allow biologically male prison inmates who identify as females to take showers with biologically female inmates—which, besides being absurd and dangerous, also violates the Department’s own federal prison regulations. Apparently, the Department believes that these obvious social costs are outweighed by the policy’s purported psychological benefits to persons of conflicted gender identity. 4. The people of North Carolina came to a different and far more sensible conclusion, one they enacted in the law at issue in this case. Despite being grossly mischaracterized in the media, the Act does not embody hostility towards those whose gender identity differs from their biological sex. To the contrary, the Act specifically allows a flexible system of single-occupancy facilities for persons who do not wish to use public facilities designated for their biological sex. The Act also leaves in place existing provisions allowing a person to obtain a sex-change operation, make a corresponding change to their birth certificate, and then use the public facilities consistent with their new anatomy. And the Act allows private businesses and other entities to determine their own bathroom policies—including, if they wish, policies closer to the Department’s views. 5. But the Act also reflects concern and compassion for the many North Carolina residents—especially girls and women—who do not wish to be in close proximity to persons with genitals characteristic of the opposite sex when using public restrooms, locker rooms, and showers. Those people reasonably believe that a policy allowing people of the opposite biological sex into those spaces would be an assault on their dignity, privacy, and safety, and an affront to the legitimate and longstanding privacy expectations of all North Carolinians. That is why, in publicly owned facilities, the Act simply requires that everyone—regardless of their “gender identity” use the facilities that correspond to their current anatomy. 6. In short, the Act is not, as it has been mischaracterized in the press, an “anti-transgender” law. It is, rather, a law that promotes both privacy and safety, while accommodating the legitimate interests of persons with conflicts between their biological and gender identities. 7.

McCALL in his official capacity as Director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety, Defendants. COMPLAINT 1. Plaintiffs are a same-sex couple who were lawfully married outside the State of Alabama. They sue to challenge the constitutionality of Section 36.03 of the Alabama Constitution and Ala. Code <unk>30-1-19 (referred to collectively as the “Alabama Marriage Prohibitions”) which prohibit the State of Alabama from recognizing the marriages of samesex couples entered into in other jurisdictions. Alabama, like other states, encourages and regulates marriage through hundreds of laws that provide benefits to and impose obligations on married couples. In exchange, Alabama receives the well-established benefits that marriage brings: stable, supportive families that contribute to both the social and economic well-being of the State. It is because of the well-recognized benefits of marriage that Alabama has traditionally recognized lawful marriages performed in other states. 2. Alabama’s refusal to recognize Plaintiffs’ marriage unlawfully denies them many of the legal protections available to different-sex couples, including, but not limited to, the right to make medical decisions for an incapacitated spouse, access to health insurance and retirement benefits, property protections, and inheritance. 3. The refusal to recognize Plaintiffs’ marriage undermines the couples’ ability to achieve their life goals and dreams, threatens their mutual economic stability, and denies them “a dignity and status of immense import.” United States v. Windsor, 133 S Ct. 2675, 2692 (2013). They and their family are stigmatized and relegated to a second-class status by being barred from marriage, a bar that serves no legitimate state interest. The exclusion “tells [same-sex] couples and all the world that their otherwise valid relationships are unworthy” of recognition Id. at 2694. And it “humiliates... children now being raised by same-sex couples” and “makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.” Id. 4. Alabama’s exclusion of married same-sex couples from the protections and responsibilities of marriage violates the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This discriminatory treatment directly affects the fundamental right to marry and serves no compelling state interest. 5. Alabama’s refusal to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples discriminates against such couples on the basis of sexual orientation and sex. 6. The State’s discrimination against Plaintiffs and other married same-sex couples not only serves no compelling state interest, but also is not substantially related to an important state interest. It is not rationally related to the furtherance of any legitimate state interest. 7. Under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983, Plaintiffs seek: (a) a declaration that Alabama’s refusal to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples validly entered into outside of the State violates the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution where Alabama refuses to treat same-sex couples legally married in other jurisdictions the same as different-sex couples; and (b) a permanent injunction directing Defendants to legally recognize Plaintiffs’ marriage and the marriages of other same-sex couples validly entered into outside of Alabama. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 8. Plaintiffs sue under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 for violations of civil rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This Court has jurisdiction over all claims for relief pursuant 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1343(a)(3) (civil rights). 9.

Plaintiffs also seek an injunction prohibiting the State of Arkansas, and all political subdivisions thereof, from enforcing Amendment 83 or the referenced statutes. Declaratory relief is sought under the United States Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, et seq., and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57. Injunctive relief is. sought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 II. PARTIES A. Plaintiffs 3. Plaintiffs Becca and Tara Austin and Rita and Pam Jernigan are lesbian couples who wish to marry for the same reasons so many other couples get married-to publicly declare their love and commitment for each other before their family, friends and community, and to give one another the security and protections that only marriage provides. 4. Plaintiffs Becca and Tara Austin have been in a committed relationship for over nine (9) years. Becca and Tara are both employees at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, where They have twins-<unk>a boy and a girl-who are four and a half (4V2) years old. Tara is the biological mother of the children. Because Becca is not a biological parent to the children and cannot legally marry Tara, Becca is not considered a parent to the twins under Arkansas law. The fact that Becca and Tara Austin are not permitted to marry harms them in other material ways, including reducing family resources and stigmatizing the Austins and their children by denying them family social recognition and respect. When their children were born, Becca was denied family leave time to spend with the twins at home after they were born because she and Tara were not married and the children were not legally her dependents. Tara wanted to stay home after the children were born but had to return to work full time in order to have health insurance for her.and the children. Becca could not carry Tara and the children on a family health insurance plan because she and Tara were not (and could not be) married and the children were not her legal dependents. 5. Plaintiff Rita Jernigan retired after teaching math in the Little Rock School District for over twenty-eight (28) years. She participated in the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System (ATRS) while employed and currently receives retirement pay from ATRS. Amendment 83 to the Arkansas Constitution prohibits Rita's life partner, Pam, from receiving surviving spouse benefits under ATRS in the event of Rita's death. 6. Plaintiffs Randy and Gary Eddy-McCain are a gay couple who are already married under New York law. They have been in a committed relationship for twentyone (21) years. They were married in 2012 in the State of New York, which recognizes same-sex marriage. A copy of Randy and Gary Eddy-McCain's New York State Marriage License is attached as Exhibit 1. Although Randy and Gary Eddy-McCain are legally married, they are treated as legal strangers in their home state of Arkansas. 7. Plaintiffs come from various walks of life and occupations-a nurse practitioner, an executive assistant, a retired schoolteacher, a minister, an artist, and the owner of a pet-sitting service. All of the Plaintiffs are homeowners and reside in Pulaski County, Arkansas. They are involved in their communities and have been in committed relationships with one another for many years. The situations faced by these couples are similar to those faced by thousands of same-sex couples in the State of Arkansas who are being denied the basic rights that are afforded by marriage. They have cared for one another, supported each other, sacrificed for each other, and made plans for the future with each other.

The rate reduction is being imposed on a system already in crisis, wherein inadequate payment levels have resulted in a scarcity of willing providers, creating serious access hurdles for Medi-Cal beneficiaries. A further reduction in rates will result in additional providers withdrawing from the Medi-Cal program and will exacerbate the current access problems, making it more difficult for Medi-Cal beneficiaries to find physicians, dentists, or other health care providers who are willing to treat them or fill their prescriptions. 2.

INTRODUCTION 3. The State of California continues to disregard the mandates of federal 14 law when making decisions that impact the rates of reimbursement afforded to 15 health care providers under California's Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. On two 16 separate occasions in 2008, as part ofthe enactment of the State budget, the 17 California Legislature passed statutes that called for flat percentage reductions in the 18 payment rates for various classes of services covered under Medi-Cal. The majority 19 of these payment rate reductions were enjoined by federal courts because they were 20 not enacted or implemented in a manner consistent with the federal Medicaid Act, 21 which requires that states consider certain factors and take certain procedural steps 22 before altering the rates paid to health care providers. Indeed, these rate reductions 23 resulted in three, published decisions from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 24 establishing clearly that, to the extent it undertakes the task of setting Medi-Cal 25 payment rates, the Legislature must comply with the mandates of federal law and, if 26 it does not, the offending State statutes will be preempted. 4. The Legislature's effort to balance California's budget for the 28 2009-2010 fiscal year has resulted in legislation that once again reduces Medi-Cal COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF 1 payment rates solely in the name of financial savings and without adherence to the 2 requirements ofthe Medicaid Act. Although the form of the most recent rate 3 reductions may differ slightly from the flat percentage reductions that were enjoined 4 previously, the process through which the latest limitations were enacted was 5 virtually identical to the process that led to the now enjoined cuts. The State should 6 not be permitted to continue to ignore federal law when setting Medi-Cal payment 7 rates. 5. By this action, an organization representing the interests of California 9 Intermediate Care Facilities For The Mentally Retarded (""ICFIMR facilities"") and 10 Freestanding Pediatric Subacute facilities (""FPS facilities"") seeks an injunction to 11 invalidate and stop the implementation of the Medi-Cal rate limitation, which went 12 into effect on August 1, 2009, that applies to payment rates for services rendered by 13 ICFIMR facilities and FPS facilities. This new payment limitation has and will 14 continue to improperly deprive Medi-Cal participating ICFIMR facilities and FPS 15 facilities, including a large number of small facilities, of reimbursement to which 16 they otherwise are lawfully entitled. 6. The payment limitation is illegal because, as it has multiple times 18 before, the California Legislature failed to fulfill its legal mandate to consider 19 whether the resulting reimbursement rates are consistent with efficiency, economy 20 and quality of care, reasonably related to provider costs, and sufficient to enlist 21 enough providers so that Medi-Cal beneficiaries have access to the impacted 22 services to the extent such services are available to the general public.

The State of Michigan, the State of California, the District of Columbia, the State of 3 Maine, the State of New Mexico, and the State of Wisconsin (collectively, the Plaintiffs, Plaintiff 4 States, or the States) bring this action to challenge a rule promulgated by Defendants Secretary 5 Elisabeth D. DeVos and the United States Department of Education (the Department) 6 (collectively, Defendants), unlawfully and erroneously interpreting the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 7 and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Public Law 116–136, 134 Stat. 281. The 8 Department’s interpretation will deprive low-income and at-risk students, their teachers, and the 9 public schools that serve them of critical resources to meet students’ educational and social- 10 emotional needs during and after pandemic-related school closures. The States will also be 11 harmed by the loss of these critical resources at a time of severe crisis. 2. The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020, to address some of the financial 13 challenges faced by Americans as businesses closed, employees lost their jobs, and schools shut 14 down in an unprecedented effort to slow the spread of the virus. The statute authorizes the 15 allocation of $30.75 billion for elementary and secondary schools and higher education in 16 response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including assisting students to transition to distance 17 learning. The statute directs states to distribute CARES Act funds to local educational agencies 18 (LEAs) in proportion to their allocation under part A of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary 19 Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) in the previous fiscal year. Title I-A funds are allocated to LEAs 20 and schools based on the number of children who are economically disadvantaged. These funds 21 benefit many of the vulnerable students whom the States serve, including children with 22 disabilities, migrant children, English language learners, children in residential or day programs 23 for students in the foster care or juvenile justice systems, and homeless children. 3.

The complaint alleged that the closings affected children with disabilities, English language learners, children in residential or day care, children who lost their jobs, and homeless children. On September 20, 2019, the court granted the states' motion for summary judgment and granted their motion for partial summary judgment. The parties then entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. On March 2020, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the case. On June 21, 2019, the parties agreed to a preliminary injunction. On July 21, 2020, the court entered a permanent injunction against the DOE and the DOE. On May 2021, the parties entered a consent decree. The consent decree requires the DOE to comply with the terms of the consent decree and to provide the states with a copy of the final consent decree within 30 days.</s>"

Arkansas approved a work requirement in Medicaid as a requirement for health coverage in its amendments on March 5, 2018.

On August 14, 2018, three individuals filed a suit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as administrators involved in implementing the Arkansas Works Amendments (AMA) in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the SSA and the Constitution in approving the AWA in March 2018. All three plaintiffs were beneficiaries of Medicaid who lost or risked losing medical coverage due to changes in the AWA. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the AWA and attorney fees. 

On March 27, 2019, the court held that the AWA work requirement does not advance the purpose of the SSA. The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and vacated the approval for Arkansas’s program. On April 10, 2019, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 

On February 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment vacating the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas Works Amendments. The court emphasized that providing healthcare coverage is the primary purpose of Medicaid. The defendants' alternative objectives of better health outcomes, financial independence, and transition to commercial coverage, on the other hand, were not consistent with Medicaid. The court found the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas program to be arbitrary and capricious due to the failure to consider whether the program would result in loss of coverage, an important aspect of the approval analysis.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHARLES GRESHAM 123 W. Ridge Ave., Apt. C, Harrison, AR 72601 CESAR ARDON MARISOL ARDON Plaintiffs, v. ALEX M. AZAR II SECRETARY, UNITED STATES DEPART- MENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES in his official capacity SEEMA VERMA ADMINISTRATOR, CENTERS FOR MEDI- CARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES in her official capacity Baltimore, MD 21244 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES Baltimore, MD 21244 Defendants. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This case challenges the ongoing efforts of the Executive Branch to bypass the legislative process and act unilaterally to “comprehensively transform” Medicaid, the cornerstone of the social safety net. Purporting to invoke a narrow statutory waiver authority that allows experimental projects “likely to assist in promoting the objectives” of Medicaid, the Executive Branch has instead effectively rewritten the statute, ignoring congressional restrictions, overturning a half century of administrative practice, and threatening irreparable harm to the health and welfare of the poorest and most vulnerable in our country. 2. The Medicaid program provides health insurance coverage to more than 75 million low-income people in the United States. Medicaid enables states to provide a range of federally specified preventive, acute, and long-term health care services to individuals “whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.” As described in more detail below, the core populations covered by Medicaid include children; pregnant women; the aged, blind, or disabled; and, as added by the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), adults with household incomes of less than 133% of the federal poverty level (currently $12,140 for an individual; $16,460 for a family of two). 3. The Medicaid program offers a deal for states. If a state chooses to participate in the program, the federal government will contribute the lion’s share of the cost of providing care. In return, the state agrees to pay the remaining portion of the costs of care and to follow all federal requirements, including those regarding the scope of coverage and eligibility for the program. States may not impose additional eligibility requirements other than those set forth in the Medicaid Act, and states cannot pick and choose among individuals within a covered population group. 4. The Social Security Act, of which Medicaid Act is a part, does permit the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to waive certain federal Medicaid requirements, but only in narrow circumstances — when necessary to allow a state to carry out an experimental or pilot program that is likely to promote the objectives of the Medicaid Act. 5. In 2014, the State of Arkansas obtained such a waiver to expand its Medicaid program to cover the adults made eligible through the ACA by using private health plans. In 2016, this waiver was renewed and extended through 2021. Consistent with previous agency actions, HHS denied Arkansas’ request to impose a work requirement as a condition of eligibility, finding such a requirement was not consistent with the objectives of the Medicaid Act. 6. Early in 2017, the current HHS abruptly reversed course, signaling to states that it would revise its use of the waiver authority in Medicaid as part of President Trump’s vow to “explode” the ACA and its Medicaid expansion. On June 30, 2017, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson submitted the “Arkansas Works Amendment,” a request to the Secretary of HHS to implement a work requirement as a condition of Medicaid eligibility in order to “promot[e] personal responsibility and work, encourage[e] movement up the economic ladder, and facilitate[e] transitions from Arkansas Works” to private coverage. 7. While the Arkansas Works Amendment was pending, HHS announced its new Medicaid waiver policy through a letter to State Medicaid Directors. Reversing decades of agency guidance, and consistent with the Administrator’s own expressed view of the need to “fundamentally transform Medicaid,” the letter to State Medicaid Directors announced the agency’s intention to, for the first time, approve waiver applications containing work requirements and outlining “guidelines” for states to consider in submitting such applications. On March 5, 2018, citing the Dear State Medicaid Director Letter, the Secretary approved the Arkansas Works Amendment, and Arkansas began implementing the Amendment on June 1, 2018. 8. The Secretary’s issuance of the letter to State Medicaid Directors and approval of Arkansas’ request sharply deviate from the congressionally established requirements of the Medicaid program and vastly exceed any lawful exercise of the Secretary’s limited waiver authority. This Amendment will harm Arkansans across the state who need a range of health services, including check-ups, diabetes treatment, mental health services, non-emergency medical transportation, and vision and dental care. The letter and approval of Arkansas’ application are unauthorized attempts to re-write the Medicaid Act, and the use of the Social Security Act’s waiver authority to “transform” Medicaid is an abuse of that authority. The Defendants’ actions here thus violate both the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution, and they cannot survive. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 9.

Plaintiff Campaign Legal Center (“CLC”) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit legal organization that works to strengthen American democracy at all levels of government. Among other activities, CLC engages in local, state, and federal actions to ensure the political process is accessible to all citizens, resulting in a representative, responsive, and accountable government. As part of these activities, CLC conducts research, publishes reports and articles, and regularly provides expert analysis to the media. CLC is also involved in litigation throughout the country regarding voting rights, campaign finance, redistricting, and electoral ethics. To support these efforts and to educate the public, CLC regularly seeks information under FOIA regarding federal agency decision-making. 4. Defendant Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is a department of the Executive Branch of the United States Government. The Office of Information Policy (“OIP”), the Office of the Attorney General (“OAG”), and the Justice Management Division (“JMD”) are components of Defendant DOJ. Defendant DOJ is an “agency” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(f). STATEMENT OF FACTS 5. On February 1, 2018, CLC submitted to OAG and JMD a FOIA request for records pertaining to a request by Arthur E. Gary, the General Counsel of JMD, to the Census Bureau to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census Questionnaire. See Ex. 1 (Feb. 1, 2018 FOIA Letter). 6. In particular, CLC sought (1) documents to, from, or mentioning Dr. Ron Jarmin or Dr. Enrique Lamas; and (2) documents containing the phrases “2020 census,” “long form,” “citizenship question,” “questions regarding citizenship,” “ACS,” “American Community Survey,” “citizen voting age population,” or “CVAP,” dating from January 20, 2017 to the present. 7. CLC requested expedited processing because there is an “urgency to inform the public” about the “actual or alleged government activity” covered by the request and because the requested records involve “a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government’s integrity that affect public confidence.” 28 8. Since CLC’s initial request, the urgency of this request has only increased. On March 26, 2018, Secretary Ross announced his decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.1 Secretary Ross made this announcement despite a technical review by Census officials concluding that the change will be “very costly” and “harm[] the quality of the Census count.”2 Eighteen states, as well as various cities, counties, mayors, and nonprofit organizations, have filed suit against the Department of Commerce to enjoin the addition of the citizenship question.

INTRODUCTION 1. A person’s access to health care should not be contingent on their sex, gender identity, transgender status, sexual orientation, race, national origin, age, disability, or religion. When people go to a doctor’s office, hospital, or an emergency room seeking treatment, they expect and are entitled to receive care appropriate to meet their health needs without regard to who they are or the type of health care they seek. 2. Yet, in the midst of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration’s Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has sought to diminish protections from discrimination in health care because of a person’s sex, gender identity, transgender status, sexual orientation, race, national origin, age, or disability. 3. HHS has taken these actions notwithstanding and despite the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on June 15, 2020 holding that discrimination on the basis of a person’s transgender status or sexual orientation is discrimination on the basis of sex. See Bostock v. Clayton Cty., Ga., 590 U.S. 2020 WL 3146686 (June 15, 2020). 4. As of the filing of this Complaint, and in less than six months, approximately 2.25 million people in the United States have tested positive for COVID-19, resulting in approximately 120,000 deaths to date.1 The United States is facing a public health crisis. During these difficult times, Americans need the security and peace of mind that they will be able to access the health care they need and require. The government should be doing everything within its capacity to protect and preserve the safe and effective delivery of health care to all patients regardless of their sex, gender identity, transgender status, sexual orientation, race, 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Cases in the U.S., https://perma.cc/38HG-JUBB (last visited June 21, 2020). national origin, age, or disability. Yet, HHS is doing exactly the opposite, adopting positions that fly in the face of its stated mission to “enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans by providing for effective health and human services.” 2 5. Recognizing the paramount importance of providing people with prompt, effective, and nondiscriminatory access to health care, Congress has taken repeated and concerted efforts to improve access to health care and bar discrimination within the health care industry. 6. Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>18116, specifically and explicitly protects against discrimination in the provision of health care services. Section 1557 prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, color, national origin, age, and disability. 7. In 2016, HHS promulgated a final rule, developed over the course of six years and two notice-and-comment periods, to implement the nondiscrimination requirements of Section 1557.

The plaintiffs also alleged that HHS violated Section 15(a) of the federal health care law by failing to implement a final rule that would have protected them from discrimination in the provision of health care.

CRIPA gives the Department of Justice authority to seek a remedy for a pattern and practice of conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights (including those under the ADA) of individuals with mental illness or developmental disabilities who are in public institutions. The Department also has authority to seek a remedy for violations of Title II of the ADA. 42 U.S.C <unk>12133. We notified then-Governor Ruth Ann Minner in November 2007 that we were initiating an investigation of conditions and practices atDPC pursuant to CRIPA. We conducted an on site inspection ofDPC on April28-May 2, 2008, with the assistance of expert consultants in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric nursing, and fire safety. On July 29,2010, we notified Delaware's Deputy Attorney General that we were also focusing our investigation on community integration issues in the State. On August 4-6, 2010, we toured DPC and the community to examine whether the State is serving individuals confined to DPC and statewide in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. While on site, we interviewed persons in statewide leadership positions, hospital administrative staff, community providers of mental health services, and individuals confined to DPC, and examined the physical plant conditions throughout the facility. We also reviewed a wide variety of documents, including policies and procedures, incident reports, and medical and mental health records. Our most recent tour included interviews with leadership from DPC and the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (""DDHSS"") and a review of hospital clinical records and administrative documents, as well as substantial interviews with providers who are responsible for community-based mental health services to individuals discharged from DPC or at risk of admission. In addition, we had an opportunity to interview consumers who are currently served by the community system. Consistent with our commitment to provide technical assistance and conduct a transparent investigation, we concluded our tours with an extensive debriefing at which our consultants conveyed their initial impressions and concerns about the DPC to counsel, administrators, staff, and State officials. Before discussing our findings, we wish to express our appreciation for the hospitality, cooperation, and professionalism of the statewide leadership and hospital staff and administrators throughout our investigation. We hope to continue to work with Delaware officials and the staff at DPC in the same cooperative manner going forward. In accordance with our statutory requirements under CRIPA, we now write to advise you formally of the findings of our investigation, the facts supporting them, and the minimum steps necessary to remedy the deficiencies set forth below. 42 U:S.C. <unk>1997b(a).

Delaware has been on notice of many ofthe findings we make in this letter. In November 2007- shortly after we notified Delaware of our CRIPA investigation- the Delaware Depmiment of Justice (""DDOJ"") initiated its own investigation to determine whether DPC had violated individuals' statutory rights guaranteed by Delaware law. On March 7, 2008, the DDOJ issued its own findings citing significant deficiencies and concluded that numerous conditions, practices, acts, and failures to act by DPC administrators and staff resulted in systemic and pervasive violations of the state statutory civil rights of individuals confined to DPC, including: failure to develop appropriate treatment plans; failure to prepare adequate discharge plans; failure to ensure safety; physical and emotional abuse of individuals by staff; mistreatment of individuals by staff through inappropriate use of medications, isolation, and physical and chemical restraints; neglect of individuals by staff; failure to protect individuals from assaults by other patients; and failure to protect individuals from self-inflicted abuse due to inadequate supervision and monitoring. In May 2008, the DPC entered into a memorandum of agreement with DDOJ to address these findings. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (""CMS"") has made similar findings. Current Delaware leadership acknowledge and recognize that an effective","<pad>The U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division recently conducted an investigation of conditions and practices at the Delaware Psychiatric Center. The investigation was conducted pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The DDOJ also conducted its own investigation of the DPC in 2008 and concluded that numerous conditions, practices, acts, and failures to act resulted in systemic and pervasive violations of the state statutory civil rights of individuals confined to DPC. As a result of the investigation, the State of Delaware entered into a memorandum of agreement with the DDOj in May 2008 to address these findings.

The plaintiffs claimed that the state discriminated against them by failing to offer services that would enable them to live in a community setting. After a bench trial, the court entered judgment for one of the named plaintiffs and decertified the class that he had previously approved. In part because of recent legislation that greatly improved the state's efficiency at moving eligible persons from nursing homes to community living, the court determined that the conditions allowing for the class no longer existed.","UNiTED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA TALLAHASSEE DIVISION WilLIAM LONG, CHARLES TODD LEE, RODNEY PETERSON, JOHN BOYD, CLAYTON L GRIFFIN, MARGARET WASHINGTON, and LOUISE SEYMOUR, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, v DR.

To date, DCF has not finalized rules regarding the implementation and operation HB 353, but is operating under interim, non-final policies. During a period of record unemployment, Florida has the dubious distinction of being the first state to institute across-the-board, suspicionless drug testing of all applicants for TCA. Despite applicants' dire financial straits, HB 353 also mandates that applicants pay for the testing. HB 353 strips Plaintiff and all TANF applicants of their Fourth Amendment right to fteedom from unreasonable searches by mandating urine testing without any individualized suspicion of drug use. TCA applicants are required to undergo testing not because they are performing dangerous tasks that require sobriety, or because they are known. or even suspected drug users or abusers. The State requirea invasive testing of bodily fluids merely because TCA applicants have fallen on hard times and need temporary help to tide them and their children over until they can once again be employed. Plaintiff and other putative class members are suffering and will sutrer serious violations of their constitutional rights and civil liberties if Defendant continues to enforce HB 353, as they are being denied and will continue to be denied the temporary cash assistance they need for day-to-day subsistence, and to which they would be entitled by law but for their refusal to waive their Fourth Amendment rights and to submit to the uniquely intrusive treatment by DCF.

This is a civil action arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States presenting a substantial Federal question. 2. Venue is properly in the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, pursuant to 28 United States Code 1391. Both Defendants AKE and ASHCROFT have offices for the conduct of official business in Hillsborough County, Florida: also a substantial part of the events or omissions giving raise to the claim occurred in the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. 3. This is an action for a Declaratory Judgment pursuant to 28 U.S. Code 2201 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the purpose of determining an actual and existing justiciable controversy to declare the rights and other legal relations and questions of construction and/or the validity of an Act of Congress and a Florida Statute between the parties as hereinafter more fully appears. BACKGROUND 4. Through the institution of marriage, society publicly guarantees individuals respect and legitimacy as a couple. For those who choose to marry, and for their children, marriage provides an abundance of legal, financial and social benefits. The ability to marry and to thereby participate in this fundamental societal institution is something that most Americans take for granted. Florida Same-sex couples do not; they are denied access solely on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender. 5. The Supreme Court of the United States has found that the right to marry is not a privilege conferred by the State, but a fundamental right that is protected against unwarranted State interference. As Mr. Chief Justice WARREN said in Virginia, 87 S Ct. 1817 (1967) atp. 1824; ""The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our very existence and survival."" This right is vitiated if one is denied the right to marry a person of one's choice; the decision to marry is among the personal decisions that is part of the fundamental ""right of privacy"" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. 6. Our highest court has also mandated that if a law ""impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly secured by the Constitution, (it) is presumptively unconstitutional."" As a result, the burden shifts to the government to pass a ""strict scrutiny"" test by the courts for certain classifications and fundamental rights to be valid; the government must justify an intrusion on Plaintiffs' fundamental rights of privacy, liberty and autonomy found in the Due_ Process Clause and the right of equality in the Equal Protection Clause. Excluding same-sex couples from a basic element of civic life marr1age infringes human dignity and violates the Constitution of the United States, which affirms the dignity and equality of all individuals; it forbids the creation of second- class citizens. There is no identifiable constitutionally adequate reason for denying civil marriage to same-sex couples. Plaintiffs would show that the Act of Congress and the Florida Statute under the microscope here and both of which define ""marriage"" as a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife AND which prohibit recognition of same-sex marriages can meet constitutional muster ONLY if they further a compelling governmental interest and the legislation substantially furthers that interest, doing so through the least restrictive means to overcome the constitutional right. The ordinary deference due legislation does not apply when fundamental constitutional rights are implicated. 7. Plaintiffs ask this Court to construe constitutional rights which operate in favor of the individual against government so as to achieve the primary goal of individual freedom and autonomy especially where homosexuals are the traditional targets of unfair, irrational and unlawful discrimination. 8. The legislative decisions of Congress and Florida are clearly erroneous, arbitrary or wholly unwarranted here; their decisions clearly transgress private rights. In spite of the foregoing, the United States' and Florida's statutory codes as detailed later, do not permit marriages of lesbian and gay couples. It is this selective denial of marriage equality to this disfavored group that has led to this action. PLAINTIFFS 9. Plaintiffs are a lesbian couple who are citizens of the United States, over 18 years of age seeking to live a full life by availing themselves of a marriage universally recognized, the social validation it confers, and the hundreds of rights, responsibilities, benefits and obligations that it affords and which are predicated on marriage","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Tampa, Florida | U.S. District Court | Middle District of Florida | Tampa Division | Tampa | Florida | Hillsborough County | Plaintiffs | Department of Justice .<n>Plaintiffs filed this suit in the Middle district of Florida, Tampa Division, seeking a declaration that Florida's ban on same-sex marriage violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

By the time the paramedics resuscitated him, Marketric's brain was catastrophically and irreparably injured. 9. Following Marketric's devastating neurologic injury, he developed many severe health conditions which are difficult to control and can quickly become lifethreatening. Marketric's doctors have diagnosed him with many serious, incurable conditions including but not limited to static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, spastic quadriplegia with sustained clonus in all four extremities, intractable seizure disorder, chronic lung disease, chronic upper airway obstruction, gastro esophageal reflex, scoliosis with curvatures, and severe mental retardation. 11. Marketric is medically fragile with multiple systems diagnoses. 12. Most of Marketric's diagnoses are complications of extensive brain damage. 13. Marketric's medical conditions are challenging to manage effectively. Marketric experiences frequent and serious infections, respiratory distress, and hospitalizations. 14. Marketric needs to be administered many medications and treatments on a strict schedule around the clock. He requires frequent deep suctioning to remove secretions from his airways. He often needs oxygen. 1 5. Marketric's conditions require constant assessment for signs indicating the need for more or other medications and interventions to prevent further complications, and to keep him as healthy as possible. 16. When he is most healthy, Marketric is alert and attempts to communicate. Marketric is too medica lly fragile to attend school outside of his home, so he receives services and therapies at home to, among other things, help him communicate better. Marketric's physicians have determined that Marketric requires private duty nursing to keep him as healthy as possible, to compensate for health conditions, to improve or prevent conditions from worsening, and to keep him from developing new problems. 18. Marketric's physicians have repeatedly documented Marketric's medical conditions and health care needs and have prescribed private duty nursing services for Marketric for at least five (5) years. 19. On September 5, 2008, Marketric was admitted to Children's Medical Center in Augusta to have surgery to place a rod next to his spine to correct","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2008 | Georgia Department of Community Health | Georgia Medical Care Foundation, Inc. | U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ||| August 2009 ||| September 2010 ||| May 2011 ||| June 2012 ||| July 2013 ||| March 2014 ||| October 2014 | December 2015 ||| January 2016 |</s>"

These therapies were necessary to ensure the plaintiffs' conditions would not deteriorate and that they would not lose functional ability. The FSSA had denied the named plaintiffs and others similarly situated continuing access to these therapies, citing two provisions of the Indiana Administrative Code. On February 10, 2011, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs, issuing a permanent injunction preventing the Defendants and their successors from limiting or denying coverage for prescribed physical, occupational, or respiratory therapy, and/or speech pathology, for any person under 21 enrolled in the State's Medicaid program when such denial or limitation was based upon the two disputed provisions.","IN THE I ;l r"" CZ<unk>urT p<unk>UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT zt SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA 10 MAR 25 AM 10; INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION i A.M.T., by his imother and next friend Karla) T; J.J.M., by hils mother and next friend Amy M.; and JfM.G., by his father and next friend Michael :G., on their own behalf and Plaintiffs, i rI s.

The plaintiffs alleged that underfunding and the flawed design of the 2020 Census might lead to undercounts of the US population in violation of the Enumeration Clause and to the detriment of minority populations, as the census count is tied to both public funding and governmental representation. The plaintiffs requested an injunction to require the US to develop a plan to ensure a fair and accurate count. The court dismissed the claim for injunctive relief as unripe because census preparations were ongoing, but allowed the claim on underfunding to continue. The court also allowed the plaintiffs to add two claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. On April 16, 2020, the court granted the government’s motion to dismiss; the case is closed. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE; PRINCE GEORGE’S COUNTY MARYLAND; PRINCE GEORGE’S COUNTY MARYLAND NAACP BRANCH; ROBERT E. ROSS; and H. ELIZABETH JOHNSON, Plaintiffs, Civil Action No. COMPLAINT v. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS; RON JARMIN, Acting Director, Bureau of the Census; WILBUR ROSS, Secretary of Commerce; DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States; and THE UNITED STATES, Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution imposes one of the few affirmative obligations on the federal government: to conduct an “actual Enumeration” of all residents every ten years. Despite this duty, the United States has undercounted people of color since the nation’s founding, starting with the decision to treat African American slaves as only three-fifths of a person. The Three-Fifths Clause appeared in the same constitutional provision that mandates a decennial census. The failure fully to count African Americans has persisted to the present. In the 2010 Census, for example, there was a 2.1% net undercount of African Americans. Accordingly, in the past, federal officials have made considerable efforts to enumerate what the Census Bureau calls “hard-to-count” individuals, including African Americans, non-English speakers, and young people. These efforts reflect the recognition that an inaccurate census hurts some communities more than others, depriving them of their constitutional right to representation and their fair share of resources. The government’s preparations for the 2020 Census, however, are so conspicuously deficient as to extend far beyond the failures of past censuses, such that they violate Defendants’ constitutional duty to conduct an “actual Enumeration.” U.S. Const., Art. I, <unk>2. Sufficient staffing, funding, and preparation in advance of the census are essential to such a monumental undertaking. Yet, only two years from the 2020 Census, the Census Bureau lacks both a permanent director and a deputy director. A presidential hiring freeze has limited the Bureau’s capacity to fill routine staff vacancies. The Bureau also canceled essential field tests last year and two of three “dress rehearsal” sites this year. Moreover, the Bureau’s intention to adopt substantial new technologies for the 2020 Census makes these cancellations especially dangerous. Defendants are unprepared to conduct the first-ever digital census, which will exacerbate undercounts and leave the census vulnerable to cyber-attack. Despite these imminent threats to the accuracy and integrity of the 2020 Census, the Bureau has been operating on the cheap, without sufficient funding to address its many challenges. These deficiencies will result in a massive undercount of communities of color. The effects of an inaccurate census will be felt across the country, and especially in places like Prince George’s County, Maryland that are home to many “hard-to-count” people. Such a dramatic undercount will especially dilute the votes of racial and ethnic minorities, deprive their communities of critical federal funds, and undervalue their voices and interests in the political arena. Plaintiffs the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Prince George’s County Maryland Branch NAACP, Prince George’s County, Robert Ross, and Elizabeth Johnson, ask this Court to address this grave and imminent threat to the accuracy of the census. Absent judicial intervention, Defendants will violate their constitutional obligation to conduct an actual enumeration of all people residing in the United States. Plaintiffs bring this action to compel Defendants to fulfill their constitutional duty. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1.

The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs alleged that DHHS had violated Title II of the ADA and other federal laws. The Plaintiffs alleged that the State had failed to accommodate Plaintiffs' disabilities and to provide medically necessary treatment in the most integrated setting possible, instead forcing them into nursing homes where they were functionally segregated from the outside world. In August, 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint reframing the case as a class action on behalf of all similarly situated Maine residents. The parties began settlement discussions shortly thereafter. On May 2, 2012, the Court (Judge Nancy Torresen) approved the settlement. The settlement agreement required the State to establish a Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW) program, which would provide a limited number of qualifying class-members the opportunity to live in community-based settings.

Brenda Harvey, Commissioner, Maine Department Of Health and Human Services, Defendant. Civil Action No. COMPLAINT I. Introduction 1. This action is brought by and on behalf of three young men who have been unlawfully confined to nursing facilities for years in violation of their rights under federal law. The Plaintiffs, despite their disabilities, are capable of attending school, working and participating in various community activities, and being contributing members of society. Maine state officials have failed to accommodate Plaintiffs’ disabilities and ensure that they receive appropriate treatment in the most integrated setting possible. The Plaintiffs are currently segregated in nursing facilities, where they do not receive even minimally adequate training, habilitation, or support services, as required by law. The Plaintiffs, therefore, bring this action against Maine’s Commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services (hereafter the “Defendant”) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. 2. The Plaintiffs should not be in nursing facilities because they do not require significant nursing care but instead need only supervision or assistance with activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing and eating. The medically necessary services to which Plaintiffs are entitled can and must be provided, under applicable federal law, in integrated community settings. 3. Maine, like most other states, voluntarily participates in the federal Medicaid program. 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396 – 1396v. As a condition of participation, Maine must ensure that services that are medically necessary for its citizens with disabilities are provided in a reasonably prompt manner and in sufficient amount, duration, and scope to meet the medical and clinical needs of all eligible Medicaid recipients like the Plaintiffs. 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396a(a)(8), 42 C.F.R. <unk>440.230(b). This failure to provide Plaintiffs with the programs and supports to which they are entitled has resulted in their deterioration, regression, segregation and unnecessary institutionalization. 4. Alternatively, if the Plaintiffs needed nursing home care, because Plaintiffs have developmental disabilities, they require and are entitled to receive specialized services appropriate to their individual needs, which promote independence and growth, while they remain confined in nursing facilities. The Nursing Home Reform Amendments to the federal Medicaid Act (hereafter “NHRA”) require that individuals with developmental disabilities must be screened to determine that they actually need nursing services prior to their admission to nursing facilities. 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396r(e). These amendments also require that the state “provide or arrange for the provision of” specialized services in nursing facilities or in the community to individuals with developmental disabilities, including the Plaintiffs who have cerebral palsy. 42 C.F.R. <unk>483.120. The Plaintiffs have received no specialized services and continue to live in nursing facilities segregated from their communities. 5. In segregating Plaintiffs in nursing facilities and failing to afford them equal access to community services and supports, the Defendant contravenes the integration and nondiscrimination mandates of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (hereafter “ADA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131-12134. and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (hereafter “Rehab Act”), 29 U.S.C. <unk>794. Likewise, the Defendant violates the relevant provisions of the Social Security Act and its implementing regulations in unnecessarily confining Plaintiffs to nursing facilities and failing to provide them with specialized services appropriate to their disabilities. 6. This case is brought to remedy these violations of federal law and to ensure that Jacob Van Meter, Adam Fletcher, and Eric Reeves receive appropriate services to which they are entitled under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396a 1396v and that these services are provided in an integrated community setting, as required by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12133, and the Rehab Act, 28 C.F.R. <unk>41.51(d).

Plaintiffs Marsha Caspar and Glenna DeJong, Clint McCormack and Bryan Reamer, Frank Colasonti, Jr. and James Barclay Ryder, Samantha Wolf and Martha Rutledge, James Anteau and Jared Haddock, Kelly Callison and Anne Callison, Bianca Racine and Carrie Miller, and Martin Contreras and Keith Orr are eight same-sex couples who were legally married in Michigan on March 22, 2014, but are now being denied, along with their families, the dignity, recognition, privileges, and benefits that all legally married couples and their families deserve and are entitled to under the law. 2. Plaintiffs were married in Michigan after this Court, in DeBoer v. Snyder, permanently enjoined state officials from enforcing Michigan’s constitutional and statutory bans on marriage for same-sex couples, and before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed this Court’s judgment in DeBoer pending appeal. When Plaintiffs became married on March 22, 2014 in accordance with Michigan law, they immediately obtained vested rights in the validity and recognition of their marriages under Michigan law. Their marriages, and the protections and responsibilities that flow to them and their families from their married status, are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and must be recognized by state officials regardless of the ultimate outcome of the DeBoer litigation. 3. In violation of constitutional protections due to all legally married couples and their families, the Governor of Michigan has publicly announced that, as a result of the Sixth Circuit’s stay of this Court’s judgment in DeBoer, the legal benefits and rights associated with Plaintiffs’ marriages are being “suspended,” and the State of Michigan will not recognize the validity of Plaintiffs’ marriages because they are same-sex couples. 4. By retroactively stripping Plaintiffs’ marriages of legal recognition, the Governor has placed Plaintiffs and their families in an intolerable state of legal limbo that threatens their wellbeing, health, financial security, and family integrity, and denies their dignity as free and equal citizens. Absent relief from this Court, Plaintiffs will be unable to access critical protections and benefits for themselves and their families that are enjoyed as of right by all other couples who were legally married in Michigan. 5. By this action, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring that their legally valid marriages be given immediate and ongoing recognition by the State of Michigan as required by the due process and equal protection guarantees of the United States Constitution.

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Medicaid recipients with disabling and chronic conditions bring this suit to challenge the lack of basic due process protections for Medicaid recipients when their developmental disability services were reduced or terminated effective July 1, 2011 by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), through its Medicaid managed care contractor and agent, Defendant Piedmont Behavioral Healthcare (hereinafter “PBH”), under the direction of its Area Director, Defendant Shipman. Without any change in their underlying health conditions or needs, essential Medicaid services previously authorized for the care of each named Plaintiff and hundreds of others similarly situated were terminated or reduced effective July 1, 2011 by Defendant PBH. Defendant PBH is using a “Supports Needs Matrix” to terminate the services, but the process uses arbitrary, non-ascertainable standards and the recipients were given no meaningful opportunity to challenge the PBH decisions. This class action seeks to enjoin Defendants from reducing these essential health services without first providing due process to the plaintiffs and others similarly situated. The violations of law and illegal reduction of services suffered by the named plaintiffs are typical of similar violations suffered by hundreds of other North Carolina Medicaid recipients served by PBH. PBH, as Defendant Cansler’s agent, has engaged in a uniform policy and practice of reducing these Medicaid developmental disability services in violation of due process. 2. Plaintiffs and all proposed class members have been receiving developmental disability services in the community through the North Carolina “Innovations Waiver,” which covers home and community based services for developmentally disabled individuals such as the Plaintiffs and class members and is operated by Defendant Cansler’s contractor and agent, Defendant PBH, under the direction of its Area Director and CEO, Defendant Shipman. 3. Prior to July 1, 2011, the Defendants had found the Plaintiffs’ services to be medically necessary and were providing coverage for these services through the Medicaid program. Plaintiffs are representative of a class of more than 600 developmentally disabled North Carolina residents who have received services under the PBH Innovations Waiver, but whose coverage was recently reduced, terminated or eliminated by PBH employees. The PBH employees used a tool called the Supports Intensities Scale (hereinafter, “SIS”) to assign a score to each Plaintiff based on an assessment of an individual’s medical and behavioral support needs and “life activities” in comparison to others with developmental disabilities. Based on the score obtained from the SIS, Plaintiffs and other proposed class members were assigned by PBH into a category under PBH’s new Supports Needs Matrix system. That assignment in turn resulted in a reduction of each class member’s services effective July 1, 2011. This reduction in services occurred without adequate written notice of PBH’s decisions, without the opportunity for a fair hearing to contest the SIS score’s accuracy or to appeal their assignment to a particular category, and without the opportunity to continue receiving services at the prior authorized level pending the outcome of such a fair hearing, all in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Medicaid Act and under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 4. PBH’s illegal policies and practices will cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class, all of whom are receiving Medicaid-funded services due to their disabling and chronic conditions. Terminating or reducing developmental disability services that have previously been found to be necessary by Plaintiffs’ treating providers and by PBH will place the health and safety of Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class at risk, threatening them with imminent irreparable harm. By depriving them of coverage of essential health services to which they are entitled without due process or statutory authority, Defendants leave many of the most vulnerable disabled children and adults in North Carolina without adequate health care services, even though such services are, and have previously been found by Defendants to be, critical to their health, safety, and development. Some Plaintiffs and class members also will be threatened with placement in institutional settings far from their communities if the services which they need to remain at home are not reinstated. Plaintiffs and class members thus have no adequate remedy at law and are entitled to a declaratory judgment and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to reinstate and continue their","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Piedmont Behavioral Health Care Area Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Authority (PBH) filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) on behalf of Medicaid recipients with developmental disabilities.

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER This is a complex case involving mentally disabled people who receive financial support from Nebraska. Among other things, the plaintiffs allege that the funding (services) they receive from Nebraska is insufficient and thus ""discriminatory."" It is ""discriminatory"" because the lack of funds has caused or threatens to cause their institutionalization. See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) (""discrimination"" under the ADA results from ""undue"" institutionalization and may result from a lack of funding). The plaintiffs seek only injunctive and declaratory relief. The defendants have moved to dismiss this case asserting, among other things, Eleventh Amendment immunity.

The case was dismissed on March 11, 2008, because named Plaintiff's claims were moot.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK WILLIAM G., AND WALTER W., et aI., Plaintiffs, v. GEORGE PATAK!, in his official capacity as Governor ofthe State of New York; SHARON CARPINELLO, in her official capacity as Acting Commissioner of the New York State Office ofMental Health; WILLIAM GORMAN, in his official capacity as Commissioner of the New York State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services; and BRION TRAVIS, in his official capacity as Chainnan and Chief Executive Officer, New York State Division of Parole, COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs, by their attorneys, as and for their complaint, allege on knowledge as to their own acts, and on infonnation and belief as to all other matters, as follows: 1. Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent (collectively, ""Plaintiffs"") are needlessly incarcerated in New York City's jails, awaiting an opening in a treatment program for their serious and persistent mental illness and chemical addiction. Their incarceration is harmful, costly, and discriminates against Plaintiffs by virtue of their disabilities, or the severity of their disabilities, in violation of both Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""), 42 u.S.C. <unk>12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (""Rehabilitation Act""), 29 u.S.C. <unk>794. 2. Plaintiffs have been charged with violating conditions of their parole or postrelease supervision, for which they are confined by the State of New York in a New York City jail, usually on Rikers Island, pending dispositionoftheir parole violation charges. (Such individuals are sometimes referred to as ""parole detainees""). Typically, they have been charged with technical or minor violations. Parole hearing officers appointed by defendant Brion Travis pursuant to NY Executive Law <unk>259-d (McKinney 200 I), with the agreement of parole specialists (who represent the Division of Parole in parole proceedings) and other professionals, have concluded that Plaintiffs should be placed in a residential treatment program rather than imprisoned for their violations. However, because of Defendants' failure to provide an adequate number oftreatment programs, the programs that do exist have virtually no openings. As a result, Plaintiffs have spent many months-sometimes longer-needlessly languishing in jail awaiting a community placement. When programs are unavailable to Plaintiffs for extended periods, Plaintiffs are transferred to State-run facilities to serve additional prison time, or they are released without getting the treatment that State officials have determined is appropriate. Without treatment, Plaintiffs are at greater risk ofre-incarceration. 3. The lengthy waits experienced by Plaintiffs are in sharp contrast to similarly situated parole detainees with histories of alcohol or substance abuse (hereinafter ""substance abuse"" or ""chemical addiction"") but no, or minor, mental illnesses, who are offered a treatment disposition in lieu of incarceration. Such individuals remain in jail for only days, or at most weeks, after parole hearing officers conclude that they should be released to treatment programs for their substance abuse. This is because State officials have ensured a sufficient supply of treatment programs for parole detainees who need substance abuse treatment but who have less severe or no mental illnesses. BACKGROUND 4. Plaintiffs have serious mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder or major depression. They also have a history of substance abuse. New York has a network of treatment programs for individuals with mental illness and histories of substance abuse, often referred to as MICA programs, i.e., programs that serve and treat individuals suffering from mental illness and chemical addiction and offer supervised housing programs. Such programs are supervised and funded by the New York State Office of Mental Health, Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services, and Division of Parole. These agencies also supervise and fund similar programs for individuals with a history of substance abuse but who have not been diagnosed with a serious mental illness. 5. In many cases, the conduct which leads to charges of a parole violation is a direct result of an individual's substance abuse history or mental illness. In certain instances, State officials will determine that a parole violator should be placed in treatment in lieu of serving a jail sentence, and there are systems in place for making such treatment dispositions. 6. Although State officials have determined that participation in a treatment program is preferable to ajail sentence, Plaintiffs must often remain injail indefinitely awaiting an opening, because too few programs exist to meet their needs. Moreover, many ofthe programs that the State has created or funded umeasonably refuse to serve or accommodate individuals whose mental illness, like Plaintiffs, is severe and persistent. 7. Instead of funding the community placements that Plaintiffs need, and that the parole hearing officers have found appropriate, New York uses its funds to ""lease"" beds for Plaintiffs at New York City jails. The State pays the City $34 per day for each parole detainee housed in a City jail, including Plaintiffs, and incurs significant other costs in connection with the incarceration of Plaintiffs. These funds, combined with other cost",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] New York City | New York State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services | U.S. District Court | Southern District of New York ||| June 2013 ||| July 2014 ||| August 2015 ||| September 2016 ||| December 2018 ||| January 2019 ||| February 2019 | ||| March 2019 |</s>

LANCE HIMES, in his official capacity as Director of the Ohio Department of Health, KAREN SORRELL, in her official capacity as Chief of the Office of Vital Statistics, and JUDITH NAGY, in her official capacity as State Registrar of the Office of Vital Statistics, Defendants. Civil Action No.: COMPLAINT NATURE OF ACTION 1. This action is brought by transgender people who wish to correct their Ohio birth certificates to accurately reflect their gender identity. They wish to have access to a birth certificate they can use without being exposed to discrimination and other harm, including a high risk of violence. Although Stacie Ray, Jane Doe, and Ashley Breda are all women, the Ohio Department of Health and Office of Vital Statistics incorrectly identifies them as male on their birth certificates. Although Basil Argento is a man, the Ohio Department of Health and Office of Vital Statistics incorrectly identifies him as female on his birth certificate. 2. Accurate identity documents are essential to every person’s ability to navigate through life. Access to employment, education, housing, health care, banking, travel, and government services often depend on having documentation that accurately reflects a person’s identity. A birth certificate is a basic identity document routinely relied upon for many purposes, including as a prerequisite to obtain other essential identity documents. 3. While the state provides most people born in Ohio with accurate birth certificates—matching their gender identity—the state bars transgender people alone from obtaining accurate birth certificates matching their gender identity. In practical terms, this policy denies transgender people access to birth certificates they can use. Ohio’s refusal to issue such birth certificates erects a barrier to the full recognition, participation, and inclusion of transgender people in society and subjects them to discrimination, privacy invasions, harassment, humiliation, stigma, harm to their health, and even violence. 4. The State of Ohio refuses to correct the gender markers on transgender people’s birth certificates regardless of what steps a person may have taken in order to obtain recognition of their gender identity. 5. Ohio’s categorical bar stands in sharp contrast to the approach of nearly all other states and the District of Columbia, which have established processes by which transgender people can correct the gender marker on their birth certificate. Indeed, this total bar is also inconsistent with Ohio’s own practice of permitting transgender people to correct the gender marker on their driver’s license or state identification card to match their gender identity. 6. Ohio’s practice, which each Defendant enforces, violates federal constitutional guarantees, including the rights to equal protection, due process, and freedom from compelled speech. As confirmed by the practices adopted by other states, as well as Ohio’s own practice in changing the gender marker on state-issued driver’s licenses and state identification cards, there is no government justification to support Ohio’s refusal to provide transgender people with accurate birth certificates matching their gender identity. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. Subject matter jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343 because this action seeks to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights secured by the United States Constitution through 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983. 8.

(Doc. 1). With their Verified Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction. (Doc. 2). During the informal conference held on May 20, 2019 pursuant to S.D. Ohio Civ. R. 65.1, Plaintiffs advised the Court of their preference for a ruling only on their Motion for Preliminary Injunction (and not their Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order) in light of the July 11, 2019 effective date of the statute. Plaintiffs and the Ohio Attorney General agreed that there was no need for discovery or an evidentiary hearing. They established a briefing schedule, and asked that the Court render its decision by July 5, 2019 based on the memoranda alone. This Order follows. I. BACKGROUND A. Statutory Framework Giving Rise to Plaintiffs’ Complaint The Ohio General Assembly passed Senate Bill 23 (“S.B. 23” or the “Act”), also known as the “Heartbeat Protection Act,” on April 10, 2019. Governor Mike DeWine signed the bill into law the next day, April 11, 2019. It is set to go into effect on July 11, 2019. Ohio law already requires an abortion provider to first determine whether there is detectable cardiac activity.1 Once in effect, the Act will make it a crime to “caus[e] or abet[] the termination of” the pregnancy. S.B. 23 <unk>1, amending Ohio Rev. Code <unk>2919.195(A). The Act has two exceptions. S.B. 23 allows abortion care after cardiac activity is detected only if the abortion is necessary to prevent the patient’s death or “a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” S.B. 23, <unk>1, amending Ohio Rev. Code <unk>2919.195(B). “‘Serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function’ means any medically diagnosed condition that so complicates the pregnancy of the woman as to directly or indirectly cause the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,” which “includes preeclampsia, inevitable abortion, and premature rupture of the membranes[ and] may include, but is not limited to, diabetes and multiple sclerosis[ but] does not include a condition related to the woman’s mental health.” Ohio Revised Code <unk>2919.16(K). 1 As currently written, the statute provides: “The person who determines the presence or absence of a fetal heartbeat shall record in the pregnant woman’s medical record the estimated gestational age of the unborn human individual, the method used to test for a fetal heartbeat, the date and time of the test, and the results of the test.” Ohio Rev. Code <unk>2919.191(A). In addition, “The person who performs the examination for the presence of a fetal heartbeat shall give the pregnant woman the option to view or hear the fetal heartbeat.” Id. <unk>2919.191(C). A violation of the Act is a fifth-degree felony, punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of $2,500. S.B. 23 <unk>1, amending Ohio Rev Cod. <unk>2919.195(A); Ohio Rev. Code <unk>2929.14(A)(5), 2929.18(A)(3)(e). The state medical board may assess a forfeiture of up to $20,000 for each violation of the Act, S.B. 23 <unk>1, amending Ohio Rev. Code <unk>2919.1912(A), and limit, revoke, or suspend a physician’s medical license based on a violation of the Act, see Ohio Rev. Code <unk>4371.22(B)(10). A patient also may bring a civil action against a provider who violates the Act and recover damages in the amount of $10,000 or more. S.B. 23 <unk>1, amending Ohio Rev. Code <unk>2919.199 (B)(1). B. Plaintiffs’ Verified Complaint In a nutshell, S.B. 23 bans abortion care at and after approximately six weeks in pregnancy. And, in so doing, according to Plaintiffs—a collection of reproductive health care clinics and physicians providing abortion care—violates a woman’s right to privacy as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In a normally developing embryo, cells that form the basis for development of the heart later in gestation produce activity that can be detected with ultrasound.

This is an action brought by seniors and adults with disabilities, all residents of the State of Oklahoma, who are current recipients of the Medicaid ADvantage Waiver or the Medicaid In-Home Supports Waiver for Adults, who have received notice from Defendant Lake’s agency, the Department of Human Services (DHS), that their waiver services will be terminated effective December 1, 2017, and who are at serious risk of institutionalization as a result of the arbitrary decision to terminate waiver services solely for economic reasons.1 2. Defendant Lake’s arbitrary termination of waiver services without assessing for and providing alternative services places Plaintiffs at serious risk of institutionalization. 3. Plaintiffs who receive the ADvantage waiver are either “frail elderly persons” or are adults over the age of 21 who have a physical disability.

Plaintiffs who receive the In-Home Supports waiver for adults are individuals over age 18 who have developmental disabilities and receive waiver services, such as nutrition services, nursing care, therapeutic services, and physical home modifications (such as a ramp or roll-in shower) in order to remain in a community-based living setting, either in their own home, or the home of a family member, instead of in an institution.4 5. As a result of Defendant Lake’s actions, Plaintiffs and thousands of putative class members are at serious risk for institutionalization.5 DHS itself has estimated that at least 10,000 individuals who will lose waiver services could be forced to live in institutions, including nursing homes.6 2 http://www.okhca.org/individuals.aspx?id=8143 3 http://www.okhca.org/individuals.aspx?id=8143 4 http://www.okhca.org/individuals.aspx?id=8149 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 1- COMPLAINT LEGAL28727382.6 I. INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs Paul Rummell and Benjamin West, and Lisa Chickadonz and Christine Tanner are two loving, committed same-sex couples. Plaintiff Basic Rights Education Fund is a not-for-profit organization that works to advance the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Oregonians through education and advocacy. Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for the violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution caused by the exclusion of same-sex couples from the freedom to marry under the laws of the state of Oregon. 2. Marriage plays a unique role in society as the universally recognized and celebrated hallmark of a couple’s commitment to build family life together. It confers upon couples a dignity and status of immense import. Plaintiffs have formed committed, enduring bonds equally worthy of the respect afforded by the state of Oregon to different-sex couples through marriage. Since 2008, Oregon has allowed same-sex couples to enter into domestic partnerships, which offer only some of the legal protections of marriage, and provide none of the dignity of that status. Yet, Plaintiffs and other committed same-sex couples in Oregon are barred from marrying as a result of existing Oregon statutes and because the Oregon Constitution was amended in 2004 to single out lesbian and gay Oregonians by excluding them from the freedom to marry, based solely on their sexual orientation and their sex. 3. On October 16, 2013, the Deputy Attorney General for the state of Oregon issued a legal opinion that the State could begin to respect the marriages of same-sex couples who married in other states, because refusing to do so would likely be unconstitutional after the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v Windsor. The next day, the Chief Operating Officer for the Oregon Department of Administrative Services, Michael Jordan, directed all state agencies immediately to recognize all marriages performed outside of Oregon, including marriages of same-sex couples. Nevertheless, the State continues to refuse to allow same-sex 2- COMPLAINT LEGAL28727382.6 couples to marry in Oregon. Further, Mr. Jordan’s directive binds only state agencies, not other entities like courts and local governments. 4. The exclusion from marriage inflicts serious and irreparable harms upon same-sex couples and their children. For example, Plaintiffs Paul and Ben are unmarried, and wish to marry for the same reasons as different-sex couples — to publicly declare their love and commitment before their family, friends, and community, and to give one another and their child L.B. the security and protections that only marriage provides. 5. Plaintiff Basic Rights Education Fund (“Basic Rights”) is a statewide civil rights organization that has a long history of public education and advocacy for the rights of lesbian,","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2015 | Oregon | Plaintiffs | ACLU | United States District Court | Portland | U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon ||| June 2016 | ||| July 2016 ||| August 2017 ||| November 2018 ||| January 2019 ||| March 2019 | | June 2019 | May 2019 | July 2019 | August 2019 | June 2020 | July 2020 | May 2020 | June 2021 | July 2021 | August 2020 | March 2021 | May 2021 | June 2022 | May 2022 | July 2022 | August 2022 | March 2020 | August 2021 | March 2022 | September 2020 | January 2020 | February 2019 | February 2020 | April 2020 | November 2020 | December 2020 | October 2020 | September 2019 | January 2021 | February 2021 | April 2021 | December 2019 | March 2020, April 2020</s>"

Magill, in his official capacity as the Director of the South Carolina Department of Mental Health; the South Carolina Department of Mental Health; and the South Carolina Mental Health Commission; Defendants. CIVIL CASE NO: 2:17-cv-1346-PPRMMMDDG CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF Plaintiffs file this class action to enforce the rights of people with mental disabilities to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. In support of their prayer for relief, Plaintiffs allege the following: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Every day, adults with mental disabilities are unnecessarily and illegally segregated in South Carolina’s G. Werber Bryan Psychiatric Hospital (“Bryan” or “Bryan Hospital”). These adults remain in this isolating institution because Defendants have failed to develop sufficient community-based mental health services. 2. These residents of Bryan Hospital experience the type of “[u]njustified isolation” that the Supreme Court calls “discrimination based on disability.” Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999). 3. Contrary to modern and generally accepted methods of providing mental health care, this isolation at Bryan may last for years, possibly decades. All too often, this isolation happens not because it is necessary to facilitate care, but rather because Defendants have not provided the services, programs, and activities to support these individuals in the community where Plaintiffs can live healthy, productive lives. 4. Individual Plaintiffs bring this action on their behalf and on the behalf of others similarly situated under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”) to require the Defendants to administer “services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. <unk>35.130 (d); 28 C.F.R. <unk>41.51 (d). Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities, Inc. (“P&A”) brings this action on behalf of its constituents. 5. Defendants violate their obligation to comply with the ADA and Section 504 by: a. unjustifiably isolating and segregating individuals at Bryan Hospital; b. failing to consistently provide adequate integrated services in the community; c. overly and inappropriately relying upon segregated residential facilities for outpatient treatment; d. failing to develop and maintain a working plan for implementing the ADA’s integration mandate; e. employing policies and practices that create arbitrary barriers to discharge and access to community mental health services, programs, and activities; and f. charging the Plaintiffs fees of $503 per day for unnecessary and unjustified hospitalization, creating a perpetual burden of debt that will follow them to their death, making any attempt at accumulating wealth and planning for inheritance potentially meaningless. The Defendants’ policies and practices, their failure to remove discriminatory barriers, and their failure to reasonably modify their programs and services to make integrated community mental health services available, have consigned individuals at Bryan to prolonged and unnecessary institutionalization. 6. Individual Plaintiffs, Plaintiff class, and P&A constituents1 are harmed by the isolation and segregation caused by the Defendants. This isolation “perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life” and “severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 600.

INTRODUCTORY FACTS 1. During the infancy of the United States, John Adams, James Madison, Alexis de Tocqueville, and others, wamed of ""tyranny of the majority."" Concerned that a direct democracy would allow a simple majority to stampede the rights and dignity of minorities, our nation's founders created a constitutional representative democracy, establishing a system of government with several super-majoritarian checks on simple majorities and myriad institutional checks and balances pursuant and subordinate to the Constitution. 2. In 1898, South Dakota became the first State in the nation to allow a simple majority of its voting-eligible citizenst to initiate and enact constitutional amendments. Since that time, and particularly in the last half century, our country has seen an explosion in the use of such statewide popular votes to circumvent the traditional legislative process and to override the judiciary often in a manner that tramples on the dignity and cquality of minorities. 3. In 1992, a 53Yo majority of Colorado voters approved a ballot measure that added Amendment 2 to the Colorado Constitution. The amendment prohibited every county, city, and town within Colorado from protecting gay and lesbian individuals from discrimination. In 1996, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the amendment in Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996). In the Court's opinion, Justice Kennedy wrote, ""laws of the kind... raise the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity toward the class of persons affected,"" and concluded that the ballot measure I South Dakota did not allow women to vote until 1918. 2 The Proposal, YouTube (May 21, 2014),http :/<unk>outu.belTKkSMnlxWnU was born of a ""bare... desire to harm a politically unpopular group."" Id. at 634. The Court added, ""[i]f the constitutional conception of equal protection of the laws means anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare... desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest."" Id. (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted). 4. With the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, our Constitution provided not only a more expansive definition of citizenship, but also the framework for assuring our Founders' ""self-evident"" truth of liberfy and equality: ""No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" Guided by this framework, the United States Supreme Court has declared the right to marryr as ""fundamemtal"" and one of the ""basic civil rights of ntan."" Loving v Virginia. 388 U.S. I, 12 (1967). Its decisions have made clear that ""the freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties"" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Zablocki v Redhail. 434 U.S. 374,393 (1978). 6.

Case No. 5:10-cv-1025 I. INTRODUCTION COMPLAINT 1. Eric Steward, Linda Arizpe, Andrea Padron, Patricia Ferrer, Benny Holmes, and Zackowitz Morgan, (hereafter the “Individual Plaintiffs”) are adult persons with mental retardation or other related conditions (hereafter referred to as “developmental disabilities”). Each of these individuals is qualified for the Defendants’ system of community-based services and supports for individuals with developmental disabilities. Each is able and would prefer to reside in a more integrated, community-based placement. Nevertheless, the Individual Plaintiffs and thousands of similarly situated individuals in Texas are unnecessarily institutionalized and segregated in nursing facilities because of the Defendants’ decision to exclude them from any meaningful access to Texas’s system of community-based services and supports which they need to be able to reside in the community. 2. The Defendants, by their actions and inactions in violation of federal law, have caused the Individual Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent to live in institutional nursing facilities isolated from their family and friends. The Individual Plaintiffs and the class are not able to leave the nursing facility to work, attend day habilitation programs or prevocational activities, and are deprived of the right to attend social, recreational or religious activities outside of the nursing home. Instead, they have no option but to remain in nursing facilities in order to receive Medicaid-funded services. 3. Despite their ability to benefit from Texas’s system of community-based supports that are available to other individuals with disabilities, all of the Individual Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent are experiencing or will experience unnecessary and prolonged institutionalization in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12132 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), 29 U.S.C. <unk>794 et seq. 4. To avoid the inappropriate institutionalization of individuals with developmental disabilities in nursing facilities, Congress enacted the Nursing Home Reform Amendments (NHRA) to the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396r(e). These Amendments require that before admission to a nursing facility, an individual with developmental disabilities must be screened by a mental retardation professional to determine whether their needs could be met in the community or other less restrictive placement. These Amendments also require that the Defendants provide individuals with developmental disabilities who are placed in nursing facilities with specialized services and active treatment, designed to enable the individual to function as independently and with as much self determination as possible, and to prevent regression and loss of abilities. 5. Despite the requirements of the NHRA, the Defendants have failed to conduct pre-admission screening and assessments that comply with the requirements of the NHRA and have failed to provide all needed specialized services to the Individual Plaintiffs and the class. As a result, the Individual Plaintiffs and class members have been inappropriately placed in nursing facilities and, while there, have frequently suffered significant regression or stagnation that could have been avoided through the provision of specialized services, required by federal law. 6. Plaintiffs and the class seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the Defendants to require the provision of adequate community-based services and supports to enable them to transition from their current nursing facility placements to more integrated community placements as required by the ADA, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12101 et seq.; the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. <unk>794; the NHRA, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396r(e); the federal Medicaid Act and the regulations implementing these statutes.

The plaintiffs alleged that the Affordable Care Act's regulation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex (which included gender identity and termination of pregnancy) violated the Administrative Procedure Act, Religious Freedom Restoration Act and constitutional rights. In October 2016, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of this regulation, which was granted on December 31, 2016. Defendants' motion to stay the preliminary injunction was denied in January 2017. In May 2017, the defendants filed a motion for voluntary remand and stay, arguing that HHS should be given the opportunity to reconsider the regulation at issue in this case, which would conserve the resources of both parties and the court. In July 2017, Judge O’Connor declined to remand the case, but imposed a stay of all proceedings while HHS reconsidered the regulation. He clarified that the December 31, 2016 preliminary injunction order would be unaffected by the stay and would remain in full force and effect throughout the stay. In December 2018, the stay was lifted, and the parties resumed litigating the case. In September 2019, Judge O'Connor vacated the rule's challenged provisions.

","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS WICHITA FALLS DIVISION FRANCISCAN ALLIANCE, INC.; SPECIALTY PHYSICIANS OF ILLINOIS, LLC,; CHRISTIAN MEDICAL DENTAL ASSOCIATIONS; Civ. Action No. COMPLAINT STATE OF TEXAS; STATE OF WISCONSIN; STATE OF NEBRASKA; COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY, by and through Governor Matthew G. Bevin; and STATE OF KANSAS, Plaintiffs, v. SYLVIA BURWELL, Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services; and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, Defendants. INTRODUCTION AND NATURE OF THE ACTION This lawsuit challenges a new Regulation (“Regulation” or “Rule”) issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that seeks to override the medical judgment of healthcare professionals across the country. On pain of significant financial liability, the Regulation forces doctors to perform controversial and sometimes harmful medical procedures ostensibly designed to permanently change an individual’s sex—including the sex of children. Under the new Regulation, a doctor must perform these procedures even when they are contrary to the doctor’s medical judgment and could result in significant, long-term medical harm. Thus, the Regulation represents a radical invasion of the federal bureaucracy into a doctor’s medical judgment. HHS attempts to impose these dramatic new requirements by redefining a single word used in the Affordable Care Act: “sex.” For decades, across multiple federal statutes, Congress has consistently used the term “sex” to refer to an individual’s status as male or female, as determined by a person’s biological sex at birth. But in the Regulation, HHS redefines “sex” to include “an individual’s internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female, and which may be different from an individual’s sex assigned at birth.” 45 C.F.R. <unk>92.4. Thus, with a single stroke of the pen, HHS has created a massive new liability for thousands of healthcare professionals unless they cast aside their medical judgment and perform controversial and even harmful medical transition procedures. And HHS has done this despite the fact that Congress has repeatedly rejected similar attempts to redefine “sex” through legislation, and federal courts have repeatedly rejected attempts to accomplish the same goal through litigation. The Regulation not only forces healthcare professionals to violate their medical judgment, it also forces them to violate their deeply held religious beliefs. Plaintiffs include the Christian Medical Dental Associations, which include over 17,000 healthcare professionals, and Franciscan Alliance, a network of religious hospitals founded by the Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration. These religious organizations are deeply committed to the dignity of every human person, and their doctors care for everyone with joy and compassion. They eagerly provide comprehensive care to society’s most vulnerable populations, but their religious beliefs will not allow them to perform medical transition procedures that can be deeply harmful to their patients. Tragically, the Regulation would force them to violate those religious beliefs and perform harmful medical transition procedures or else suffer massive financial liability. The Regulation also undermines the longstanding sovereign power of the States to regulate healthcare, ensure appropriate standards of medical judgment, and protect its citizens’ constitutional and civil rights. Under this Rule, States are now required to force all healthcare professionals at state-run facilities to participate in medical transition procedures (including hormone therapy, plastic surgery, hysterectomies, and gender reassignment surgery), and to cover those procedures in the States’ health insurance plans, even if a doctor believes such procedures are harmful to the patient. The Rule exposes the States to litigation by its employees and patients, despite the fact that neither Congress nor the States expressed any intent to waive the States’ sovereign immunity in this area. And the Rule threatens to strip the States of billions of dollars in federal healthcare funding—over $42.4 billion a year for Texas alone—jeopardizing the availability of healthcare for the nation’s most vulnerable citizens. Ultimately, this case boils down to a very simple question of statutory interpretation: Can HHS redefine the term “sex” to thwart decades of settled precedent and impose massive new obligations on healthcare professionals and sovereign States? The answer is “no,” and the new Regulation must be set aside as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and multiple other federal laws and constitutional provisions. I. PARTIES 1. Texas has a significant role to play in regulating and protecting the integrity of the medical profession within its borders. Moreover, Texas zealously protects the physician-patient relationship through numerous laws and regulations ensure that physicians honor their duties to their patients and exercise appropriate medical judgment when treating patients under their care. Texas also employs thousands of healthcare employees through its constituent agencies. As an employer, generally, Texas provides health benefits to hundreds of thousands of its employees and their families through its constituent agencies. Moreover, Texas oversees and controls several agencies and healthcare facilities that receive federal funding subject to Title IX and the new Rule.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CLASS ACTION CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF I. INTRODUCTION 1. Named Plaintiffs Joanne Harris and Jessica Duff, and Christy Berghoff and Victoria Kidd (collectively, “Named Plaintiffs”), and the members of the Plaintiff Class1 (collectively, with the Named Plaintiffs, “Plaintiffs”) are loving, committed same-sex couples. The Named Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 on behalf of themselves and the Plaintiff Class, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for the violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution caused by the exclusion of same-sex couples from the freedom to marry and from recognition of the marriages some 1 The Plaintiff Class is defined in Section V of this Complaint, below. 1 Plaintiffs have entered into in other jurisdictions under the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth” or “Virginia”). 2. Marriage plays a unique role in society as the universally recognized and celebrated hallmark of a couple’s commitment to build family life together. It confers upon couples a dignity and status of immense import. Plaintiffs have formed committed, enduring bonds equally worthy of the respect afforded by the Commonwealth to different-sex couples through marriage. Yet, the Commonwealth, without any adequate justification, has enacted an unprecedented series of statutory and constitutional amendments to single out lesbian and gay Virginians by excluding them from the freedom to marry, or by refusing to recognize their existing marriages from other jurisdictions, based solely on their sexual orientation and their sex. 3. Through the Commonwealth’s constitutional and statutory marriage bans and through Defendants’ enforcement of them, the Commonwealth and Defendants send a purposeful message that they view lesbians, gay men, and their children as second-class citizens who are undeserving of the legal sanction, respect, protections, and support that heterosexuals and their families are able to enjoy through marriage. This discrimination (referred to herein as the Commonwealth’s “marriage ban”) is enshrined both in the Commonwealth’s statutes and in article 1, section 15-A of the Commonwealth’s Constitution, which limits marriage to couples composed of “one man and one woman.” 4. The marriage ban inflicts serious and irreparable harms upon same-sex couples and their children. Joanne Harris and Jessica Duff are unmarried, and wish to marry for the same reasons as different-sex couples – to publicly declare their love and commitment before their family, friends, and community, and to give one another and their son J. H.-D. the security and protections that only marriage provides. Christy Berghoff and Victoria Kidd have married in another jurisdiction, but are treated as legal strangers in the state they call home – a painful invalidation of their relationship that also deprives them and their daughter L. B.-K. of the protections that a legally recognized marriage most securely provides. 5. Our courts and our society have discarded, one by one, marriage laws that violated the Constitution’s mandate of equality, such as anti-miscegenation laws and laws that denied married women legal independence and the right to make decisions for themselves. History has taught us that the vitality of marriage does not depend on maintaining such discriminatory laws. To the contrary, eliminating these unconstitutional aspects of marriage has enhanced the institution. Ending the exclusion of lesbian and gay couples from marriage is no different. Indeed, in 13 states and the District of Columbia, same-sex couples are marrying and the institution of marriage continues to thrive. 6. Plaintiffs seek equal access to marriage as the only means to secure their rights to due process and equal protection of the law, and to eliminate the myriad serious harms inflicted on them by the marriage ban and Defendants’ enforcement of it. Accordingly, Named Plaintiffs bring this suit on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the Commonwealth’s exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage and refusal to recognize their valid marriages from other jurisdictions and Defendants’ enforcement of the marriage ban violate the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The purpose of this letter is to advise you of our findings, supporting facts, and recommended remedial measures, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997b(a)(1). As a result of our investigation, we have concluded that there exists at ADOC women's facilities an unconstitutional pattern or practice of sexual misconduct and constitutionally unacceptable invasions of privacy rights, and that ADOC officials have not addressed these problems adequately. These conclusions, and the more specific findings and recommendations set out below, must be read in the context of ADOC's refusal to cooperate with our investigation. Although ADOC has provided some relevant data, our requests for other information have been denied or gone unanswered. Most importantly, ADOC officials have refused to grant us access to female inmates, correctional staff, or ADOC women's facilities. Both the legislative history of CRIPA and federal case law make it clear that the Attorney General may consider state officials' failure to cooperate with an investigation in her decision to bring suit under the Act. United States v. Michigan, 868 F Supp. 890, 896 (W.D Mich. 1994). Nevertheless, we offer our findings and recommendations in a cooperative spirit. We hope that ADOC will be willing to discuss these matters with us promptly and in appropriate detail, rather than continuing its adversarial posture. Our findings and recommended remedial measures are offered in the context of the current state of the law regarding the unconstitutionality of sexual misconduct against female inmates and the analytical framework for assessing the constitutionality of invasions of privacy rights of female inmates. I. FINDINGS AND SUPPORTING FACTS A. Physical Sexual Misconduct. We have received significant evidence, some of it confirmed by ADOC records, that during the past few years at least 14 female inmates have been subjected to sexual assaults and other non-consensual sexual behavior by guards, including rape, sodomy, touching and fondling, masturbation, urination, removal of clothing, nude dancing, indecent exposure, and offensive sexual comments. We also have received significant evidence, some of it confirmed by ADOC records, that during the past few years a number of female inmates have engaged in supposedly ""consensual"" sexual behavior with ADOC staff, sometimes in return for special privileges not available to other inmates. In the context of a prison environment, in which inmates necessarily surrender virtually all self-control over every aspect of their lives and are at the mercy of staff for their basic needs, there cannot be any ""consensual"" sexual behavior between staff and inmates. Moreover, a prison environment which fosters or tolerates ""consensual"" sexual behavior between staff and inmates significantly increases the probability of nonconsensual sexual misconduct by staff. In two letters dated September 22, 1995, and December 6, 1995, copies of which are attached, we provided Arizona state officials with detailed information on sexual misconduct in ADOC women's facilities. We received some of this information in the form of 13 sworn ""Jane Doe"" affidavits of inmates whose identities were confidential. In addition, detailed information on some of the sexual misconduct summarized above is contained in a document provided to us by ADOC (referred to by ADOC as the ""Matrix""), a copy of which is also attached.1/ ADOC officials have conceded that ADOC settled one case in which a CSO was accused of raping a female inmate; and we have received information that contract employees have requested sexual favors from female inmates in exchange for better job assignments. 1/ ADOC has provided us with self-selected documents relating to the incidents covered by the Matrix. The evidence outlined above, considered in light of the fact that ADOC officials have refused to permit us to interview female inmates, indicates that sexual misconduct is occurring in ADOC women's facilities with constitutionally unacceptable frequency. The sexual misconduct cases included in A D O C s own Matrix reflect only those incidents that ADOC chose to investigate through its Inspections and Investigations (""I I"") unit after the incidents happened to come to ADOC's attention. ADOC has raised the possibility that other complaints regarding sexual misconduct were not investigated by I I, but to date ADOC has not responded to our request for information concerning that possibility.

The case survived the defendants' motion to dismiss and class certification was granted. 

In October 2014, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the CDCR agreed to a number of terms, including to cease implementation of race-based modified programs or lockdowns; to provide outdoor activity to prisoners in a modified program or lockdown for longer than fourteen days; to revise its policies concerning modified programs and lockdowns, and to train its staff on modified programs and lockdowns. The defendants also agreed to pay attorneys fees and costs. The court retained jurisdiction for 18 months to enforce compliance with the agreement, and on December 20, 2016, the parties filed notice that the court’s jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement had terminated and that the case was dismissed with prejudice in its entirety.

COMPLAINT—CLASS ACTION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS I. INTRODUCTION 1. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) is mismanaging one of the 4 worst public health catastrophes related to COVID-19 anywhere in the country— 5 and at the epicenter of the outbreak are FCI Lompoc and USP Lompoc (collectively 6 “Lompoc”), where more than 1,000 incarcerated persons have tested positive for 7 COVID. 2. FCI Lompoc is a low security prison located in Santa Barbara County, 9 California. Just down the road is its sister facility USP Lompoc, which houses 10 medium security individuals and is adjacent to a low security satellite camp. 11 Prisoners are often transferred among these facilities. Lompoc is the site of by far 12 the largest COVID-19 outbreak at a BOP facility. As of the morning of May 15, 13 2020, BOP reports that 1,023 of the 2,680 individuals collectively incarcerated at 14 Lompoc have tested positive for COVID-19.1 3. The cases at Lompoc account for more than 65 percent of cases in 16 Santa Barbara County and are so staggering that local officials are asking the State 17 of California to allow them to exclude the numbers from Lompoc in their reopening 18 criteria.2 Shockingly, these numbers, high as they seem, are still underreported. 19 Only the 963 prisoners at FCI Lompoc have undergone a round of mass testing 20 (which was completed weeks past the point where testing could have helped actually 21 prevent the virus from spreading), with 882 reporting positive—meaning that nearly 24 1 Bureau of Prisons, COVID-19 Update, https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/ (last visited May 15, 2020). 25 2 Delaney Smith, Santa Barbara County Urges State to Exclude Lompoc Prison 26 Cases from Reopening Criteria, SANTA BARBARA INDEPENDENT, May 11, 2020, 27 https://www.independent.com/2020/05/11/santa-barbara-county-urges-state-toexclude-lompoc-prison-cases-from-reopening-criteria/.

INTRODUCTION Plaintiff, Prison Legal NewS (PLN), respectfully submits this Complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief ordering the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to turn over any and all material that PLN requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 (2005). In an August 6, 2003, letter PLN requested a copy of all documents concerning the monetary amounts the BOP paid for lawsuits and claims against it between January 1, 1996, through and including July 31, 2003. PLN also asked for a fee waiver for processing this request and providing copies of the relevant documents. In a September 9, 2003, letter, the BOP denied the fee waiver, stating that the request did not meet the threshold for granting the waiver. II JURISDICTION. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 (2005). lie PARTIES. Plaintiff; Prison Legal News, is headquartered in the State of Washington, located at 2400 NW 80<unk>1<unk>Street PMB #148, Seattle, WA 98117. PLN is a <unk>501[c](3) non-profit organization. Defendant, Federal Bureau of Prisons, is an agency of the United States government, located at 320 First Street NW, Washington, DC 20534. IV FACTS. PLN reasserts paragraphs 1 to 3. PLN is a legal journal that reports news and litigation concerning detention facilities. PLN has published monthly since 1990 and has 4,500 subscribers in all 50 states. PLN’s subscribers include lawyers, journalists, judges, courts, public libraries and universities. The estimated actual readership is 36<unk>000. PLN also maintains a website that has received more than 36,000 visitors a month. PLN, a <unk>501 [c](3) non-profit organization, is small and underfunded. On August 6, 2003, PLN requested documents from the BOP pursuant to FOIA, 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 (2005), documenting all money the BOP paid for lawsuits and claims against it between January 1, 1996<unk>up to and including July 31, 2003. PLN requested a copy of the verdict or settlement in each case identifying the dollar amount of damages, the plaintiff’ s or claimant’s identity and the identifying information (i.e., names, docket number, court) for each lawsuit, administrative claim, and/or attorney fee award. PLN also requested a copy of the complaint or other documents describing the facts of the case. PLN requested a fee waiver for processing its request and providing copies of the relevant documents. 10. The BOP is the largest prison system in the country with facilities in almost every state and approximately 200,000 inmates. 11. PLN will contribute to the public interest and understanding of BOP operations and activities by analyzing and publishing the information obtained through this FOIA request in its print journal and on its website. Specifically, PLN will analyze how the BOP spends public tax dollars, will publicize BOP facilities in which litigation has identified problems, and test how well BOP programs address inmate concerns. 12. On September 9, 2003, the BOP denied PLN’s request for a fee waiver, stating that the request did not explain why the information was of interest to the public. 13. On October 20, 2003, PLN appealed the denial of the fee waiver to the United States Department of Justice (DO J). In its appeal PLN explained in detail how the requested information would help the public identify problems in specific BOP facilities and programs, and provided an important overall measure of program efficiency and effectiveness within BOP. 14. On May 23, 2005, the DOJ denied PLN’s appeal. DOJ denied the appeal because PLN had not <unk>demostrated that it has both the intent and the ability to disseminate the requested records to the general public."" 15. 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(A)(iii) grants the right to a fee waiver if it satisfies the following requirement: <unk>’if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester."" 16. PLN satisfies this requirement as it will contribute to the public understanding of BOP operations and activities by analyzing and publishing the information obtained through this FOIA request in its print journal and on its website. This request is not primarily in the cornrnercial interest of PLN as it is a non-profit organization. V.

The plaintiffs claimed that inadequate staff, training, discipline, and hours of operation, along with a host of other policies, caused dysfunction and frequent over-detention. The plaintiffs brought suit individually and as a class on behalf of all those incarcerated in a DDOC facility as of October 1, 2008 or later who were not or will not be released within 12 hours of the expiration of their sentence or the forwarding of a court order for release. In 2015, the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment because the plaintiffs' failed to demonstrate that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the overdetention problem. On appeal, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the defendants. The case is now closed.","United States District Court for the District of Delaware PHILIP A. WHARTON, JOSEPH ROUNDTREE, JAMES MADDOX and LAMAR CORREA Plaintiffs, v. CARL C. DANBERG, CATHY ESCHERICH, and REBECCA MCBRIDE Defendants. JURY TRIAL DEMANDED COMPLAINT CLASS ACTION INTRODUCTION 1. This is an action brought by Philip A. Wharton, Joseph Roundtree, James Maddox and Lamar Correa as plaintiffs on their own behalf and on behalf of the class defined below (injured or presently subject to injury) from the practice of the Delaware Department of Corrections (DDOC) of over-detaining inmates and by the defendants' deliberate indifference to the effect of the DDOC practice of over-detention on the rights of inmates. To over-detain means holding a detainee or prisoner in a DDOC facility more than 12 hours beyond when a Court order releasing the detainee or prisoner has been forwarded to Central Offender Records (COR) or when a detainee or prisoner is held past the day that his or her sentence has ended. 2. Plaintiffs bring this action against the defendants under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.c. <unk>1983 to enforce the Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendments for injuries suffered by them when the defendants caused them to be over-detained and other members of the class. 3. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 23(a) and (b)(2). 4. At all times pertinent Carl C. Danberg was Commissioner of the DDOC, Attorney General of the State of Delaware, or Deputy Principal Assistant to the Commissioner of the Department of Correction. 5. Cathy Escherich was Director of COR during some of the time pertinent to this case. 6. Rebecca McBride was Director of COR during some of the time pertinent to this case. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.c. <unk>1983. This Court also has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>220Iand 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Procedure. 8. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.c. <unk>1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to Plaintiffs claims and those ofproposed class members occurred in this judicial district. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATION 9. The Over-detained Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2) and 23(b)(3), of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalfofa class consisting of: (a) Each person who has been, is, or in the future will be incarcerated in any DDOC facility from October 1, 2008 forward; and (b) who was not released, or, in the future, will not be released within 12 hours of the time that a Court order has been forwarded to COR releasing the person or is not released by midnight of the day his or her sentence has ended. 10. Certification of this class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate, because the defendants have a pattern and practice that has uniformly affected all members of both classes, and injunctive relief against the defendants will benefit each and every plaintiff and class member. These patterns and practices have been known to defendants since at least 2008 and continue unabated, thus it is clear that a court order is necessary to insure the rights of the class members. 11. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as Plaintiff and the Class satisfy the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under FED R. Civ P. 23(a). 12. Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable because of the large number of Class members and the fact that Class members may be dispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of Delaware and the geographic area served by this Judicial District. 13. The classes are entitled to injunctive relief, for example, setting up an independent monitor to supervise DDOC's inmate records management system to ensure that all inmates are timely released after the legal justification for their incarceration has ceased. 14. Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is also appropriate, in that common questions of law and fact predominate over any individual questions, and a class action is superior for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy as detailed below. 15. Among the questions oflaw and fact common to the classes are: a) the maximum length of time a person may","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Delaware Department of Corrections (DDOC) | Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2) | U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware .<n>Plaintiffs brought this action against the defendants under 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 to enforce the Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendments for injuries suffered by them when the defendants caused them to be over-detained and other members of the class.

CIVIL ACTION NO. :1 :02-CV-479-JEC ALAN ADAMS, Acting Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Corrections, and MICHELLE MARTIN, Warden of Phillips State Prison, in their official capacities, Defendants. O RD E R This case is presently before the Court on defendants' Motion to Dismiss [38]. The Court has reviewed the record and the arguments of the parties and, for the reasons set out below, concludes that defendants' Motion to Dismiss should be DENIED. BACKGROUND This case began its life under the style Fluellen v. Wetnerington, No, i :02-CV-479-JEC, and was filed as a purported class action. The would-be class was composed of mentally i11 and/or mentally retarded prisoners at Phillips State Prison. These plaintiffs alleged that they were subiect to physical, mental, and AO 7?k i Fev. 3182) sexual abuse, excessive use of force, improper and prolonged (placement in administrative and disciplinary segregation, and to an Ion-going risk of suicide, sell-injury, and death. Plaintiffs sought class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b) (2) for a class consisting of ""all individuals whose abilities to cope with the demands of life within the correctional environment are impaired or in need of monitoring due to mental illness and/or mental retardation, who are now or will be in the future incarcerated at Phillips State Prison."" (First Amended Compl. [10] at 17.) In an Order [32] dated March 21, 2003, the Court determined that the would-be class did not meet all four of the requirements of Rule 23(a) and therefore denied without prejudice plaintiffs' motion for class certification. (Order [32] at 43.) The Court stated that it would maintain, as a single case, the action styled Fluellen, et al v. Wetherington, et al., 1 :02-CV-479-JEC, and ordered plaintiff Fluellen to file an amended complaint within thirty days from the date of that Order. (Id.) The Court further severed the claims of the remaining twenty plaintiffs and directed them to file individual complaints within thirty days of the date of the Order. (Id.) The Court emphasized that the denial of class certification was without prejudice and stated that if the j i plaintiffs, at some point in the future, developed a more cohesive AO ;w aev 8/82 1 class that could meet the requirements of Rule 23, the Court would entertain again a motion for class certification. (Id. at 99.) On April 10, 2003, the Court held a status conference with counsel for all parties present. The purpose of the conference was both to consider a motion for a preliminary injunction that plaintiffs had filed before the dismissal by Fluellen and to determine how best to proceed with the case. The Court noted the awkward procedural posture that had been created because the voluntary dismissal by plaintiff Fluellen meant that there was really no longer any case. (Hearing Tr. at 3.) The Court stated that it would like to have some sort of action started and for the parties to begin discovery. (Id. at 23.) The Court noted that a AO 714 raevs'a2) complaint would need to be filed and that the next step would then be to conduct discovery with regard to the particular complaint. (Id. at 24.) The Court therefore instructed plaintiffs' counsel to pick the plaintiff that they wanted to go with and to file an amended complaint ""in the next few days."" (Id. at 28.) The Court stated that discovery would proceed as to that one individual and that any decision on class status would be deferred. (Id.) Plaintiffs' counsel subsequently submitted an amended complaint to the Clerk's Office on July 8, 2003. This complaint has apparently not actually been filed, however, and it does not appear on the docket sheet. Moreover, no discovery appears to have been conducted in the intervening period. Plaintiffs' counsel stated at the conference that they would like to begin discovery as soon as they could. (Hearing Tr. at 31.) The Court stated specifically that it wanted discovery to start. (Td. at 33.) The Court's understanding was therefore that the parties would go ahead and conduct a ninety-day discovery period after the filing of the new complaint. (Hearing Minute Sheet [36].) Yet, for reasons I unclear to the Court, the amended complaint appears never to have been officially filed, and no discovery has occurred. Defendants have new filed a motion to dismiss this case based upon the new plaintiff's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. At the April 10, 2003, conference, the Court noted that Ao ;2a i Rev 9821 it did not want to get bogged down nn the issue of whether the proper grievances had been filed at the prison.

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff (""Green"") files this Complaint for all permissible damages, by using 42 <unk>1983 and 1988 as vehicles to vindicate Green's rights under the Eighth Amendment and Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, because Defendants violated Green's constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. To support this Complaint, Green alleges the following: 1 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT Based on new knowledge, Green files this Complaint, which related to 6:14cv-46-BAE-GRS. On September 21, 2012, at the same time (4:30 a.m.), Tone Grubbs (a Defendant in 6:14-cv-46-BAE-GRS) admitted both Plaintiff and Darryl Ricard (Plaintiff's assailant) into protective custody, and when Green arrived to Green's protective custody cell, Ricard was waiting. Ricard raped Green, and the Defendants to this action all knew Ricard was going to rape (or at the very least, sexually assault) Green yet permitted Ricard to sexually assault Green. JURISDICTION 1. Jurisdiction is proper and based upon 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331, 1332, and 1343. VENUE 2. Venue is proper and based upon 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391. Also, the events or omissions related to Green's claims arose in Tattnall County, GA at Rogers State Prison. See L.R. 3.4. PARTIES 3. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Green was a citizen of the United States, residing in Georgia. Green submits to the jurisdiction and venue of this Court; thus Green files this action under federal law for all general, special, compensatory, punitive, and any other permissible damages. A. Defendants Lieutenant Bashan McIntosh (""McIntosh') at all times relevant to this action was a correctional officer at Rogers State Prison who was also employed by GDC. While Green was in protective custody (""PC""), from September 21-22, 2012, McIntosh was on duty. During that time, McIntosh saw Ricard (Green's assailant) in Green's PC cell and knew Ricard was not supposed to be in Green's cell. McIntosh also knew, at the time he saw Ricard in Green's cell and knew Ricard was not supposed to be there, that Ricard was a gang member and convicted rapist, child molester. McIntosh knew Ricard would sexually assault Green and condoned that eventual sexual assault by permitting Ricard to be in Green's PC cell where McIntosh knew Ricard was not supposed to be. At all times relevant to this Complaint, McIntosh was acting under color of law, and was responsible for knowing all relevant policies, procedures, rules, regulations of the DOC with respect to transgender inmates and vulnerable inmates, and McIntosh was also responsible for knowing all precedential law of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, as that law applies to the U.S Constitution with respect to transgender and vulnerable inmates. McIntosh is being sued in his individual capacity and may be served at 1978 GA HWY 147, Reidsville, GA 30453. 5. Brad Westberry (""Westberry"") at all times relevant to this action was a correctional officer at Rogers State Prison who was also employed by GDC.

Create falsified administrative records to introduce before pending judicial proceedings, before the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, regarding litigation on the CONS and c. Create falsified administrative records and statistics to use before Judicial Administrative and Legislative proceedings to: 1.

BRENT REINKE and JOHANNA SMITH, in their official capacities, Defendants. Case No. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This action arises under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12101 et seq. (hereinafter “ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. <unk>701 et seq. (hereinafter “Rehabilitation Act”). At issue is the failure of Defendants, Idaho Department of Correction (IDOC) officials, to ensure that Plaintiff, Randolph Smith, an inmate who is deaf, was provided an opportunity to effectively communicate with persons outside the prison that was equal to that provided hearing inmates. Hearing inmates are provided COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF the use of standard telephones to communicate with persons outside the prison. Using a standard telephone, hearing inmates can communicate with persons outside the prison using their primary language. Moreover, in light of the continuing spread of this basic technology, using the standard telephone hearing inmates have an ever increasing potential audience with whom they can communicate. Because of his disability, Plaintiff cannot communicate using a standard telephone. In recognition of this, the IDOC has provided him the use of a text telephone (TTY). However, a TTY does not enable Plaintiff to communicate with deaf persons outside the prison in a manner that is functionally equivalent to that afforded hearing inmates. A TTY does not allow him to communicate in his primary language. Moreover, because of changing technologies and trends, the actual number of persons he can contact using a TTY is continually decreasing. In fact, the TTY is becoming increasingly obsolete and useless. In light of this, Plaintiff requested that he be provided the use of a videophone. A videophone would allow him to communicate with an increased number of people using his primary language. The request for a videophone was denied. This denial violates Plaintiff’s rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act because it denies him, on the basis of his disability, an opportunity to communicate with persons outside the prison that is equal to that provided to hearing inmates.

","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS HENRY DAVIS, DOUGLAS COLEMAN, AARON FILLMORE, JEROME JONES, DESHAWN GARDNER, and PERCELL DANSBERRY on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, v. JOHN BALDWIN, Acting Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections, Defendant. Case No. 3:16-cv-600 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF NATURE OF THIS ACTION 1. Plaintiffs are residents of the Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”) who seek to represent a class consisting of persons who are currently subjected to “extreme isolation” (as defined below) or who have been subjected to extreme isolation and are in immediate danger of being subjected to extreme isolation by the IDOC. 2. “Extreme isolation” is the consensus term used by correctional experts, including corrections administrators, to describe segregation from the mainstream prisoner population in attached housing units or free-standing facilities where prisoners are involuntarily confined to their cells for upwards of 22 to 24 hours a day, given only extremely limited or no opportunities for direct and normal social contact with other persons (i.e., contact that is not mediated by bars, restraints, security glass or screens, and the like), and afforded extremely limited if any access to meaningful programming of any kind. Haney, The Social Psychology of Isolation: Why Solitary Confinement is Psychologically Harmful, Prison Service Journal, 12 at n.1 (Jan. 2009); see also Stephen Handelman, Changing the Rules for Solitary, The Crime Report (Jan. 15, 2016, 8:00 AM), http://www.thecrimereport.org/news/inside-criminal-justice/2016-01-changing-the-rulesfor-solitary. Extreme isolation includes, but is not limited to, double-celling inmates for updates of 23 hours a day or more in cells designed to hold only one person Id. Double celling leads to inmates being “forced to interact with a cellmate under extremely close quarters that afford little or no privacy or respite.” Haney, The Wages of Prison Overcrowding: Harmful Psychological Consequences and Dysfunctional Correctional Reactions, 22 Wash U J. of L Pol. 265, 273 (2006). Further, these inmates experience “constant and unavoidable violations of personal space, in an environment of forced closeness that affords them no respite from one another or opportunities to release the interpersonal tensions that inevitably result.” Id. at 11; see also Madrid v. Gomez, 889 F Supp. 1146, 1230 (N.D Cal. 1995) (prisoners held in extreme isolation “are severely deprived of normal human contact regardless of whether they are single or double celled”); Stuart Grassian, Psychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash. U.J.L. Pol’v 325, 357–58 (2006) (“Confined groups comprising just two individuals may be the most pathogenic of all.”). 3. The practice of punishing incarcerated individuals by transferring them from the general prison population to extreme isolation has long been shown to cause a severe risk of grave physical and psychological harm. For example, IDOC data shows that prisoners housed in segregation in Illinois prisons are nine times more likely to commit suicide than those in the general population. That is an 800% increase in suicides per person in segregation versus suicides per person in the general population. Regardless of its label—solitary confinement, Disciplinary Segregation, Investigative Status, or Administrative Detention—extensive research shows that the practice of subjecting individuals to extreme isolation causes pain, suffering, psychological and emotional trauma, physical injury, and, in extreme cases, death. Moreover, the practice of punishing incarcerated individuals by subjecting them to extended periods of extreme isolation has long been viewed by courts, prison authorities, bar associations, and United Nations commissions on torture as a practice to be avoided in all but the most limited cases where the individual presents a credible and continuing serious threat to others or himself. See, e.g., Interim Report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment, 66th Sess., UN Doc. A/66/268 (Aug. 5, 2011) (concluding that “prolonged solitary confinement” can produce harmful psychological effects and recommending that it be prohibited). 4. The IDOC, however, does not restrict the use of extreme isolation to limited cases where the individual presents a credible and continuing serious threat to others or himself. Instead, the Illinois Department of Corrections, as a matter of custom and practice, arbitrarily, capriciously, and routinely uses extreme isolation as means of punishing even the most minor prison infractions. Shockingly, as of June 30, 2013, approximately 2,300 residents of the IDOC were serving extreme isolation sentences. See Exhibit A, Segregation Housing Utilization and Population Dissemination, and Institution Population Chart, dated June 30, 2013.

In June 2013, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and the parties entered into a settlement agreement. In July 2015, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. In March 2019, the parties filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The parties agreed to a settlement in December 2015. The parties entered a consent decree in February 2019.

The DLC claimed that the DOC failed to take into account mental illness when subjecting prisoners to long periods of disciplinary and other forms of isolation and segregation. The case settled in 2011, and the defendants agreed to make sure that mentally ill prisoners were not placed in isolation or segregation without a full evaluation and determination that such placement would not cause further injury; they also agreed to pay attorney fees. The case was closed in 2015 as no one had requested to reopen the case since the settlement monitoring date ended. In 2016 one of the prisoners tried to reopen the case since prison officials were violating the settlement agreement, but the judge refused to reopen the case.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS DISABILITY LAW CENTER, INC., Plaintiff, v.

CIVIL ACTION NO. 07-10463 COMPLAINT Introduction By placing prisoners with mental illnesses in segregated confinement, the Massachusetts Department of Correction subjects these vulnerable individuals to conditions they are physically and psychologically incapable of tolerating for any sustained period of time. The extreme social isolation and sensory deprivation conditions of segregated confinement are difficult for all prisoners; for prisoners with mental illnesses, they exceed the limit of human endurance. Indeed, it is only too common for prisoners with mental illnesses to suffer further psychological deterioration, inflict serious harm to themselves, and even commit suicide as a result of placement in segregation. LITDOCS/658511.8 The Department of Correction and each of the individually named defendants is aware of the effect placement in segregation has on prisoners with mental illnesses. Nevertheless, they have taken no effective action to ameliorate the conditions under which prisoners with mental illnesses can be confined outside of the general prison population. By acting with deliberate indifference to this situation, each of the individually named defendants subjects prisoners with mental illnesses to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Department of Correction has also failed to address the problem, and therefore violates both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. <unk>794, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131, et seq.

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT I. INTRODUCTION 1. This is a class action lawsuit based on the willful and deliberate refusal of the Defendants to comply with federal laws protecting the rights of Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Correction (“DOC”). 2. The Defendants named in this case have failed to comply with federal law, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. <unk>794 et seq., the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000cc-1 et seq., and the Constitution of the United States. 3. Through their policies and practices, Defendants discriminate against deaf and hard of hearing individuals in DOC custody. They have done this by denying deaf and hard of hearing individuals adequate, equally effective, and reliable means of communication, leaving Plaintiffs isolated and unable to communicate with others, including their loved ones outside of prison. Defendants’ failure to provide adequate access to auxiliary aids and services necessary to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing individuals in their custody deprives Plaintiffs of the ability to take advantage of educational, vocational, and rehabilitative programming, to receive equal access to medical and mental health services, and to participate in religious services. The DOC Defendants also fail to provide deaf and hard of hearing individuals in the DOC with adequate notification of important daily events and safety announcements, and to provide adequate interpretive services at administrative meetings and hearings, including disciplinary hearings, thus depriving them of the ability to adequately represent themselves and defend against undue punishment. In some cases, Plaintiffs have been disciplined due to their inability to hear instructions or announcements. In addition, the DOC Defendants discriminate against deaf and hard of hearing prisoners in work assignments. 4. As a result of Defendants’ discriminatory policies and practices, deaf and hard of hearing individuals in the Massachusetts DOC are: (A) Prevented from fully and effectively communicating by telephone or other telecommunications means with family, friends, attorneys, and other advocates outside of prison; (B) Denied full access to educational, vocational, and rehabilitative programs and services for which they could receive good conduct deductions to reduce their overall incarceration time, improve their prospects for gaining parole release, and improve their prospects for successfully transitioning back into the community upon their release; (C) Unable to fully access religious services; (D) Unable to fully access necessary and adequate medical treatment; (E) Excluded from full participation in medical, mental health, and counseling services and programs offered by the DOC and medical contractor Massachusetts Partnership for Correctional Healthcare (“MPCH”); (F) Unable to hear and understand safety announcements, fire alarms, and announcements for meals, prison counts, visits, appointments, and other important daily activities; (G) Denied the ability to meaningfully participate and represent themselves in disciplinary and other administrative proceedings and to defend against punishment resulting from their failure to hear instructions or announcements; and (H) Discriminated against in work assignments. 5. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief on their own behalf and on behalf of the class of all deaf and hard of hearing individuals in DOC custody for the harms they have suffered and continue to suffer as a result of the Defendants’ discrimination II.

LIBERTY, Commissioner of Maine Department of Corrections in his official capacity, Class Action Complaint IMMEDIATE RELIEF SOUGHT Respondents. INTRODUCTION 1. COVID-19 is a deadly virus that disproportionately sickens and kills medically vulnerable people housed in closed congregate settings like cruise ships, nursing homes, and prisons.1 As Maine’s Governor’s Chief Legal Counsel recently explained to this Court, “indoor settings where a large number of people sit stagnant, remain in close proximity to one another, breathe the same air, touch common personal and fixed property, and remain there for an extended period of time present an especially dangerous environment for community spread, particularly for persons who are elderly or who have certain compromising medical 1 John M. Barry, The Single Most Important Lesson from the 1918 Influenza, New York Times (March 17, 2020), https://cutt.ly/PtQ5uAZ (Opinion piece by author of “The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History,” noting comparison between current COVID-19 outbreak and the 1918 influenza outbreak widely considered one of the worst pandemics in history). conditions.”2 Although this statement was originally made in support of the government’s restriction on in-person religious gatherings, it applies with even greater force to Maine’s prisons, where people (including many who are medically vulnerable) spend much of the day in close contact with approximately 50 to 80 other prisoners and prison staff who circulate to and from the community each day. 2. With no vaccine or known cure for the virus, physical distancing is critical and, for those most vulnerable to the virus, it can be a matter of life or death. As explained by the Director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, “[p]hysical distancing is the best vaccine that we have.”3 For people who are particularly medically vulnerable to serious illness or death from COVID-19—including those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease—physical distancing is also a form of necessary preventative medical care.4 Other mitigation measures like frequent hand- washing, use of alcohol-based hand-sanitizer, and widespread testing, are additional important preventative measure for everyone—and especially those at highest risk.5 3. There can be no dispute that, if there was a vaccine or a pharmaceutical treatment for COVID-19, the prison would be obliged to provide it to prisoners—even if providing the treatment would be costly or inconvenient.6 But no vaccine or treatment is available. Instead, for medically vulnerable people who are mostly likely to face serious illness and death from the virus, prevention is the most important type of care. Indeed, there is consensus among medical experts that physical distancing is critical for individuals at high risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19, like the Petitioners and proposed Class Members.7 4. Yet, despite encouraging and even requiring these mitigation measures for the vast majority of people,8 the State of Maine fails to ensure that such preventative treatment is available to prisoners, and, to the contrary, prevents most prisoners from social distancing. Indeed, positive yet asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and concluding that “[t]esting all persons can facilitate isolation of those who are infected to minimize ongoing transmission in” homeless shelters, another closed congregate setting like prisons); Consideration for Use if Test-Based Strategies for Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Nursing Homes, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (last visited May 9, 2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019ncov/hcp/nursing-homes-testing.html (recommending widespread testing and retesting in nursing homes, another closed congregate setting with many medically vulnerable individuals).

The Plaintiff alleged that the “freeze-frame” policy of refraining from providing transgender prisoners necessary medical care for gender dysphoria unless they previously received such services violated the Eighth Amendment. In 2018, the court declared that the policy violated the Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause and issued a permanent injunction against the policy.

Plaintiff Jessica Hicklin (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Hicklin”) is a thirty-seven year old transgender woman1 in the custody of the Missouri Department of Corrections (“MDOC”) and housed at Potosi Correctional Center (“PCC”), a facility for male inmates, in Mineral Point, Missouri. Defendants are individuals and institutions who, for the duration of Ms. Hicklin’s incarceration, have had authority and responsibility for her medical treatment. 2. Despite knowing that Ms. Hicklin has gender dysphoria, a serious medical condition that causes severe psychological suffering and can lead to physical injury when not properly treated, Defendants have refused to provide Ms. Hicklin with medically necessary care. 3. On March 27, 2015, Ms. Hicklin filed a Petition for Change of Name in the Washington County Circuit Court, seeking to change her name from the traditionally male name given to her at birth to her current legal name, Jessica Hicklin.2 1 In keeping with Ms. Hicklin’s gender identity, modern judicial practice, and accepted medical protocol, this Complaint uses female pronouns to refer to her. 2 On July 24, 2015, Ms. Hicklin received an order from the Washington County Circuit Court granting her name change petition.

Although Defendants’ own mental health personnel have evaluated Ms. Hicklin, have diagnosed her with gender dysphoria, and have recommended that she receive hormone therapy to treat her gender dysphoria, Defendants refuse to provide Ms. Hicklin with this therapy, citing a policy or custom of providing hormone therapy only to those transgender inmates who were receiving it prior to incarceration. 5. This type of “freeze-frame” policy violates the medically accepted standard of care for treating gender dysphoria; similar state and federal policies have been held unconstitutional by federal courts as a violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 6. Upon information and belief, Defendants are providing and have provided hormone therapy to other transgender inmates in MDOC, recognizing that it can be medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria, but unreasonably refuse to provide this medically necessary treatment to Ms. Hicklin due to MDOC’s unconstitutional “freeze-frame” policy. 7.

COMPLAINT Preliminary Statement This class action is brought by prisoners confined in Unit 32 of Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, Mississippi. A supermaximum security facility, Unit 32 is a massive complex of five buildings housing about 1000 men, almost all of them in segregation cells where they are locked down 23 to 24 hours a day, in total isolation. The conditions ofconfinement in Unit 32 are so barbaric, the deprivation of medical and mental health care so extreme, and the defects in security so severe, that the lives and health ofthe men confined there- and the correctional staffwho work there are at great and imminent risk. 2. Although Mississippi prison officials claim that they use Unit 32 to incarcerate the most dangerous and incorrigible offenders in the State, in the most secure and restrictive setting possible, the reality is quite different. The majority of the men housed in Unit 32- for years, sometimes for decades- do not have the kind ofcriminal history or institutional conduct that justifies incarceration under ""supermax"" conditions. Many prisoners were placed in Unit 32 for purely arbitrary reasons, or for no discernible reason at all, and have never had a meaningful opportunity to contest their placement there. Many are confined there because they are HIV-positive, have special medical needs, are severely mentally ill, or have requested protective custody. Even for those men whose history might warrant the most highly restrictive custody, there is no justification whatsoever for the horrifically brutal and dangerous conditions to which they are knowingly subjected by Defendant prison officials and their medical services contractors. 3. These conditions include profound isolation and unrelieved idleness; pervasive filth and stench; malfunctioning plumbing and constant exposure to human excrement; lethal extremes of heat and humidity; uncontrolled infestations of mosquitoes, spiders, horseflies and other insects; grossly inadequate medical, mental health and dental care; the routine use by security staff of excessive force; and the constant pandemonium, night and day, of severely mentally ill prisoners screaming, raving and hallucinating in nearby cells. Security staffing in Unit 32 is so dangerously inadequate and incompetent that prison gang leaders, housed in other areas of Mississippi State Penitentiary but assigned to work in Unit 32, are able to freely transact their gang business and recruit corrupt corrections officers to facilitate gang-related drug transactions, prostitution rings and extortion schemes. 4. All of these conditions, separately and in combination, cause those who live in Unit 32 intense suffering, and put them at substantial risk of physical injury, illness and premature death. These conditions are likely to cause serious mental illness to emerge in previously healthy prisoners, and psychosis, mania and mental breakdown to afflict less healthy prisoners. As a result of these deprivations, Unit 32 is a tinder-box- a catastrophe waiting to happen. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 to redress the deprivation under color of state law of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States.

INTRODUCTION 1. This is a class action filed on behalf of prisoners confined at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility (EMCF) near Meridian, Mississippi. EMCF was designed as the facility intended to provide treatment for Mississippi's seriously mentally ill prisoners in a safe, humane, and therapeutic environment. Today, EMCF is an extremely dangerous facility operating in a perpetual state of crisis, where prisoners live in barbaric and horrific conditions and their basic human rights are violated daily. Grossly inhumane conditions have cost many prisoners their health, and their limbs, their eyesight, and even their lives. Defendants, high-ranking officials of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), who are responsible for the health and safety of these prisoners, have known of these conditions for years but have failed to take reasonable steps to protect the prisoners in their charge. 2. EMCF's solitary confinement zones house dozens of seriously mentally ill prisoners who are locked down in filthy cells for days, weeks, or even years at a time. Many cells lack functioning toilets; prisoners defecate into Styrofoam trays or plastic trash bags and have no way of ridding their cells of the waste other than tossing it onto the housing unit through the slots in their cell doors, where it remains. It is commonplace for cells to lack working lights, leaving prisoners with barely enough light to see during the day and in total darkness at night. One of EMCF's solitary confinement areas is widely known by prisoners as ""the Dead Man's Zone,"" or ""Dead Area,"" because the prisoners are virtually unsupervised and their basic needs are ignored: Correctional officers seldom appear on the housing zones and prisoners are left to fend for themselves, sealed behind solid-front doors. Because there is insufficient officer staffing, prisoners are frequently left in the grime-covered shower stalls, wet, naked and cold for hours at a time. Setting fires is often the only way to get medical attention in emergencies. 3. Rats climb over prisoners' beds in the dark and mice crawl out of broken toilets. The extreme deprivations and extraordinarily harsh conditions at EMCF have even fostered commerce in rats: Some prisoners capture rats, put them on improvised leashes, and sell them as pets to the seriously mentally ill. 4. Among the hundreds of mentally ill prisoners at EMCF are many whose untreated illnesses lead to extreme behaviors such as screaming, babbling, throwing excrement, and starting fires. Suicide attempts are frequent; some are successful. Other prisoners engage in gross acts of self-mutilation, including electrocution, swallowing shards of glass and razors, and tearing into their flesh with sharp objects. Defendants deny prisoners even rudimentary mental health treatment and, last year, reduced access to psychiatric care. 5. Medical staffhas ignored gangrenous wounds. One prisoner's scrotum swelled to the size of a softball before revealing a hard knot on his testicle. He was denied timely proper care for weeks and was later diagnosed with testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen. Another prisoner is now legally blind after being denied treatment for glaucoma. Last month, staff placed a prisoner with a large, open wound in a cell in a filth-ridden solitary confinement unit. He developed a life-threatening infection and required emergency surgery. 6. Rapes, stabbings, beatings, and other acts of violence are rampant. Security staff is far too few in number and far too ill-trained and ill-supervised to protect prisoners at EMCF from violence. Management and Training Corporation (MTC), the private for-profit corporation with which MDOC currently contracts to operate EMCF, 1 provides only minimal training and places raw recruits on the job after a mere three-week training course. Some security officers are complicit or otherwise involved in prisoner-on-prisoner violence. 7. Poorly trained security staff rely heavily on excessive force to control prisoners, including mentally ill prisoners, even when no threat is posed.

The plaintiffs that the New Jersey prison system was failing to treat them for Hepatitis C.  By the time the court adjudicated the class action issue, in May 2008, the New Jersey Department of Corrections had adopted major changes in how prisoners with HCV were treated; it updated its procedures to match those of the federal Bureau of Prisons, and ""backscreened"" all the prisoners willing to be screened for the virus.  Given that the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs was this same set of reforms, Judge Hillman denied the request for injunctive relief as moot.  As to two individual class members who had HCV, the court held there was sufficient evidence in the record to go to trial on their constitutional claims (though not on their Americans with Disabilities Act claims), and denied the state's motion for summary judgment.  In October 2009, the case settled for money damages.  (However, it seems from some papers filed by one of the plaintiffs that he may never actually have received  his money.  But when he sought the assistance of the court in enforcing the settlement against his lawyer, Judge Hillman ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction, and directed him to file a collection action in state court.  )","Document 27 •Filed 07/25/2003 CAMDEN VICINAGE WALTER BENNETT, and DANIEL AMOS GRRGORY ROYAL, and JOHN LACRY, individually and jointly on behalf ,<unk>f all others similarly situated PlaintifIs, VS.

MICHELLE R. RICCI, in her official capacity as Administrator, New Jersey State Prison; and GEORGE W. HAYMAN, in his official capacity as Commissioner, New Jersey Department of Corrections, Defendants. VERIFIED COMPLAINT Civil Action No. INTRODUCTION The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of2000 (""RLUIPA"") and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prohibit prison officials from substantially burdening the religious practice of inmates without sufficient justification. Howard Thompson, Jr., the Plaintiff in this case, is a prisoner at New Jersey State Prison (""NJSP"") and an ordained Pentecostal minister. For over a decade, he has been preaching at Sunday Protestant services at NJSP and leading other inmates in religious activities such as choir and Bible study. Far from disrupting security at NJSP, Mr. Thompson's activities have been praised by NJSP chaplains as helpful to the rehabilitation ofmany of those confined at NJSP. Last year, however, NJSP implemented a new policy without warning or justification that bans Mr. Thompson and all other inmates from preaching in the prison. NJSP's blanket prohibition on inmate preaching prevents Mr. Thompson from fulfilling his religious calling as a minister and a Pentecostal. Because the policy is not the least restrictive means of advancing any compelling governmental interest, it violates Mr. Thompson's rights under RLUIPA. And because, as currently formulated, it serves no legitimate penological interest, it contravenes the Free Exercise Clause as well Mr. Thompson files this action to vindicate his right to religious liberty and, more specifically, to restore his ability to preach at NJSP. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000cc, et seq.

This Court has jurisdiction to issue the declaratory relief requested pursuant to the Declaratory Relief Act, 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, 2202. 3. Venue is proper in the District of New Jersey pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b), because all parties reside within the District of New Jersey and the events described in this Complaint occurred in the District of New Jersey. PARTIES 4. Plaintiff Howard Thompson, New Jersey State Prisoner #204-289/ SBI 97607B, is an inmate at New Jersey State Prison (""NJSP""). In 1986, Mr. Thompson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. As an ordained minister in the Pentecostal faith, Mr. Thompson feels compelled by his sincerely held religious beliefs to preach and minister to other inmates. 5. Defendant Michelle R. Ricci is employed by the New Jersey Department of Corrections (""NJ DOC"") as the Administrator ofNJSP. She is responsible for the daily operations ofNJSP, including all policies relating to prisoners' freedom to preach and minister to others inmates. Ricci is sued in her official capacity. 6. Defendant George W. Hayman is the Commissioner ofthe NJ DOC. He is responsible for the overall operations of the prison facilities in the State ofNew Jersey, including NJSP. Hayman is sued in his official capacity. FACTS 7. Since he entered NJSP in 1986, Mr. Thompson, an adherent of the Pentecostal faith, has been an active member of the prison's Christian community, participating in and preaching at Sunday services and other religious events, and founding the Protestant choir. 8. As a Pentecostal, Mr. Thompson believes that he has a religious calling to spread the Good News of the Kingdom of God through preaching, study of the Bible, and ministry to others. 9. Those beliefs are deeply and sincerely held by Mr. Thompson. 10 Mr. Thompson first preached in a service at NJSP over a decade ago, when he relieved Bishop Joseph P. Ravenell, the NJSP Protestant Chaplain at the time who was unable to lead the service due to temporary illness. 11. During the next decade, prior to his ordination as a Pentecostal minister, Mr. Thompson periodically preached at Sunday services, taught Bible study classes, and participated in and led the prison choir. 12. In October of2000, in a service at NJSP overseen by then-Chaplain Samuel K. Atchison, and attended by Bishop Ravenell and two chaplaincy volunteers, Bishop Lawrence S. Thompson and Pastor Stephen Miller, Mr. Thompson was ordained as a Pentecostal minister. 13 Mr. Thompson received the call of ordination and deeply and sincerely believes he",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] New Jersey State Prison | U.S. District Court | District of New Jersey ||| Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 ||| New Jersey Department of Corrections ||||||| June 2012 ||| June 2013 ||| July 2014 ||| August 2015 ||| September 2016 ||| December 2018 ||| January 2019 |</s>

This is a civil rights action, brought on behalf of state prisoners who seek to redress defendants’ failure to make their programs, services, and activities accessible to prisoners with disabilities who are in the custody of the New York State Department of Correctional Services (“DOCS”).

The case was consolidated to include the complaints of two other prisoners. The prisoners won both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to provide them a Kosher diet at no personal cost. The permanent injunction, issued February 8, 2006, ordered the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections 'to immediately provide to the plaintiffs Kosher diets at no cost, [while complying with nutritional requirements currently applicable to all other ODOC prisoners].' On September 26, 2012 the Court found that the judgment entered in this case only applies to the claims pursued by the three named plaintiffs, and the permanent injunction relief does not apply to all Oklahoma Department of Corrections inmates.

I i I Electronically Filed AMENDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff Sebastian Richardson brings this action for damages, injunctive, and class relief against the Defendants, complaining and alleging as follows: NATURE OF THE CASE 1. This civil rights case is brought against Defendants for injunctive relief and monetary damages for violations of Plaintiff Sebastian Richardson's (""Plaintiff' or ""Mr. Richardson""), Eighth and Fifth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution Mr. Richardson also asserts class claims for injunctive relief on behalf of all current and future prisoners in the Special Management Unit (SMU) at the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg (USP Lewisburg), pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, for the unconstitutional and unconscionable conditions of confinement that Plaintiff individually, and all inmates collectively, must endure on a day-to-day basis. Defendants, acting under color of federal law, engaged and continue to engage in a pattern, practice or policy of placing hostile inmates together in cells and/or recreation cages despite the serious risk that the hostile inmates will cause substantial material harm to each other. As part of this placement pattern, practice or policy, Defendants punish inmates who refuse dangerous placements by putting them in restraints for hours at a time, sometimes as long as twenty-four (24) hours or more. These restraints significantly restrict an inmate's arm and leg motion, and in some cases, inmates are strapped to a bed with their limbs tied down in a brutal procedure known as four pointing. If an inmate does not refuse the hostile cellmate placement, violence is likely to occur. Furthermore, Defendants, again acting under color of federal law, engaged and continue to engage in a pattern, practice or policy of failing to intervene to prevent substantial material harm to inmates resulting from dangerous placements. There have been at least two inmate deaths at USP Lewisburg attributable to this systemic failure. Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive the members of the class of their constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and their right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. If appropriate injunctive relief is not granted, the harms suffered will be irreparable, may lead to death, and will continue for the foreseeable future. Plaintiff has personally endured two categories of this conduct: (1) He has been forced to share a cell with a known hostile inmate, facing the threat of violence from that cell pairing; and (2) he has been placed in restraints on multiple occasions for refusing dangerous cell assignments with hostile inmates. Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of himself, as well as injunctive relief on behalf of all current and future USP Lewisburg inmates. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. Plaintiff brings this action under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the United States Constitution and under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). 3.

Indeed, they have prohibited all communication between Mr. Abu-Jamal and anyone, with the exception of one 15-minute phone call between him and his wife, Wadiya Jamal, who has been authorized by Mr. Abu Jamal to receive any and all medical information.1 ""!The Declaration of Wadiya Jamal was signed prior to the her being notified that a phone call was permitted. 7. Injunctive relief is necessary to permit the plaintiff attorneys to perform their professional duties for their client and to secure Mr. Abu-Jamal’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment right of access to the courts. Background 8. For the past several months, Mr. Abu-Jamal has been suffering from a variety of medical problems. These include a skin rash over 70% of his body of unknown origin, abnormal blood work, and one episode of diabetic shock that could have resulted in death. There has been no diagnosis. 9. The medical issues began to surface in about August 2014. At that time he began to experience itching over his whole body. The itching was reported to facility staff who prescribed creams. The creams had no effect and the rash spread. No effort was made to determine the cause of the rash. 10. The rash spread and, on two occasions became infected. While the infection was treated with antibiotics, no efforts were made to diagnose the cause of the rash Mr. Abu-Jamal had an allergic reaction to one of the antibiotics administered. 11. By February 2015, the rash had spread to over 70% of Mr. Abu-Jamal’s body. It was accompanied by lower extremity and genital edema causing great discomfort and making it increasingly difficult for Mr. Abu Jamal to walk. 12.

COPPOLA, each individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, PLAINTIFFS, v. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT JURY TRIAL DEMANDED THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, THOMAS R. KANE, DAVID J. EBBERT, DEFENDANTS. COMPLAINT Plaintiffs Jusamuel Rodriguez McCreary, Richard C. Anamanya, and Joseph R. Coppola, each individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, respectfully complain as follows against Defendants the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), Thomas R. Kane, and David J. Ebbert. INTRODUCTION 1. This class action lawsuit concerns the inadequate and unconstitutional treatment of prisoners within the Special Management Unit (“SMU”) at the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg (“USP Lewisburg”) who suffer from mental illness. 2. The BOP houses men in the SMU at USP Lewisburg in tiny cells, frequently with another individual, for at least 23 hours a day. International standards describe holding anyone in such conditions for more than two weeks as torture. Knowing that men are held in these conditions for years at a time, the BOP sends men with diagnosed mental illnesses to live in these conditions without adequate mental health treatment. This lawsuit seeks to recognize that it is unconstitutional to hold men with mental illness is these conditions. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the BOP to comply with its policies regarding the treatment of individuals with mental illness and to provide mental health diagnoses and treatment consistent with the requirements of the Eighth Amendment for individuals who have been committed to its custody. 3. USP Lewisburg was built in 1932 and is a high security United States penitentiary located in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. It currently houses approximately 1,089 men, 437 of whom are held in a low security camp. The remaining 652 men are held in a high security facility, most of them in the SMU. A small number of individuals are held in a general population (non-SMU) unit in the high security facility at Lewisburg. In 2009 the BOP transformed USP Lewisburg from a regular penitentiary to an SMU for the purpose of housing men with unique security and management concerns. Conditions of confinement in the SMU are more restrictive than in a general population environment. Men spend as at least 23 hours per day in cells that are on average eight by eleven feet in size. 4. Men who have been diagnosed with mental illness as well as with serious mental illness1—including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression— are confined in these conditions, often sharing a cell with another man with mental illness. 5. The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and BOP policies require the provision of mental health treatment to those in the SMU at USP Lewisburg who are suffering from mental illness. 6. Specifically, formal BOP policies suggest a commitment to ensuring that “inmates with mental illness are identified and receive treatment to assist their progress toward recovery, while reducing or eliminating the frequency and severity of symptoms and associated negative outcomes of mental illness.”2 7. The policies also demonstrate the BOP’s recognition that extended confinement in isolation combined with harsh disciplinary practices (such as placement in four-points restraints) pose a substantial risk to individuals’ mental 1 As defined infra at 51. 2 BOP Program Statement 5310.16 on the Treatment and Care of Inmates with Mental Illness (May 1, 2014). health, especially for the men who had mental health problems before being confined in such conditions. 8. Lastly, the BOP’s policies state that SMU men may be transferred out of the SMU program if it becomes clear that their mental health status does not reasonably allow them to complete the SMU program. 9. Despite these policies, the BOP houses dozens of men with serious mental illness in the SMU at USP Lewisburg and fails to provide adequate mental health care to individuals with mental illness, even denying individuals who have been diagnosed with mental illness by the BOP the treatment they require. Together, the conditions of confinement at USP Lewisburg and the BOP’s failure to properly diagnose and treat mental illness, have worsened the mental health status of men who arrive at USP Lewisburg with mental illness, and have caused other individuals to develop mental illness while at the facility. 10. The less-than-constitutionally-adequate care provided for people with mental illness at USP Lewisburg consists of prison staff passing out coloring books and puzzles and calling it “treatment.” Most men never receive actual one-on-one counseling. The supposed “counseling” they do receive is during psychology rounds and includes brief discussions with a psychology staff member through the cell doors.

He sued multiple TDCJ employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. He alleged that TDJC policies that prevented his smoking a prayer pipe during Native American pipe ceremonies, limited his ability to wear a religiously significant medicine bag, and prevented him from growing long hair violated his rights under RLUIPA and the First Amendment. He sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief as well as attorney's fees and costs. An additional Native American prisoner plaintiff joined the suit shortly after filing. 

In February 2013, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, consented to proceedings before a Magistrate Judge, and voluntarily dismissed all of their claims except their three RLUIPA challenges against the TDCJ Director in his official capacity and their First Amendment claim seeking damages against the Program Analyst in his individual capacity. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. On February 27, 2014, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment was granted and a final judgment entered in their favor. The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit and were successful in getting judgement on the RLUIPA grooming policy claim vacated and remanded. On remand, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the RLUIPA grooming claim was denied. As the RLUIPA grooming policy claim moved towards trial, the initial prisoner plaintiff in the case was released and his claims were dismissed. The Court ordered the consolidation of cases Casey v. Davis (2:14-cv-13) and Cobb v. Morris (2:14-cv-22) with this case, as the two cases also were brought by Native American prisoner incarcerated at the McConnell Unit and involved RLUIPA grooming policy claims moving towards trial. After a bench trial, Judge Ramos granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief permitting them to grow their hair long, consistent with their Native American religious beliefs and entered a final judgment on February 26, 2019. The defendant appealed, but moved to dismiss the appeal shortly after. The Fifth Circuit granted the motion to dismiss the appeal on July 9, 2019.

VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, HAROLD CLARKE, RANDALL C. MATHENA, H. SCOTT RICHESON, A. DAVID ROBINSON, HENRY J. PONTON, MARCUS ELAM, DENISE MALONE, STEVE HERRICK, TORI RAIFORD, JEFFREY KISER, and CARL MANIS, each individually and in their official capacities, Defendants. CASE NO. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 1. Named Plaintiffs William Thorpe, Frederick Hammer, Dmitry Khavkin, Gerald McNabb, Gary Wall, Vernon Brooks, Brian Cavitt, Derek Cornelison, Christopher Cottrell, Peter Mukuria, Steven Riddick, and Kevin Snodgrass bring this action against the Virginia Department of Corrections (“VDOC”) and the individual defendants, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. These men have been isolated in solitary confinement at Virginia’s twin maximum-security prisons, Red Onion and Wallens Ridge State Prisons—and have remained in long-term solitary confinement for between two and 23 years. No Virginia sentencing statute or regulation requires VDOC to place these men in long-term solitary confinement based on their crimes or sentences. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 2. As a result of their long-term solitary confinement, the Named Plaintiffs have suffered severe physical and mental health damage, including weight loss, auditory and visual hallucinations, emotional distress, PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, severe sensory deprivation, and suicidal thoughts. 3. As understood by the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Department of Justice, “solitary confinement”—including when referred to as “segregation,” “administrative segregation,” “restrictive housing,” or “isolation”—entails: (1) removal from the general inmate population; (2) placement alone in a locked room or cell; (3) inability to leave the room or the cell for the vast majority of the day; and (4) near-total deprivation of contact with other humans. For the purposes of this Complaint, “solitary confinement,” “administrative segregation,” and “restrictive housing” are used interchangeably. 4. Different state prison systems differ as to the exact conditions of solitary confinement. Some lock prisoners in their cells not for 23 hours a day, but 22. Others lock prisoners in their cells for 20 hours per day. Some solitary confinement cells are windowless; some have small slits for windows; some still have small slits that have been fogged over. All fit the definition of solitary confinement. 5. It is well recognized in court decisions, by the U.S. Department of Justice, and among experts in the field of prison science that the practice of longterm solitary confinement inflicts wide-ranging and often permanent physical and psychological harms on prisoners. 6. Extensive scientific research demonstrates that people consistently suffer a number of dysfunctional psychological states and outcomes when deprived of meaningful social contact and a normal range of sensory input (such as exposure to natural light, outdoor sounds, and varying colors) for long periods. According to experts in the field, these harms can manifest in as little as 10 days. 7. Almost forty years ago, VDOC was sued by a class of prisoners held in solitary confinement at Virginia’s then maximum-security prison—the Mecklenburg Correctional Center (“Mecklenburg”). VDOC was using a so-called “Phase Program” which it touted as a scientifically based “behavioral modification” program, whereby prisoners could advance through “phases” of solitary confinement with varying levels of privileges and ultimately become eligible for return to the general prison population. The class alleged that VDOC used the Phase Program to warehouse prisoners in solitary confinement, causing mental and physical harms. For prisoners deemed particularly “disruptive,” VDOC had a so-called “Special Management Unit,” where prisoners generally spent their entire incarceration in a more draconian form of solitary confinement, without the opportunity to obtain additional privileges, and with additional attendant harms. In Brown v. Landon, Case No. 81-0853-R (E.D. Va.), the prisoners alleged that, through the Phase Program and Special Management Unit, VDOC violated their Constitutional rights to due process and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. 8. In 1984, the Virginia Board of Corrections issued a comprehensive report documenting that its solitary confinement system at Mecklenburg was a failure. Among other things, the report documented that in designing the Phase Program, VDOC ignored correctional and mental health science and the recommendations of independent psychologists, and instead opted for a program devised by a V",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] February 2015 | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of Virginia ||| Virginia Department of Corrections ||| August 2015 ||| July 2016 ||| September 2017 ||| October 2018 ||| January 2019 ||| March 2019 | ||| May 2019 |</s>

Judge John P. Jones denied the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief in 2017 and initially granted summary judgment in favor of VDOC in 2018, but the Fourth Circuit overturned him on appeal in late 2019, saying that VDOC's use of access to television for religious services as an incentive program unduly burdens the plaintiff's rights to practice a bona fide religious belief. The panel stated that religious practice should be a right, not a privilege that can be taken away through an incentive program.

The United States files this Complaint pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997 (CRIPA), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131-12134 (ADA), to enjoin the Defendant, Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority, from depriving prisoners of rights, privileges, or immunities secured and protected by the Constitution of the United States, and rights protected by the ADA. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1345 and 42 U.S.C. 3. The United States is authorized to initiate this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997a(a). 4. The Attorney General has certified that all pre-filing requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997b have been met. The Certificate of the Attorney General is appended to this Complaint as Attachment A and is incorporated herein. 5. Venue in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and in this Division is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391 and Local Rule 3(C). PARTIES 6. Plaintiff is the United States of America. 7. Defendant is the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (“Jail”). 8. Defendant is responsible for the safety, care, custody, and control of prisoners housed in the Hampton Roads Regional Jail at 2690 Elmhurst Lane in Portsmouth, Virginia. FACTS 9. The Jail is an institution within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997(1). 10. The Jail houses over 900 individuals, including pre-trial detainees, convicted prisoners, and youth accused of adult crimes (“prisoners”). 11. The Jail is a public entity within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131(1) and 28 C.F.R. <unk>35.104, and is therefore subject to Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131-12134, and its implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. Part 35. 12. On December 12, 2016, the United States notified the Jail and local officials of its intention to investigate conditions in the Jail, including specifically whether the “Jail violates inmates’ rights to adequate medical and mental health care, violates the constitutional rights of inmates who have mental illness by secluding them in isolation for prolonged time periods, and violates the ADA rights of inmates who have mental illness by denying them access to services, programs, and activities by reason of their disability.” 13. The United States’ investigation included on-site inspections with expert consultants, staff and prisoner interviews, and extensive review of documents such as policies, procedures, forms, incident reports, grievances, medical records, and training records. 14. The United States provided the results and recommendations of its investigation to the Jail and local officials. These disclosures include specifically those made in the United States’ December 19, 2018 CRIPA Notice. The constitutional and statutory violations outlined in the CRIPA Notice include those described in paragraphs 15 through 23 below. 15. Jail prisoners suffer serious harm or risk of serious harm from inadequate medical and mental health care, and from the Jail’s use of prolonged restrictive housing, under current conditions, on prisoners with serious mental illness. 16. Such deficiencies are longstanding and have been in place throughout the course of the United States’ investigation. 17. Defendant has not taken corrective action sufficient to correct the longstanding deficiencies. 18. Defendant fails to provide constitutionally adequate medical care to prisoners. Many prisoners at the Jail have serious medical needs requiring treatment, and these prisoners are placed at a substantial risk of serious harm when they do not receive adequate treatment. The Jail fails to provide constitutionally adequate intake, discharge planning, sick call, chronic care, and emergency care such that prisoners are subjected to an unacceptable risk of harm due to delays or lack of treatment. 19. Defendant fails to provide constitutionally adequate mental health care to prisoners. Specifically, the Jail’s current program fails to: properly screen prisoners for mental illness; provide adequate treatment planning; adequately administer medications and psychotherapy; and properly treat and supervise suicidal prisoners. 20. Defendant’s use of prolonged restrictive housing under current conditions, including the failure to provide adequate medical and mental health care, violates the constitutional rights of prisoners with serious mental illness. 21. At least as of 2018, Defendant’s restrictive housing practices of placing prisoners with mental health disabilities in restrictive housing on administrative status specifically because they are “mentally deficient,” with no disciplinary or","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia | Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority | Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) | Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) ||| December 19, 2018 ||| January 31, 2019 ||| March 31, 2019 [Verse] On December 19, 2018, the United States filed this civil rights suit in the United District Court of the Eastern district of Virginia.

I. INTRODUCTION This lawsuit challenges the Washington Department of Corrections' (""DOC's"") regular 23 practice of withholding necessary medical care from patients with serious and painful medical 24 conditions. DOC denies patient-prisoners access to constitutionally adequate medical care by COMPLAINT- Page 1 COLUMBIA LEGAL SERVICES Institutions Project utilizing a healthcare preapproval system that regularly results in arbitrary and medically 2 unsound decisions. DOC's inadequate preapproval system denies medically necessary treatment 3 to Plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, by allowing a committee of clinicians and 4 administrators who have little familiarity with the patient to override the clinical 5 recommendations of the patient's treating DOC practitioner and outside specialists. Under this 6 preapproval system, DOC regularly disregards evidence that a patient's condition is causing 7 chronic and substantial pain and functional limitations. The Defendants' failure to properly 8 review medical cases and their denials of necessary care expose Plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, to a substantial risk of ongoing and unnecessary pain, functional limitations, and other serious harm, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The named Plaintiffs are prisoners in the custody of the DOC and are subject to DOC's policies governing the provision of medical care. Plaintiffs suffer from various medical 13 14 conditions that result in chronic and substantial pain or other conditions that warrant medical 15 treatment or evaluation that DOC has refused to provide.

I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 15 1.1 This class-action civil-rights lawsuit challenges King County’s pervasive policy 16 and practice of holding children who have not been convicted of any crime in long term solitary 17 confinement (“isolation”) at King County’s Maleng Regional Justice Center (“RJC”) and the 18 Defendants’ denial of an adequate education to every child held at the RJC. 19 1.2 Despite a scientific consensus that solitary confinement places children at risk of 20 serious emotional, psychological and physical harm, King County has embraced the frequent and 21 arbitrary use of solitary confinement. 22 COLUMBIA LEGAL SERVICES Institutions Project 1.3 King County regularly confines children incarcerated at the RJC alone in 2 miniscule, barren cells for 23 or 24 hours a day. King County holds children in isolation cells for 3 weeks or months on end. 1.4 These children, many of whom already have mental illnesses, have little to 5 nothing to do in their cells: no meaningful human interaction, little to no education or 6 programming, no music or television, and very few reading materials. Even when allowed out of 7 their cells, children in isolation are alone in the day room. Any “recreation” the children in 8 isolation receive takes place alone in an empty, concrete pen. 1.5 Isolating children so that they have minimal meaningful social contact causes 10 trauma, depression, anxiety, and psychosis, increases the risk of suicide and self-harm, and 11 permanently interferes with a child’s psychological and social development. For children with 12 mental illnesses or disabilities, the risk of harm from isolation is even greater because those 13 illnesses or disabilities worsen. 1.6 Compounding the profound consequences of King County’s wanton use of 15 isolation, King County is also denying all children held at the RJC basic educational services and 16 programming. 1.7 By holding children in isolation for long periods of time and refusing to provide 18 them an adequate education, King County has violated and continues to violate the rights of all 19 children held at the RJC; rights guaranteed them by the United States and Washington 20 constitutions, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and other applicable laws. 1.8 Plaintiff seeks to certify a class of all children King County currently houses at 22 the RJC and all children it will hold there in the future and asks the Court to issue declaratory COLUMBIA LEGAL SERVICES Institutions Project 1 and injunctive relief that will end the Defendants’ unlawful policies and practices. II. PARTIES 3 Defendants 2.1 Defendant King County is the governmental entity that owns and operates the 5 RJC and is responsible for the unlawful policies, practices and practices and customs challenged 6 by Plaintiff, including those related to the use of isolation. 2.2 King County employees, agents or others operating at King County’s direction are 8 hereinafter referred to as “jail staff” or “jail staffperson.” 2.3 King County is legally responsible for the actions or inactions described herein 10 committed by any jail staffperson. 2.4 King County failed to properly train or supervise jail staff and failed to properly 12 promulgate policies and standards to ensure that the RJC is operated in a lawful manner. 2.5 The actions or inactions described herein committed by King County or by jail 14 staff were taken under color of state law and constitute state action for all purposes. 15 Plaintiff 2.6 The Plaintiff, C.S., represented by his mother, Sonya Stokes, is a minor under the 17 age of 18, who has been injured by the Defendants’ actions as described herein. 2.7 The terms child, children or youth as used herein all mean a person or persons 19 under the age of 18. III. FACTS King County holds children in isolation cells for weeks and months on end. 3.1 King County operates two jails designed to hold adults, the RJC and the King COLUMBIA LEGAL SERVICES Institutions Project 1 County Jail. 3.2 Located in Kent, Washington, the RJC is a courthouse complex and correctional 3 facility. The jail portion of the RJC houses pre-trial detainees and people serving criminal 4 sentences. It generally has a daily census of between 830 and 950 adults. 3.3 Under Washington law, any child charged with certain crimes who is 16 or 17 at 6 the time of the alleged offense is automatically referred to the adult criminal justice system for 7 the adjudication of the criminal charge. 3.4 Younger children may also be sent to the adult system, but only after a Superior 9 Court Judge holds a hearing and determines that adult jurisdiction is appropriate. 3.5 By policy and practice, King County generally holds all children charged as 11 adults in King County at the RJC pending resolution of their criminal cases.

The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants failed to properly train or supervise jail staff and failed to ensure that the RJC is operated in a lawful manner.

The case was resolved by Consent Decree on November 19, 2008.","STEPHEN L. PEVAR American Civil Liberties Union Foundation 32 Grand Street Hartford, Connecticut 06106 (860) 293-1559 JENNIFER HORVATH American Civil Liberties Union of Wyoming PO Box 20706 1603 Capitol Avenue, Suite 510 Cheyenne, Wyoming 82003 (307) 637-4537 ATTORNEYS FOR PLAINTIFFS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF WYOMING JOSEPH MILLER, and HURIE PURDIMAN, JR. Plaintiffs, vs. MICHAEL MURPHY and, ROBERT LAMPERT, in their official and individual capacities, Defendants. Civ No. 08-CV-090B PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs Joseph Miller and Hurie Purdiman, Jr., are Muslim prisoners incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary (""WSP""). They file this motion in an effort to immediately halt further violations of rights guaranteed them by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (""RLUIPA""), 114 Stat. 804, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000cc. Defendant Michael Murphy is the Warden of WSP, and Defendant Robert Lampert is the Director of the Wyoming Department of Corrections (""WDOC""). These prison officials adopted, and their subordinates at WSP enforce, a policy known as the ""twenty-minute"" rule. This policy requires segregated prisoners to eat their meals within twenty minutes after delivery by guards. Food not eaten within twenty minutes will be confiscated and discarded. The ""twenty-minute"" rule substantially burdens Plaintiffs' religion in violation of RLUIPA on those occasions when meals are delivered during one of Plaintiffs' religious exercises, that is, during their prayers or their religious fasting. On those occasions, Plaintiffs are faced with a ""Hobson's choice"": either they must violate their religious beliefs by abruptly terminating their religious exercise and choose to eat, or they must follow their conscience and complete their religious exercise, but forfeit their meal. On these occasions, in other words, Plaintiffs must relinquish their food in order to follow their faith. Plaintiffs asked Warden Murphy in January 2008 to grant them an exemption from the ""twenty-minute"" rule when meals are delivered during a religious exercise, by allowing them extra time to eat their meals on those occasions. Warden Murphy denied that request, stating that ""[f]or years now"" the prison has maintained a policy that allows prisoners only ""twenty (20) minutes to eat their meals"" and no exceptions are allowed. See Letter of Warden Michael Murphy dated January 22, 2008 (attached as ""Exhibit 1."") For reasons explained below, Defendants' ""twenty-minute"" rule violates RLUIPA. Indeed, as the Supreme Court made clear in Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709 (2005), RLUIPA was intended to eradicate the very type of prison policy challenged here. See Cutter, 544 U.S. at 716-17 n.5 (noting that RLUIPA was enacted ""[t]o secure redress for inmates who encountered undue barriers to their religious observances,"" citing as one example of an undue barrier a policy of forcing inmates to choose between completing a religious exercise and eating). Before proceeding further, the Court should be aware of one additional set of facts. As just noted, Warden Murphy staunchly defended his ""twenty-minute"" rule as recently as January 22, 2008. As a result, the instant lawsuit was filed on April 3, 2008. After the complaint was filed, however, Plaintiffs learned that Warden Murphy had suddenly abandoned his ""twenty-minute"" rule ten days earlier, on March 24, 2008, when he issued Warden's Memorandum 7-2008, a copy of which is attached as ""Exhibit 2."" This new rule is precisely the type of exemption that Plaintiffs had requested in January. Rather than require prisoners engaging in a religious exercise to consume their meals within twenty minutes, the new rule permits such persons to retain their meals until the next meal is served (which, of course, will be hours later). Thus, Warden Murphy repealed the ""twenty-minute"" rule, replacing it with a very accommodating policy. The problem is--and the reason why Plaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief--many WSP employees continue to enforce the ""twenty-minute"" rule. On April 5, 2008, for instance, Correctional Officer Fuller confiscated meals served to Plaintiffs Miller and Purdiman. When Mr. Purdiman grieved the loss of his meal, Officer Fuller cited the ""twenty-minute"" rule as the reason. (A copy of Officer Fuller's response is attached as ""Exhibit 3."") Mr. Purdiman then asked his caseworker, Mr. Markum, if anything could be done to change the ""twentyminute"" rule Mr. Markum replied on April 7, 2008, stating that he is unable to change the rule. (A copy of Mr. Markum's statement is attached as ""Exhibit 4."") On April 24, 2008, a supervisory officer, Corporal Paulsing, enforced the ""twentyminute"" rule on a Jewish prisoner, David Jones.

Governor Ritter is sued in his official capacity only. dn-156955 JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. The Court has personal jurisdiction over Governor Ritter because he resides in this district, and venue is appropriate because Colo Rev Stat. <unk>16-7-301(4) is enforced in this district. 5. The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 2201(a). GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 6. In Rothgery v. Gillespie County, the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant’s right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution attaches at “a criminal defendant’s initial appearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction.” 554 U.S. 191, 213 (2008). 7. Rothgery held that “[o]nce attachment occurs, the accused at least is entitled to the presence of appointed counsel during any ‘critical stage’ of the postattachment proceedings.” Id. at 212. 8. In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 130 S Ct. 1473, 1486 (2010), the Supreme Court held “that the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.” 9. Under Colo Rev Stat. <unk>16-7-301(4), Colorado does not provide appointed counsel during a critical stage of postattachment proceedings against indigent defendants with a right to counsel. 10 Colo. Rev Stat. <unk>16-7-301(4) provides that, in “misdemeanors, petty offenses, or offenses under title 42, C.R.S. [traffic offenses],” an indigent defendant’s “application for dn-156955 appointment of counsel and the payment of the application fee shall be deferred until after the prosecuting attorney has spoken with the defendant as provided in this subsection (4).” 11. Subsection (4) requires the prosecuting attorney to “tell the defendant any offer that can be made based on the facts as known by the prosecuting attorney at that time.” Colo Rev Stat. <unk>16-7-301(4). 12. Subsection (4) provides that “[t]he defendant and the prosecuting attorney may engage in further plea discussions about the case, but the defendant is under no obligation to talk to the prosecuting attorney.” Id. 13. Subsection (4) further provides that “[t]he prosecuting attorney shall advise the defendant that the defendant has the right to retain counsel or seek appointment of counsel.” Id. 14. Indigent defendants whose applications for counsel are deferred under subsection (4) have already appeared before a judicial officer to learn the charges against them and the potential restrictions on their liberty. 15. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel thus has already attached for indigent defendants whose applications for counsel are deferred under subsection (4). 16. Indigent defendants subject to Colo Rev Stat. <unk>16-7-301(4) nonetheless cannot apply for appointed counsel until after plea discussions with the prosecuting attorney. 17. Plea discussions with the prosecuting attorney under Colo Rev Stat. <unk>16-7-301(4) are a critical stage of the proceedings against indigent defendants. 18 Colo.

Dixon, Jr., in his official capacity as Louisiana State Public Defender, Defendants. Complaint – Class Action CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs Darwin Yarls, Jr., Leroy Shaw, Jr., and Douglas Brown are each currently detained on separate felony accusations in the Orleans Parish Prison. The prosecution has not formally charged any of the Plaintiffs with a crime, either by information or indictment. 2. Plaintiffs cannot afford attorneys. They have requested and been approved for a public defender from the Orleans Parish Public Defender’s Office (“OPD”). 3. However, OPD has refused to accept Plaintiffs as clients due to budgetary shortages and excessive caseloads. OPD has instead placed Plaintiffs on a waiting list for appointed counsel. OPD’s refusal to represent Plaintiffs means that they must languish indefinitely in jail without counsel until OPD secures adequate resources to provide them with an attorney. 4. As long as OPD refuses to represent Plaintiffs, their prosecutions cannot proceed. Meanwhile, Plaintiffs have no access to an attorney for critical pretrial functions that would ordinarily be performed by defense counsel, such as conducting a preliminary examination to challenge their arrests and bail conditions; investigating the allegations; filing motions to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence; or negotiating with the prosecution. 5. The public defender’s budgetary crisis and its denial of counsel to Plaintiffs both result from the State of Louisiana’s chronic underfunding of its public defender system. While the legislature yearly appropriates funds for public defense, the public defender system overwhelmingly relies on locally generated fines and fees for revenue. 6. Under this scheme, approximately two-thirds of the state’s budget for public defenders comes from a $45 fee assessed primarily on traffic tickets. No other state in the nation is as dependent on local fines and fees to fund indigent defense.1 7. Louisiana’s structure dictates that the funding available to a public defender is inherently unreliable. Funding is captive to arbitrary factors like how many highways pass through a district, the degree to which local law enforcement prioritizes traffic enforcement, or the extent to which the district attorney relies on pretrial diversion. 8. As a result, public defenders have continually faced funding emergencies like the one in Orleans Parish. These crises have in turn forced offices into extreme measures like refusing clients. 9. Plaintiffs bring this class action under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated who have been or will be denied counsel indefinitely because OPD has refused to represent them. 10. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that OPD’s indefinite denial of counsel violates their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to counsel, as well as their Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and the equal protection of the laws. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 11. Plaintiffs’ claims arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States. This Court has jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331, 1343(a)(3). 12.

Judge: Case No: FILED 2013 Sep-12 PM 02:20 U.S. DISTRICT COURT N.D. OF ALABAMA COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. The Etowah County Sheriffs Office operates a program of unannounced, random and suspicionless compliance investigations of every individual in the county who is subject to the registration requirements of the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act. Essential to the Sheriffs Office's program is that officers search the home of each registrant. Officers must also question the registrant about his or her registration information. 2. The Sheriffs Office conducts this program without regard to such factors as whether an individual was convicted as an adult or adjudicated as a juvenile; whether the individual presents a substantial risk of reoffending; whether the individual is on probation or parole; or whether the individual is fully compliant with his or her registration requirements. Under the Sheriffs Office's program, officers have unfettered discretion as to how often and when they conduct these unannounced inspections, so long as the officers make personal contact with every registrant at least once per month. 3. Plaintiff James Doe is an Etowah County resident who, under the Act, is required to register as a juvenile. To do so, he must appear in person at the office of Etowah County Sheriffs' Office four times per year. Nonetheless, the Sheriffs Office has conducted at least nine separate inspections at James' home, where he resides with his parents, Plaintiffs John Doe and Jane Doe. Sheriffs' Office officers routinely search Plaintiffs' home without consent during these inspections. Officers also interrogate Plaintiffs about James' registration information. Defendants have threatened to arrest Plaintiffs if they fail to cooperate. 4. Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 to vindicate their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to not be deprived of liberty without due process of law. Plaintiffs seek a declaration from this Court affirming that their rights have been violated, a permanent injunction against future compliance inspections without suspicion, and damages from Defendants in their individual capacities to compensate Plaintiffs for their unlawful treatment. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343 because this is a civil action seeking redress for the deprivation of rights secured by the United States Constitution. 6. Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201 and 2202; Rules 57 and 65 ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and the general legal and equitable powers of this Court. 7. Venue is proper in the Northern District of Alabama pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b), because this is the judicial district where the Defendants are located or reside, and it is the judicial district where a substantial portion of the events and omissions giving rise to this action occurred. PARTIES 8. Plaintiff James Doe is a resident of Etowah County, Alabama. He resides there with his parents, John Doe and Jane Doe, and his two minor siblings. He is categorized as a ""juvenile sex offender"" under the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act (the ""Act"" or ""RCNA"") Ala. Code <unk>15-20A-4(12). Following sex offender treatment, a risk assessment, and a full hearing pursuant to Section 15-20A-26 of the Code, the Etowah County Circuit Court determined that James' risk of re-offending is low. Since April 2012, officers from the Etowah County Sheriffs Office have subjected James to random, suspicionless searches of his home without consent. The officers have also required James to submit to questioning about his registration status. 9. Plaintiff John Doe is a resident of Etowah County, Alabama. He is the father of Plaintiff James Doe. Since April 2012, officers from the Etowah County Sheriffs Office have entered his home on numerous occasions without his consent. On many of these occasions, they searched his home without his consent. At least one of the officers has threatened to arrest John if he does not allow officers to enter and search. 10. Plaintiff Jane Doe is a resident of Etowah County, Alabama. She is the mother of Plaintiff James Doe. Since April 2012, officers from the Etowah County Sheriffs Office have entered her home on numerous occasions without her consent. On many of those occasions, they searched her home without her consent. 11.

The suits were filed in response to the OPD's actions on April 7 at a peaceful antiwar demonstration at the Port of Oakland. The Police, without giving sufficient notice to disperse and without provocation, barraged demonstrators with a variety of ""less-lethal"" munitions, while blocking the main exit routes. Police pursued demonstrators and others present when they attempted to disperse, while continuing to fire at them and intentionally strike them with motorcycles. On August 11, 2003, the Court ordered that the cases be officially related and heard before the same judge. One of the two cases, Local 10 ILWU v. City of Oakland, was filed as a class-action on behalf of all persons who attended the April 7 demonstration. The suit also named as plaintiffs Local 10 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, plus nine of its members who were ""standing by"" in the vicinity of the demonstration but not active participants in it. The other suit, Coles v. City of Oakland, sought relieve for several individual demonstrators who were allegedly injured by the OPD. In both cases, Plaintiffs sought compensatory, exemplary, and punitive damages, as well as to recover legal costs. They also sought declaratory judgments holding the Defendants' actions to be unlawful violations of the Plaintiffs' rights under the Constitutions of the U.S. and of California and of statutory law. They sought injunctions that among other things would prohibit the Defendants from unlawfully interference with the constitutional and statutory rights of participants in public demonstrations and protests.

On December 24, 2004, the parties entered a court-approved partial settlement addressing the Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief to the extent that those claims related to the Defendants' crowd control policies. Oakland adopted a new official Crowd Control Policy that forbade the police from dispersing crowds that had not behaved illegally or that did not pose a clear and present danger of imminent violence. It also forbade the indiscriminate use of less-lethal weapons directly against crowds, even when specific individuals in the group were violent. The remaining issues eventually settled, with awards of damages and attorneys' fees well in excess of $1,000,000.","MICHAEL J.

Officer Uu and other officers beat plaintiff so viciously that they ruptured his splenic 12 vein, causing severe pain and internal bleeding. Rather than summoning medical attention 13 or taking plaintiff to the hospital, the Oakland Police officers proceeded to detain him at 14 various locations near City Hall for some hours, and then transferred him to the Alameda 15 County Jail, in further unlawful punishment for his First Amendment expression. Police 16 officers, jailers and jail medical personnel mocked and ignored his pleas for help. Plaintiff 17 was not taken to a hospital until approximately 18 hours after the beating.

Public trust is the bedrock of community policing. The allegations of 3 this Complaint speak to the very core of that foundation. This action stems from the 4 misclassification of hundreds, if not thousands of City of Los Angeles residents as 5 gang members by at least twenty-seven (27) Los Angeles Police Department 6 (hereinafter “LAPD”) officers, including Braxton Shaw, Michael Coblentz, and 7 Nicholas Martinez, who have been charged with fifty-nine (59) criminal counts. 2. Los Angeles Police Department officers routinely falsified field 9 interview (hereinafter “FI”) cards by classifying people who are not gang members, 10 as gang members or gang associates. LAPD and its officers further violated public 11 trust and numerous laws by entering false descriptions of innocent civilians as gang 12 members into an official state-wide database. In many instances LAPD officers 13 falsely stated in official records that the individuals had “self-admitted” gang 14 affiliation when no such admissions had occurred. This resulted in devastating 15 consequences to putative class members, almost all of whom were Black and Latino, 16 including imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights, and practical consequences such 17 as not being able to obtain a job, rent an apartment, or receive financial aid for 18 college. 3. As an example, class member, Sara Ochoa is a young Latina woman 20 who grew up in East Los Angeles and made it out of the low income neighborhood 21 to become a correctional officers of the State of California Ms. Ochoa served as a 22 public servant for the State of California up until she became a victim of LAPD 23 Officers on January 18, 2020 when Ms. Ochoa was misclassified as a “gang 24 associate” simply for going back to visit the neighborhood she grew up in. 25 Unfortunately, not only was Ms. Ochoa misclassified as a “gang associate,” Ms. 26 Ochoa was subjected to an unreasonable detention by being handcuffed on the street 27 in public display for approximately twenty (20) minutes while her vehicle and 28 belongings in her vehicle were ransacked by LAPD officers. 4. Another putative class member is Jajuan Johnson Mr. Johnson recently 2 graduated from high school in south Los Angeles. Notably, he scored sixty-two (62) 3 points in a varsity basketball game during his 2018 senior year. He is soft-spoken and 4 has no criminal record. On January 13, 2019, Johnson was a passenger in a car being 5 driven in Los Angeles when LAPD officers pulled over the vehicle, ostensibly for 6 tinted windows. Officers came up with a reason to search the car. LAPD officers then 7 blatantly lied in the police report they authored by contending that Mr. Johnson, a 8 college student, Jamba Juice employee and aspiring writer was a member of a Blood 9 street gang. The LAPD officers reasoned that because Mr. Johnson’s cousin was an 10 alleged gang member, he too must be gang affiliated. As a result, Mr. Johnson is 11 currently being prosecuted by the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office pursuant to a 12 fabricated gang allegation under Penal Code Section 186.22 Mr. Johnson 13 consistently denied any gang membership to no avail. Because of the LAPD’s false 14 claims against him, Mr. Johnson has suffered","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2019 | Los Angeles | City of L.A. | City Attorney's Office ||| Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) ||||| January 2020 ||| January 2021 ||| February 2021 | ||| March 2021 | May 2021 | June 2021 | July 2021 | August 2021 | September 2021 | October 2021 | November 2021 | December 2021 | April 2021 | March 2020 | April 2020 | May 2020 | June 2021, May 2021, July 2021, August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, November 2021, December 2021, April 2021, March 2020, and August 2021, plaintiffs filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in January 2019 against the City of Los Angeles, the City Attorney’s Office, and the LAPD.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of people came out to demonstrate in Denver and elsewhere in Colorado. 2. Although the protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, the Denver Police Department (“DPD”) and officers from other agencies in DPD’s mutual-aid network (collectively, “Defendant Officers”) used violent crowd control tactics against these peaceful protestors. Over the course of several days, the Defendant Officers deployed constitutionally unlawful crowd control tactics, including kettling, indiscriminate and unwarned launching of tear gas and flashbangs into crowds and at individuals, and shooting projectiles at protestors. These protestors included many young Black and Brown people. 3. Defendant Officers knowingly placed these protestors in physical danger through indiscriminate use of excessive force. 4. Not only did this excessive use of force injure many protestors, journalists, and bystanders, but it chilled individuals from exercising their First Amendment rights and suppressed speech. 5. Defendant Officers targeted journalists and others simply documenting their conduct. They targeted medics who were seeking to give aid to those harmed. 6. Although the protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, the DPD arrested over 350 people over the course of several days beginning on May 28, 2020, the first day of the protests in Denver. 7. For numerous days beginning on May 28, 2020, Defendants used methods of “less-lethal” force to discourage and suppress peaceful protest in public places (including streets, sidewalks, and parks) in Denver, particularly in the downtown area. 8. The actions of the Defendant Officers and the Defendant City infringed on the rights of protestors, journalists, and bystanders to be free from unreasonable seizures and use of force under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. 9. The purpose and effect of this excessive use of force was to prevent, deter, and suppress protestors from exercising their First Amendment right to exercise freedom of speech, peaceably assemble, and petition for redress of grievances. 10. In addition, the Defendant City imposed a citywide nighttime curfew from May 30 through June 4, 2020 and arrested protestors for violating this curfew. These actions violated protestors’ rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments. 11. Plaintiffs bring this action seeking to restrain the Defendant City of Denver and DPD from further violence and unconstitutional conduct, and seeking damages on behalf of themselves individually and others similarly situated to them.

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 1350 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Officer John Wright Metropolitan Police Department (Badge No. 2907), John Doe Officers 1–10, Defendants. Case No. 1:14-cv-1316 Jury Trial Demanded COMPLAINT 1. On October 27, 2012, officers from the Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”) held 71-year-old Ella Ann Lane outside of her hom e for m ore than six hours. The of ficers did not allow Ms. Lane, who had been watching televi sion alone when they arrived, to re-enter her own hom e. The eld erly Ms. Lane was unable to eat, ge t water, o r us e her b athroom until h er daughter returned from work, at which tim e Ms. Lane was able to go to McDonald’s to use the public restroom. 2 Ms. Lane, a retired grandm other, was not suspected of any wrongdoing, nor did the officers have any facts or evidence that any illegal activity had ever occurred in her home. 3. Instead, the officers sought to enter her home and to look through all of her m ost intimate possessions because they had found a firearm in a jacket belonging to an acquaintance of Ms. Lane’s grandson as that m an—whom Ms. Lane had never met—was sitting on the sidewalk steps below Ms. Lane’s yard and outsi de her fence. Based on their “training” and “experience” concerning the habits of “persons involved in illegal activities,” MP D officers asserted in a search warrant application that th ey believed they would fi nd evidence of crim inal activity in Ms. Lane’s home. 4. When MPD of ficers finally obtained a warra nt to search th e home, they om itted from the sworn warrant application presented to the Superior Court judge that two police officers had already illegally entered and searched Ms. Lane’s home without a warrant and found nothing unlawful. 5. Nothing illegal was ever found in the home. 6. Nonetheless, as detailed below, Ms. La ne was physically a bused and verbally threatened by the MPD officers, including one MPD officer who, after finding nothing illegal, told Ms. Lane that, if he was ev er called back to her house, he w ould make sure that she lost her home Ms. Lane had lived in the home for over 37 years. 7. Before MPD officers finally left her hom e that night, the officers deleted the photographic evidence that Ms. Lane had taken of th e officers’ pre-warrant illegal intrusion onto her property from her digital camera. 8. The egregious and unlawful actions of th e local governm ent agents in this case have become a frightening reality for many impoverished families of color in the Dis trict. What happened to Ms. Lane and her family raises serious questions about the systemic misconduct and recklessness of the Metropolitan Police Department and its agents in obt aining search warrants and executing home raids in the District of Columbia.1 Nature of the Action 9.

COMPLAINT (for injunctive relief and damages; violation of First Amendment rights, Fourth Amendment rights, and conspiracy to violate civil rights) This case is about the President and Attorney General of the United States ordering the use of violence against peaceful demonstrators who were speaking out against discriminatory police brutality targeted at Black people. Just after 8:00 pm on May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a forty-six-year-old father, son, brother, and African American man was accused of a non-violent offense and arrested by the Minneapolis police. In the process of his arrest, Mr. Floyd was handcuffed and fell to the pavement. Less than ten minutes after the police arrived, a police officer who participated in Mr. Floyd’s arrest placed his knee and the weight of his body on Mr. Floyd’s neck as Mr. Floyd lay on the ground. For eight minutes and forty-six seconds, the officer held his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck as Mr. Floyd pleaded for relief. Other officers held his legs or stood by and watched while he died. Among Mr. Floyd’s final words were “please, please, please, I can’t breathe.” These words are reminiscent of the words spoken by Eric Garner before he was killed by a New York City police officer in 2014, which have since become a tragic rallying cry for people seeking to address racial inequities and reform the American criminal justice system. These are some of the words that a group of peaceful demonstrators chanted on June 1, 2020, in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House in Washington, D.C. On June 1, 2020, a group of demonstrators, including Plaintiffs, gathered peacefully in Lafayette Square to protest the gross, systemic injustices perpetrated by law enforcement against Black people in the United States, exemplified by the recent brutal murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, a Black woman who was shot eight times and killed in March 2020 by three Louisville police officers who entered her home in the middle of the night without knocking. This was a continuation of protests in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere since Mr. Floyd’s killing. Without provocation, Defendants directed their agents in the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Park Police, D.C. National Guard, and U.S. Military Police to fire tear gas, pepper spray capsules, rubber bullets and flash bombs into the crowd to shatter the peaceful gathering, forcing demonstrators to flee the area. Many peaceful demonstrators were injured, some severely, by this unprovoked attack. Defendants had no legitimate basis to destroy the peaceable gathering.

Counsel, Jerome A. Siegan, Asst Corp. Counsel, Chicago, Ill., for defendants. MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER LYNCH, District Judge. This is a civil action brought under 42 U.S.C., Section 1983, by eighteen named individuals and fifteen named groups and/or organizations. The named plaintiffs also seek to bring the action in the name of all others similarly situated. The plaintiffs are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory damages as a result of alleged violations of their rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution as well as their rights under 18 U.S.C., Sections 2510-2520. The complaint amounts to a broad-based attack on allegedly unlawful intelligence gathering activities of the Intelligence Division of the Chicago, Illinois, Police Department. Plaintiffs allege that said activities are carried out under the auspices of a vague and overly broad mandate contained within a general order of the Chicago Police Department directing its Intelligence Division to gather intelligence on organizations and individuals who pose ""a threat to the security of the country, state or city."" It is alleged that as a result of the above mandate, the defendants have engaged in a continuing pattern and practice involving the following activities: (1) surveillance and intelligence-gathering on individuals and organizations engaged in lawful activities; (2) unlawful wire-tapping and other forms of electronic surveillance; (3) unlawful entry and seizure; (4) dissemination of derogatory information concerning plaintiffs; (5) summary punishment and harassment, and (6) infiltration of private meetings and political organizations by informers and provocateurs. These activities are said to have the effect of chilling, 117 harassing and disrupting plaintiffs' exercise of their First Amendment rights of speech *117 and association and violate other rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution and statutes. The defendants include the commanders of the security and staff sections of the Intelligence Division of the Chicago Police Department. They, along with other defendants referred to as Unknown Agents of The Chicago Police Department and two specifically named police officers, are said to be the agents directly involved in the allegedly illegal intelligence gathering activities. The remaining defendants include the direct superiors of the above defendants, including the superintendent of the Department, as well as the members of the Police Board of the City of Chicago and the Mayor of the city. The illegal activities are alleged to take place with the knowledge, consent and direction of these remaining defendants. The cause is now before this Court due to the submission by defendants of a motion to dismiss the complaint, pursuant to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The motion to dismiss contains three grounds: (1) that plaintiffs lack standing to sue for injunctive relief since the complaint does not present a justiciable controversy; (2) that the claims of certain plaintiffs for damages are barred by the applicable state statute of limitations; and (3) that the failure of three named plaintiffs to include factual allegations in support of their damage claims should lead to dismissal of these claims. I The defendants assert in the motion to dismiss that plaintiffs have no standing to seek injunctive relief because the plaintiffs have alleged no more than a subjective ""chill"" of their rights and that such allegations are insufficient to sustain the complaint because they do not present a justiciable controversy under the holding in Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 92 S.Ct. 2318, 33 L.Ed.2d 154 (1972). In Laird, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs' allegations that the mere existence of the Army system of surveillance of unlawful and peaceful civilian activity chilled the exercise of their First Amendment rights did not present a justiciable controversy in the absence of a showing of objective harm or a threatened future harm. The High Court indicated that the plaintiffs in Laird did not allege that the Army took any specific action against them but only alleged that they were subjected to a ""chilling"" effect on the exercise of their First Amendment rights merely by the existence of the intelligence gathering and distribution system. 408 U.S. at 3, 92 S.Ct. 2318. The Court also pointed out that the information that was gathered appeared to contain nothing more than information which might be gained through clippings from newspaper articles or attendance at public meetings. An examination of the complaint in the instant case reveals that the allegations contained therein differ greatly from those contained in the Laird case and that, consequently, the decision in Laird is inapposite to the instant suit. The plaintiffs in the case at bar have alleged that they were the specific objects of both overt and covert surveillance on the part of the defendants.

JUDGE GEI]<unk>LE AN 04C DOCKETE TRIAL D<unk>A<unk>DEDOCT 2004 COMPLAINT NOW COME Plaintiffs THOMAS DUNN, DENNY ROBINSON, and LEONARD KIMBLE, on behalf of themselves and a class of others similarly situated, through their attorneys Loevy Loevy, and for their complaint against Defendant CITY OF CHICAGO, state as follows: Introduction Io This is a class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C Section 1983 challenging the Chicago Police Department’s (""CPD"" or ""Department"") inhumane and unlawful system for detaining persons under the Department’s control. As is explained in detail below, the CPD has engaged, for decades, in a repeated pattern of detaining citizens incommunicado within its police departments, holding them for unconstitutional lengths of time and subjecting them to torture in order to accomplish unjust ends. Plaintiffs bring this case in order to finally put an end to this institutionalized system of police torture in Chicago. 3. The CPD’s detention system routinely violates several fundamental constitutional protections guaranteed to all Americans. One such protection is the right to prompt judicial review of the Department’s justification for detaining a citizen in the first place. This requirement serves to ensure that citizens are not arrested unless the police have a proper justification for interfering in their liberties and to prevent overreaching while the citizen is detained behind closed station house doors. 4. As explained below, however, the Department routinely flouts this requirement for prompt judicial review by keeping citizens seGreted inside its police departments while it attempts to develop grounds that would ""justify<unk>detaining them after the fact. Another stunning example concerns the failure to provide counsel for those being interrogated during these detentions. It is a bedrock principal of American criminal procedure that police may not interrogate a suspect in their custody if that suspect requests to have an attorney present, unless and until an attorney has been provided. Although this constitutional mandate is absolutely clear, the CPD literally maintains no policy or directive for obtaining a lawyer if a detainee requests one, leaving its officers no choice but to ignore the requests. This monumental failure by Department policymakers results in consistent violations of the Fifth Amendment during custodial interrogations of CPD detainees and communicates to CPD officers that they may violate the constitution in order to obtain a confession. The result is that numerous confessions obtained by the CPD in the course of such detentions have been subsequently proven to be false. In the meantime, the damage is done to those who have been coerced to confess and the true criminals have been left at large to strike again. Further, detentions under the CPD’s system often last many days during which the detainees’ basic human needs for food, sleep and access to sanitation and hygiene are ignored. Charles Gruber, a former president of the International Association of the Chiefs of Police who consults with the United States Department of Justice in its investigations of police forces, evaluated the unlawful detentions and the conditions of confinement complained of herein and concluded in an expert opinion as follows: In my 35 years of policing and visiting police departments around the country, I have not seen a more blatant failure to promptly process and humanely care for arrested individuals.... So outrageous is the conduct on the part of the Chicago Police Department in constructing unlawful, unconstitutional, and inhumane policies and practices for extended detentions that it manifests deliberate indifference. 9. Supervisors and policymakers at the highest level have known of these inhumane conditions and illegal detentions for many years but they shrink from changing this system because it is an entrenched means of doing business in the CPD. Jurisdiction and Venue i0. This Court has jurisdiction of the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1331. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b). Defendant, City of Chicago, is a municipality physically situated in this judicial district, and the evenZs giving rise to the claims in this case all occurred here. Interrogation Room Detentions: The Use of ’<unk>Soft"" Torture In Chicaqo’s Detective Divisions ii. Many persons who are detained by the CPD for extended periods are held in Detective Division interrogation rooms small, bare rooms, approximately ten feet in length and eight feet in widZh. 12. The rooms contain only a four foot by ten inch metal bench. There is no place to sleep or to relieve oneself and no access to running water. Because the rooms are wholly inadequate to meet the detainee’s basic needs, it is inhumane and cruel to hold a detainee in these rooms for extended periods of time. Illinois law recognizes this fact by placing an eight hour cap on detentions in such rooms. 13. The CPD, however, maintains no policies regarding the length of time a detainee may be held in these rooms.

404,PN-KY-0001,"[ENTITYCHAIN] George Floyd ||| six individuals | Kentucky ||| Louisville | Jefferson County ||| U.S. Constitution ||| October 12, 2020 [SUMMARY] This case arose out of the protests that took place nationally after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Plaintiffs were six individuals and one political group called the Kentucky Alliance Against Racial and Political Repression. They filed a class-action suit against the Louisville and Jefferson County Metro Government and the Louisville police. The complaint argued that police tactics used to quell the protests constituted violations of the U.S. Constitution as well as common law battery and assault.

Civil Action No. COMPLAINT AND JURY TRIAL DEMAND PRELIMINARY STATEMENT “[O]ur constitutional command of free speech and assembly is basic and fundamental and encompasses peaceful social protest, so important to the preservation of the freedoms treasured in a democratic society.” Cox v. State of La., 379 U.S. 559, 574 (1965). Rarely before has this principle been as readily apparent as it is today; following the senseless killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black individuals at the hands of police, protesters in all fifty states are demanding police accountability and reform. Rather than treating its peaceful protesters as important parts of the democratic process protected by the Constitution, the City of Louisville has chosen to forcibly silence them—often using military-type weapons and tactics that resemble those used by authoritarian regimes to stifle dissent. In the days following the death of George Floyd, who was killed by Minneapolis police officers on May 25, 2020, a key demand for protesters who took to the streets around the country was justice for Breonna Taylor, who was killed by Louisville police officers in her own home on March 13, 2020. Louisville police officers sought to quell these demonstrations through the sustained use of tear gas, flash bangs, pepper balls, and other forms of military-grade technology. This combat-style response led to yet another senseless death: on May 31, 2020, Louisville police and the National Guard fired eighteen live rounds at David McAtee, a local Black restaurant owner, killing him. Since then, countless peaceful protesters—including elected officials and local educators—have been shot, gassed, beaten, and arrested solely for making their voices heard. Louisville police officers also abused the city’s curfew order while it was in effect, employing force to arrest or disperse people hours before they were required by the curfew order to clear the streets. And to this day, both Louisville’s Mayor and Kentucky’s Governor have defended the police department’s conduct. Plaintiffs are a diverse group of individuals who have come together to exercise their rights to protest and demand change from their government. For that, Louisville police officers have subjected them to shocking and violent levels of force. Plaintiff Corbin Smith was tear gassed, beaten with batons, and forced to beg for his life while an officer kneeled on his neck. Plaintiff Stevie Schauer was shoved to the ground and violently beaten by officers who saw her recording their misconduct; friends who tried to help her were shot with pepper balls. Their experiences are just a few examples of the sustained violence that Louisville has unleashed on its citizens. Plaintiffs now bring this suit, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, to guarantee and protect their constitutional right to demand change from their government at this singular moment in history. PARTIES 1. Plaintiff Attica Scott is a citizen of the United States and currently resides in Kentucky. She currently serves in the Kentucky House of Representatives, representing the 41st District. 2. Plaintiff Corbin Smith currently resides in Indiana. 3.

Use of Force Ms. Ruth Carter Corporation Counsel City of Detroit 660 Woodward Avenue, Suite 1650 Detroit, MI 48226-3491 Re: Investigation of the Detroit Police Department Dear Ms. Carter: As you know, the Civil Rights Division and the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan are jointly conducting an investigation of the Detroit Police Department (DPD), pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. <unk>14141. We greatly appreciate the cooperation of the City of Detroit and the DPD thus far in this investigation. At the beginning of our investigation, you requested that we inform you as soon as possible if we identified any problems during the course of the investigation. Since the investigation began, we and our consultants have reviewed hundreds of pages of documents, and interviewed over one hundred DPD officers, including command-level and line officers. Based on this preliminary review, we have identified several areas of concern, which we set forth below, along with our recommendations for addressing these problems. Important aspects of our fact-gathering process have yet to be completed, most notably reviewing DPD incident reports and investigations provided by the City. Therefore, this letter is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather focuses on significant concerns we have identified and recommendations we can provide based on our review of the DPD's policies and procedures. The issues identified below focus on the following areas: use of force and use of force reporting, external complaints, internal investigations, supervisory oversight, discipline, and training. Please note that we may identify additional issues as our investigation progresses, and that the concerns discussed below do not relate to the components of our investigation that are focused on holding cell conditions and arrest and witness detention policies and practices. I. Use of force and use of force reporting A. Use of force DPD policy does not define ""use of force,"" nor adequately address when and in what manner the use of less-than-lethal force is permitted. In addition, DPD officers only have a limited array of force options available. The vast majority of DPD officers are permitted to use only two weapons: a firearm and chemical spray (officers on foot patrol and officers in the Tactical Services Section are permitted to carry a baton). This limited array of force options may lead to the use of excessive force in situations where chemical spray may be an inappropriate option, but the use of deadly force is not justified. We recommend that DPD policy define ""use of force,"" and ensure that the definition includes all physical (pain compliance, punches, kicks, leg sweeps, etc.) and instrumental (firearm, baton, chemical spray, flashlight, etc.) acts that impose any degree of force on a member of the public. DPD policy should adequately address when and in what manner the use of less-than-lethal force is permitted. The Detroit Police Dept. Use of Force DPD should train officers in these policies. We recommend that the DPD make at least one additional intermediate force option available to all officers, and train all officers in the use of this option. The additional intermediate force option should be one that can reasonably be carried by all officers at all times while on duty, be higher on the force continuum than chemical spray, and be lower on the force continuum than a firearm, e.g., a collapsible baton. B. Use of force reporting Pursuant to DPD policy, officers are not required to report uses of force other than uses of firearms and chemical spray, unless the use of force results in a visible injury or complaint of injury. Officers are required to report firearms and chemical spray discharges in a Preliminary Complaint Report (PCR). Some officers indicated that they would report a use of force pursuant to an arrest in the PCR in which they reported the arrest. For shots fired, chemical spray discharges, injuries to prisoners, police chases, and the destruction of animals, supervisors are required to complete a Police Action Incident Report (PAIR), on which they record information regarding the incident and their disciplinary or corrective action recommendation. Both the PCR and the PAIR are apparently incident-based, so that one PCR and one PAIR are sometimes used to report multiple uses of force if they occurred in the same incident. This may result in supervisors failing to evaluate the appropriateness of each individual use of force. Additionally, one PAIR is used to record all officers involved in an incident, and there is no requirement that the supervisor indicate which of the involved officers used force.

(""Fair Housing Act""); the United States Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1437, et seq:, the Constitution and laws of the State of New York; and the New York City Human Rights Law. 2. The Defendants, the City of New York (""City"") and the New York City Housing Authority (""NYCHA"") (collectively, ""Defendants""), operating through and in conjunction with the New York City Police Department (""NYPD""), have implemented and continue to conduct, enforce and sanction an unlawful vertical patrol and trespass arrest policy which has resulted in a pattern and practice of illegal stops, seizures, questioning, searches, and false airests of residents of, and authorized visitors to, NYCHA residences. 3. A vertical patrol is a top-to-bottom walk-through patrol or ""sweep"" of hallways, stairwells, rooftops and landings, elevators, and other common areas of a NYCHA residence. (NYPD Patrol Guide 212-59 and 212-60). Under the vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices, New York City Police Department officers conduct roving pedestrian checkpoints in and around NYCHA residences, wherein they indiscriminately stop and question every person they observe, without objective individualized suspicion of a crime, and unlawfully arrest individuals for trespass without probable cause. 4. In addition to organized and directed vertical patrols in NYCHA residences, some trespass arrests are the result of less formal sweeps. 5. As a result, the number of trespass arrests in NYCHA residences has increased dramatically in recent years, without any reasoned justification or correlative rise in criminal activity. Instead, people with a legitimate reason for being on NYCHA property are being unconstitutionally detained and/or arrested on a routine basis. 6. Defendants enforce the trespass laws in NYCHA residences in an unlawful manner, and without adequate training and controls, based on the race, ethnicity, and/or national origin of NYCHA residents and visitors. 7. Defendants implement and apply these policies, practices, and customs in an intentionally discriminatory and race-based manner by focusing the patrols and trespass arrest practices entirely on communities of color, such as NYCHA residences, where historically entrenched racial segregation ensures that African Americans and Latinos will bear the brunt of Defendants' unlawful actions. Defendants also discriminatorily acquiesce in, ratify, and fail to monitor or rectify NYPD officers' widespread unlawful practices because the victims are overwhelmingly African Americans and Latinos. 8. The rate of trespass stops, arrests, and enforcement in predominantly minority NYCHA residences is, on average, three times higher than surrounding areas with similar rates of crime. The decision to enforce trespass laws in this disproportionate way is not explained or justified by underlying crime levels in NYCHA residences. Moreover, where predominantly minority NYCHA residences are located in predominantly white or gentrifying neighborhoods, the disparities in trespass arrest rates increase even further. 9. The vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices do not affect only visitors who are stopped, seized, questioned, searched, and/or arrested; they also intimidate, threaten, and interfere with NYCHA residents' enjoyment of their homes on the basis of race, ethnicity, and/or national origin. In addition, Defendants' vertical patrol policy and trespass arrest practices interfere with the rights of NYCHA residents to freely associate","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) | City of New York | United States District Court | Southern District of the U.S.C. | New York, NY ||| June 2013 ||| July 2014 ||| August 2015 ||| September 2016 ||| October 2017 ||| November 2018 ||| March 2019 ||| January 2019 | ||| May 2019 | July 2019 | February 2019 | March 2019 [ENTITIESCHAIN], on behalf of a class of NYCHA residents, filed this class action lawsuit in the United States district court for the Southern district of the New York on June 23, 2013.

CIVIL ACTION NO. 21-cv-322 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. The People of the State of New York, by their Attorney General, Letitia James, bring this action to end the pervasive use of excessive force and false arrests by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) against New Yorkers in suppressing overwhelmingly peaceful protests. 2. Beginning in May 2020, thousands of New Yorkers participated in protests across New York City (“New York Residents”) to bring attention to police brutality against Black people, the police killings of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, police accountability, and racial injustice (the “2020 Racial Justice Protests” or “Protests”). These protests are ongoing. 3. From May 28, 2020 to December 11, 2020, NYPD Officers of various ranks (“NYPD Officers”) repeatedly and without justification used batons, fist strikes, pepper spray, and other physical force against New York Residents at the Protests. Protesters—many of whom were never charged with any crime and were merely exercising their First Amendment rights—suffered concussions, broken bones, cuts, bruises, and other physical injuries. 4. NYPD Officers also arrested legal observers, medics, and other workers performing essential services without probable cause and used a crowd-control tactic called “kettling” to corral and detain individuals who were peacefully protesting in order to impede constitutionallyprotected assemblies and to conduct mass arrests. 5. The unlawful policing practices Officers engaged in at these Protests are not new. Instead, they are the latest manifestation of the NYPD’s unconstitutional policing practices. For at least the last two decades, the NYPD has engaged in the same unlawful excessive force and false arrest practices while policing large-scale protests. This misconduct is widely documented in prior lawsuits, complaints, and reports. 6. Even though these practices were well-known before the 2020 Racial Justice Protests began, Defendants failed to train officers in policing protests to correct and prevent this misconduct—a failure that Defendants have now openly admitted following the release of public reports by the City’s Department of Investigation and Corporation Counsel about NYPD’s conduct during the Protests. 7. When Defendants, starting in May 2020, chose to dispatch thousands of inadequately trained officers to large-scale protests challenging police conduct and authority, the results were predictable: mass arrests, excessive force, and other unlawful efforts to suppress the Protests. 8. These practices, which violate New York Residents’ rights under the federal and state constitutions and state common law, have caused significant harm to New York Residents. While many aggrieved protesters have sought monetary relief to remedy their injuries, this suit seeks solely declaratory and injunctive relief—relief that is imperative to ending NYPD’s decadeslong, unlawful practices in policing protests.

This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and 1988, seeking redress for violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, parallel New York State constitutional provisions, and state common law. 10.

Warren, OH 44483-5747 Re: Warren Police Department Dear Gentlemen: As you know, in December 2004, the Civil Rights Division initiated an investigation of the City of Warren, Ohio Police Department (“WPD”), pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. <unk>14141 (“Section 14141”). We would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the cooperation we have received thus far from the City of Warren and the WPD. To date we have reviewed relevant WPD policies and procedures, and conducted interviews with City of Warren officials, WPD command staff, a cross-section of WPD line officers and supervisors, representatives of the Ohio Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association (“OPBA”) and the Fraternal Order of Police/Ohio Labor Council, Inc., community leaders, and other citizens. At the beginning of our investigation, we committed to providing the WPD with technical assistance to improve WPD practices and procedures and ensure compliance with constitutional rights. During our meetings with you and the WPD command staff in April and August 2005, we told you that we would provide in writing more specifics about recommendations our police practices experts had made orally. In this letter, we convey our recommendations regarding the WPD’s written policies. Important aspects of our fact-gathering process have yet to be completed. Therefore, this letter is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather focuses on significant recommendations we can provide at this preliminary stage of our investigation. Additionally, we hope this letter will assist in our mutual goal of ensuring that the WPD provides the best possible police service to the people of the City of Warren. We look forward to continued cooperation toward this goal. We would be happy to provide examples of policies used by other police departments that might address some of the issues we raise below. I. WPD POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. A. The WPD Should Revise and Update Its Policies and Procedures to Be Consistent and Comprehensive. Policies and procedures are the primary means by which police departments communicate their standards and expectations to their officers. Accordingly, it is essential that the WPD’s policies be comprehensive, comprehensible, up-to-date, and consistent with contemporary police practices. The WPD adopted its policy and procedure manual in 1979. While the WPD has added some policies over time, the manual has not been comprehensively updated since early 2002. As discussed in further detail below, a number of the WPD’s policies and procedures are inconsistent with accepted police practices and insufficiently detailed to provide the appropriate guidance for officer conduct. In general, we recommend that the WPD review all of its policies and procedures and, where necessary, revise them to reflect current accepted police practices and to provide sufficient detail to appropriately guide officer conduct. Although we do not provide line-by-line edits and recommendations for all of the WPD’s policies and procedures, we have endeavored to provide the WPD with general recommendations regarding accepted police practices for significant WPD policies and procedures. Although not exhaustive, the examples and references to WPD policies and procedures illuminate suggested areas for revision. We also recommend that the WPD distribute updated and complete policies and procedures to all officers and that all officers provide a written acknowledgment of their receipt, review and understanding of the policies and procedures. We suggest that the WPD designate an individual to be responsible for reviewing the manuals and any revisions or new policies to ensure consistency. This individual would also be responsible for ensuring that all officers receive copies of the manuals and revisions thereto, and for maintaining copies of officers’ signed acknowledgments. B. The WPD Must Ensure Compliance with Its Policies and Procedures. Our investigation has thus far revealed that many officers are not following WPD policies and procedures. The WPD must ensure that officers are complying with all policies and procedures as written. II. USE-OF-FORCE POLICIES. In the course of their duties, police officers are sometimes required to use deadly and non-deadly force. Because the use of force can place officers, civilians, and subjects at serious risk of harm, it is incumbent upon law enforcement agencies to ensure that officers use force appropriately. Use-of-force policies and procedures must clearly set forth the legal standards for the appropriate use of force. We recommend that the WPD revise its use-of-force policies to provide a comprehensive policy that contains the following elements: appropriate definitions, a use-of-force continuum with intermediate weapons, guidance on the appropriate level of force allowed in specific circumstances, detailed use-of","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] December 2004 | U.S. Department of Justice | City of Warren | Ohio | Ohio Police Department | Ohio Patrolmen's Benevolent Association | Ohio Labor Council | Ohio Civil Rights Act | Section 14141 of the Constitution | Ohio Law Enforcement Act of 1994 | Ohio State Patrolman's Association .<n>In December 2004, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio and the Ohio Police Officers' Association filed a joint motion to dismiss the case.

On May 25, 2020, the killing of George Floyd, who was being arrested for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes, by then Minneapolis Police Department Officer Derek Chauvin was live-streamed over the Internet for eight minutes and 46 seconds and later televised around the world. 2. Starting on May 28, 2020, in Columbus, Ohio, Plaintiffs, along with hundreds of thousands in cities, states, and countries, took to the streets to demonstrate against excessive use of force by police, saying the names of Black men and women who had recently been killed by police or vigilantes; chanting that “Black Lives Matter,” “No Justice, No Peace,” “I can’t breathe,” “Hands up, Don’t Shoot,” and “Whose Streets? Our Streets”; and expressing their outrage at the militarization of police forces, the disparate impact on minority communities of law enforcement priorities, and a pattern or practice of governments at all levels tolerating systemic racism and failing to adopt effective policies or implement adequate training, supervision, and discipline of law enforcement officers. 3. Plaintiffs and other demonstrators in Columbus comprised a multi-racial group, informally brought together by Black community leaders and activists primarily through the use of social media and dedicated to nonviolent protest, including civil disobedience of traffic, parade, and mass-gathering regulations, to generate urgent widespread public attention to the historic and continuing police violence directed overwhelmingly at communities and people of color condoned by mostly white police supervisors and administrators. 4. The goals of Plaintiffs and other demonstrators included engendering serious, effective, and immediate actions to bring a halt to the endemic racism infecting America’s law enforcement and justice systems and the general tolerance of excessive force routinely administered by police officers against arrestees, regardless of innocence or guilt, and especially against citizens who question an officer’s actions. 5. On May 28, 2020, Plaintiffs and other demonstrators in Columbus exercised their rights of assembly and expression by gathering downtown. 6. Defendants Sergeant and Officers were angered by the civil disobedience they observed, the message of the protests, and the criticisms and denunciation they heard. 7. Defendants Sergeant and Officers had received minimal and ineffective training from Defendants City and Chief and were subject to vague, ineffective, and rarely enforced policies regarding the need to handle protesters without using force or using the least amount of non-lethal force necessary. 8. Defendants Sergeant and Officers instead responded to the protests with excessive use of force, including pepper spraying, tear gassing, and assaulting with physical force and rubber bullets or wooden pellets, and flash-bang grenades against nonviolent protestors who were standing in the streets, from which vehicular traffic had already been blocked and eliminated by police, or on sidewalks, chanting, and holding signs and posing no threat of violence or property destruction, and typically without giving audible warnings to their targets. 9. Defendants Sergeant and Officers either criticized, often profanely, the protestors for their chants, signs, and civil disobedience or heard, without commenting, other Officers do so while using excessive force. 10. Defendants Sergeant and Officers purposely used excessive force to punish one or more Plaintiffs and other demonstrators, to deter them from continuing to protest and others from joining a protest with which they disagreed, and to reclaim the streets. 11. Defendants Sergeant and Officers maliciously prosecuted one or more Plaintiffs to punish them and deter other demonstrators from continuing to protest. 12. Just the month before, Defendants had exercised restraint when demonstrators, some of whom openly carried weapons and engaged in hate speech while violating statewide social-distancing and mask mandates, protested the COVID-19 lockdown at and around the Statehouse. 13. Despite the excessive use of force earlier on May 28, 2020, the overwhelming majority of the demonstrators remained nonviolent, fled from the toxic chemicals, and left, sought medical assistance, or tried to regroup at a safe distance. 14. After Defendants needlessly escalated and provoked protestors, there were","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] May 25, 2020 | Columbus, Ohio | City of Columbus | U.S. District Court | Southern District of Ohio ||| May 28, 2020 | Plaintiffs | Black community leaders and activists ||| Columbus Police Department ||| Ohio Department of Public Safety ||| March 31, 2021 ||| June 30, 2021 | Plaintiffs filed this suit in the United States District Court for the southern district of Ohio on May 25, 2020.

The plaintiffs, who were members of media and legal observers of the protests, argued that their First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the PPB's use of pepper spray and rubber bullets, among other weapons. They sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief. 

The court granted a TRO against the city, prohibiting the police from arresting or seizing the equipment of reporters or legal observers of the protests. The court later granted a preliminary injunction against the city.  

By July 16, President Trump had sent in federal officers from the DHS and USMS as reinforcement. The plaintiffs added those two organizations as defendants and filed a motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction. 

The motion for temporary restraining order and the motion for preliminary injunction were both granted. These decisions were appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has yet to rule on them. However, on October 9, the Ninth Circut declined to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The federal defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which remains pending.

This case seeks to stop the Portland police1 from assaulting news reporters, photographers, legal observers, and other neutrals who are documenting the police’s violent response to protests over the murder of George Floyd. The police’s efforts to intimidate the press and suppress reporting on the police’s own misconduct offends fundamental constitutional protections and strikes at the core of our democracy. 2. Plaintiffs are members of the media and legal observers, who have a right to witness important public events and recount them to the world. Plaintiffs Tuck Woodstock, Mathieu Lewis-Rolland, Sam Gehrke, and John Rudoff are journalists whom the Portland police attacked with flash-bang grenades, rubber bullets, and tear gas merely for seeking to cover the protests. Plaintiffs Kat Mahoney and Doug Brown are neutral legal observers whom the Portland police assaulted with batons, rubber bullets, and tear gas simply for watching how they were treating demonstrators. Plaintiff Class is comprised of all journalists who have or will be attacked or forcefully dispersed by Defendants pursuant to their unlawful policy of targeting and dispersing neutrals. 3. The police retaliation against Plaintiffs is part of a broader pattern of the Portland police repeatedly and intentionally shooting, gassing, and beating journalists and observers covering the George Floyd demonstrations. 4. On June 3, the police physically assaulted KBOO reporter Cory Elia, even though he identified himself as press, because he was recording them.

Plaintiff Ebony Davis was arrested by Philadelphia police officers who erroneously claimed that he owed outstanding fines and costs in connection with alleged violations of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code. The officers failed to consider available information which demonstrated that Plaintiff Davis was not the individual who had committed the alleged Motor Vehicle Code violations. Despite the absence of probable cause to arrest, Plaintiff was detained, searched, handcuffed and transported to Philadelphia Traffic Court. After a Traffic Court proceeding at which he was not afforded counsel, notice of the specific charges against him, the opportunity to prepare a defense, to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, and to present evidence on his own behalf, Plaintiff was sentenced to a period of incarceration in the Philadelphia County Prison System. Plaintiff, who is indigent, was forced to remain in custody for nearly one month because he was unable to remit a portion of the outstanding fines and costs to secure his release, a right granted only to those with the means to make substantial monetary payments. 2.

In two separate but related civil rights actions, certain individuals and groups, acting on behalf of minority citizens and residents of Philadelphia, seek various forms of relief against the Mayor and police officials of the City, on the basis of alleged widespread violations of the constitutional rights of minority citizens by the police of the City of Philadelphia. From a procedural standpoint, the record in these cases is somewhat anomalous: plaintiffs and their respective counsel are different in the two cases, and have proceeded independently. However, both groups of plaintiffs purport to act on behalf of essentially the same class of plaintiffs. Although the specific relief sought in each case is different, both sets of plaintiffs urge that a pattern of unconstitutional behavior on the part of the police is shown by their evidence of numerous specific instances of such alleged misconduct; each group relies upon a different set of specific instances as examples alleged to establish the pattern. Since I have heard all of the evidence in both cases, it would be difficult, and in my opinion improper, in view of the nature of the claims, to dispose of each case separately, based upon its own limited record. The defendants in both cases are essentially the same, and are represented by the same counsel in both cases. 1291*1291 This Court's disposition of these cases has already been delayed too long. Much of this delay is squarely the responsibility of the Court, and is attributable to other pressing demands of its case load. In partial justification for this unfortunate delay, it may be noted that the records of the two cases are extremely complex, the issues involved are subtle and somewhat novel, and the required decisions touch upon sensitive and emotion-filled aspects of community life. Another factor requires mention. During the pendency of these two actions before the undersigned, a third case filed by different plaintiffs on behalf of the same class of plaintiffs, seeking similar relief, was pending before another member of this Court. That case, which was instituted after the Goode case but before the COPPAR case, eventuated in a consent decree granting injunctive relief, dated December 18, 1972. The defendants in all three cases are essentially the same, and all have been represented throughout by the City Solicitor's office. Nevertheless, at no time have defense counsel meaningfully addressed themselves to the class action issues involved, nor to questions of res judicata or collateral estoppel which may be involved. A brief summary of the issues in all three cases will provide a starting point for analysis: In the Goode case, Civil Action No. 70-491, plaintiffs contend that certain police officers of the City of Philadelphia are biased against Negroes and other minority groups, and habitually violate their legal and constitutional rights in the course of carrying out their police duties; that the proclivities of these officers are well known to their superiors in the Department; that the persons in control of the supervision of the Police Department, by failing to take appropriate disciplinary action, have condoned these illegal and unconstitutional activities, as a matter of policy. Plaintiffs further contend that there is no adequate machinery for dealing with civilian complaints against the police, and that departmental resistance to the creation or implementation of adequate complaint procedures justifies the conclusion that it is the policy of the Department to condone racially discriminatory actions by the police. Plaintiffs seek two kinds of relief in this action: removal or other appropriate disciplinary action in the cases of certain named policemen; and establishment of appropriate machinery to deal with civilian complaints against police. The COPPAR plaintiffs (Civil Action No. 70-2430) allege widespread and systematic violations of the constitutional rights of Negroes and other citizens by the police in the routine performance of their duties, with the express or tacit approval of their superiors. Plaintiffs ask the Court to appoint a ""receiver"" or similar official to supervise the Police Department (presumably, sweeping injunctive relief, and the appointment of a master to supervise enforcement of the",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] 1976 | Philadelphia | City of Philadelphia | Philadelphia Police Department | Philadelphia Mayor | City Solicitor | Philadelphia City Council | Philadelphia District Court | U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania ||| 1976 ||| 1983 ||| 1984 ||| 1985 ||| 1987 ||| 1988 ||| 1992 ||| 1993 ||| 1994 ||| 1997 ||| 1998 ||| 1999 ||| 2004 ||| 2006 ||| 2007 ||| 2008 ||| 2009 ||| 2010 ||| 2012 ||| 2013 ||| 2014 ||| 2015 ||| 2016 ||| 2017 ||| 2018 ||| 2019 ||| 2020 |</s>

We would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the cooperation and documents that we have received thus far from the Virgin Islands and the VIPD. However, as you know, we have made repeated requests for and are still awaiting receipt of a number of documents, such as outstanding prosecutorial opinions and investigative files. We would greatly appreciate production of these items as soon as possible in order to complete our investigation. To date, we have reviewed relevant VIPD policies and procedures and conducted interviews with Virgin Islands officials, VIPD command staff, a cross-section of VIPD supervisors and VIPD police officers. At the beginning of our investigation, we committed to providing the Virgin Islands with technical assistance to improve VIPD’s practices and procedures and ensure compliance with constitutional rights. During our meetings with you and the VIPD command staff in April, July and August 2004, we told you that we would provide in writing more specifics about recommendations our police practices experts had made orally. In this letter, we convey our recommendations regarding the VIPD’s written policies. Important aspects of our fact-gathering process have yet to be completed, most notably reviewing documents related to specific incidents of VIPD officers’ uses of force. Therefore, this letter is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather focuses on significant recommendations we can provide at this preliminary stage of our investigation. We hope this letter will assist in our mutual goal of ensuring that the VIPD provides the best possible police service to the people of the Virgin Islands. We look forward to continued cooperation toward this goal. We would be happy to provide examples of policies used by other police departments that might address some of the issues we raise below. I. VIPD POLICIES AND PROCEDURES The VIPD should revise and update its policies and procedures to be consistent and comprehensive. Policies and procedures are the primary means by which police departments communicate their standards and expectations to their officers. Accordingly, it is essential that the VIPD’s policies be comprehensive, comprehensible, up-to-date and consistent with relevant legal standards and contemporary police practices. It is our understanding that the VIPD’s policies and procedures are contained throughout various documents, including a police manual, a field manual, general orders and standard operating procedures. The official police and field manuals were adopted twenty years ago in 1985. Although some policies and procedures have been revised and updated through the issuance of general orders and standard operating procedures, the majority of the VIPD’s policies and procedures remain outdated. Moreover, the field and police manuals do not consistently incorporate subsequent changes. Significant VIPD policies, such as those relating to the use of force, use of firearms and investigations are not organized by subject matter in one document, but instead are spread throughout different documents. As we discuss in detail below, several VIPD policies and procedures are inconsistent with generally accepted police practices and are insufficiently detailed to provide the appropriate guidance for officer conduct. VIPD policies and procedures should apply uniformly and consistently to all Virgin Islands police officers, whether they are located on St. Croix, St. Thomas or St John. We understand that several VIPD policies and procedures vary from island to island. For example, the Standard Operating Procedure (“SOP”) for the Internal Affairs Units (“IAU”) for St. Croix and St. Thomas/St. John are different.1 We understand that even officer uniforms vary for each island. It is important for a police department, even one with particular geographical boundaries such as the Virgin Islands, to have consistent policies, procedures and practices. We recommend that the VIPD’s policies and procedures be consolidated into one document for all three islands. Although we do not provide line-by-line edits and recommendations for all of the VIPD’s policies and procedures, we have endeavored to provide the VIPD with general recommendations regarding generally accepted police practices for significant VIPD policies and procedures (i.e., use of force, citizen complaints, investigations, discipline, supervisory oversight and training). We recommend that updated and complete policies and procedures be distributed to all officers, and all officers should provide","<pad>In March 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division initiated an investigation of the Virgin Islands Police Department (VIPD) pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCE).

SUMMARY OF CLAIMS Defendants have promulgated and imposed new use of force (UF) policies and practices in reckless and deliberate indifference to the protections afforded Plaintiffs by the I Constitution: (1) The UF policies and practices unreasonably restrict and burden Plaintiffs' 1 right to use force reasonably required, to protect themselves and others, from apparent harm and danger, in violation of the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. (2) The new UF policies and practices require without appropriate 5 consideration of an officer's knowledge, training, experience, or the apparent danger of the 6 circumstances confronting him or her that Plaintiffs use significantly less force than is being 7 threatened against them by suspects. This includes, for example, prohibiting Plaintiffs from using reasonable and effective force tools or techniques against vaguely defined, newly protected classes of suspects unless deadly force is the only other option. This significantly 11 increases the likelihood that such persons will get killed or seriously injured in encounters 12 with the police a terrible result and a violation of those suspects' rights as well as a clear 13 violation of constitutional protections afforded Plaintiffs to reasonably protect themselves and others from threats of harm. (3) In the balancing of interests required by the Fourth Amendment, Plaintiffs' right not to be required to take unnecessary risks with their personal 17 safety in the performance of their duties are consistently violated, by the UF policies and 18 practices, in favor of suspects' alleged rights in situations where suspects appear to be or are engaged in threatening and dangerous conduct. (4) The UF policies and practices work to undermine and destroy the longstanding totality-of-the-circumstances standard for making, analyzing, and reviewing officers' reasonable UF decisions by undermining, at each step, the 23 integrity of officers' judgments as a whole. (5) The Court requires UF standards to be 24 simple, practical and useful to the officer doing his or her job. The new UF Policy clearly is 25 not. In some places it is overly complicated and contradictory, in other places overly precise and mechanical, but throughout, requires Plaintiff to engage in mental gymnastics wholly unreasonable in light of the dangerous and fast evolving cifcumstances we face every day. 1 This creates unnecessary and, therefore, unconstitutional risks to Plaintiffs' safety. (6) The UF policies and practices require Plaintiffs to under-react to threats of hann until we have no choice but to overreact. This makes it inevitable although unnecessary and unreasonable 5 that officers and citizens will get killed or seriously injured. Moreover, the policies and 6 practices are designed to trap Plaintiffs into violations even where Plaintiffs did, or could 7 have, acted in a completely reasonable and justifiable manner under the law. This places unconstitutional risks and burdens on Plaintiffs' lives and livelihood and necessarily subjects them to the very second-guessing prohibited by the Constitution. (7) The UF policies and 11 procedures attempt to fundamentally alter longstanding principles and standards governing 12 acceptable and lawful police conduct, thus significantly altering the terms and conditions of Plaintiffs' employment, including potentially interfering with Plaintiffs' rights to qualified immunity for their reasonable uses of force, without Plaintiffs having had any meaningful 16 opportunity to participate and be heard in the process.

STEVE SISOLAK, in his official capacity as Governor of Nevada; AARON FORD, in his 23 official capacity as Attorney General of Nevada; FRANK HUNEWILL, in his official capacity as Sheriff of Lyon County, Case No.: VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Defendants. INTRODUCTION 1. This action challenges Governor Steve Sisolak’s emergency orders 3 prohibiting churches and other places of worship from holding in-person worship 4 services of ten or more people, even when such services could be held in accordance 5 with social distancing and public health guidelines (the “Church Gathering Ban”). 2. For over two months, Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley (the “Church”) 7 has been unable to hold an in-person worship service due to Covid-19 and the 8 Governor’s Church Gathering Ban. The Church has patiently waited for the 9 Governor to restore its First Amendment freedoms, trusting that the Governor 10 would prioritize constitutional rights and allow churches to resume in-person 11 worship services at the earliest opportunity. 3. But that trust has been broken. Instead of prioritizing religious 13 freedom, the Governor has moved “non-essential” secular businesses and activities 14 to the front of the line and pushed churches towards the back. Incredibly, the 15 Governor has allowed restaurants and food establishments to resume in-person, on- 16 site dining at 50% capacity, allowed all retail establishments to open at 50% 17 capacity, and has thrown open the doors of nail care salons, hair salons, and barber 18 shops—businesses that the Governor’s own orders say “promote extended periods of 19 public interaction where the risk of [Covid-19] transmission is high.” In addition, 20 there are numerous other exceptions to the Governor’s gathering restrictions. 4. Yet the Governor insists on maintaining the Church Gathering Ban, 22 refusing to allow churches and places of worship to open their doors to ten or more 23 people under any circumstance. 5. Regardless of the justifications the Governor may think he has for this 25 disparate treatment, they cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. Under the Free 26 Exercise Clause, a law is not generally applicable when it “fail[s] to prohibit 27 nonreligious conduct that endangers” the government’s interest “in a similar or 1 greater degree” than the prohibited religious conduct. Church of the Lukumi Babalu 2 Aye, Inc v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 542 (1993). That is exactly what the 3 exemptions under the Governor’s orders do. 6. Indeed, under the Governor’s orders, large numbers of people in Clark 5 County can gather for a similar amount of time as a church service at restaurants, 6 food establishments, non-essential retail establishments, nail salons, hair salons, 7 and barber shops, but it is illegal for the Church—which is located in rural Lyon 8 County—to hold in-person services with ten or more people. 7. This is unconstitutional, and it makes no sense. As of May 20, 2020, 10 Carson City Health and Human Services reports that Lyon County has only 16 11 active cases of Covid-19. See Lyon County Covid-19 Data, attached as Exhibit 1. 12 With a population of approximately 57,510, that means the per capita rate of active 13 Covid-19 infections in Lyon County is approximately 0.028%. 8. Consistent with its religious beliefs, the Church plans to resume in- 15 person worship services on Sunday, May 31, and has developed comprehensive 16 social distancing and health and safety protocols to govern those services. Despite 17 these health and safety measures, however, the Governor’s Church Gathering Ban 18 threatens the Church with criminal and civil penalties. 9. Without a temporary restraining order and injunction, the Church will 20 face criminal and civil penalties for assembling and worshipping God. A temporary 21 restraining order and injunction are therefore needed to preserve the Church’s 22 constitutional rights. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 10.

DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States; SEAN M. SPICER, White House Press Secretary; and DANIEL SCAVINO, White House Director of Social Media and Assistant to the President, Defendants. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Introduction 1. President Trump’s Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, has become an important source of news and information about the government, and an important public forum for speech by, to, and about the President. In an effort to suppress dissent in this forum, Defendants have excluded—“blocked”—Twitter users who have criticized the President or his policies. This practice is unconstitutional, and this suit seeks to end it. 2. As the Supreme Court recognized just a few weeks ago, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter provide “perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard.” Packingham v. North Carolina, slip op. at 8, 582 U.S. (2017). These platforms have been “revolution[ary],” not least because they have transformed civic engagement by allowing elected officials to communicate instantaneously and directly with their constituents. “Governors in all 50 States and almost every Member of Congress have set up [Twitter] accounts for this purpose,” id. at 5, allowing citizens to “petition their elected representatives and otherwise engage with them in a direct manner,” id. at 8. Twitter enables ordinary citizens to speak directly to public officials and to listen to and debate others about public issues, in much the same way they could if they were gathered on a sidewalk or in a public park, or at a city council meeting or town hall. 3. Because of the way the President and his aides use the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account, the account is a public forum under the First Amendment. Defendants have made the account accessible to all, taking advantage of Twitter’s interactive platform to directly engage the President’s 33 million followers. The President’s tweets routinely generate tens of thousands of comments in the vibrant discussion forums associated with each of the President’s tweets. Further, Defendants have promoted the President’s Twitter account as a key channel for official communication. Defendants use the account to make formal announcements, defend the President’s official actions, report on meetings with foreign leaders, and promote the administration’s positions on health care, immigration, foreign affairs, and other matters. The President’s advisors have stated that tweets from @realDonaldTrump are “official statements,” and they have been treated as such by politicians, world leaders, the National Archive and Records Administration, and federal courts. 4. Plaintiffs include individuals from across the country who have been blocked from the @realDonaldTrump account because of opinions they expressed in replies to the President’s tweets. Because of their criticism of the President, these Plaintiffs have been prevented or impeded from viewing the President’s tweets, from replying to the tweets, from viewing the discussions associated with the tweets, and from participating in those discussions. Defendants’ actions violate the First Amendment rights of these individual Plaintiffs as well as those of other Twitter users, like Plaintiff Knight First Amendment Institute, that follow the @realDonaldTrump account and are now deprived of their right to read the speech of the dissenters who have been blocked. 5. Plaintiffs respectfully ask that the Court declare that the viewpoint-based exclusion of the individual Plaintiffs violates the First Amendment, and order the Defendants to restore their access. Jurisdiction and Venue 6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201–2202. 7. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b)(2) and (e)(1). A substantial part of the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this District, and each Defendant is an officer of the United States sued in his official capacity. Parties 8.

The complaint alleged that the Congressional subpoenas were issued to harass the President and lacked a legitimate legislative purpose.  The case was eventually consolidated with <i>Trump v. Mazars, LLP</i>, which was heard by the Supreme Court in July 2020 and later remanded for further proceedings.  ","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DONALD J. TRUMP, DONALD J. TRUMP JR., ERIC TRUMP, IVANKA TRUMP, and THE DONALD J. TRUMP REVOCABLE TRUST, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, INC., TRUMP ORGANZATION LLC, DJT HOLDINGS LLC, DJT HOLDINGS MANAGING MEMBER LLC, TRUMP ACQUISITION LLC, and TRUMP ACQUISITION, CORP., Docket No. COMPLAINT Plaintiffs, against DEUTSCHE BANK AG and CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORP., Defendants. Plaintiffs, by their attorneys Consovoy McCarthy Park PLLC and Mukasey Frenchman Sklaroff LLP, bring this complaint against Defendants and allege as follows: A. INTRODUCTION 1. This case involves Congressional subpoenas that have no legitimate or lawful purpose. The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family, and to ferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage. No grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one. 2. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Financial Services Committee issued the subpoenas to Defendants Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp. These two financial institutions have long provided business and personal banking services to Plaintiffs. 3. The Chairpersons of the Intelligence and Financial Services Committees (Adam B. Schiff and Maxine M. Waters) have confirmed the issuance of the subpoenas, making public statements to the media that emphasize their intention to probe every aspect of the private lives of the Trump family, their businesses, and even those with only the most tangential connection to Trump entities, regardless whether any evidence (credible or otherwise) exists to support such intrusive probes. The Committees have refused to provide copies of the subpoenas to Plaintiffs—preventing them from even knowing, let alone negotiating, the subpoenas’ scope or breadth. 4. Nonetheless, Defendants’ descriptions of the subpoenas confirm their remarkable overbreadth. According to Defendants, the Committees are seeking all banking and financial records not just concerning the individual Plaintiffs, but also their own family members. This means the subpoenas request documents about accounts of the Plaintiffs’ children (and in some cases, grandchildren). 5. The subpoenas to the entities are equally intrusive and overbroad. They seek not only the Plaintiffs’ documents, but also the financial records of their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, branches, divisions, partnerships, properties, groups, special purpose entities, joint ventures, predecessors and successors. As if that were not broad enough, the subpoenas extend further to documents concerning each of the entities’ current or former employees, officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, consultants, managers, senior associates, staff employees, independent contractors, agents, attorneys, or other representatives. 6. For most of the documents, the Committees demand records from the last ten years. For others, the request is unbounded—meaning the Committees seek records dating back decades, to the individual Plaintiffs’ own childhoods. 7. The intrusiveness and impropriety of these requests are obvious. The House of Representatives is demanding, among other things, records of every single checking withdrawal, credit-card swipe, or debit-card purchase—no matter how trivial or small—made by each and every member of the Trump family. But the dates and times when these individuals purchased books, groceries and other personal items is not the business of the House of Representatives or anyone else. It is an abuse of power to claim otherwise (particularly since the Committees declined to ask Plaintiffs themselves for the records, or even to discuss the scope of their requests). 8. In an effort to justify their demands, the chairs of the Committees have claimed that the subpoenas are intended to investigate “potential foreign influence on the U.S. political process” or the use of the financial system for “illicit purposes.” But the information they seek long predates the President’s election to office, reaches well beyond transactions associated with foreign parties, and encompasses reams of account records for entities, individuals, children, and spouses who have never even been implicated in any probe. 9. The Committees have ignored the constitutional limits on Congress’ power to investigate. Article I of the Constitution does not contain an “Investigations Clause” or an “Oversight Clause.” It gives Congress the power to enact certain legislation. Accordingly, investigations are legitimate only insofar as they further some legitimate legislative purpose. No investigation can be an end in itself. And Congress cannot use investigations to exercise powers that the Constitution assigns to the executive or judicial branch. 10. The subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One lack any legitimate legislative purpose. There is no possible legislation at the end of this tunnel; indeed, the Committee Chairs have not claimed otherwise. With these subpoenas, the Committees are instead assuming the powers of the Department of Justice, investigating (dubious and partisan) rumors of illegal conduct by private individuals, many of whom are outside",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] October 2018 | House of Representatives ||| Deutsche Bank AG ||| Capital One Financial Corp. ||| May 2019 ||| March 2020 ||| June 2020 | ||| August 2018 ||| July 2020 | August 2020 | May 2021 ||| September 2020 | June 2021 | August 2021 | May 2020 | July 2020</s>

After the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, they appealed to the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted the injunction in part to block the enforcement of the executive order's attendance caps pending the outcome of the appeal in the Second Circuit. The case is ongoing. ","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK AGUDATH ISRAEL OF AMERICA, AGUDATH ISRAEL OF KEW GARDEN HILLS, AGUDATH ISRAEL OF MADISON, AGUDATH ISRAEL OF BAYSWATER, RABBI YISROEL REISMAN, RABBI MENACHEM FEIFER, and STEVEN SAPHIRSTEIN, Plaintiffs, Civil Action No._1_:2_0_-_c_v_-4_8_3_4___ vs ANDREW M. CUOMO, Governor of the State of New York, in his official capacity, Defendant. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Plaintiffs, by and through their undersigned counsel Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP, respectfully allege as follows: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT Orthodox Jews celebrate three holidays on October 9, 10, and 11, respectively. These holidays each have special prayers and rituals that are incorporated into worship services. Orthodox Jews will gather at their synagogues for collective prayer, Torah readings, remembrances of deceased loved ones, and other rituals in observance of Hoshanah Rabbah, Shmini Atzeres, and Simchas Torah. Forty-eight hours before the onset of these holidays, Defendant Governor Cuomo issued an Executive Order that singles out and discriminates against all houses of worship—and synagogues in particular—by imposing occupancy and gathering restrictions that make it impossible for Orthodox Jews to comply with both their religious obligations and the Order. In doing so, Defendant explicitly targeted the Orthodox Jewish community, declaring that if the “orthodox community” does not agree with his rules “the state will take action.” See Professor Josh Blackman, New York Governor Cuomo: “I’m Going to Say to the Orthodox Community Tomorrow If You Don’t Agree Then We Will Have to Close Down Your Religious Institutions,” The Volokh Conspiracy (Oct. 6, 2020) https://reason.com/ 2020/10/06/new-york-governor-cuomo-im-going-to-say-to-the-orthodox-community-tomorrow- if-you-dont-agree-then-we-will-have-to-close-down-your-religious-institutions/. Defendant’s Executive Order and the restrictions it contains will disrupt the religious observance of tens of thousands of Orthodox Jews in New York State, depriving them of their religious worship and holiday observance. The Executive Order requires enforcement of its restrictions to begin on Friday, October 9, which is Hoshanah Rabbah, the first of these three holidays. Defendant has imposed these onerous and discriminatory new restrictions despite the fact that even he concedes he has not enforced the existing restrictions on houses of worship that already impose capacity limits and health requirements. Plaintiffs have completely complied with these rules, and Defendant does not contend otherwise. Defendant’s Executive Order violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment in two separate ways, both independently sufficient to justify the temporary restraining order and all other equitable relief that they are requesting. First, Defendant’s restrictions are facially discriminatory toward religious practices when compared to similar secular activities. Second, Defendant’s explicit targeting of religious institutions and communities for these restrictions is a punitive attempt to infringe upon Plaintiffs’ religious services because of their religious nature. 10. Plaintiffs will suffer imminent, irreparable harm because of Defendant’s actions. By depriving Plaintiffs and their congregants of the critical religious worship and practices associated with these upcoming holidays, Defendant has trampled on their constitutional right to the Free Exercise of Religion, an injury that cannot be remedied with a later money judgment. 11. This action therefore seeks immediate judicial relief from Defendant’s discriminatory restrictions by way of a temporary restraining order, followed by a preliminary and permanent injunction and a declaratory judgment that the Executive Order is unconstitutional and void because it deprives Plaintiffs of their constitutional rights. PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE 12. Plaintiff Agudath Israel of America, founded in 1922, is a national grassroots Orthodox Jewish organization. Among its other functions and activities, Agudath Israel articulates and advances the position of the Orthodox Jewish community on a broad range of legal issues affecting religious rights and liberties in the United States. Agudath Israel regularly intervenes at all levels of government to advocate and protect the interests of the Orthodox Jewish community in the United States in particular and religious liberty in general. Agudath Israel has a large number of Agudath-Israel affiliated synagogues throughout the country, with close to 70 in New York State, and advocates for synagogues whenever their rights are threatened. Agudath Israel of America’s principal place of business is located at 42 Broadway, 14th Floor, New York, NY 13. Plaintiff Agudath Israel of Kew Garden Hills is an Orthodox Jewish Synagogue located at 14737 70th Rd., Flushing, NY 11367. 14.

On March 4, 2019, HHS published a Final Rule, scheduled to go into effect on May 3, 2019, which would alter longstanding regulations governing Title X grants for family planning services. Washington sought declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate the Final Rule and prohibit HHS from implementing or enforcing it, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. On March 18, 2019, this case was consolidated for pretrial proceedings with a separate case filed by the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA; a national membership organization of Title X providers that operate or administer more than 3,500 health centers providing family planning services to more than 3.7 million patients each year), a Washington-based NFPRHA member organization, and two health care professionals, challenging the same HHS Rule on behalf of themselves and their patients.

Washington and the NFPRHA parties filed preliminary injunctions on March 22, 2019, seeking to prohibit HHS from implementing the Final Rule. Judge Bastian granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Final Rule nationwide until further order of the court. On May 3, 2019, defendants filed a notice of appeal and motion to stay the preliminary injunction, as well as a notice of interlocutory and preliminary injunction appeal regarding plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction.

On June 20, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a three-judge panel per curiam decision granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit noted that the Final Rule was challenged in federal court in California, Oregon, and Washington (this case), and district courts in each case granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. HHS appealed in each case and sought to stay the injunctions pending a decision of the merits of its appeals. The panel found that HHS was likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and that the remaining factors also favored a stay pending appeal. 

On June 25, 2019, plaintiffs in the Oregon and Washington cases filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc regarding the stay. On July 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that the three cases (California, Oregon, and Washington) be reheard en banc, and that the motions for stay pending appeal granted by the Ninth Circuit panel would not be cited as precedent by or to any court of the Ninth Circuit. 

On July 11, 2019, the Ninth Circuit en banc court denied the motions for administrative stay of the three-judge panel’s order granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The en banc court stated they would proceed expeditiously to rehear and reconsider the merits of Defendant-Appellants’ motions for stay of the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders pending consideration of the appeals on the merits. This case is ongoing.","1 Jeffrey T. Sprung, WSBA #23607 Kristin Beneski, WSBA #45478 2 Paul M. Crisalli, WSBA #40681 Assistant Attorneys General 3 ROBERT W.

The State of Washington seeks to enjoin and set aside the Federal 3 Government’s March 4, 2019 Final Rule that, should it become effective, will 4 cripple Washington’s Title X family planning network serving tens of thousands 5 of Washingtonians annually, to achieve ends unrelated to Congress’ Title X 6 program. 2. Congress enacted Title X in 1970 to equalize access to voluntary 8 family planning services. Title X sought to help low-income women reduce their 9 rate of unintended pregnancies and exercise control over their economic lives and 10 health by offering federally-funded access to effective contraception and 11 reproductive health care. Congress authorized the Department of Health and 12 Human Services (HHS or the Department) to award grants to public and 13 non-profit private entities to provide a “broad range of acceptable and effective 14 family planning methods and services” to patients in need. 42 U.S.C. <unk>300(a). 3. Every year since 1971, the State of Washington has competed for 16 and been a direct grantee of Title X funds. As a result, Washington has built a 17 family planning network that has been a remarkable success for the State and its 18 residents. In 2017 alone, it enabled over 18,000 women to avoid unintended 19 pregnancies and eliminated the need for over 6,000 abortions, and it saved the 20 State over $113 million in health care costs. It now comprises 85 clinics providing 21 free or low-cost contraceptives and other reproductive health services to COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1 low-income people in 32 of Washington’s 39 counties. If not curtailed because 2 of the Final Rule, it will serve 98,000 Washingtonians in 2019. 4. The Final Rule dramatically and unlawfully alters the longstanding 4 regulations governing Title X grants for family planning services. It is slated to 5 go into effect on May 3, 2019. The Final Rule will destroy Washington’s family 6 planning network, irreparably harming thousands of Washingtonians. 5. The Final Rule makes numerous changes that impose the 8 Administration’s views contrary to congressional will and five decades of 9 regulations, including the following: a. Coercive practices; denying patient access to medical 11 facts. The Final Rule attempts to deprive pregnant patients of voluntary 12 decision-making about their health care. It eliminates the requirement that they 13 receive nondirective pregnancy counseling. It requires directive referrals to 14 prenatal care for all pregnant patients, while forbidding referrals for abortion care 15 even if requested by patients. The Final Rule permits Title X providers’ own 16 views to dictate the information a patient receives, by withholding factual 17 medical information and offering only biased information, regardless of the 18 patient’s wishes. These aspects of the rule violate Congress’s requirement that 19 Title X subsidizes only voluntary family planning services and its repeated 20 mandate that all pregnancy counseling in a Title X program “shall be 21 nondirective” (the Nondirect","<pad>On March 4, 2019, the State of Washington filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HHS Secretary Alex Azar, alleging that HHS's new Title X regulations violate Title X of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and federal law. The complaint alleged that the new regulations would cripple Washington's Title X family planning network serving tens of thousands of Washingtonians annually, to achieve ends unrelated to Congress' Title X 6 program.

The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant Jefferson Parish School Board had violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by continuing to segregate the school system. The Court granted injunctive relief, mandated desegregation of the school system, and required that the defendants use busing to speed up the integration process. The injunction remained in place for several decades. In 2007, the School Board sought to implement a magnet school program in the hopes of boosting academics and increasing school diversity. The parties jointly moved to supplement the desegregation plan to include the magnet school program, and the Court issued Consent Orders in 2008-2009 that enabled the School Board's plans. However, issues arose in the following years with the School Board's implementation of the plan. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants were using the Consent Orders as a pretext to conceal attempts to continue a system of racially segregated schools. After the Consent Orders expired, the parties reached a settlement agreement and the Court declared Jefferson Parish Schools unitary in 2011. ","I.

COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. On and before January 6, 2021, the Defendants Donald J. Trump, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Proud Boys, and Oath Keepers conspired to incite an assembled crowd to march upon and enter the Capitol of the United States for the common purpose of disrupting, by the use of force, intimidation and threat, the approval by Congress of the count of votes cast by members of the Electoral College as required by Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution. In doing so, the Defendants each intended to prevent, and ultimately delayed, members of Congress from discharging their duty commanded by the United States Constitution to approve the results of the Electoral College in order to elect the next President and Vice President of the United States. 2. Plaintiff, the Honorable Bennie G. Thompson, Member of the United States House of Representatives, brings this action against the Defendants for conspiring to prevent him and other Members of Congress from discharging these official duties, in violation of 42 U.S.C. <unk>1985(1). Enacted as the “Ku Klux Klan Act” in 1871, Section 1985(1) was intended to protect against conspiracies, through violence and intimidation, that sought to prevent Members of Congress from discharging their official duties. The statute was enacted in response to violence and intimidation in which the Ku Klux Klan and other organizations were engaged during that time period. 3. The Defendants conspired to prevent, by force, intimidation and threats, the Plaintiff, as a Member of Congress, from discharging his official duties to approve the count of votes cast by members of the Electoral College following the presidential election held in November 2020. 4. In furtherance of this common goal of preventing the timely approval of the Electoral College vote count, the Defendants acted in concert to incite and then carry out a riot at the Capitol by promoting an assembly of persons to engage in tumultuous and violent conduct or the threat of it that created grave danger of harm to the Plaintiff and to other Members of Congress. 5. This conduct jointly undertaken to threaten the Plaintiff and other Members of Congress in order to disrupt the Electoral College vote count was part of an ongoing course of action pursued by the Defendants for the purpose of contesting the announced results of the presidential election held in November 2020 and preventing the duly elected President and Vice President from attaining approval of Congress of their election necessary to their inauguration. 6. The insurrection at the Capitol was a direct, intended, and foreseeable result of the Defendants’ unlawful conspiracy. It was instigated according to a common plan that the Defendants pursued since the election held in November 2020, culminating in an assembly denominated as the “Save America” rally held at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021, during which Defendants Trump and Giuliani incited a crowd of thousands to descend upon the Capitol in order to prevent or delay through the use of force the counting of Electoral College votes. As part of this unified plan to prevent the counting of Electoral College votes, Defendants Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, through their leadership, acted in concert to spearhead the assault on the Capitol while the angry mob that Defendants Trump and Giuliani incited descended on the Capitol. The carefully orchestrated series of events that unfolded at the Save America rally and the storming of the Capitol was no accident or coincidence. It was the intended and foreseeable culmination of a carefully coordinated campaign to interfere with the legal process required to confirm the tally of votes cast in the Electoral College. 7. While not all of the Defendants in this action were physically present at the Capitol during this attack on the Plaintiff and other Members of Congress, the events that occurred were the natural, foreseeable and intended consequence of the Defendants’ coordinated campaign to use intimidation, harassment and threats in an attempt to prevent Congress from discharging its legally required duty to preside over, and approve, the count of the Electoral College votes which ultimately confirmed that Defendant Trump’s opponent was elected the next President of the United States. 8. Accordingly, this action seeks the award of compensatory damages to redress the harm to the Plaintiff caused by the Defendants’ use of intimidation, harassment and threats of violence to interfere with his discharge of his legally required duty as a Member of Congress and punitive damages to punish the","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 6, 2019 | U.S. District Court | District of Columbia ||||| January 6, 2020 ||| March 6, 2021 ||| Proud Boys International, L.L.C., and Oath Keepers, Inc. ||| December 31, 2018 ||| January 5, 2019 ||| May 2, 2019 .<n>On January 6, 2019, the Honorable Bennie G.

Complaint Nature of the Case 1. This is an action to modify Georgia’s ballot-access requirements for independent and third-party candidates in light of the current public health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus. Although the Secretary of State has exercised his authority under O.C.G.A. <unk>21-2-50.1 to extend the deadline for independent and thirdparty candidates to submit nomination petitions for the 2020 general election, he lacks authority under state law to pro-rate the number of signatures required or to modify any other petition requirements. The result is that the plaintiffs have no reasonable opportunity to qualify for the ballot without endangering their own lives and the lives of others. 2. The plaintiffs are two third-party candidates for U.S. Representative who timely filed a declaration of candidacy and paid the required qualifying fee in March and the Georgia Green Party, which seeks to have the Green Party’s nominee for President of the United States appear on the ballot in November. They allege that, under these unprecedented circumstances, Georgia’s ballot-access restrictions unconstitutionally burden their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and they seek declaratory and injunctive relief pro-rating the number of petition signatures required and making other appropriate modifications to the petition requirements for the 2020 general election. Jurisdiction and Venue 3. This Court has original jurisdiction over this case under Article III of the U.S. Constitution and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343(a)(3). 4. This suit is authorized by 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983. 5. Declaratory relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201 and 2202. 6.

Plaintiff Martin Cowen is the Libertarian Party of Georgia’s nominee for U.S. Representative in Georgia’s Thirteenth Congressional District. He timely filed a declaration of candidacy and paid the required qualifying fee in March 2020 but has not yet submitted the nomination petition required by Georgia law. He is 68 years old and meets all of the other qualifications for the office of U.S. Representative. 9. Plaintiff Green Party of Georgia is an unincorporated political body within the meaning of O.C.G.A. <unk>21-2-170. The party is registered under O.C.G.A. <unk>21-2-110(a) and (b).

The Novel Coronavirus Presents a Threat to Public Health 11. In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China. 12. The respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, now known as “COVID-19,” is an infectious disease that can spread from person to person and can result in serious illness and death. 13. On January 30, 2020, after the coronavirus outbreak had spread well beyond China, the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 14. On January 31, 2020, as a result of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a nationwide public health emergency retroactive to January 27, 2020. 15. On February 27, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control issued guidance recommending, among other things, that members of the public practice “social distancing,” minimizing close contact with others, in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. 16.","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 31, 2020 | Novel Coronavirus | Georgia | U.S. District Court | Northern District of Georgia | Georgia Secretary of State | Georgia Green Party .<n>On January 31, 2020, two third-party candidates filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern district of Georgia challenging Georgia's ballot-access restrictions in light of the current public health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus.

COMPLAINT Nature of the Case 1. This case is about protecting American democracy at a time when we are facing a worldwide pandemic. The Governor has declared a state of emergency and ordered everyone to stay at home unless absolutely necessary to go outside. The infection and death count is ticking upwards each day. 2. Under these circumstances, voting in-person is no longer a realistic option for most if not all voters. Voting in-person unnecessarily endangers the health and safety of voters and anyone they come into contact with well after voting. If this weren’t enough, voting in-person has become even harder as poll workers across Georgia (many who are elderly) are quitting in droves to limit the risk of potentially deadly exposure. 3. Under these circumstances, many voters have reasonably decided to vote from the safety of home by casting mail-in absentee ballots. With the ongoing pandemic, the number of mail-in votes is expected to skyrocket this year at recordbreaking levels. Voting by mail may become the new normal as more and more people vote by mail for the first time. Given the surge of voters who will be casting mail-in absentee ballots this year, it is all the more critical that all unconstitutional barriers to mail-in voting be removed as soon as possible. 4. Though the stakes are high, the legal claim is simple. The United States Constitution (through the Twenty-Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments) bans poll taxes. Georgia election officials require voters to use their own postage when submitting mail-in absentee ballots and applications. Postage costs money. Thus, Defendants have imposed a poll tax in violation of the Constitution. 5. A poll tax remains unconstitutional even if there are free alternatives to voting, such as voting in-person. But the “option” of voting in-person does not really exist because of the pandemic. And voting in-person is already nearly impossible for certain voters that are elderly, disabled, or out of town. 6. Voters are thus trapped into paying an unconstitutional poll tax just to cast a ballot by mail. To be sure, many wealthy and middle-class voters see little problem paying 55 cents to avoid voting in person. While unconstitutional, the postage requirement barely fazes them. 7. But this case is not really about middle-class or wealthy people. This case is about marginalized voters who come from communities who have historically faced over a century of racist voter suppression, including the use poll taxes to disenfranchise voters, and who rightfully refuse to pay another cent for the right to vote. This case is about voters who have always voted in-person to honor their Black ancestors who have fought and died for the right to vote, but now cannot. This case is about voters who live on shoestring budgets and lack access to all the resources such as time, money, and transportation that wealthier people take for granted. This case is about voters who don’t have Internet access, smartphones, email addresses, printers, or scanners in a home office where they can download, print, scan, and e-mail absentee ballot applications to avoid paying postage. This case is about lower-income voters who have overlapping work and childcare responsibilities and cannot just skip work or family obligations to buy stamps at a post office just to vote. 8. For these vulnerable voters, the postage stamp requirement imposes a serious burden that is unfathomable to wealthier people. Many lower-income voters do not have postage stamps. They no longer need to use them or have never needed to use them. They cannot be expected to needlessly expose themselves to the pandemic just to get stamps in order to vote. That assumes they can even get there, when many do not have cars, and ride-sharing and public transportation is non-existent in rural parts of the state. Voters without Internet access or a credit card cannot buy stamps online, and if they do, they must unnecessarily purchase an unaffordable book of stamps (about $10) because they aren’t allowed to buy just one. Making matters worse, voters are left guessing about how much postage to use because ballots vary in size and weight. So they must add potentially unnecessary extra postage just to be safe from the risk of being disenfranchised. It hardly bears mention that few people actually own stamp scales. 9. For these reasons, Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and a permanent injunction requiring Defendants to provide postage prepaid returnable envelopes for absentee ballots, as well as absentee ballot applications. Defendants know how to do this, because the law already requires them to provide postage prepaid returnable envelopes for other purposes.

The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to our nation, threatening the lives, livelihood, and health of millions of Americans and severely straining health care systems, the economy, and all levels and branches of government. 3. COVID-19 is wreaking havoc across all sectors and causing massive disruptions in election administration during this presidential election year. With its high transmission and mortality rates, COVID-19 poses a significant risk to in-person voters, especially to those voters at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19. The pandemic has decimated voter registration drive activity, makes it unreasonably dangerous and burdensome to comply with certain requirements for mail-in absentee voting, and threatens massive withdrawals by volunteer poll workers who justifiably fear contracting the disease. 4. The United States has recorded more than 1.2 million confirmed cases1—more than one-third of the global total.2 As of May 18, 2020, Louisiana had reported 34,709 cases and 2,440 deaths.3 5.

On April 15, 2020, Defendant Secretary of State Ardoin proposed an emergency election plan that would have substantially reduced the risk of voters being exposed to COVID-19 by suspending certain aspects of Louisiana election law that require person-to-person interactions, including in-person voting by large categories of individuals.

But weeks into a deadly pandemic that now afflicts thousands of South Carolinians, prompting Governor McMaster to order all residents to remain at “home or work,” it is now clear that two requirements of the election laws will deprive thousands of the chance to participate in scheduled South Carolina elections by putting voters like the individual Plaintiffs in this lawsuit to the Hobson’s choice of risking their community’s and their own health to vote or not voting at all. 2. Plaintiffs bring this action to prevent the needless deprivation of their fundamental right to vote. 3. First, Plaintiffs challenge the requirement setting forth exclusive categories of “[p]ersons qualified to vote by absentee ballot,” in South Carolina (the “Excuse Requirement”). S.C. Code Ann. <unk>7-15-320. A voter who does not qualify under any of the listed categories has to vote in person on Election Day, or not at all. Defendants have maintained that none of the listed absentee “excuses” apply to the thousands of voters like Plaintiff Rev. Jeremy Rutledge who has preexisting conditions that make exposure to COVID-19 extremely dangerous or deadly, but would surely vote in person at his polling site but for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Defendants have also refused to provide an absentee “excuse” for voters like Plaintiff Trena Walker who reasonably fears that voting in person may result in her contracting or unintentionally contributing to the spread of COVID-19. In so doing, Defendants have forced South Carolina voters to make an untenable decision between risking their health and the health of their families or giving up their right to vote. Plaintiffs seek relief enjoining the Excuse Requirement insofar as it unreasonably burdens their fundamental right to vote while following South Carolina’s directive to remain at “home or work,” or while practicing recommended physical distancing to protect their and their community’s health from community transmission of the novel coronavirus. 4. Second, Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of South Carolina’s witness signature requirement on absentee ballots, codified at S.C. Code Ann. <unk>7-15-220 (the “Witness Requirement,” and collectively with the Excuse Requirement, the “Challenged Requirements”). State law requires all mail-in ballots be signed by a third-party witness in addition to the voter, otherwise an absentee ballot goes uncounted. In the current environment, this poses an unreasonable obstacle to many South Carolina voters, like Plaintiff Mary Thomas, who lives alone and cannot risk contact with third parties while the threat of contagion continues—whether to vote in person or to obtain a witness signature. The Witness Requirement also violates Sections 3(b) and 201 of the Voting Rights Act, which categorically prohibit the use of “any test or device” including “any requirement that a person as a prerequisite for voting... prove his qualifications by the voucher of registered voters or members of any other class.” 5. The Witness Requirement threatens to disenfranchise thousands of voters like Ms. Thomas: almost 30% of the State’s residents (about 560,000) live by themselves, and well over 200,000 South Carolinians over 65 years of age—one of the groups most vulnerable to COVID19—live alone.3 6. And the Challenged Requirements’ impact will also fall more heavily on AfricanAmerican voters in South Carolina, who both live alone in larger percentages than the population as a whole and who","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] March 2019 | South Carolina | Coronavirus ||| Excuses ||| Witness ||||| Disparity ||| March 2020 ||| South Carolina State Election Commission (S.C.

ROBERT J. BLACK, in his individual and official capacities, and BOGALUSA CITY COURT, Defendants. Case No. COMPLAINT CLASS ACTION I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Defendants Judge Robert J. Black (“Black”) and the Bogalusa City Court (“City Court”) operate a modern-day debtors’ prison, jailing the poor for their failure to pay. Defendant Black routinely orders individuals to jail for non-payment of monetary penalties for minor traffic and misdemeanor offenses without inquiring into the reason for non-payment. 2. The City Court is funded off the backs of the poor. It substantially relies on the court costs and fees it collects from criminal defendants. The City Court routinely covers at least 15% of its expenditures through income it generates from criminal defendants. This structural conflict of interest creates an incentive for Defendant Black to find individuals guilty and to coerce payment through the threat of jail. Without this money, the City Court could not function. 3. This incentive is exemplified through Defendant Black’s creation of a $50 “extension fee” to raise additional money to operate the City Court. This extension fee is not authorized by state law. However, Defendant Black gives individuals unable to pay their monetary penalties in full a false choice: they may either go to jail for non-payment of fines and costs or pay this illegal $50 extension fee to buy additional time to pay their monetary penalty. 4. Plaintiffs Rozzie Scott (“Scott”) and Ebony Roberts (“Roberts”) fear they will be incarcerated for non-payment, forced to make an illegal payment, and deprived of due process by having their cases decided by a biased judge at their upcoming court hearings. Neither has the ability to pay the hundreds of dollars in fines and costs they owe the City Court. 5. Plaintiffs Scott, Roberts, Latasha Cook (“Cook”), and Robert Levi (“Levi”) were previously victimized by this funding system and were forced to accept the false choice of paying the illegal $50 extension fee to avoid being jailed. Each of these Plaintiffs paid the City Court $50 to purchase their freedom. 6. Defendants’ unconstitutional practices have affected, and will continue to affect, hundreds of low-income people with citations for traffic tickets or misdemeanor violations in the City of Bogalusa, Louisiana. Plaintiffs bring these claims on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated to seek a declaration that Defendants’ practices are unconstitutional, to seek an injunction to enjoin them from continuing these practices, and to seek damages to recover the illegal extension fee for those who paid it in the past year.

The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and the case was dismissed.</s>"
438,CJ-MO-0024,"[ENTITYCHAIN] October 31st, 2016 | Florissant | Missouri ||| four years [SUMMARY] On October 31st, 2016, a group of Plaintiffs who had been jailed for their inability to pay fines owed to the City of Florissant, Missouri for traffic tickets or other minor municipal offenses, sued the City for this violation of due process. This case is still in the discovery stage and has been ongoing for four years. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI EASTERN DIVISION THOMAS BAKER, SEAN BAILEY, NICOLE BOLDEN, ALLISON NELSON, MEREDITH WALKER, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF FLORISSANT Defendant. No. 4:16-cv-1693 (Jury Trial Demanded) CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Introduction 1. The Plaintiffs in this case are all impoverished Missourians who were jailed by the City of Florissant because they were unable to make a monetary payment to the City arising from traffic tickets or other minor municipal offenses. In each instance, the City kept a human being in its jail solely because the person could not afford to pay for their release. Each was held in jail indefinitely without either the legal representation or the inquiry into their ability to pay guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Instead, they were threatened, abused, and left to languish in confinement until their frightened family members produced enough cash to buy their freedom, or until City jail officials decided, days or weeks later, to release them free of charge—after it had become clear the City would not be able to extract any money from them. 2. The City’s modern debtors’ prison scheme has been increasingly profitable to the City of Florissant, earning it millions of dollars over the past several years. It has devastated the poor in the City and surrounding area, trapping people for years in a cycle of increased fees, debt, extortion, and cruel jailings. Thousands of people like the Plaintiffs take from their disability checks or sacrifice money that is desperately needed by their families for food, diapers, clothing, rent, and utilities to pay ever-increasing court fines, fees, costs, and surcharges arising from minor offenses. They are told by City officials that if they do not pay, they will be thrown in jail. The cycle repeats itself, month after month, for years. 3. The treatment of Thomas Baker, Sean Bailey, Nicole Bolden, Allison Nelson, and Meredith Walker reveals systemic illegality perpetrated by the City of Florissant against some of its poorest people. The City has engaged in the same conduct, as a matter of policy and practice, against many other impoverished human beings on a daily basis for years, unlawfully jailing people if they are too poor to pay. The result is an abusive system that flagrantly violates the basic constitutional and human rights of our community’s most vulnerable people. 4. Once locked in the Florissant jail, impoverished people who cannot afford to pay the City endure grotesque treatment. They are kept in overcrowded cells; they are denied toothbrushes, toothpaste, and soap; they are subjected to the constant stench of excrement and refuse in their congested cells; they are kept in the same clothes for days and weeks without access to laundry or shoes or underwear; they step on top of other inmates, whose bodies cover nearly the entire uncleaned cell floor, in order to access a single shared toilet that the City does not clean; illnesses and even infected wounds go untreated and uncovered; they endure days and weeks without being allowed to use the moldy shower; they are housed in short-sleeve jump suits; shoes and flip-flops are not permitted, so those who are not arrested in socks go barefoot on the dirty cement floor; they huddle in cells kept intentionally cold in order to quiet detainees, forced to retreat under a single thin blanket as they beg guards for warmer coverings; they are not given adequate hygiene products for menstruation; they are routinely denied vital medical care and prescription medication, even when their families beg to be allowed to bring medication to the jail; they are provided food so insufficient and lacking in nutrition that inmates lose significant amounts of weight; they suffer from dehydration out of fear of drinking foul smelling water dispensed from an apparatus covered in blood and mucus on top of the toilet, without sufficient pressure to drink from without pressing their lips to the contaminated apparatus; and they must listen to the screams of other inmates languishing from unattended medical issues as they sit in their cells without access to books, or legal materials. Perhaps worst of all, they do not know when they will be allowed to leave their disorienting and timeless cage, deprived of windows and perpetually flooded in florescent light. 5. These physical abuses and deprivations are accompanied by other pervasive humiliations. Jail guards primarily ignore, but also routinely taunt impoverished people when they are unable to pay for their release. 6. The City applies its scheme broadly, making jail or payment virtually unavoidable for the area’s poor. Florissant is the largest municipality in St. Louis County by population, and the eighth largest by area. Florissant has a population of 51,812 according to the 2010 U.S Census. In 2015 alone, the City of Florissant issued 28,436 arrest warrants, equaling an average of 1.3 arrest warrants per household and almost 0.79 arrest warrants for every adult, mostly involving unpaid debt for municipal violations. Between 2011 and 2015, the City of Florissant filed 151,026 new cases.

The plaintiffs, represented by Children's Rights and the ACLU, asked the court to order improved policies related to protective services, family preservation and preventive services, child placement, case reviews, adoptions, and staffing, among other issues, claiming violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA), the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the District of Columbia Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the District of Columbia Youth Residential Facilities Licensor Act of 1986. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that caseloads were too large, leaving many children in the foster care system for far too long with unresolved cases. Additionally, the complaint alleged inappropriate placements for children and inadequate efforts to return children home. 

In 1993, Judge Thomas F. Hogan approved a consent decree directing DHS to develop policies and procedures to rectify the system. After many years of oversight, and periodic contempt orders, the system has gradually improved.

COMPIAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. This is a civil rights action brought on behalf of children who have been placed in foster care under the supervision of the District of Columbia's Department of Human Services and on behalf of children have been abused or neglected and who are or should be known to the Department by virtue of that abuse or neglect. The Department has systematically denied the plaintiff children their rights under federal law, the united states Constitution, and the law of the District of Columbia. 2. Constitutional principles, federal statutes and the law of the District of Columbia all mandate that the Department promptly investigate complaints of neglect and abuse, that it make reasonable efforts to keep families together whenever possible by offering services, that it provide appropriate care to children it has taken into foster care, and that it provide permanent homes for children either by returning them to their own families or by finding them adoptive homes. The District of Columbia Department of Human Services is complying with none of these mandates. 3. The child-welfare system in Washington is in an ongoing state of crisis as severe as that experienced by many of the homes from which the system is removing children. Worker caseloads are many times larger than that permitted by professional standards, abuse reports go uninvestigated, ninety-day ""emergency care"" lasts for years, workers and foster parents are unt""rained, foster homes are overcrowded and unsupervised, planning for children is nonexistent, children are ""controlled"" by inappropriate use of medication, specialized placements are virtually nonexistent and thus children with special needs often are shipped out to institutions in distant states, and no services are provided to families to enable children to be returned home safely nor are efforts made to find new permanent homes for children. One tragic result of this systemic chaos is that children who enter foster care in the District of Columbia remain there an average of nearly five years, more than three times the national average. 4. The District of Columbia child-welfare system operates in violation of federal statutes, constitutional provisions, and the law of the District of Columbia. These violations result directly from the defendants' actions and inactions and are irreparably injuring children for whom the Department of Human Services is responsible. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This is an action pursuant to section 1983 of title 42 of the united states Code alleging violations of federal statutes as well as of the united States Constitution. In addition the action alleges violations of statutes of the District of Columbia. The district court has jurisdiction over the federal claims pursuant to sections 1331 and 1343(a) (3) of title 28 of the united states Code, and it has pendent jurisdiction over the claims alleging violations of the statutes of the District of Columbia. 6. Venue in this district is proper pursuant to section 1391(b) of title 28 of the united States Code because the claims arise in the district.

The plaintiffs alleged that DHHS violated the children's constitutional rights under the U.S. Constitution, the federal civil rights statute, the child welfare law, and the child and family services law of the district of Columbia by systematically denying the children their rights under federal law and failing to provide them with appropriate care, services, placement, and placement. The DHHS also alleged that the children were not adequately protected from abuse and neglect. The case was dismissed in May 2007 and the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment in June 2006. The case is still pending in the district court.</s>"
440,CW-TX-0002,"[ENTITYCHAIN] 2017 | the Indian Child Welfare Act | ICWA ||| Fifth Circuit [SUMMARY] On 2017, foster parents and three states filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the Indian Child Welfare Act (the ""ICWA""). Plaintiffs allege the ICWA violates the Equal Protection Clause and anti-commandeering principles. The district court held the ICWA is unconstitutional which was partially affirmed in a fractured en banc opinion by the Fifth Circuit. The case is ongoing. ","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS FORT WORTH DIVISION CHAD EVERET BRACKEEN and JENNIFER KAY BRACKEEN and TEXAS, Plaintiffs, v. RYAN ZINKE, in his official capacity as Sec- retary of the United States Department of the Interior; BRYAN RICE, in his official capac- ity as Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs; MICHAEL BLACK, in his official capacity as Acting Assistant Secretary for Indian Af- fairs; the BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS; and the UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, Defendants. Case No. 4:17-cv-00868 COMPLAINT AND PRAYER FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1. Chad and Jennifer Brackeen want to adopt A.L.M., a two-year-old boy, and provide him with a loving, safe, and permanent home. The Brackeens have fostered A.L.M. since he was ten months old, and A.L.M.’s biological parents and grandmother support the adoption. The only thing standing in the way of the Brackeens’ loving embrace is the federal government. 2. A Texas family court, applying federal law, refused the Brackeens’ adoption petition, and ordered A.L.M. removed from the only real home he has known with the Brackeens to live with a couple he does not know, in a state he has never even visited. The sole justification for this result is that A.L.M. is labeled an “Indian child” under federal law. 3. In 1978, Congress decided that the federal government, and, in particular, the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”), knew best how to manage the fostering and adoption of Native American children. Though the Constitution reserves domestic relations to the States, and despite the fact that Congress possesses no enumerated power to legislate in this way, Congress enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act (“ICWA”), 25 U.S.C. <unk>1901–1963. ICWA, and the enabling regulations promulgated by the BIA, invade every aspect of state family law as applied to Indian children. ICWA commandeers state agencies and courts to become investigative and executive actors carrying out federal policy, and to make child-custody decisions based on racial preferences. 4. By enforcing this racially discriminatory policy, the federal government places Indian children at risk for serious and lasting harm. And States that refuse to follow ICWA risk having their child-custody decisions invalidated and federal child welfare funding pulled. Thus, Congress forces ICWA on the States by threatening the stability and well-being of the family lives of their youngest and most vulnerable citizens. 5. This is an action under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>551–706, and the United States Constitution, brought to challenge the validity of a final rule entitled Indian Child Welfare Act Proceedings, 81 Fed Reg. 38,778 (June 14, 2016) (the “Final Rule”) (codified at 25 C.F.R pt. 23), and certain provisions of ICWA that the Final Rule purports to interpret and implement. 6. Plaintiffs Chad and Jennifer Brackeen bring this action because the Final Rule and ICWA were applied by a Texas family court to deny them the ability to adopt A.L.M., and, as a result, the Texas Department of Family Protective Services (“Texas DFPS”), also applying the Final Rule, seeks to remove A.L.M. from the Brackeens’ home and place him with an unknown Indian family in New Mexico. The Brackeens’ petition to adopt A.L.M. was denied solely because the family court concluded that ICWA and the Final Rule applied to the Brackeens’ petition and that the Brackeens had failed to satisfy, by the Final Rule’s clear and convincing burden of proof, that “good cause” exists to depart from the Final Rule’s and ICWA’s “placement preferences.” See 23 C.F.R. <unk>23.132; see also Order Denying Request for Adoption of Child, In re A.L.M., a Child, No. 323-105593-17 (323rd Dist. Ct., Tarrant Cty., Texas Aug. 22, 2017). 7. ICWA’s placement preferences require that, “in any adoptive placement of an Indian child under State law, a preference shall be given in absence of good cause to the contrary to a placement with (1) a member of the child’s extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child’s tribe; or (3) other Indian families.” 25 U.S.C. <unk>1915(a); see also 25 C.F.R. <unk>23.130. 8.

CITY OF STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, COLORADO Defendant. COMPLAINT Plaintiffs Jonathan Steele and Timothy Richardson, by and through their attorneys Fox Robertson, P.C., hereby submit their Complaint for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. INTRODUCTION 1. Almost nine years after Congress passed our nation’s landmark civil rights law for people with disabilities, Defendant which, through Steamboat Springs Transit, owns and operates the City of Steamboat Springs’s public transportation system has not made several of its public services, including its public transportation system, accessible to individuals who use wheelchairs. 2. On July 12, 1990, Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>12101, et seq., establishing the most important civil rights law for people with disabilities in our country's history. 3. Congress explicitly stated that among the purposes of the ADA are: a. “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;” b. “to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities,...;” and c. “to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the 14th Amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. <unk>12101(b). 1. In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. <unk>794 (the “Rehabilitation Act”) is “designed to eliminate discrimination on the basis of handicap in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 34 C.F.R. <unk>104.1. 2. In spite of abundant lead time and the extensive publicity the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act have received since 1990, Defendant continues to discriminate against people who use wheelchairs in ways that include but are not limited to its failure to provide access for persons with disabilities to basic public services, including the public transportation system, that are available to all other members of the public. JURISDICTION 1. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 2. Venue is proper within this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391. PARTIES 1. Plaintiff Timothy Richardson is and was at all times material hereto a resident of Colorado residing at 901 Mountain Village Circle, Steamboat Springs, Colorado, 80487 Mr. Richardson has cerebral palsey, is a paraplegic, and is substantially impaired in several major life activities Mr. Richardson requires a manual wheelchair for mobility. 2. Plaintiff Jonathan Steele is and was at all times material hereto a resident of Colorado residing at 305 Mountain Village Circle, Steamboat Springs, Colorado, 80487. Seven years ago, Mr. Steele was injured in a skiing accident. As a result, Mr. Steele is a paraplegic and is substantially impaired in several major life activities Mr. Steele requires a manual wheelchair for mobility. 3. Defendant, the City of Steamboat Springs is a public entity (i.e., a local government) located in Colorado with its principal place of business at 137 Tenth Street, Steamboat Springs, Colorado, 80477. On information and belief, the City of Steamboat Springs (hereinafter “Steamboat Springs”) receives federal financial assistance, and in particular, for the operation of its public transportation system through Steamboat Springs Transit (“SST”). SST operates a fixed route bus system. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 1. Plaintiff Timothy Richardson has lived in Steamboat Springs since November of 1998 and relies on SST’s buses as his primary means of transportation Mr. Richardson is an active and contributing member of the Steamboat Springs community and has been employed at the Wal-Mart in Steamboat Springs, where he handles returns and exchanges, since December of 1998. 2. Plaintiff Jonathan Steele has lived in Steamboat Springs for the last twelve years Mr. Steele has been employed at the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Steamboat Springs for nine years, where he controls the switchboard in the front office. He relies on SST as well as his own vehicle for transportation Mr. Steele is an active member of the community who patronizes many of the city’s private businesses and public facilities. He is an outdoorsman who frequently uses the city’s many parks, trails, and other recreational areas. 3. Plaintiffs have encountered various accessibility barriers throughout Steamboat Springs.

COMPLAINT Plaintiffs Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, Jeremy Hudson, and James Hudson, by and through their attorneys, Fox Robertson, P.C. and Kevin W. Williams, hereby bring this Complaint against the Colorado Rockies Baseball Club, Ltd., lessee and operator of Coors Field. INTRODUCTION 1. Coors Field is the home of the Major League Baseball Colorado Rockies. Starting in 2001, Defendant made it almost impossible for baseball fans who use wheelchairs to enjoy a game from front-row or near-in seats adjacent to the infield. 2. For baseball fans who do not use wheelchairs, Defendant provides seats behind the dugouts and along the first and third base lines at prices that range from $27 to $38. The only wheelchair accessible seats with similar lines of sight cost approximately $100. 3. Prior to 2001, Defendant provided wheelchair accessible seats behind home plate at prices equivalent to the inaccessible seats behind the dugouts and along the first and third base lines. These seats were the only accessible seats providing a front-row or near-in viewing experience by the infield. 4. Starting in 2001 in order to create a luxury area called the “Coors Clubhouse” -Defendant raised the price on the wheelchair accessible seats behind home plate to $100 each and removed some of these seats. This move left no accessible seats in Coors Field that are equivalent in price, lines of sight and overall experience to the many inaccessible seats behind the dugouts and along the first and third base lines. 5. This discrimination violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires stadiums such as Coors Field to “provide people with physical disabilities a choice of admission prices and lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public.” Department of Justice Standards for Accessible Design, <unk>4.33.3.

Plaintiff Jeremy Hudson is a resident of Colorado. He has spina bifida and is substantially impaired in several major life activities, including but not limited to walking. He uses a manual wheelchair for mobility. Plaintiff Jeremy Hudson is a member of CCDC. 10. Plaintiff James Hudson is a resident of Colorado. He is the father of Jeremy Hudson and often attends baseball games at Coors Field with him. As such, he is in a known relationship with and/or association with an individual with a disability. Plaintiff James Hudson is a member of CCDC. 11. Defendant Colorado Rockies Baseball Club, Ltd. is a Colorado limited partnership with its principal place of business in Denver, Colorado. Defendant owns the Colorado Rockies major league baseball team and leases and operates Coors Field, the stadium in which the team plays. FACTS 12. Coors Field was built for first occupancy after January 26, 1993. 13. Defendant does not provide wheelchair accessible and companion seats with lines of sight equivalent to and at prices equivalent to the inaccessible seats in the rows behind the backstop, behind the dugouts, and adjacent to the infield along the first and third base lines in Sections 120 to 141 (“Infield Box Seats”). 14. Infield Box Seats are currently sold at prices ranging from approximately $27 to approximately $38 per game. 15. Prior to the 2001 major league baseball season, Defendant provided approximately 17 wheelchair accessible and companion seats immediately behind the backstop (“Backstop Accessible Seats”). These seats were sold at prices similar to those of the Infield Box Seats. 16. Starting in 2001, Defendant raised the prices on the Backstop Accessible Seats to approximately $100 per game. 17. This price hike was the result of the creation of a luxury area known as the Coors Clubhouse. Defendant describes the Coors Clubhouse as a “premium seating area located directly behind home plate. Season Ticket Holders in this area have a private entrance, access to a private lounge and complimentary in-seat service.” 18. In addition, on information and belief, Defendant removed all or many of the Backstop Accessible Seats and reduced the total number of accessible seats behind home plate. 19. Defendant is required to provide wheelchair accessible and companion seats in certain percentages, dispersed throughout Coors Field. Specifically, wheelchair accessible seating is required to be an integral part of the seating at Coors Field, and Defendant is required to provide people with physical disabilities a choice of admission prices and lines of sight comparable to those for members of the general public. 20.

CUOMO, in his official capacity as Governor of New York State Defendant. CASE NO: 1:20-CV-03338 COMPLAINT PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Plaintiffs challenge Governor Andrew Cuomo’s practice of holding daily press briefings regarding the COVID-19 pandemic without providing simultaneous American Sign Language (“ASL”) interpretation for television broadcast for deaf audience members. 2. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is being disproportionately felt by New Yorkers, with confirmed COVID-19 cases at a rate four times greater than any other state and with more than a third of all domestic COVID-19 related deaths occurring in New York. 3. Governor Cuomo’s daily briefings provide critical information about steps taken by the state and federal government to address the health crisis and recommendations on how New Yorkers can stay safe and help limit the spread of the virus. 4. The Governor has ordered schools and non-essential businesses to close. 5. The Governor has ordered people in New York to maintain a 6-foot distance when in public 6. The Governor has ordered the public to wear masks or face coverings when taking public or private transportation or riding in for-hire vehicles. 7. Governor Cuomo’s briefings have briefed the public on important developments, and provided commentary on the government’s response at the local, state and national levels. 8. Many deaf New Yorkers cannot understand Governor Cuomo’s briefings without live televised ASL interpretation in frame. 9. According to the 2014 census, there are approximately 208,000 people in New York City who are deaf or hard of hearing. 10. Rochester, New York, is home to the United States’ largest deaf population per capita, with about 90,000 people who are deaf or hard of hearing living in the metropolitan area. 11. ASL is the primary language for the majority of deaf individuals, 12. These individuals are often unable to follow closed captioning due to imperfections in the transcription, English being their second language, cognitive and/or processing issues, and other factors. 13. Media reports indicate that every other state in the nation has provided some form of live televised ASL interpretation in frame during its briefings. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 14. Plaintiffs’ federal claims are made pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”). 15.

Before proceeding with our findings, we would like to thank the State for the assistance and cooperation extended to us during this investigation. We would also like to acknowledge the courtesy, professionalism, and commitment of the State officials and counsel involved in this matter to date. Further, we would like to thank providers, stakeholders, families, and service recipients for their candor and cooperation in assisting our investigation.

Accordingly, the civil rights of persons with disabilities are violated by unnecessary segregation in a wide variety of non-residential settings, including in segregated employment, vocational, and day programs.

The elementary school student had been subject to disciplinary removal from the classroom and his district had failed to provide the behavioral supports and programming required by law.

KANAWHA COUNTY SCHOOLS, and RON DUERRING, Superintendent, Kanawha County Schools, in his official capacity, Defendants. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Defendant Kanawha County Schools (“KCS”) unlawfully fails to provide effective behavior supports for a class of its students with disabilities, leading to unjustified disciplinary removals from the classroom due to the students’ behaviors. KCS punishes students for their behaviors and removes them from the classroom instead of developing and implementing effective behavior supports—required by law—that would allow these students to succeed in general education settings alongside their peers without disabilities. 2. Plaintiff G.T. is a third-grade KCS student diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”). G.T. has significant strengths and could be educated successfully in a general education classroom, with effective behavior supports. However, he has been denied effective behavior supports at his KCS public school and, as a result, has experienced disciplinary removals from school. Because of KCS’s failures to provide G.T. with effective behavior supports, and subsequent removals of G.T. from the classroom, he is not making appropriate progress. 3. Plaintiff G.T.’s situation is representative of many students with behavior support needs within KCS. KCS fails to provide students with disabilities the instruction and services, including behavior supports, they need to succeed in school. As a result, these students drop out at a high rate and experience repeated yet avoidable disciplinary sanctions, including in-school and out-of-school suspensions, undocumented “send homes,” placement in alternative schools, expulsions, and referrals to law enforcement. Many students with behavior support needs are pushed into segregated classrooms where they interact only with other students with disabilities, and where there is inadequate (and sometimes no) instruction and inappropriate and ineffective efforts at behavior management. 4. Plaintiffs G.T., on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, and The Arc of West Virginia bring this class action complaint for declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief to challenge KCS’s systemic policies, practices, and procedures that violate federal and state law. 5. KCS’s actions violate the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. <unk>1400, et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. <unk>794(a), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131 et seq., the West Virginia Human Rights Act (“HRA”), W Va. Code <unk>5-11-9 et seq., and West Virginia Policy 2419 (“WV Policy 2419”). 6. The IDEA requires public schools to provide all eligible children with disabilities a free appropriate public education (“FAPE”). 20 U.S.C. <unk>1412(a)(1). To meet their FAPE obligation, schools must provide “special education and related services.” 42 U.S.C. <unk>1401(9). The standard for providing a FAPE is a “demanding” one: students with disabilities must receive “appropriately ambitious” special education that gives them “the chance to meet challenging objectives.” Endrew F v. Douglas Cty Sch Dist. RE-1, 137 S Ct. 988, 1000 (2017). This standard must be met by public schools in West Virginia, including schools within KCS. See R.F v. Cecil Cty Pub.

Under federal law, for students whose behavior impedes learning, public education must include effective behavior supports. 20 U.S.C. <unk>1400(c)(5). These supports may include, but are not limited to, Functional Behavior Assessments (“FBAs”) of the student’s behaviors, Behavior Intervention Plans (“BIPs”) identifying interventions addressing those behaviors, and other positive behavior interventions and supports.

The state-created public health crisis in Flint, Michigan, whereby an entire population was poisoned with lead-contaminated water, is now well known. Since the full magnitude of this crisis became public in 2015, there have been federal and state inquiries, investigations, task forces, declarations, and appropriations. Yet there has been no effective response to address the needs of the thousands of children who attend Flint’s public schools. This class action civil rights lawsuit is brought to remedy that failure. 2. Flint is a community in sustained economic decline, 1 with deterioration of essential infrastructure and public services, including education and public health services.2 Forty percent of Flint’s residents live in poverty, one of the highest rates in the nation for a city of its size.3 The childhood poverty rate is equally staggering: 42% in Flint as compared to 14.8% in the United States.4 The majority of Flint’s residents are African American.5 1 Mona Hanna-Attisha et al., Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Children Associated with the Flint Drinking Water Crisis: A Spatial Analysis of Risk and Public Health Response, 106 AM J PUB.

According to the complaint, the majority of Flint’s residents live in poverty, one of the highest rates in the nation for a city of its size. The complaint alleged that the defendants failed to provide the children with adequate education and public health services. In August 2018, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to show that there was a substantial likelihood of success. On March 2020, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants. The final judgment required the defendants to provide all children in the Flint community schools with free or reduced-price school lunches.</s>"

COMPLAINT JURY TRIAL DEMANDED Plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. brings this action to obtain, among other relief, a declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, that Defendants have employed and are employing racially and ethnically discriminatory policies and procedures in administering the undergraduate admissions program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (“UNC-Chapel Hill”) in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1981, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000d et seq. (“Title VI”). UNC-Chapel Hill’s undergraduate admissions policies and procedures have injured and continue to injure Plaintiff’s members by intentionally and unconstitutionally discriminating against them on the basis of their race and ethnicity I. INTRODUCTION 1. This is an action brought under the Fourteenth Amendment and federal civil rights laws to prohibit UNC-Chapel Hill from engaging in intentional discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity. “Classifications of citizens solely on the basis of race are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. They threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a racial group and to incite racial hostility.” Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 643 (1993) (citations and quotations omitted). As a consequence, racial classifications are highly disfavored and have been permitted only when there is a compelling government interest that cannot be met through raceneutral means. In the educational setting, “diversity” is the only interest the Supreme Court has found compelling. Even then, the Supreme Court has mandated strict judicial scrutiny to ensure that an academic institution is actually pursuing that interest and that it is absolutely necessary to employ racial preferences in order to achieve a diverse student body. 2. Yet the Supreme Court has always had misgivings about its decision to permit any use of racial preferences in university admissions. See City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 518 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). The Supreme Court was nevertheless convinced to permit racial preferences in pursuit of diversity for two reasons.

KENOSHA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1 BOARD OF EDUCATION and SUE SAVAGLIO-JARVIS, in her official capacity as Superintendent of the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1, Civ. Action No. 2:16-cv-00943 COMPLAINT Defendants. INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiff A.W., a 16-year-old boy, is a rising senior at George Nelson Tremper High School (“Tremper”) in the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 (“KUSD”) in Kenosha, Wisconsin. A.W. is a boy. He is also transgender. A.W. was assumed to be a girl when he was born, and was designated “female” on his birth certificate, but has a male gender identity and lives as a boy in all aspects of his life. A.W.’s family, classmates, medical providers, and others recognize A.W. as a boy, respect his male gender identity, and support his right to live and be treated consistent with that gender identity. 2. Defendants Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 Board of Education (the “Board”), Superintendent Sue Savaglio-Jarvis, and their agents, employees, and representatives, have repeatedly refused to recognize or respect A.W.’s gender identity and have taken a series of discriminatory and highly stigmatizing actions against him based on his sex, gender identity, and transgender status. The actions, as described more fully herein, have included (a) denying him access to boys’ restrooms at school and requiring him to use girls’ restrooms or a singleoccupancy restroom; (b) directing school staff to monitor his restroom usage and to report to administrators if he was observed using a boys’ restroom; (c) intentionally and repeatedly using his birth name and female pronouns, and failing to appropriately inform substitute teachers and other staff members of his preferred name and pronouns, resulting in those staff referring to him by his birth name or with female pronouns in front of other students; (d) instructing guidance counselors to issue bright green wristbands to A.W. and any other transgender students at the school, to more easily monitor and enforce these students’ restroom usage; (e) requiring him to room with girls on an orchestra trip to Europe and requiring, as a condition of his ability to participate in a recent overnight school-sponsored orchestra camp held on a college campus, that he stay either in a multi-room suite with girls, or alone in a multi-room suite with no other students, while all other boys shared multi-room suites with other boys; and (f) initially denying him the ability to run for junior prom king, despite being nominated for that recognition based on his active involvement in community service, instructing him that he could only run for prom queen, and only relenting and allowing him to run for prom king after a protest by many of those same classmates. 3. Through these actions, Defendants have discriminated against A.W. on the basis of sex, including on the basis of his gender identity, transgender status, and nonconformity to sex-based stereotypes, in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. <unk>1681, et seq., and on the basis of sex and transgender status in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendants’ actions have denied A.W. full and equal access to KUSD’s education program and activities on the basis of his sex. 4. Plaintiff, through his mother and next friend, M.W., brings this action against Defendants based on these unlawful and discriminatory actions. 5. Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and damages resulting from Defendants’ discriminatory actions. PARTIES 6. Plaintiff A.W. is a 16-year-old boy. He was born in 1999. He resides in Kenosha, Wisconsin and is a student at Tremper High School, a public high school in the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1. He will begin his senior year at Tremper on September 1, 2016. 7. M.W. is A.W.’s mother and brings this action as his next friend. M.W. resides in Kenosha, Wisconsin and is employed by the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 as a high school teacher at Tremper. 8. Defendant Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 Board of Education is a sevenmember elected body responsible for governing the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1, a public school district serving over 22,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade who reside in the City of Kenosha, Village of Pleasant Prairie, and Town and Village of Somers.

Smith Barney is 13 the brokerage retail arm ofCitigroup, the largest financial institution in the United States. 2. The violations are systemic, constituting a pattern and practice that 15 pervades the corporate culture of Smith Barney. They are not isolated or exceptional incidents, 16 but rather the regular and predictable result of Defendant's policies and practices. Put simply, 17 Smith Barney's policies and practices with regard to distribution of the business opportunities and 18 investment accounts under its control have the effect, and have been undertaken with the purpose, 19 of denying equal opportunities for compensation to qualified female Financial Consultants. 3. Smith Barney generally pays its Financial Consultants (also called ""FCs"" 21 or ""brokers"") on a commission basis, determined by the value, quality, and quantity of the 22 investment accounts the FCs acquire and manage. Investment accounts may be generated when 23 individuals with new business call in or walk into the office; through ""leads"" and ""referrals"" (e.g., 24 when a Financial Consultant is told ofa possible account opportunity and makes contact with the 25 potential account holder); by transfer from one Financial Consultant to another (e.g., when a 26 Financial Consultant retires or leaves the business); or through partnerships between Financial 27 Consultants within an office (or ''branch""). 4. But accounts and potential accounts are not simply ""acquired"" by brokers CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 1 in a vacuum, outside the control of the Company. In fact, Smith Barney has implemented a 2 companywide policy for account distribution that delegates the discretion to allocate or distribute 3 accounts, as well as the opportunities to gain new accounts, to its virtually all-male branch 4 management. Because so many accounts are obtained through the distribution process rather than 5 on an FC's own initiative, account distribution is a substantial factor affecting the compensation 6 of Smith Barney Financial Consultants. 5. Pursuant to Smith Barney policy and practice, accounts- or potential 8 accounts and business opportunities -<unk>are normally distributed to Financial Consultants 9 according to a uniform Smith Barney policy that allows Branch Managers to consider past 10 production (e.g., the results of","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] April 2010 | Smith Barney | U.S. District Court | Northern District of California ||| California Fair Employment and Housing Act ||| Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ||||| May 2011 ||| May 2012 ||| June 2013 ||| July 2013 | May 2014 ||| August 2013 | July 2014 | July 2015 | August 2015 | July 2016 | July 2017 | August 2018 | July 2018 | August 2019 | July 2019 | August 2020 | July 2020 | August 2021 | July 2021 | August 2022 | July 2022 | August 2025 | July 2023 | August 2023 | July 2024 | July 2026 | August 2028 | July 2027 | July 2028 | September 2018 | September 2019 | September 2020 | September 2021 | September 2023 | October 2018 | October 2019 | October 2020 | October 2021 | November 2019 | November 2020 | December 2020 | January 2020 | March 2020 | February 2020 | April 2020 | May 2020 | June 2019 | March 2021 | May 2021 | April 2019 | May 2019 | June 2020 | November 2018 | March 2019 | December 2019 | February 2019 | April 2020, May 2020, April 2020, March 2020, March 2020</s>"

African American Secret Service agents brought proposed class action against United States Secret Service under Title VII for discrimination in promotion and retaliation. On plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, the District Court, Roberts, J., held that: (1) statistical analysis revealing statistically significant difference between percentage of black employees at different grade levels did not establish prima facie case of disparity in promotion; (2) Secret Service would be enjoined from taking action to discourage other African American agents from joining proposed class action; and (3) named plaintiffs were not entitled to paid administrative leave to attend someone else’s deposition.

Ladd, Relman Associates, David James Shaffer, Karen Rapaport Esser, Ron Schmidt, Susan Tahernia, Thelen, Reid Priest, LLP, Washington, D.C., for Plaintiff. Brian J. Sonfield, United States Attorney’s Office, Washington, D.C., for Defendant. Opinion MEMORANDUM OPINION ROBERTS, District Judge. Plaintiffs, ten African–American current and former special agents of the United States Secret Service purporting to represent a putative class of African–American special agents who have been employed by the United States Secret Service from January 1, 1974 to the present, have filed this action against the Treasury Secretary under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000e et seq. (1994), and the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1981a. Among other things, plaintiffs claim that the Secret Service has engaged in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination in its promotion of black special agents from the GS–13 to the GS–14 level. Plaintiffs have filed an application for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin future use of the allegedly discriminatory promotion evaluation system pending resolution of this matter on the merits. Plaintiffs also claim that they have been retaliated against for engaging in protected equal employment opportunity (“EEO”) activity and seek to enjoin future retaliation. Oral argument was held on September 1, 2000. I find that the plaintiffs’ evidence thus far is insufficient to give rise to an inference that the performance evaluation system is discriminatory, but does demonstrate that some actions taken by the Secret Service since this litigation began are likely to chill other black agents from coming forward with their claims. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that, over the course of past twenty-six years, the United States Secret Service has utilized a wide variety of racially discriminatory employment practices. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that the Secret Service’s policies and practices have systematically discriminated against black special agents in the following areas: (1) placement in positions of GS–14 or above; (2) performance evaluations; (3) assignments to the position of acting supervisor; (4) transfers and assignments in general; (5) access to training; (6) assignment to undercover work; (7) hiring; (8) testing; (9) disciplinary policies; (10) awards and bonuses; *8 (11) overall work environment; (12) retaliation, and (13) other practices relating to the terms and conditions of employment. The primary target of plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is the Secret Service’s performance evaluation system. A description of how that system operates is therefore in order. I. The Secret Service Special Agent Merit Promotion Plan The evaluation system at issue is known as the Secret Service Special Agent Merit Promotion Plan (“MPP”). Developed by a Secret Service Task Force in 1997, the MPP consists of three distinct parts: (1) a “First–Level” evaluation; (2) a “Peer Panel” evaluation; and (3) a “Second–Level” evaluation. (Burgess Decl., Def.’s Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Prelim Inj. (“Def.’s Opp’n”) Ex. 1 at 6–9.) The First–Level evaluation counts for 50% of a special agent’s total MPP score while the Peer Panel and Second–Level scores are weighted at 20% and 30% respectively. (Id. at 7–9.) The MPP is used annually to evaluate special agents for promotion. In August, each GS–13 and GS–14 special agent who wishes to compete for a promotion is required to file a notice of his or her intent to compete. (Id. at 7.) However, not every GS–13 or GS–14 special agent is eligible to compete. A special agent must have completed three years “in grade” before he or she will be considered for a promotion. (Id. at 23.) For example, in order to compete for a promotion to the GS–14 level, a special agent must first have completed three years at the GS–13 level. Plaintiffs do not allege that this practice is discriminatory in any","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 8, 2000 | U.S. District Court | District of Columbia | Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ||| African American Secret Service agents ||| September 10, 2000 ||| Secret Service Merit Plan ||||| September 17, 2000 | ||| August 31, 2001 ||| December 31, 2001 .<n>Plaintiffs alleged that the Secret Service has engaged in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination in its promotion of black special agents from the GS–13 to the GS–14 level.

Plaintiffs, Hispanic Special Agents of the United States Customs Service (""Customs Service""), bring this action, on their own behalf, and on behalf of a class of all other Hispanic Special Agents in the GS-1811 series who have been employed as GS-1811's at any time from, at least January 1, 1974 to the present, or in the alternative from January 1, 1977 to the present, to address a pattern and practice of discrimination on the basis of national origin by the Department of Treasury's United States Customs Service in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000e and the Civil Rights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. <unk>1981a.

On the basis ofthese violations, plaintiffs seek equitable relief, including, but not limited to, back pay, front pay, and other lost compensation, compensatory damages, a declaratory judgment, and an injunction requiring the Customs Service to cease and desist these illegal acts, and remedy the effects of its illegal conduct.

On or aboutJanuary 9, 1995, Special Agent Miguel Contreras initiated contact with the agency's office ofEqual Employment Opportunity (""EEO"") and caused to be filed a class action complaint on March 23, 1995. The initial class complaint alleged discrimination in the recruitment of applicants, hiring, initialjob assignments, transfers, promotions, retention, training, awards and bonuses, and discipline. In 1995, the complaint was certified as a class by an administrative law judge of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC). The decision was upheld by the EEOC on appeal. This complaint tolled the statute of limitations from its initial filing for all members of the class as to these claims, or any claims reasonably arising therefrom or the investigation thereof. 4. From at least 1977 to the present, members ofthe class raised these issues with Customs Service management from time to time, but no meaningful effort was made to address the discriminatory policies, practices and procedures. 5. In fact, throughout this period, the Customs Service management systematically retaliated against members ofthe class who brought claims or otherwise sought to address the problems of discrimination within the Customs Service.

Class comprised just under 1,700 members. Eventually, parties reached $57 million settlement agreement.","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF KANSAS Shirley Williams, Plaintiff, v. Case No. 03-2200-JWL Sprint/United Management Company, Defendant. MEMORANDUM ORDER This matter is presently before the court on plaintiff’s motion to join additional parties as plaintiffs and for provisional certification of the action as a collective action pursuant to 29 U.S.C. <unk>216(b) (doc. #256). Plaintiff also requests that the court facilitate joinder of the putative class members by approving the sending of a notice to those who have not yet filed written consents to join the action. As set forth in more detail below, plaintiff’s motion is granted. Procedural History Plaintiff Shirley Williams filed a complaint on April 23, 2003 alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. <unk>621 et seq., arising out of her employment with defendant.1 In her complaint, plaintiff further alleged that defendant had engaged in a pattern and practice of age discrimination against plaintiff and others similarly situated to plaintiff such that the action should proceed as a collective action under the ADEA.2 Shortly after plaintiff filed her complaint, individuals began opting-in to the action by filing the requisite consent forms. To date, approximately 119 individuals have filed consent forms as opt-in plaintiffs. Moreover, the parties have engaged in considerable discovery concerning the appropriate composition of the proposed plaintiff group (i.e., the “similarly situated” issue). The parties have not yet engaged in discovery concerning the merits of plaintiff’s pattern and practice allegations nor have the parties engaged in discovery concerning any issues specific to plaintiff or any members of the opt-in group. Plaintiff now moves the court to join the opt-in plaintiffs and to provisionally certify the action as a collective action for purposes of providing notice of the action to other potential plaintiffs. Standard Class actions under the ADEA are authorized by 29 U.S.C. <unk>626(b), which expressly borrows the opt-in class action mechanism of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. <unk>216(b) (1994). Section 216(b) provides for a class action where the complaining employees are “similarly situated.” The Tenth Circuit has approved a two-step approach in determining whether plaintiffs are “similarly situated” for purposes of <unk>216(b). See Thiessen v. General Elec. Capital Corp., 267 F.3d 1095, 1105 (10th Cir. 2001). Under this approach, a court typically makes an initial “notice stage” determination of whether plaintiffs are “similarly situated.” See id. at 1102 (citing Vaszlavik v. Storage Tech. Corp., 175 F.R.D. 672, 678 (D Colo. 1997)). That is, the district court determines whether a collective action should be certified for purposes of sending notice of the action to potential class members. See Mooney v. Aramco Servs. Co., 54 F.3d 1207, 1213-14 (5th Cir. 1995). For conditional certification at the “notice stage,” a court “require[s] nothing more than substantial allegations that the putative class members were together the victims of a single decision, policy, or plan.” See Thiessen, 267 F.3d at 1102 (quoting Vaszlavik, 175 F.R.D. at 678). The standard for certification at the notice stage, then, is a lenient one. See id. at 1103; see also Brooks v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 164 F.R.D. 561, 568 (N.D Ala. 1995) (certification decision at the notice stage is usually based only on the pleadings and any affidavits which have been filed and, thus, the standard is fairly lenient and typically results in conditional certification of a representative class). At the conclusion of discovery, the court then revisits the certification issue and makes a second determination (often prompted by a motion to decertify) of whether the plaintiffs are “similarly situated” using a stricter standard. Thiessen, 267 F.3d at 1102-03. During this “second stage” analysis, a court reviews several factors, including the disparate factual and employment settings of the individual plaintiffs; the various defenses available to defendant which appear to be individual to each plaintiff; fairness and procedural considerations; and whether plaintiffs made the filings required by the ADEA before instituting suit Id. at 1103. While plaintiff is arguably beyond the “notice stage” in that 119 individuals have already filed opt-in consent forms and the parties have engaged in considerable discovery with respect to the opt-in group, plaintiff has not yet sent notice of the action to potential plaintiffs and the parties have not engaged in discovery on those issues pertinent to the “second stage” analysis. Moreover, defendant does not contend that the court should employ the higher “second stage” standard at this juncture.

Defendant City of Pontiac is a corporate, governmental body and a political subdivision of the State of Michigan, established pursuant to the laws of the State of Michigan. The City of Pontiac provides fire and rescue services to its citizens through its agency, the Pontiac Fire Depmmenr: (‘;’PFD”). 4. The City of Pontiac is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 2000e(a), and an employer within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. tj 2000e(b). 5. Defendant Local #376 Fire Fighters Union, International Association of Fire Fighters (“Local #376”) is a local chapter of the International Association of Fire Fighters, a union of professional fire fighters and paramedics. Local #376 is a labor organization within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 2000e(d). Local #376 is named as aparty pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a). 6. The City of Pontiac and Local #376 have entered into and maintained collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”) regarding various aspects of work and terms and conditions of employment at the PFD. Since 1984, these CBAs have contained a dual system for both hire and promotion based upon race and sex. 7. The CBA currently in force requires that hiring in the PFD be subject to the following race and sex-based criteria: Dual lists will be established with one list being all candidates in total score order and the second list a special list of the minorities, including women, in total score order. Iliring will be made from the first list in order except that at least one (1) minority must be hired of every t h e e (3) hires. In order to achieve this, the second list will be used if there is not at least one (1) minority for every three (3) hires from the first list. This dual list procedure will be in effect through the duration of the contract. 8. The CBA currently in force requires that various promotions in the PFD be subject to the following race and sex-based criteria: Dual lists will be estabhhed with one being in score order for all the candidates and the second list being the minorities, including women, in score order. Promotions are to be made from the first list except that at least one (1) minority will be promoted out of every three (3) promotion&. The second list will be used to accomplish t h s if the first list does not result in at least one (1) minority promoted out of every three (3) promotions. The dual list will be in effect though the duration of the contract. 9. The City of Pontiac, through the PFD,has pursued and continues to pursue policies and practices that discriminate against appIicants for employment and employees based on race and sex in violation of Section 703(a) of Title VII,42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a), by explicitly creating and maintaining a dual system for hire and promotion requiring that one out of every t h e e hires or promotions be given to a “minority.” As set forth above, the term “minority” includes women as used in the CBA. 10. The acts, omissions, policies and practices of the City of Pontiac described in paragraphs 6-9, supra, constitute a pattern or practice of: (a) resistance to the full enjoyment by non-minorities of their rights to equal employment opportunities in the PFD without discrimination based on race; and (b) resistance to the full enjoyment by men of their rights to equal employment opportunities in the PFD without discrimination based on sex, in violation of Section 707 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. S 2000e-6. This pattern or practice is of such a nature and is intended to deny the fir11 exercise of the rights secured by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. Unless enjoined by order of this Court, the City of Pontiac will continue to pursue policies and practices that are the same as or similar to those alleged in this Complaint. I 1.

MARTIN, CRAIG MILLER, BRENDA CANNELLA, and CINDY O'BOYLE, by and through their attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom, for their complaint against the Defendants above-named, state as follows: l. NATURE OF THE CfION 1. This lawsuit seeks judicial review of Defendants' violations ofthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000bb et seq. (herein ""RFRA""), the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.c. each and every human person is created in the image of God and that it is contrary to God's will to interfere with human conception with contraceptives or to destroy innocent human life by abortion or by the use of abortion-inducing drugs and devices. Thus, FOCUS holds, as a matter of religious conviction, that it is immoral for FOCUS to intentionally participate in, pay for, train others to engage in, enable or otherwise support or facilitate access to access to contraceptives, sterilization, abortion, abortion-inducing drugs, devices, and services. 6. Though a religious organization, FOCUS does not qualify for the extraordinarily narrow religious exemption from the Mandate. That narrow religious exemption protects thousands of ""churches, their integrated auxiliaries, conventions or associations of churches"" and ""the exclusively religious activities of any religious order"", but does not protect FOCUS. 78 Fed Reg. 39,870 (July 2, 2013). 7. In addition, though thousands of other secular organizations have been exempted from the Mandate for purely secular reasons, FOCUS has not been so exempted. For example, employers with so-called ""grandfathered"" plans, i.e., plans in existence before March 23, 2010, are exempted from the Mandate and encompass tens of millions of women. Defendants have also recently admitted that ""church plans"" exempt from ERISA are also exempt from penalties attached to the Mandate, and those plans likewise encompass thousands of non-exempt nonprofit religious organizations otherwise indistinguishable from FOCUS. 8. Defendants have offered FOCUS and other non-exempt religious organizations a socalled ""accommodation"" of their religious beliefs and practices. However, this alleged ""accommodation"" fails and conscripts FOCUS into compliance with the Mandate, forcing FOCUS to obtain an insurer or a third party insurance claims administrator, and to complete and submit a government form that specifically causes that insurer or third party administrator to arrange payment for the objectionable drugs and devices, so that such coverage will apply to FOCUS's own employees as a direct consequence of their employment with FOCUS and of their participation in the health insurance benefits FOCUS provides to them. 9. Under the supposed ""accommodation,"" the government continues to treat entities like FOCUS as second-class religious organizations, not entitled to the same religious freedom rights as substantially similar religious entities, or even the myriad of secular entities, that qualify for the exemption from the Mandate. 10. Defendants have determined to exempt churches and integrated auxiliaries from the Mandate because they surmise that employees of such religious entities are likely to share the religious convictions of such entities. Clearly, though not understood or recognized by the Defendants, this rationale applies equally to FOCUS and its employees. 11. Instead, Defendants seek to force FOCUS and other similarly situated religious nonprofits not eligible for Defendants' exemption to comply with the Mandate without regard to their sincerely held faith beliefs. 12. Indeed, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius stated that: ""[A]s of August every employee who doesn't work directly for a church or a diocese will be included in the [Mandate] benefit package,"" and ""Catholic hospitals, Catholic universities, other religious entities will be providing [contraceptive and abortifacient] coverage to their employees starting August 13. Defendants' so-called ""accommodation"" does not offer religious liberty protections to FOCUS; if FOCUS follows its religious convictions and declines to participate in Defendants' scheme, FOCUS will face, among other injuries, enormous fines that could exceed $16,000,000. It also forces the individual plaintiff employees of FOCUS, CURTIS A.

Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp. is a national supplier of fasteners, headquartered in Portage, MI. It is licensed to do business in 50 states and employs a total of 187 employees. 4. Plaintiffs provide self-funded health insurance through Midwest Fastener Corp., to employees and their dependents. Approximately 91 employees (and their dependents) of Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp., Inc. are currently covered by this group health insurance plan. Each of the members of the DeVries Plaintiffs are believing and practicing Christians and each believes the Holy Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God and that the Holy Bible instructs that each human life, which begins at conception, is created in God’s image, that God mandates respect for the sanctity of each human life, and that abortion and abortion-inducing drugs result in the wrongful taking of a human life. 5.

The Plaintiffs have a nongrandfathered plan, do not benefit from any exceptions, and must provide these services. These services have been defined by the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) to include “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.” HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines, http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ (referred to hereinafter the “HHS Mandate”). 6. In the category of “FDA-approved contraceptives” included in this HHS Mandate are several drugs or devices that may cause the demise of an already-conceived but not-yetimplanted human embryo, such as “emergency contraception” or “Plan B” drugs (the so-called “morning after” pill) and “ellaTM” (the so-called “week after” pill) which studies show can function to kill embryos even after they have implanted in the uterus by a mechanism similar to the abortion drug RU-486. 7. The DeVries Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp have always maintained objections on the basis of their religious beliefs to supporting either directly or indirectly the use of any drugs or procedures intended for the purposes of inducing an abortion or otherwise terminating an embryo. Such drugs or procedures are referred to collectively herein as “Abortifacients” 8. Over the last several months, the DeVries Plaintiffs have become aware that many citizens of the United States who hold the same or similar religious beliefs as do the DeVries Plaintiffs have, as a result of such religious beliefs, challenged the application of the HHS Mandate to them and to their for-profit businesses.

Trump; Eugene Scalia, United States Secretary of Labor; and the United States Department of Labor (collectively, “Defendants”) for violations of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Every nation’s history includes unsettling truths that many would prefer to forget or deny. But true patriotism demands confronting the truths of our history—no matter how embarrassing or dishonorable—and undertaking the difficult work of learning from the lessons of our past in order to move forward. For the United States, that work requires reckoning with our shameful legacy of racial subjugation of Black people in this country— from slavery and Jim Crow to mass incarceration and police violence—as well as our long history of express discrimination against other people of color, women, and LGBTQ persons. 2. Without uninhibited discussion and examination of that legacy, we are ill-equipped as a nation to address its ongoing manifestations in present-day forms of discrimination and bias. The First Amendment protection of free speech in the United States Constitution ensures that all Americans are empowered to engage freely in an exchange of ideas, truth-telling, and difficult conversations about this history. This protection extends equally to those who engage with the federal government, where the policies that affect the lives of all Americans are developed, enacted, and funded. 3. On September 22, 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order 13950, entitled “Executive Order on Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping” (“EO 13950” or “the Order”). Contrary to its title, the Order is an extraordinary and unprecedented act by the Trump Administration to undermine efforts to foster diversity and inclusion in the workplace. The Order strikes at the heart of those critical efforts by government and nongovernment actors—including trainings and other forms of private speech in the workplace—to eradicate race and sex stereotyping and other continuing manifestations of entrenched discrimination and bias against people of color, women, and LGBTQ individuals. 4. EO 13950 prohibits the National Urban League, the National Fair Housing Alliance, and Class members (including current and prospective federal contractors and grant recipients) from discussing and promoting concepts like, among other things, systemic race and sex discrimination and implicit race and sex biases. In so doing, EO 13950 prevents Plaintiffs from effectively addressing the persistent harms, privileges, and disadvantages associated with systemic discrimination and implicit biases. This broad-based prohibition of private speech on matters of immense public concern and public welfare violates the guarantees of Free Speech, Equal Protection, and Due Process, which are fundamental to the rights secured in the United States Constitution. The depth and scope of EO 13950’s constitutional flaws are alarming and, if left unremedied, will erode the core principles of our democracy and the foundations of our pluralistic society. 5. The right to Free Speech, secured in the First Amendment, is foundational to a free and democratic republic.

","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL FAIR HOUSING ALLIANCE 1101 Vermont Ave NW, Suite 710 Washington, DC 20005, TEXAS LOW INCOME HOUSING INFORMATION SERVICE 1800 W and TEXAS APPLESEED 1609 Shoal Creek, Suite 201 Austin, TX 78701, Plaintiffs, v. BEN CARSON, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in his official capacity, and U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, Defendants. Civ. Action No. _1_:1_8_-_c_v-01076 COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Fifty years ago, Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601, et seq. That Act is best known for barring a variety of forms of housing discrimination. Less attention has been paid to its requirement that the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) “administer the programs and activities relating to housing and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of” that Act Id. <unk>3608(e)(5). Although this Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) requirement was of great importance to Congress in enacting the Act, for decades, HUD inadequately enforced it. The agency has permitted more than 1,200 grantees—mostly local and state government entities—to collectively accept billions of dollars in federal housing funds annually without requiring them to take meaningful steps to address racial segregation and other fair housing problems that have long plagued their communities. 2. Recognizing that the AFFH requirement had not been adequately enforced, HUD in 2015 promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking the AFFH Rule, a regulation requiring covered cities and counties around the country to take meaningful action to address longstanding segregation and otherwise effectuate the Fair Housing Act’s unrealized purposes. The AFFH Rule creates a rigorous process to ensure that recipients of federal housing funds identify local fair housing problems and then commit to taking concrete steps to correct them (under HUD’s supervision and with considerable community input), while giving those jurisdictions flexibility to respond to local conditions. At the Rule’s core is the requirement that jurisdictions prepare and submit for HUD review an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH), a document that includes both the jurisdiction’s diagnosis of fair housing impediments and a plan to overcome them. 3. In January 2018, HUD abruptly announced that it was suspending for years the requirement that jurisdictions prepare AFHs and submit them for HUD review, effectively suspending the Rule itself. Plaintiffs National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), Texas Low Income Housing Information Service (Texas Housers), and Texas Appleseed bring this suit to challenge HUD’s suspension of the AFFH Rule’s requirements as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. <unk>500, et seq. 4. Before it promulgated the AFFH Rule, HUD engaged in little enforcement of this important provision of the Fair Housing Act, permitting its grantees to virtually ignore it. Even after a number of federal courts articulated the breadth of HUD’s obligations under the AFFH statutory provision, HUD required jurisdictions only to certify that, every few years, they analyzed barriers to fair housing in their communities, made gestures in the direction of solving them, and memorialized this analysis in their own files (never reviewed by HUD). As both HUD and the Government Accountability Office found, putting local jurisdictions on the honor system was ineffective. When pressed, many jurisdictions could not produce any documentation supporting their certifications; others had prepared documents that made no concrete promises or otherwise did not translate into action on the ground to address fair housing concerns. A False Claims Act suit against Westchester County, New York revealed that the County had certified compliance for years without ever assessing whether racial segregation was a problem, let alone committing to addressing the barriers to integration that were well known to exist in Westchester. 5. In response to these revelations, in 2009, HUD began an exhaustive, six-year process of crafting a more effective AFFH enforcement regime, culminating in the promulgation of the AFFH Rule in 2015. This Rule requires every covered jurisdiction to develop, submit for HUD review, and implement a planning document—called an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH)—that includes concrete plans to address local fair housing issues. It requires jurisdictions to provide wide notice and solicit public comment about fair housing problems in various communities; to consult with fair housing groups and other interested entities; and to encourage public comment on drafts of their AFHs. Jurisdictions must submit their AFHs for HUD review (along with their responses to comments from the public on those AFHs), and HUD must carefully review them, rejecting those AFHs not meeting specified requirements and requiring the submission of revised, compliant versions. In short, the AFFH Rule requires jurisdictions to take meaningful action to earn their federal housing funds by addressing local fair housing issues, while requiring HUD to monitor their compliance. It includes a schedule on which various jurisdictions are to submit their first AFHs, beginning","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2019 | District of Columbia | U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ||| Fair Housing Act ||| HUD ||| January 2020 | ||| ||| March 2020 ||| June 2020 .<n>On January 2019, a group of low-income residents filed a suit in the District Court for the District of Washington, alleging that HUD's failure to enforce the fair housing provisions of the Fair Housing act violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.

Fatally missing from the Complaint are any allegations of injuries suffered by the Resident Plaintiffs as a result of not receiving a reasonable accommodation. Regardless, none of the plaintiffs, including the corporate plaintiffs, Boca House and Awakenings, can state a cause of action against the City under the FHAA or ADA for the City's purported failure to allow a reasonable accommodation from the City's Unrelated Person Limitation because the complaint is absent of any allegation that the plaintiffs ever made a request for a reasonable accommodation from that limitation. They also fail to allege what specific accommodation they were seeking, and it cannot be ascertained, based on the allegations in the Complaint, whether such requested accommodation would be reasonable or even necessary matters that a plaintiff must demonstrate when making a claim under the FHAA and ADA.

Moreover, Boca House and Awakenings are not entitled to seek lost profits under the ADA because profit margins and loss of business opportunities do not directly benefit those handicapped individuals that the ADA is designed to protect. Lastly, the Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action for violation of their Equal Protection rights that purportedly underlies their claim under 42 U.S.c. <unk>1983. The alleged constitutional violation is based on the same exact facts and allegations as their claims under the FHAA and ADA, does not allege anything more than certain ""buzz words,"" and does not demonstrate, in any way, how their Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment have been violated. Accordingly, the Complaint should be dismissed.

This action is brought by the United States on behalf of John Peet, pursuant to Section 812(o) of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3612(o). JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1345 and 42 U.S.C. <unk>3612(o). 3. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) because the actions giving rise to the United States’ allegations occurred in the District of Minnesota, and the subject property is located in the District of Minnesota. PARTIES AND PROPERTY 4. John Peet is an African-American male and is a resident of the District of Minnesota. 5. The subject property is located at 402 East 6. Defendant Loki Properties LLP (“Loki Properties”) is a Minnesota limited liability partnership and has its principal place of business at 1547 Hay Creek Valley Road, Red Wing, Minnesota. At all times relevant to this action, Defendant Loki Properties owned the subject property at 402 East 7. Defendant Robert Ryan is a resident of Red Wing, Minnesota. At all times relevant to this action, Defendant Robert Ryan was a partner of Loki Properties. At all times relevant to this action, Loki Properties managed the subject property and participated in, among other things, the rental of apartments. 2 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 8. The subject property is a two-story apartment building with four units. Two units are located on the ground floor and two on the second floor. 9. John Peet is a participant in the Red Wing Housing and Redevelopment Authority (“RWHRA”) Section 8 voucher program (a government program that provides rental housing subsidies to low-income individuals and families). In or around July 2008, RWHRA’s housing choice voucher program coordinator, Becky Hinrichs, provided Mr. Peet with a list of housing providers accepting Section 8 vouchers in the Red Wing area. The subject property was listed on that list. 10. In or around late July or early August 2008, Mr. Peet first contacted Defendant Ryan by telephone to inquire about renting an apartment Mr. Peet spoke to Defendant Ryan, who told him that staff from RWHRA had already contacted him and “vouched” for Mr Peet. Defendant Ryan advised Mr. Peet that the subject property was undergoing renovations and invited Mr. Peet to inspect the subject property. At that time, Defendant Ryan also told Mr. Peet that he did not need to submit an application, but that he would need to provide his Section 8 paperwork. 11. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Peet visited the subject property and met with Defendant Ryan in person. Defendant Ryan informed Mr. Peet that he could choose the unit he was interested in renting Mr. Peet inspected the units and expressed an interest in units 3 and 4 (the “second-floor units”) Mr. Peet also provided Defendant Ryan with his Section 8 paperwork at that time. Defendant Ryan informed Mr. Peet that a unit would be ready for occupancy by October 1, 2008. 12. On or about September 1, 2008, a tenant named Julie Corks leased unit 1, one of the first-floor units, at the subject property. Julie Corks is a white female. 13. In or around September 2008, Mr. Peet contacted Defendant Ryan to inquire about the progress of the repairs. Defendant Ryan stated that a unit would be ready for occupancy in early to mid-October 2008. Defendant Ryan also informed Mr. Peet that he had lost Mr. Peet’s Section 8 paperwork and requested that Mr. Peet leave a new copy in the mailbox near unit 2 at the subject property Mr. Peet completed and resubmitted the paperwork as Defendant Ryan requested. 14. During the time Mr. Peet waited for the renovations to be completed on the second-floor units, he requested and received an extension to his Section 8 voucher from RWHRA. 15. On or about October 17, 2008, Mr. Peet contacted Defendant Ryan to inquire about completion of the renovations on the second-floor units. Defendant Ryan informed Mr. Peet for the first time that “it would not work,” or words to that effect.

Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the District Court retained jurisdiction to resolve disputes between the parties until October 2015.

Plaintiffs National Fair Housing Alliance (""NFHA"") and Paralyzed Veterans of America (""Paralyzed Veterans"") hereby bring this civil rights action against the builder, designer, manager and current owners of multifamily apartment complexes designed and/or built by Defendant HHHunt Corporation (""HHHunt"") for monetary, declaratory and injunctive relief arising from violations of the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHA), 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601-3619. The FHA requires that certain apartment complexes built for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 be designed and constructed with accessible and adaptable features for people with disabilities. 2. Since at least 2002, the Design/Build Defendants, who are later defined herein, have engaged in a continuous pattern or practice ofdiscrimination against people with disabilities in violation of the FHA by designing and/or constructing multifamily dwellings, and the common use and public use areas associated with those dwellings (hereafter referred to as ""covered units"" or ""covered apartment complexes""), at seven apartment complexes tested by Plaintiffs, as to deny people with disabilities full access to, and the use of, these facilities as required under the FHA. The seven apartment complexes are: Auston Chase in Ridgeland, South Carolina; Abberly at West Ashley in Charleston, South Carolina; Ashton Pointe in Beaufort, South Carolina; Abberly Place in Garner, North Carolina; Auston Grove in Raleigh, North Carolina; Abberly GreenMooresville in Mooresville, North Carolina; and Auston Woods in Charlotte, North Carolina (hereinafter the 'Tested Properties""). Some of these Tested Properties have apartment buildings with covered units that were first occupied within two years of the filing of this Complaint. The Design/Build Defendants' violations of the FHA at these apartment complexes are serial and frequent, and they continue 20 years after the effective date ofthe FHA accessibility requirements. 3. The Design/Build Defendants' violations of the FHA accessibility requirements have serious and significant consequences for people with disabilities. As outlined below, many complexes have steps, curbs without curb cuts, excessive running and cross slopes, and primary entry doors with high thresholds impeding the only route of travel for people with mobility impairments to travel to covered units. There is insufficient centered clear floor space for people in wheelchairs at bathroom toilets, lavatories and tubs, and at kitchen sinks. There are inaccessible routes to public- and common-use areas that can be blocked by parked cars, designated accessible parking which lacks the required access aisle for people with mobility impairments to leave or enter their parked vehicles, common-use restrooms which lack the required clear floor space for people with mobility impairments, sinks with insufficient clear floor space for wheelchairs and exposed hot water and drain pipes at roll-under sinks, environmental controls beyond the reach range of wheelchair users, computer tables with work surfaces that are excessively high for people in wheelchairs, exercise facilities with narrow access aisles that block access to machines for wheelchair users- all in violation ofthe FHA's accessibility requirements. These blatant violations, and many others, effectively communicate that people with disabilities are not welcome at the Tested Properties. 4.

","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA TALLAHASSEE DIVISION J.R., Plaintiff, v. Case No.: MICHAEL HANSEN, in his Official Capacity as Director of the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Plaintiff, J.R., brings this action to redress violations of his Due Process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. J.R. is diagnosed with mild mental retardation.1 On October 26, 2004, J.R. was involuntarily committed to residential services pursuant to Florida’s law governing civil commitment of persons with developmental disabilities: Section 393.11 of the Florida Statutes. Florida law does not provide for any type of periodic review for individuals committed pursuant to Section 393.11 of the Florida Statutes. As a result of this omission, the continued 1 The developmental disabilities community encourages use of the term “intellectual disability” in lieu of “retardation” or “mental retardation.” See R.L.

The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 as this action arises under the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1343(a)(3) as this action seeks to redress for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 1988. 3.

Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) and N.D Fla. Loc R. 3.1 because a substantial number of the events and omissions giving rise to J.R.’s claims occurred in the District. PARTIES 5. Plaintiff, J.R., a person with mental retardation, has been involuntarily committed to residential services pursuant to Section 393.11 of the Florida Statutes. J.R. has never received any periodic review of his continued need for involuntary confinement to residential services. 6. Defendant, Michael Hansen, is the Director of the Agency for Persons with Disabilities (“APD”). APD is the state agency responsible for all services provided to persons with developmental disabilities under Chapter 393 of the Florida Statutes Fla Stat. <unk>20.197. As the director of APD, Defendant is responsible for the custody and care of all those committed under Section 393.11 of the Florida Statutes, including the adoption and implementation of any policies related to that commitment. Defendant Hansen is sued in his official capacity for the purposes of declaratory and injunctive relief. FACTS 7. J.R. is a person with mental retardation. 8. On May 23, 2003, a petition was filed to seek the involuntary commitment of J.R. pursuant to Section 393.11 of the Florida Statutes which governs the involuntary commitment of persons with developmental disabilities in Florida. 9. On October 12, 2004, a hearing was convened in the Twentieth Judicial Circuit in Lee County, Florida to determine whether J.R. was in need of involuntary commitment pursuant to Section 393.11 of the Florida Statutes. 10. Once a person is committed pursuant to the authority of Section 393.11 of the Florida Statutes, the person’s commitment will continue until the court, which retains jurisdiction throughout the commitment, releases the individual from the order Fla Stat. <unk>393.11(11). Thus, the commitment order is of indefinite duration. Id. 11. At the time of the hearing, the court found that: a. J.R. is a person with mental retardation; b. Placement in a residential setting was the least restrictive and most appropriate alternative to meet J.R.’s treatment and supervision needs; and c. As a result of J.R.’s mental retardation, i. He lacked sufficient capacity to consent to a voluntary application for services from the state agency responsible for the care of persons with developmental disabilities, and lacked basic survival or self-care skills to such a degree that close supervision and habilitation in a residential setting was necessary and, if not provided, could have resulted in a threat of substantial harm to his well-being; or ii.

Additionally included as a Plaintiff in this action are two Illinois non-profit advocacy organizations, the Illino is League of Advocates for the Developm entally Disabled, Inc., and the Murray Parents Association. These organizations support indi viduals with severe and profound mental and/or physical disabilities, and also oppose the Stat e’s plan (the “Plan”) under which the Defendants’ seek to close all State Operated Developm ental Centers for the Developmentally Disabled (“SODCs”) and, to that end, have already removed all the residents of one such facility (the Jacksonville Developm ental Center) and are imminently prepared to close another (the Murray Developm ental Center), with more to follow shortly thereaf ter. A true and accurate copy of the State Plan is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit A.1 3. Collectively, the Individual Plaintiffs and Plaintiff-Class Members oppose the Plan because it is b eing undertaken against the legal guardians’ will and against the will of th e guardian-charges’ current caretakers.

This is a class action brought on behalf of all legal hourly-paid workers, 4 who have been employed by any entity owned or operated by the defendants, 5 including Fruit Patch, Inc. of Reedley, California. Mr. Hernandez contends that the defendants (hereafter “the Balakians”) have 8 depressed his wages as an agricultural worker at Fruit Patch Inc. by knowingly 9 employing vast numbers of illegal immigrants there for the express purpose of 10 depressing the market price for unskilled labor. (This is referred to as “the Illegal 12 Immigrant Hiring Scheme” or “the Scheme”.) 2. The Illegal Immigrant Hiring Scheme violates the Racketeer Influenced 14 and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. <unk>1961 et seq. It is perpetrated 16 every day, as an integral part of the Balakian’s regular manner of staffing their 17 orchards, and will continue unabated, victimizing every legal worker, until halted by judicial intervention. 20 II. PARTIES, JURISDICTION VENUE 3. Plaintiff Jose Hernandez is a citizen of California. He was legally authorized to be employed in the U.S. when he was employed by Fruit Patch, Inc., as 24 an hourly paid farmworker. Fruit Patch Inc. is owned and operated by the Balakians. 25 Mr. Hernandez’s wages as an agricultural worker for Fruit Patch Inc. were set by the CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 1 Balakians at a level which was depressed as a direct result of the Illegal Immigrant Hiring Scheme they perpetrated. 4. Leo Balakian and his sons, Anthony and Vince Balakian, are citizens of 5 California. They have conspired to operate Fruit Patch Inc. and other agricultural growing businesses they own or operate (hereafter “the other entities”) through a 8 pattern of racketeering activity, the Illegal Immigrant Hiring Scheme. 5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this case as a federal question, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 18 U.S.C. <unk>1964(c). 6. Venue is proper in this District because the illegal acts giving rise to this 13 case occurred in this district and all parties reside here. III. CLASS ALLEGATIONS 7. This action is brought and may be maintained as a class action pursuant 17 to FED R. CIV P. 23(b)(3) Mr. Hernandez brings this action on behalf of himself and all other persons legally authorized to be employed in the U.S. who have been 20 employed by Fruit Patch Inc. and the other entities owned and/or operated by any of 21 the three Defendants in the last four years (hereafter the “Class” or “Class members”) as hourly or piece rate unskilled laborers. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 8. The Class is so numerous that joinder of all Class members is impracticable. The actual number can be ascertained through discovery of the various 4 entities’ records. 9. Among the questions of fact and law that are common to the Class are: a. Whether the Defendants have been and are currently engaged in 8 the Illegal Immigrant Hiring Scheme in order to depress wages; b. To what extent the Illegal Immigrant Hiring Scheme has caused Class members’ wages to be depressed; and c. Whether the Illegal Immigrant Hiring Scheme violates the 13 Immigration and Nationality Act and RICO. 10. Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the members of the Class 16 inasmuch as their alleged damages were directly and proximately caused by the Illegal 17 Immigrant Hiring Scheme. Plaintiffs seek no relief that is antagonistic or adverse to other Class members. 11. Plaintiffs are committed to the vigorous prosecution of this action and 21 have retained counsel who are competent in the prosecution of RICO cases generally, and this legal theory in particular. Accordingly, Plaintiffs and their counsel will fairly 24 and adequately protect and represent the interests of the Class. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 12. Questions of law or fact that are common to the members of the Class are substantially similar and predominate over any questions affecting only individual 4 Class members, and a class action is the only appropriate method for the fair and 5 efficient adjudication of this controversy for the following reasons, among others: a. The individual amounts of damages involved, while not 8 insubstantial, are generally not large enough to justify","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Fruit Patch, Inc. of Reedley, California | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of California ||| Racketeer Influenced 14 and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) ||||| Fruit Patch Inc. ||| Defendants ||| August 2013 ||| September 2014 ||| December 2015 ||| January 2016 ||| February 2016 | ||| March 2017 ||| May 2018 ||| June 2019 ||| July 2019 |</s>"

Plaintiffs claimed the rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Plaintiffs successfully sought a preliminary nationwide injunction.  However, defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit and the nationwide scope of the injunction was stayed. Then the District Court restored the nationwide scope of the injunction on September 9, 2019, but the government again appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay pending disposition of the appeal in the 9th Circuit. The District Court issued a separate preliminary injunction against another rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in the closing days of the Trump Administration which was substantially similar to the one already enjoined.

The United States has a longstanding commitment under domestic and international 3 law to protecting people fleeing persecution from further harm. 2. The Immigration and Nationality Act reflects Congress’s carefully considered 5 balance between effectuating our broad, historic commitment to international humanitarian law 6 principles in the context of our asylum system and ensuring fairness and efficiency in the process. In 7 crafting our asylum laws, Congress sought to implement the principles in the 1951 Refugee 9 Convention, which was designed to avoid the horrors visited on refugees around World War II. 3. As part of our nation’s commitment to the protection of people fleeing persecution 11 and consistent with our international obligations, it is longstanding federal law that merely transiting 12 through a third country is not a basis to categorically deny asylum to refugees who arrive at our 13 shores. 14 4. Specifically, Congress expressly provided in the Immigration and Nationality Act 15 (“INA”) that a noncitizen is ineligible for asylum in the United States only if she “was firmly 16 17 resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United States.” 8 U.S.C. <unk>1158(b)(2)(A)(vi). 18 The concept of firm resettlement—which involves far more than a mere transitory relationship with 19 a third country—dates back to international agreements crafted after World War II, and takes into 20 account the ties an individual fleeing persecution formed with another country and his or her 21 particular ability to enjoy safety and legal protection there. 22 5. Moreover, Congress expressly spoke to when an asylum seeker may be removed to a 23 third country and required to seek protection there: only where the United States and that country 24 25 have entered into a bilateral or multilateral agreement, the removal is pursuant to that agreement, and 26 there is a determination that the asylum seeker would not face persecution and “would have access to 27 a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum” in that country. 8 U.S.C.

Trump is determined to prevent immigrants of color from 3 coming to and remaining in the United States. As part of this broad effort, the administration has 4 promulgated a “public charge” regulation, which erects hurdles to family-based immigration that 5 Congress has not authorized. This unlawful regulation harms and specifically targets immigrants 6 of color. 2. Defendants’ “public charge” regulation (“Regulation”) violates the Administrative 8 Procedure Act (“APA”) and the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. 9 Constitution. The Regulation is squarely at odds with the language of the statute, its century-long 10 interpretation, and Congress’s purpose in enacting the statute. It is arbitrary and capricious and 11 motivated by animus toward non-white immigrants. 3. The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) bars an individual from obtaining a 13 green card or from obtaining certain visas if the person is “likely at any time to become a public 14 charge.” Since Congress first introduced the term in the immigration context in 1882, “public 15 charge” has been understood to mean only someone who is primarily dependent on the 16 government to avoid destitution (i.e., someone who is effectively a “charge” or ward of the state). 17 From its first use in the immigration laws, “public charge” was included alongside other grounds 18 of inadmissibility that necessitate reliance on the government to avoid destitution, such as 19 “paupers,” “professional beggars,” and “insane persons.” Congress has never altered the long- 20 standing meaning of “public charge” as articulated by the courts and administrative agencies. 21 “Public charge” has never been understood to reach immigrants who, like the majority of citizens 22 in the United States, may at some point in their lives receive supplemental health care, nutrition, or 23 housing assistance to improve their lives and those of their families. 4. Acting unilaterally and without congressional approval, Defendants now deviate 25 from the established meaning of the term public charge, dramatically expanding it to effect a sea- 26 change in immigration law. The Regulation treats as a public charge any immigrant found to be 27 more likely than not, at any time over his or her lifetime, to receive any amount of benefits from a 28 wide range of supplemental public benefits programs. COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF Case No. 19-4980 5. The targeted benefits include health care coverage (non-emergency Medicaid for 2 non-pregnant adults), housing assistance (Section 8 and public housing), and food assistance 3 (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or “SNAP”). Indeed, one in four U.S. citizens (over 4 70 million individuals) participate in one or more of these programs in any given year.

COMPLAINT Plaintiff sues the Defendants in this civil action. The Defendants’ Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) from June 15, 2012 and new November 20, 2014, Executive Order Amnesty (EOA) programs are unconstitutional abuses of the President’s role in our nation’s constitutional architecture and exceed the powers of the President within the U.S Constitution. Even where Congress has granted authority to the executive branch, these programs are ultra vires, exceeding the bounds of delegated authority. While Defendant Obama hijacks the language of previous immigration regulation and law, Defendant Obama fundamentally transforms the definition of key terms to create a radically new and different regime of immigration law and regulation. DACA and EOA are sweeping changes to immigration law and regulation, operate on a “wholesale” level upon broad categories rather than “retail” as an individualized adjudication of persons one at a time, operate in and modify areas already regulated differently by existing regulations, and are a dramatic departure from prior interpretation and application of existing law and regulations. Yet the Obama Administration purports to effect these dramatic changes by Executive Order announced by the President, implemented through his Cabinet Secretaries. Even if the Court deems this constitutional, DACA and EOA are exercises of delegated law-making authority by the executive branch which must first go through rigid rule-making procedures under the Administrative Procedures Act. The President cannot simply announce sweeping new rules and implement them by giving a speech. Alternatively, Plaintiff challenges these executive branch actions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>702 through 706 as unlawful and invalid as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, unreasonable, and/or otherwise not in accordance with law. Plaintiff seeks a Declaratory Judgment, and preliminary and permanent injunctions. Plaintiff also challenges the executive branch action under this Circuit’s Nondelegation Doctrine. As grounds therefore, Plaintiff alleges as follows: INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY Defendant Obama has announced and initiated actions under his purported inherent authority as President of the United States to grant amnesty by Executive Order, or more precisely by giving directions to Cabinet Secretaries. The President states that he is doing so because he does not like the legislative decisions of the Congress. In fact, “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.” Article I, Section 1, of the U.S Constitution. “The Congress shall have Power... To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” Article I, Section 8, of the U.S Constitution. There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution which offers any authority or role of the executive branch with regard to immigration, admission of aliens to the country, or naturalization or citizenship other than the President’s duty that he “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed....” Article II, Section 3, of the U.S Constitution. Defendant Obama has already purported to give amnesty, the status of lawful presence in the United States, and even the right to work lawfully in the United States to 611, 9531 illegal aliens classified as “Dreamers” who arrived illegally in the United States with their parents. 1 U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, Number cf I-821p (Mar. 2014) available at http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigrati on%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/I821d_daca_fy2014qtr2.pdf The Department of Homeland Security admits that these initiatives are “unprecedented.” Despite the attempt to use familiar terminology, these initiatives are a dramatic departure from past precedent, interpretation, and application of immigration law.

CLASS COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. This lawsuit is about hundreds of people who lawfully presented at official ports of entry along the Southern U.S. border to claim their right to seek asylum, only to be confined indefinitely in remote immigration jails across the Deep South. They have all demonstrated a credible fear of persecution and are now in removal proceedings before the Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”). 2. Current law denies them the right to petition immigration judges for their release from custody. Instead, they must ask their jailer, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), to grant them release on parole for the duration of their asylum proceedings. Fewer than 10 years ago, DHS released roughly 90 percent of such asylum seekers. Now, release rates have plummeted to the single digits. In no jurisdiction is the release rate lower than in the New Orleans Field Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), where, across the five states under its jurisdiction—Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee—only two (2) of 130 release requests were granted last year. 3. A binding 2009 policy directs ICE to release such asylum seekers, provided they establish their identity and show they are not a danger or flight risk. Despite that, in November 2018, high-ranking ICE officials disavowed the agency’s obligations under the policy in response to a question from the American Immigration Lawyers Association about whether the policy remained in effect in the jurisdiction of the New Orleans ICE Field office: “Technically no, by Executive Order. However, there is an injunction in certain field offices outside the New Orleans AOR [Area of Responsibility].”1 4. The statement by the New Orleans ICE Field Office confirmed that this jurisdiction, like other ICE jurisdictions across the country, had effectively rescinded the 2009 policy. 5. The statement by the New Orleans ICE Field Office contradicts other public agency documents and even the agency’s representations to courts. In a February 2017 memorandum implementing an Executive Order, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly wrote that the 2009 policy “shall remain in full force and effect.”2 DHS has made the same representation before the U.S. Supreme Court.3 In the Damus v. Nielsen litigation pending before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, DHS has stated in oral argument that the 2009 policy is binding upon the agency.4 6. Across the five Southern states under the command of the New Orleans ICE Field Office, hundreds of asylum seekers are incarcerated for months on end, enduring abuses in confinement in exchange for the right to press their claims in court. ICE’s refusal to consider the release of these asylum seekers on a case-by-case basis violates federal law, costs taxpayers 1 Email from Brian Acuna, New Orleans ICE Assistant Field Office Director, New Orleans ICE Field Office, to ICE Liaison, Brian Acuna to American Immigration Lawyers Association – Midsouth Chapter (Nov. 29, 2018) (attached as Ex.

This action is brought by migrant agricultural workers who were admitted to the United States to work under the H-2B temporary foreign worker visa program. The Plaintiffs have been employed in the forestry operations of the Defendants at various times during the period from June 1999 through the filing of this Complaint.

This action is brought on behalf of a class of over 1500 predominantly Guatemalan, Mexican and Honduran migrant workers who planted trees and performed other forestry-related activities for the Defendants. The Plaintiffs and other class members are indigent migrant workers who the Defendants brought to the United States on temporary, H-2B work visas. The Plaintiffs and other class members left their homes and families and spent considerable money and effort to. come to the United States to perform arduous jobs, which the Defendants have certified that American workers were not willing to do. 3. Almost all of the Plaintiffs and other class members are non-English speakers who had little, if any, understanding of their legal rights while working in the United States as H-2B forestry workers particularly their legal rights to receive a prevailing hourly wage and overtime pay. The Defendants took full advantage of the Plaintiffs' and other class members' indigence, inability to speak or understand English, and their lack of understanding of the laws of the United States to grossly underpay them. 4. The Plaintiffs and many other class members were required by Defendants' agents to leave the deeds to their homes or land in Guatemala with the Plaintiffs and other class members were thus particularly vulnerable to coercion and exploitation by the Defendants, as they believed they might lose their property if they failed to comply with the directives of the Defendants. 5. The Plaintiffs seek an award of unpaid wages, an award of money damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief to make them whole for damages they suffered due to the Defendants' violations of law and to ensure that they and other H-2B workers will not be subjected by the Defendants to such illegal conduct in the future.

The plaintiffs dismissed their claims without explanation on June 28, 2019.","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS EASTERN DIVISION COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS--CHICAGO, Plaintiff, v. UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP IMMIGRATION SERVICES, and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, Defendants. Case No. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 against defendant United States Citizenship Immigration Services (“USCIS”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) (collectively, “the Defendants”), for declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief, seeking the disclosure of records concerning a policy called the Controlled Application Review Resolution Program (“CARRP”), which imposes extra-statutory rules and criteria to delay and deny immigration benefits to which applicants are entitled. Defendants have failed to respond to a request properly made by Plaintiff Council on American-Islamic Relations—Chicago (“CAIR-Chicago”), and have unreasonably denied a request to expedite the requested records. INTRODUCTION 1. Under the CARRP program, Muslim applicants for numerous immigration benefits, including those seeking to naturalize as American citizens, have had their applications delayed and ultimately denied without legal authority, and without even being informed of the existence of the program. 2. In order to obtain information about the extent of the CARRP’s program impact on Muslim applicants for immigration benefits, on August 1, 2017, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to Defendants seeking the release of agency records concerning demographic information and processing times for individuals applying for naturalization, change of status, and asylum since April 11, 2008, when USCIS instituted CARRP. On September 6, 2017, Plaintiff revised the timeframe for which it is seeking the associated records. 3. Plaintiff also requested that Defendants expedite processing of the request under 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(6) based upon the urgency to inform the public about religious discrimination against Muslim applicants—which is the subject of great public interest—and based upon the status of the Plaintiff as an organization primarily engaged in civil rights advocacy and disseminating information to the public about civil rights violations. 4. The Defendants’ denial of the Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing, and the Defendants’ failure to make any determination concerning the requested records within the statutory time period, violates FOIA and is impeding the Plaintiffs’ efforts to educate the public about important government activities. 5. The requested information is of interest to a wide cross-section of the public given the breadth and nature of the CARRP program. Law-abiding, long-time residents of the United States, who otherwise meet the statutory criteria to be naturalized as American citizens, are subjected to protracted delays through the separate, discriminatory CARRP process. These populations have no route for recourse, often unaware of their presence on the unreviewable government watchlists used to buttress CARRP’s designation of applicants presenting “national security concerns.” The Defendants do not notify these populations that they consider them potential “national security concerns,” do not provide the reasons why they classify them in this way, and do not afford them any opportunity to address and correct any basis for these concerns. The public interest in the release of these records lies in the public knowledge of whether this policy exhibits discriminatory practices, which will be revealed by statistical analysis of these records on the part of Plaintiff. 6. Plaintiff therefore brings this action pursuant to FOIA, 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, for injunctive and declaratory relief to compel the release of agency records improperly being withheld by Defendants. PARTIES 7. Plaintiff CAIR-Chicago is a not-for-profit Muslim civil rights organization whose primary goal is “to promote and defend the constitutional rights of all Americans and to assist those who cannot attain justice themselves,” which is achieved through the provision of legal services, the dissemination of vital information and resources, and community advocacy and outreach. Plaintiff shares information with the CAIR National Office and CAIR chapters throughout the country. Plaintiff also provides the Muslim-American community with information about matters of public policy and civil rights as a service through daily news briefs, press releases and statements, community action alerts, and consulting other organizations on matters of public interest. 8.

INTRODUCTION 1. This is an action to declare invalid the federal defendants’ misinterpretation of Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. <unk>1226(c) (“mandatory detention” provision), and Section 303(b) (“Transitional Period Custody Rules” or “TPCR”) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”). Section 236(c) of the INA, in effect since October 9, 1998, requires the mandatory detention without bond of virtually all immigrants who commit a removable offense listed therein upon the immigrant’s release from the criminal custody that resulted from the offense. The TPCR provision, in effect until October 9, 1998, also required detention upon release for those who committed removable offenses listed therein—but did not preclude bond. The net result of these two provisions is that <unk>236(c) does not apply to: 1) anyone released from criminal custody for an offense covered by the statute, if the release occurred prior to October 9, 1998; and 2) anyone released from criminal custody for an offense not covered by the statute, even where the release occurred after 1998. Defendants have misinterpreted both of the above provisions by erroneously applying <unk>236(c)(1) to immigrants with pre-October 9, 1998 removable offenses upon an immigrant’s post-October 9, 1998 “release” from a subsequent, unrelated state or local custodial encounter that does not constitute a removable offense under <unk>236(c)(1). 2. Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent are immigrants unlawfully detained by defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Boston field office (“Boston ICE”) as a result of this misinterpretation. In erroneously subjecting plaintiffs and other class members to mandatory detention, defendants have deprived them of statutory and regulatory rights to be considered for release on bond under INA <unk>236(a), 8 U.S.C. <unk>1226(a), and under 8 C.F.R. <unk>1003.19(c)-(f). They have been or will be denied all opportunity to be heard concerning their suitability for release based upon evidence that they are not flight risks or a danger to their communities and that therefore no purpose is served by their detention. As a consequence of defendants’ actions, the individual plaintiffs and class members are suffering or will suffer unnecessary imprisonment, prolonged separation from family members, and economic harms, including lost business income, wages and property, as well as reduced ability to access legal services and develop and present their cases against removal. Plaintiffs also include two organizational plaintiffs—a national nonprofit immigration legal services provider and a local nonprofit immigration legal services provider that rely on limited resources and charitable contributions to assist the growing number of detainees, including unrepresented immigrants, held in Boston ICE’s New England contract detention facilities pursuant to contracts and/or agreements with the jailer defendants. 3.

The court granted a joint motion to stay the case on October 31, 2019, so parties could seek a nonjudicial resolution.

KENNETH THOMAS CUCCINELLI II, Acting Director, U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services, LORI PIETROPAOLI, Regional Director, Northeast Region U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services MICHAEL J. McCLEARY, Director, Boston Field Office, U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services, U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES, KEVIN K. McALEENAN, Acting Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, Defendants. COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION This lawsuit challenges the Trump Administration’s abrupt termination of a longstanding government program that protects seriously ill people from deportation and death. The Administration’s action is unconscionable. It is also illegal. For decades, the United States Customs and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) has operated a small but vital humanitarian program that allows immigrant families battling serious illnesses to request immigration relief in the form of “deferred action.” The program recognizes that deporting seriously ill individuals and their families is in many cases tantamount to a death sentence. Deferred action does not grant immigration status to beneficiaries; it confers other benefits, including an opportunity to apply for work authorization, the tolling of any accrual of “unlawful presence” that could bar future entry into the United States, and a measure of protection against removal proceedings by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). Those protected by this program are in dire straits. They include the mother of a U.S. citizen baby that has spent eight of the last ten months in the hospital; a ten-year-old girl with eye cancer; and a partially-immobilized 18-year-old boy with burns over 70% of his body. In August 2019, the Trump Administration abruptly prohibited USCIS field offices from granting deferred action in cases of serious medical need, and has now put the lives of scores of medically fragile individuals at immense and immediate risk. In doing so, the Administration provided no opportunity for notice-and-comment, or any other procedural protection that is required under the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”). Nor did the Administration provide any rationale for its abrupt termination of the program, as required by law. But the reasons for the Administration’s actions are all too clear: they are part of an overarching anti-immigrant agenda that is driven by racial and ethnic animus, and in this case additional animus against persons with disabilities. Throughout his campaign and presidency, Defendant Trump has derided and stoked animus against immigrants of color. Defendant Kenneth Cuccinelli, Acting Director of USCIS has similarly described undocumented immigrants as invaders and recently claimed, just days before USCIS began sending denial letters to people seeking deferred action, that the Statue of Liberty’s famous exhortation to “give me your tired, your poor” refers to “people coming from Europe....” Plaintiff Irish International Immigrant Center, Inc. (the “IIIC”) is a nonprofit organization based in Boston, Massachusetts that serves clients in Massachusetts who seek deferred action based on a serious medical need. At present, the IIIC represents individuals and families in 19 such cases, including children seeking treatment for illnesses such as cancer, cerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy—and the parents who care for them. Nearly all of the IIIC’s deferred action clients are people of color from countries in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Africa. The elimination of USCIS’s deferred action program has harmed the IIIC and endangered its clients. Deferred action benefits non-citizens with serious illness, their families, and the families of U.S. citizen children with serious illness. Without deferred action, the IIIC’s clients face the prospect of returning to countries where their life-preserving care cannot be continued, or being placed in removal proceedings. Many of the IIIC’s clients have been forced to contemplate the possibility of leaving behind minor children in the United States so that they can continue receiving essential care. USCIS’s decision has also wreaked havoc for the IIIC. The organization has not only dropped almost all other work in an effort to help save the lives of its clients and their family members, but it will now be tasked with the years-long commitment of representing these clients in complex immigration proceedings that will necessarily come at the expense of the IIIC’s other work, all while losing funding tied to work that it can no longer take on. Because eliminating the authority of USCIS field offices to grant deferred action to individuals with dire medical needs is arbitrary, capricious, and based on impermissible animus, it violates the APA and the Equal Protection guarantees of the U.S Constitution. The IIIC therefore asks this Court to declare the termination of USCIS’s deferred-action program unlawful and enjoin its enforcement.

Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States of America, the U.S. Department of State, and Michael R. Pompeo, in his official capacity as U.S. Secretary of State, and alleges as follows: 1. This case concerns President Trump’s ongoing, unlawful attempts to make it harder for underprivileged immigrants—from countries he has vilified—to come to the United States. Since President Trump took office, his administration has repeatedly tried to alter the longstanding rules regarding public charge, a provision of immigration law intended to prevent those who may become primarily dependent on public assistance from entering the country. The Trump Administration has done so despite expressly recognizing, as have past administrations and multiple federal agencies, that expanding the meaning of public charge threatens to deter immigrants, millions of whom are lawfully present in the United States or are naturalized citizens, from obtaining food, housing, medical care, and other necessities for which they and their families are indisputably eligible through public programs. 2. In particular, the Trump Administration recently began to enforce a set of changes it made to the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual (“FAM”) in January 2018, a set of instructions which dictate how consular officers are to determine whether a visa applicant is likely to become a public charge if admitted to the United States. The Trump Administration’s changes to the FAM put a thumb on the scale in favor of barring immigrants from the country if they have used any of a host of federal, state, or local programs—making it much harder for immigrants to reunite with their families. Specifically, those changes dramatically expand the range of benefits that may be considered by consular officials, referring to “public assistance of any kind”; they permit consular officers to look at the receipt of those benefits by the applicant’s entire household; and they decrease the weight a consular officer is permitted to give to a financial sponsor’s agreement to support the applicant. With respect to all of these changes, Defendants offered virtually no explanation for discarding the decades-old understanding of public charge. 3. Simultaneously, the Trump Administration has initiated a parallel rulemaking at the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to change the definition of public charge for other immigration determinations. That proposed rule has yet to take effect; recognizing the significance of these changes, DHS provided the public with notice, an explanation, and an opportunity for comment, as the law requires. 4. In contrast, Defendants met none of those requirements for the FAM changes. Defendants barely even alerted the public once the changes had been implemented. Yet those changes are in effect right now—directing how consular officers make visa decisions across the globe. That is the essence of procedurally infirm, arbitrary and capricious agency action. It is also unconstitutional: the Trump Administration’s demonstrated hostility toward the immigrants affected by the FAM change, and the discriminatory effects of that change, constitute a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection guarantees. 5. Defendants’ unlawful changes to the FAM have harmed cities across the country, including Plaintiff Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (“Baltimore”). Baltimore strives to be a welcoming city to the immigrants who have chosen to live there, providing them with access to the same programs and services it provides to all of its residents. As multiple federal agencies have repeatedly recognized, interpreting and applying public charge rules more stringently will deter, and in fact, is deterring, immigrants from accepting the public benefits Baltimore makes available to all of its residents. That dynamic frustrates an essential component of Baltimore’s mission; it forces Baltimore to devote additional resources to managing its programs; and it paradoxically encourages immigrants to consume other city services as they are deterred from enrolling in more appropriate federal programs. And the FAM change is counterproductive to boot: public benefits often put immigrants and their families on the path to self-sufficiency and success. Ultimately, the FAM change hurts","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2019 | District of Maryland | City Council of Baltimore | U.S. Department of State | President of the United States of America | Donald J.

This is a class action for injunctive and declaratory relief necessary to remedy 3 ongoing violations of the constitutional and statutory rights of individuals held in government 4 custody pending immigration proceedings. Because such proceedings seek to deprive 5 individuals of the opportunity to live and work in the United States, the United States 6 Constitution and federal statutes and regulations afford these individuals with substantive and 7 procedural rights, including the right to be represented by counsel, the right to gather and present 8 evidence, and the right to a fair hearing. Defendants have systematically denied those rights, and 9 others. 2. Plaintiffs Franklin Gomez Carranza and Ruben Torres Jauregui (“Individual 11 Plaintiffs”) bring this class action lawsuit to challenge policies and practices that deny and 12 severely restrict their abilities to make telephone calls necessary to consult with or obtain 13 counsel, to gather information and evidence necessary for their cases, and to obtain fair hearings 14 while in civil, immigration custody. 3. Individual Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent (collectively “Plaintiffs”) 16 are held in detention facilities under the custody of Defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs 17 Enforcement (“ICE”), many pending resolution of ICE’s charges that they should be deported or 18 “removed” from the United States. Others are detained while challenging final removal orders 19 or their prolonged detention, while motions to reopen or reconsider a prior removal order are 20 pending, and while pursuing habeas corpus petitions because they cannot be deported. 4. Respondents in immigration proceedings are not entitled to appointed counsel, but 22 have a right to counsel of their choosing at no expense to the government. Individuals detained 23 at the El Paso Service Processing Center (“El Paso”) and the Otero County Detention Processing 24 Center (“Otero”) rely on pro bono counsel located nationwide for representation. In-person 25 visits by out-of-state counsel to El Paso or Otero often are prohibitively expensive and 26 unreasonably time-consuming. In-person visits by any counsel – including local attorneys – 27 have been rendered impossible with the COVID-19-related shutdowns. Even before these 1 shutdowns, visits by local counsel were extremely time-consuming because attorneys cannot 2 make appointments to see their clients at El Paso or Otero. Thus, telephone access is critical to 3 Plaintiffs’ ability to locate, retain, consult with, and seek advice from legal counsel. 5. For those Plaintiffs who cannot afford an attorney and are not able to retain pro 5 bono counsel, telephone contact with the outside world is essential to gather the evidence and 6 government documents necessary to defend against removal charges, locate witnesses, seek 7 relief from removal, including protection from persecution or torture, and do other things 8 necessary to represent themselves in legal proceedings. 6. Meaningful telephone access is also necessary to enable Plaintiffs to exercise their 10 First Amendment rights to petition government agencies for affirmative immigration benefits 11 and related documentation, including ones that may legalize their status or otherwise assist with 12 their applications for relief or protection from removal. 7. However, ICE, and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security 14 (“DHS”) have engaged in a common course of conduct that severely restricts Plaintiffs’ 15 telephone access in violation of their constitutional, statutory, and regulatory rights under, inter 16 alia, the United States Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), and the 17 Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”). Specifically, and as elaborated herein, Defendants 18 have illegally restricted Plaintiffs’ telephone access in the following ways: a. impeding all confidential communications with counsel, depriving Plaintiffs of the attorney-client privilege; b. providing no privacy to Plaintiffs when able to make telephone calls; c. when made available, only providing calling options that are prohibitively expensive; d. not providing free telephone access to indigent Plaintiffs; e. not providing Plaintiffs free telephone access to make calls to nonprofit legal services providers and/or government entities; f. disallowing Plaintiffs from receiving incoming","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 20, 2019 | U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico | El Paso Service Processing Center | ICE ||| January 21, 2019 ||||| January 31, 2019 | ||| December 31, 2018 ||| March 31, 2019 .<n>On January 20, 2019, two immigrants filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court, New Mexico, alleging that the Department of Homeland Security's detention policies and practices violated their constitutional and statutory rights.

INTRODUCTION 1. In the American tradition of justice, judges are supposed to be impartial. Under principles dating back to the founding of the nation, judges are insulated from political power and play a role distinct from that of prosecutors.1 As a result, lawyers across the country practice law in courts where transparency, impartiality, and predictability serve the interests of justice. 2. Not so in the immigration courts of the United States, where judges answer to the nation’s chief prosecutor, the Attorney General. 3. The immigration courts make life-and-death decisions every day: vulnerable people seeking asylum in the United States depend on a functioning court system to protect them from persecution, torture, and death. Yet, in the immigration courts, the tradition of judicial independence has been turned upside down. Systemic dysfunction and anti-immigrant animus create a Kafkaesque reality where prosecution merges with judging and the ultimate goal is deportation rather than fair adjudication. 1 See, e.g., The Federalist No. 78, at 392 (I. Shapiro ed. 2009) (A. Hamilton); The Declaration of Independence (U.S. 1776) (among litany of reasons for seeking independence, the King “has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries”). 1 COMPLAINT 4. Defendants have manipulated the immigration court system to serve an antiimmigrant agenda. Categorizing people fleeing persecution as “invaders,” Defendants are using the immigration courts as a weapon against the asylum system and vulnerable migrants—to beat them back to places of danger—instead of lawfully adjudicating their claims based on their merits.2 5. Specifically, Defendants have created an adjudication system where applicants for asylum are supposed to lose. Defendants rush some asylum claims to adjudication prematurely in order to achieve rapid removals. Defendants simultaneously delay other claims long past the time when they were ripe for adjudication, undermining fundamental fairness and the rule of law. Everywhere in this dysfunctional adjudication spectrum, the standards set forth in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), intended to ensure case-by-case decision-making, are subverted by Defendants’ design. 6. First, Defendants have abused their authority to perpetuate vast asylum-free zones. In many immigration court jurisdictions, covering large swaths of the country, asylum is effectively impossible to win—a de facto nullification of a duly-enacted statutory scheme. 7.

This class action habeas petition and complaint for declaratory relief is brought on behalf of lawful permanent residents who are being imprisoned for prolonged periods of time in Pennsylvania facilities without receiving the most basic element of Due Process—a custody hearing to determine if their prolonged detention is justified. 2. Petitioners and named plaintiffs Alexander Alli and Elliot Grenade (hereafter “Petitioners”) are longtime lawful pemanent residents of the United States who are challenging efforts by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to remove them from the United States. Both have substantial ties to this country, including children who are U.S citizens. And both have substantial challenges to removal. Yet, each has been subject to prolonged detention—in Mr. Alli’s case for nearly nine months, and in Mr. Grenade’s case, for more than one and a half years—without any hearing to determine whether such detention is justified. 3. Petitioners are not alone. On any given day—DHS detains more than one thousand noncitizens in jails across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, particularly in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Like Petitioners, many are lawful permanent residents who are detained for months, if not years, while the immigration courts and federal courts resolve their cases. Yet they never receive a custody hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is even necessary. Indeed, many choose to abandon their meritorious cases because they cannot endure the prospect of being locked up indefinitely. 4. Petitioners bring this action on their own behalf, and on behalf of similarly-situated individuals, to obtain the custody hearing to which they are statutorily and constitutionally entitled. As set forth below, the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) does not authorize prolonged, pre-final order detention of the kind Petitioners are suffering. Indeed, if it did, it would raise serious constitutional problems. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that immigration detention violates Due Process unless it is reasonably related to its purpose. Moreover, where detention is prolonged, Due Process requires a “sufficiently strong special justification” to outweigh the significant deprivation of liberty, as well as strong procedural protections to ensure that an individual’s detention is actually serving legitimate governmental aims, see Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 690-91 (2001). At a minimum, these procedural protections include a hearing before an impartial adjudicator where the government bears the burden of justifying prolonged detention. Yet the government has failed to provide the Petitioners, and the class they seek to represent, with any custody hearing that would even approach what is constitutionally required. 5. Instead, pursuant to its unlawful policy and practice, the government has imprisoned Petitioners, and the similarly-situated persons they seek to represent","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2015 | Immigration and Nationality Act | U.S. District Court | Middle District of Pennsylvania ||| December 2015 ||| January 2016 ||| March 2018 ||| May 2018 | ||| June 2018 | December 2018 | January 2019 ||| February 2019 | March 2019 | May 2019 | June 2019 | January 2020 | March 2020 | February 2020 | May 2020 | June 2020 | January 2021 | March 2021 | February 2021 | May 2021 | June 2021 | July 2020 | July 2021 | August 2020 | September 2020 | October 2020 | November 2020 | December 2020 | April 2021 | December 2021 | January 2018 | March 2020, May 2020, March 2020, April 2020, April 2020 | August 2020, March 2020 (all dates are subject to change)<n>This class action was brought on behalf of lawful permanent residents who are being imprisoned for prolonged periods of time in Pennsylvania facilities without receiving a custody hearing to determine if their prolonged detention is justified.

The law was patterned after Arizona's SB 1070. The District Court has issued a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the law, and this injunction has been appealed to the Fourth Circuit; in the meantime, the case, along with several others like it from different states, are stayed at the District Court or U.S. Appellate level pending the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v.

After Arizona v. United States was decided the issue was remanded to the District Court.

The 4th Circuit per Judge Davis agreed and affirmed the order on July 13, 2013. In March of 2014 Judge Gergel permanently enjoined South Carolina from enforcing Sections 4, 5, and 6(B)(2). Furthermore the state agreed to more favorable interpretations of Section 7, and the remainder of Section, encouraging the Plaintiffs to dismiss their claims on those sections without prejudice.

Civil Action File No. ___2_:_1_1-_c_v_-0_2_7_7_9_-R__M_G____ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CLASS ACTION 1. This action challenges South Carolina’s comprehensive immigration law, Senate Bill 20 (“SB 20,” attached as Exhibit A), on multiple constitutional grounds and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent serious harm that Plaintiffs and putative class members across the state will suffer if the law goes into effect. 2. Through SB 20, South Carolina has created a punitive and comprehensive state immigration system that, among other things: (1) mandates that state and local law enforcement officers engage in immigration enforcement; (2) creates new criminal immigration laws specific to and wholly administered by the State of South Carolina; and (3) creates a South Carolinaspecific alien registration system. 3. SB 20 is unconstitutional in several respects. SB 20 in its entirety violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by attempting to regulate immigration—a function that is constitutionally committed exclusively to the federal government. SB 20 is also preempted because it conflicts with federal law in several ways. SB 20 further violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures and the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantees to equal protection and due process under the law. 4. SB 20 will subject South Carolinians—including U.S. citizens and non-citizens with permission from the federal government to remain in the United States—to unlawful interrogations, prolonged detentions, and arrests. See Secs. 6 7, codified at S.C. CODE <unk>1713-170, 23-3-1100. SB 20 mandates that state and local law enforcement officers investigate the immigration status of any individual they stop, detain, or arrest whenever they have a “reasonable suspicion” that the individual lacks immigration status. Individuals perceived as “foreign” by state or local law enforcement agents will be in constant jeopardy of harassment and unlawfully prolonged detention and arrest. Under SB 20, all South Carolinians will be required to carry state-approved identity documentation in order to prevent lengthy investigations into their immigration status. 5. SB 20, in combination with existing South Carolina law, will subject South Carolinians—including U.S. citizens and non-citizens with permission from the federal government to remain in the United States—to criminal penalties and incarceration for humanitarian daily activities, such as giving a ride to a neighbor, family member, client, or fellow congregant, or for opening their homes to individuals, including individuals in need. See Sec. 4, codified at S.C. CODE <unk>16-9-460. The South Carolina Illegal Immigration Reform Act of 2008 (“A280”), adopted June 4, 2008, created the state immigration crimes of harboring or transporting. See S.C. CODE <unk>16-9-460 (2008). SB 20 amended this provision to criminalize unlawful presence by making unlawful the acts of allowing oneself to be transported or harboring oneself—effectively authorizing the arrest of individuals simply suspected of being unlawfully present—while maintaining the existing immigration-related transporting and harboring offenses. See Sec. 4, codified at S.C. CODE <unk>16-9-460. SB 20 further encourages broad enforcement of South Carolina’s harboring and transporting crimes by subjecting law enforcement agencies to potential civil liability for failure to enforce these laws to the maximum extent possible. See Sec. 1, codified at S.C. CODE <unk>6-1-170. 6. SB 20 also creates a South Carolina-specific alien registration scheme, allowing state and local law enforcement officers to arrest individuals simply for failing to carry with them certain registration documents. See Sec. 5, codified at S.C. CODE <unk>16-17-750. And it creates new state criminal penalties for using false identity documents, which apply solely when the documents are used by individuals who are deemed by the State to be unlawfully present in the United States or if offered as proof of an individual’s lawful presence in the United States.

INTRODUCTION 1. This lawsuit challenges the Trump Administration’s third attempt since taking 3 office at suspending the United States Refugee Admissions Program (the “USRAP”) and 4 blocking Muslim refugees from reaching the safety of this country. 2. For over half a century, the United States has played a leading role in helping 6 refugees from around the world rebuild their lives. In enacting the Refugee Act of 1980, which 7 created the USRAP as it exists today, Congress declared that “it is the historic policy of the 8 United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their 9 homelands,” including through resettlement to this country Pub. L No. 96-212 <unk>101(a), 94 Stat. 3. Despite this historical legacy and the currently unfolding global refugee crisis, 12 President Trump campaigned on rhetoric of fear and hate and a promise to ban Muslim refugees 13 from entering the United States. A week after taking office, on January 27, 2017, the President 14 attempted to deliver on that promise through an executive order (“EO-1”) that indefinitely 15 banned Syrian refugees, suspended the USRAP for 120 days with the exception of case-by-case 16 waivers, ordered a review of the USRAP during the 120-day period, and directed that religious 17 minorities be prioritized for admission once the USRAP resumes. President Trump expressly 18 confirmed that this provision in EO-1 was intended to preference Christian refugees. 4. When EO-1 was quickly enjoined, the President withdrew it and issued another 20 executive order on March 6, 2017 (“EO-2”), which also suspended the USRAP for 120 days with 21 the exception of case-by-case waivers, ordered a review of the USRAP during the 120-day 22 period, and directed that after that period the USRAP may resume only for certain nationalities. 23 This order was enjoined before it went into effect, although the Supreme Court allowed it to 24 partially take effect pending appeal in June. 5. On October 24, 2017, the day EO-2’s 120-day period expired, the President 26 imposed his third—and most blatantly discriminatory—attempt to ban Muslim refugees. That 1 same day, the President issued the Executive Order on Resuming the United States Refugee 2 Admissions Program with Enhanced Vetting Capabilities, and released an accompanying 3 Memorandum (together, “Refugee Ban 3.0”). Refugee Ban 3.0 continues the suspension of the 4 USRAP in two ways while the Administration purports to continue reviewing the USRAP: (1) it 5 suspends all entry of refugees from 11 countries, 9 of which are majority Muslim, for a minimum 6 of 90 days; and (2) it indefinitely suspends the process known as “follow-to-join,” which allows 7 refugees who have already been admitted to the country to reunite with their spouses and 8 children who remain abroad. 6. Refugee Ban 3.0 implements defendant Donald Trump’s and his Administration’s 10 often repeated goal of banning Muslim refugees from the country. Of all Muslim refugees 11 resettled in the United States in the last two fiscal years, 80% were from the nine Muslim- 12 majority countries whose nationals are subject to this most recent suspension. For the six 13 nationalities with the highest number of follow-to-join petitions in recent years, 62% of the 14 refugees who arrived from those nationalities in the USRAP generally identified as Muslim. The 15 Administration has not provided any reason justifying this suspension, or any specific criticisms 16 of the current, extensive USRAP process, even after having spent months reviewing the USRAP 17 under the mandates of the prior executive orders. 7. Refugee Ban 3.0 will irreparably harm the lives of the plaintiffs, their families, 19 and their loved ones—people like John Doe 1, an Iraqi former interpreter for the U.S. Army who 20 had been told to be ready to travel to the United States when Refugee Ban 3.0 came down and 21 remains stranded outside the country; Allen Vaught, his former Army supervisor, who has been 22 waiting to welcome him to the","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2018 | U.S. District Court | District of Columbia | Eastern District of Washington ||| Muslim refugees ||| United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP)<n>On January 2018, a group of Muslim refugees filed a class action suit in the United States District Court for the District of the Columbia in the Eastern district of Washington.

492,JC-AR-0009,"[ENTITYCHAIN] August 2018 | Pulaski County Jail | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of Arkansas ||| September 12, 2018 | U.S. District | James Moody Jr [SUMMARY] In August 2018, an inmate filed a civil class action lawsuit against the Pulaski County Jail (PCJ) and six PCJ officials in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. The plaintiff, on behalf of himself and twenty-two other inmates, asked the court for monetary and injunctive relief, claiming that he and other inmates were being kept locked in their cells because the jail was not properly staffed. On September 12, 2018, U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr. entered an initial order providing guidelines for proceeding pro se and finding that a request for class certification at this stage was premature; accordingly, he severed the case as twenty-three separate lawsuits. Twenty-one of the other cases were eventually all dismissed without prejudice due to lack of prosecution by the other inmates. This instant case and one other case (docket no. 4:18-cv-00552), which was also dismissed without prejudice due to lack of prosecution and reopened, are the only two ongoing cases out of the total twenty-three cases initially filed on this matter.","Moody Ray Address: II.

Rosas and 10 Goodwin have been beaten and threatened with violence by deputies of the Los 11 Angeles County Sheriff's Department (the ""Department"" or ""LASD"") Mr. Rosas 12 and Mr. Goodwin have also witnessed deputies beating other inmates. The abuse 13 that Rosas and Goodwin suffered and witnessed is typical of the abuse inflicted by 14 deputies on countless other inmates in the jails, and is part of a pattern and practice 15 of deputy-on-inmate violence that has persisted for many years. In the last few 16 years alone, there have been dozens of documented cases of extreme and unjustified 17 violence by deputies against inmates. Defendants are aware of the culture of 18 deputy violence that pervades the Jails but have failed to take reasonable measures 19 to remedy the problem.

Case No. 5:16-CV-355 PROPOSED CLASS ACTION CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. San Bernardino County is violating the constitutional rights of the 3 nearly 6,000 people it incarcerates in its jails. Jail medical, mental health, and 4 dental care is so deficient that it is harming the people it aims to serve. Jail staff 5 uses excessive force against people they are charged with protecting, and fails to 6 take even the most basic steps to prevent violence. Jail staff discriminates against 7 people with disabilities by locking them in housing units that don’t have accessible 8 toilets and showers, and by locking people with mental health problems in tiny cells 9 for 22 to 24 hours a day, which only worsens their psychiatric conditions. 2. County officials have known for years that the conditions in the jails 11 are so deplorable that people housed there are at significant risk of harm. Yet the 12 County has failed to take reasonable measures to mitigate the risk of harm faced by 13 people entirely dependent on the County for basic health care, disability 14 discrimination, safety, and security. 3. Plaintiffs George Topete and Zachery Shovey, and the class they 16 represent, seek a declaration that San Bernardino County’s ongoing practices violate 17 their constitutional and statutory rights, and seek injunctive relief compelling 18 Defendant to provide constitutionally adequate health care, to protect people from 19 violence, to provide equal access to programs, services, and activities, and to cease 20 the unnecessary and excessive use of force.

Venue is proper in the Central District of California under 28 U.S.C. 3 1391(b) because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the 4 claims brought by Plaintiffs and the class have occurred in this District and 5 Defendant is located in this District. PARTIES 7 Plaintiffs 7. George Topete is a convicted prisoner and pretrial detainee who 9 transferred from state prison to the West Valley Detention Center on October 14, 10 2011, to face new charges. He has difficulty walking and using stairs due to a 11 physical disability Mr. Topete requires the use of a cane, but Defendant has 12 periodically refused to provide him with one for months at a time. In June 2015, 13 Defendant provided Mr. Topete with a wheelchair, but does not house him in a 14 wheelchair accessible unit or cell. As a result, he has fallen and is at risk of falling 15 when trying to access the visiting area, his cell, and the toilet. Defendant also denies 16 Mr. Topete adequate access to a C-PAP machine that he requires to treat his sleep 17 apnea. 8.

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF Plaintiffs, who are prisoners in the El Paso County Jail (“Jail”) with serious mental health needs, and who are subject to the actions and omissions of defendants that are described in this Complaint, allege as follows: BACKGROUND 1. Pre-trial detainee Michael Lewis died while strapped face-down to a restraint board in the Jail on May 7, 1998, his second time on the board for that day. The restraint was imposed by sheriff deputies, not medical or mental health personnel. For at least five days, he had been hallucinating and psychotic, the probable result of the Jail medical provider’s decision to change his medications, a decision made without consulting with the therapist who had prescribed his former medications. Two days after security staff noted his decompensation, the Jail’s counselor placed him on the waiting list to see the Jail’s psychiatrist, who visited the Jail only one morning every other week Mr. Lewis did not live long enough to see the psychiatrist; he died while struggling against his restraints. 2. Since that death in May 1998, eight additional prisoners have died in the Jail, four of them in 2001. In almost every case, the deceased prisoner was suicidal, seriously mentally ill, or displaying symptoms of psychosis from overdose or withdrawal from street drugs or alcohol. 3. Shortly after the latest death, a suicide in November 2001, the American Civil Liberties Union wrote to defendant El Paso County Board of County Commissioners (“Board”) to ask it to investigate the alarming pattern of prisoner deaths and consider whether the Jail was staffed with a sufficient number of competent medical, mental health, and security personnel who were adequately trained to recognize and respond appropriately to the needs of the Jail’s population. 4. The Board declined to investigate. INTRODUCTION 5. This class action for injunctive and declaratory relief is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 to preserve the rights of the plaintiffs and the plaintiff class under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 6. The named plaintiffs and the plaintiff class are all subject to the actions, omissions and deliberate indifference of the defendants described herein. The named plaintiffs and the plaintiff class suffer from serious mental health problems, and the deliberate indifference of the defendants to these problems exposes each of them to conditions that constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and deprivation of liberty in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result of the defendants’ actions and omissions, the named plaintiffs and the plaintiff class face continued and further degradation of their mental health and daily exposure to a serious risk of injury or death. 7. This case is about the long-lasting and continuing failure and refusal of the Board and defendant Anderson to acknowledge or provide sufficient resources for the serious mental health needs of their prisoners during the time they are imprisoned in the Jail, and their failure to enter a contract with a medical services provider which (a) adequately provides for the prisoners’ serious mental health needs, and (b) is rigorously enforced by defendants. The needs of mentally ill prisoners include diagnosis of their condition, timely provision of proper treatment and medication by competent staff, safe and appropriate housing, and protection from inhumane and punitive actions taken out of ignorance of or indifference to their mental state. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 8. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 because this action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1343(a)(3) because this action seeks to redress the deprivation, under color of state law, of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) because all defendants reside in this district, and because the events and omissions giving rise to plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this district.

Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Office of the Assistant Attorney General Washington, D.C. 20530 The Honorable Carlos A. Gimenez Mayor, Miami-Dade County Stephen P. Clark Center 111 Northwest First Street, 29th Floor Miami, FL 33128 Re: lnvestigation of the Miami-Dade County Jail Dear Mayor Gimenez: The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division has concluded its investigation of conditions at the corrections facilities operated by the Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation Department (""MDCR""). This letter provides MDCR with our findings. On April 2, 2008, we notified officials of Miami-Dade Calmty (""County"") of our intent to investigate the MDCR corrections facilities pursuant to the Civil Rights oflnstitutionalized Persons Act (""CRIPA""), 42 U.S.C.<unk>1997. CRIPA gives the Department of Justice authority to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constihltional rights of prisoners in adult detention and corrections facilities. CRIPA requires that we advise you of the findings of our investigation, the facts supporting them, and the minimum remedial steps that are necessary to address the de-£iciencies we have identified. 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997b. I. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS We conclude that that there is a pattern and practice of constitutional violations in the correctional facilities operated by MDCR, and as a result of the unconstitutional operation of the Jail, prisoners suffer grievous harm, including death. As described more fully below, our specific findings include: • MDCR is deliberately indifferent to the suicide risks and serious mental health needs of its prisoners. At least eight prisoners have committed suicide since 2007, and thousands of prisoners have suffered from inadequate mental health crisis services. • MDCR fails to provide adequate acute care, chronic care, outpatient treatment, and discharge services to prisoners with mental illness. Instead, MDCR inappropriately relies on medication management that fails to consistently incorporate diagnoses or treatment plans, even for prisoners with the most serious mental illnesses. • MDCR is deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of prisoners including access to care for acute medical needs, management of chronic health problems, and record keeping and quality assurance. Prisoners wait weeks and even months to receive consultations for care from HIV, cardiology, and neurology specialists. • MDCR fails to provide adequate intake screening, initial health assessments and acute care for newly incarcerated prisoners. Since 2008, at least five prisoners have died from MDCR's failure to identify and treat prisoners withdrawing from drugs or alcohol. • MDCR is engaged in a pattern or practice of using excessive force against prisoners. MDCR corrections officers openly engage in abusive and retaliatory conduct, which frequently causes injuries to prisoners. • MDCR is deliberately indifferent to the serious risk of harm to prisoners posed by fellow prisoners. Corrections officers fail to supervise prisoners, particularly prisoners known to be violent, resulting in ongoing harm and serious risk of harm. There is significant evidence to be concerned that the Jail fails to take reasonable steps to protect prisoners from sexual assault. • The conditions of confinement within the Jail expose prisoners to an umeasonable risk of hann from inadequate fire and life safety systems and environmental health and sanitation deficiencies, including umeasonable risk of infection from overcrowding and inadequate laundry, housekeeping, and pest controL II. INVESTIGATION On June 9-13, 2008, June 16-20,2008, and April 7-8,2009, we inspected the facility together with consultants in the fields of corrections, custodial medical and mental health care, suicide prevention, and environmental health and sanitation. We interviewed administrative and corrections staff, medical and mental health care providers, prisoners, and members of the Miami-Dade community. Our investigation also included the review of policies and procedures, incident reports, grievances, medical records, and use of force records and investigations, including documents provided by the County subsequent to our on-site visits. In keeping with our pledge of transparency and providing technical assistance where appropriate, our consultants conveyed their preliminary impressions and concerns to County officials and the MDCR command staff at the conclusion of our tours. We are grateful to MDCR Director Timothy P. Ryan and his entire stafffor the assistance and cooperation extended to us. We found the MDCR officials helpful and professional throughout the course of the investigation. MDCR provided us with access to records and personnel, and responded to our requests, before, during, and after our on-site visits, in a transparent and forthcoming manner.

The plaintiffs challenged the Cook County Sheriff's policy of strip searching all males following their return to the Cook County Jail from court after there was a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention.  The parties settled in 2011 and the defendants paid $1.4 million in damages and roughly $2 million in attorney's fees and costs.

Morrissey, Ltd., and Robert H. Farley, Jr Ltd. and complain of the Defendant as follows: This is a Civil Action for monetary damages to redress deprivations under color of law rights, privileges, and immunities secured under the Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Title 42 U.S.C. Sections 1983 and 1988. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS (a) Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (b) The Class consist of all male inmates who have been subjected to a strip search at the Cook County Department of Corrections (Jail) following their return to the Jail from court after there is a judicial determination that there is no longer a basis for their.detention, other than to be processed for release. <unk>) The class is so numerous that joinder of all persons is impracticable. Inmates are required by the Sheriff’s Office to return to the Jail after receiving judicial determinations ordering their release. There is a written directive at the Jail which requires that strip searches are conducted of all male inmates upon their return to the Jail from Court. The Sheriff’s Office, on the other hand, does not strip searched similarly situated female inmate returning to the Jail after receiving judicial determinations ordering their release. Plaintiffs believe that the class probably numbers well over 20,000 persons. (d) Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interest of all class members as they are members of the class and their claims are typical of the claims of all class members. Each of the plaintiffs is incensed at the treatment accorded the class members and will aggressively pursue the interests of the entire class. Plaintiffs’ interest in obtaining monetary damages for the violations of constitutional rights and privileges arc consistent with and not antagonistic to those of any person within the class. (e) The common questions of law and fact include: (i) Whether the defendant has a policy and practice to strip search all males with judicial discharge upon their return to the Jail; (iii) Whether similarly situated female inmates with judicial discharges are <unk>strip searched upon their return to the Jail; (iv) Whether the visual search of male inmates is reasonable; (v) Whether the defendant has knowledge of the conduct alleged herein; (vi) Whether the conduct alleged herein is in violation of the Fourth, or Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Title 42 U.S.C. 1983; (vii) whether plaintiffs and the members of the plaintiff class are entitled to an award of compensatory damages. (f) The wrongful conduct alleged herein has been conducted generally upon all members of the plaintiff class in that the strip searches were conducted pursuant to a long-established pla<unk>., policy or procedure of the Cook County Department of Corrections. (g) Common questions of fact and law predominate over questions affecting only individual class members. (h) A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy in that: (i) A multiplicity of suits with consequent burden on the courts and defendants should be avoided. (ii) It would be virtually impossible for all putative class members to intervene as parties in this action. (iii) Upon adjudication of defendants’ liability, claims.of the class members can be determined by this Court. Facts and Parties 1.

The plaintiffs alleged that the Sheriff’s Office had violated the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment by conducting strip searches on male inmates returning to the jail after judicial discharge. In January 2005, the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the case. On July 2005, the case was dismissed. The case was moved for summary judgment in favor of the Sheriff. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in which the Sheriff agreed to pay the plaintiffs in the amount of $325,000. In August 2006, the parties entered a consent decree, which was approved by the court on July 2017. The parties agreed to implement a new policy of strip searches of all male inmates, including female inmates with judicial discharge, and that the sheriff’s office would not strip search searches on female inmates. The consent decree was entered into effect in January 2005. The parties also agreed to conduct searches on all female inmates who had judicial discharges.</s>"

On November 19, 2009, we notified Parish officials of our intent to conduct an investigation of Terrebonne pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. <unk>14141 (“Section 14141”). Section 14141 gives the Department of Justice authority to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of youth in juvenile justice institutions. Summary of Findings The youth confined to Terrebonne are subjected to conditions that place them at serious risk of avoidable harm in violation of their rights protected by the Constitution of the United States. During our investigation, we received a significant number of credible reports of sexual and physical misconduct by staff members on youth within their custody. The allegations exposed wide-spread and systemic abuses and revealed a lack of accountability and controls that would have prevented harm to the young people confined there. Allegations of sexual misconduct have led to criminal charges against seven staff members. Our findings are not limited to the conduct charged in the criminal cases, but include numerous additional accounts. These incidents are compounded by a lack of systems in place to identify and correct misconduct. In addition to sexual misconduct, there is a pervasive atmosphere of excessive force and violence. We found: <unk>Physical restraints, including handcuffing and a restraint chair, are routinely used when verbal or non-physical methods would have been adequate; <unk>The inappropriate and dangerous use of chemical agents; <unk>Excessive use of isolation as punishment or for control; <unk>Suicidal behavior six times the national average and an inadequate suicide prevention program; and <unk>High levels of fighting and assaults between youth. These conditions are the result of, and allowed to continue to exist because generally accepted juvenile justice standards are not followed. We found that staff did not receive minimally adequate training, and that existing policies and procedures are inadequate to ensure: that minimally necessary force is used to control youth; that chemicals are used safely; or that youth are protected from sexual or physical abuse. In addition, we found that the facility lacks adequate staff and that the staffing pattern places youth at risk of harm because of fatigue, reduced accountability, overreliance on seclusion, and inadequate supervision. Significantly, we found limited mechanisms to provide accountability. During our inspections we uncovered staff members who lied about performing room checks. This information would not have been discovered but for our efforts. In addition, we found that child abuse allegations are not reported to state officials as required by law; the facility fails to collect data that would permit managers to identify and address problems; there is inadequate supervision of line staff; and no meaningful quality assurance program exists. The failure to meet generally accepted juvenile justice standards in the face of severe problems in the facility violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s mandate that youth in state custody be protected from harm. In this letter we provide additional recommendations that are minimally necessary to bring the facility into compliance with the Constitution. Investigation On March 22-25, 2010, we conducted on-site inspections at Terrebonne with expert consultants in juvenile justice administration and protection from harm. We interviewed Facility management personnel, direct care and administrative staff, and youth. Before, during, and after our visits, we reviewed an extensive number of documents, including policies and procedures, incident reports, investigative reports, grievances from youth, staff personnel files, unit logs, orientation materials, staff training materials, and school records. In keeping with our pledge of transparency and to provide technical assistance where appropriate, we conveyed our preliminary findings to Terrebonne and Terrebonne Parish officials at the close of our on-site visits. We followed up with a letter to the Parish on April 22, 2010 outlining some of our most pressing concerns.1 In our letter, we expressed serious concern that overnight rooms checks were not being consistently performed, and that staff routinely appeared to be falsifying room check documentation. In addition, we expressed concern that overnight shift staff were not being adequately supervised and were not being held accountable for complying with Terrebonne policies and procedures. We commend the staff at Terrebonne for their helpful and professional conduct throughout the course of the investigation. We received full cooperation with our investigation and appreciate the Parish’s receptiveness to our consultants’ on-site recommendations. Also, we appreciate comments made by Ralph Mitchell, the Director of the Terrebonne Parish Department of Public Safety, indicating that he had become aware of some of the problems we identified, and had begun formulating remedies to address some of our most serious concerns. In addition, we appreciate the thorough cooperation provided by Facility Director Jason Hutchinson. Director Hutchinson brings a number of strengths to the role of facility superintendent","<pad>On November 19, 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division conducted an investigation of conditions at the Terrebonne Parish Juvenile Detention Center in Houma, Louisiana. The investigation was conducted pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (""Section 14141""). Section 14141 gives the Justice Department the authority to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of youth in juvenile justice institutions. According to the investigation, the youth confined to Terrebonne are subjected to conditions that place them at serious risk of avoidable harm in violation of their rights protected by the Constitution of the United States.

The plaintiff alleged that the practice of placing minors in solitary confinement as punishment violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. In 2017, the plaintiff was granted a preliminary injunction and the parties began the settlement process. The case settled in July 2019. The settlement agreement included a permanent injunction prohibiting Rutherford County from using seclusion as punishment for minors.","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE AT NASHVILLE JOHN DOE, a minor, by and through his Mother and next friend, SHARIEKA FRAZIER, Plaintiff, v. BONNIE HOMMRICH, in her official capacity as the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services, THE TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN’S SERVICES, RUTHERFORD COUNTY, TENNESSEE, LYNN DUKE, in her individual and official capacity as Director of the Rutherford County Detention Facility and LIEUTENANT ANGELA ISTVANDITSCH, in her individual and official capacity as an officer of the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Facility, Defendants. VERIFIED COMPLAINT Plaintiff John Doe1, by and through his mother and next friend Sharieka Frazier and his undersigned counsel, sues Defendants, The Tennessee Department of Children’s Services (“DCS”), Rutherford County, Tennessee (“the County”), Lynn Duke (“Duke”), and Lieutenant Angela Istvanditsch, in their individual and official capacities as director and officer of the Facility, showing as follows: 1 John Doe is a minor, so his name has been redacted pursuant to Local Rules. Similarly, counsel has redacted his name and other identifying information from exhibits and other documents submitted herewith. NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. This case involves the constitutional rights of John Doe, a child charged with offenses that would render him delinquent under the laws of Tennessee if the Juvenile Court performed an adjudication and found that he had committed the offenses. Currently, he has not received an adjudication, and is housed at the Rutherford County Detention Facility as a pretrial detainee.2 2. At issue in this case is whether the government may lawfully place a child who is a pretrial detainee and likely suffers from mental illness in solitary confinement for long periods of time. At further issue, is whether the government may lawfully place any child in extended solitary confinement. 3. John Doe has been held in solitary confinement at the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Facility since April 19, 2016 (a period of five (5) days as of the filing of this Complaint) because he allegedly disrupted the Facility’s classroom. 4. Defendants have acknowledged that placing juveniles like John Doe in solitary confinement for long periods of time is a violation of applicable regulations, but in at least this one case, they sought and obtained permission from the Juvenile Court to impose such draconian measures in excess of what is allowable even by the regulations promulgated by the Department of Children’s Services. 5. Almost no standards exist for imposition of solitary confinement of pretrial detainees in Tennessee’s juvenile justice system, and no meaningful opportunity for review exists. John Doe has been subjected to routine periods of solitary confinement during his time in the 2 Tennessee, like most other states, allows pretrial detention of juveniles when certain conditions are met. These conditions include a finding of probable cause, that the child is a threat to himself or the community, and that no less restrictive alternatives to detention exist to protect the child or the community. Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center, but on April 19th, the Defendants requested (and were granted) permission to hold him alone in a cell with nothing but a toilet and bed for twentythree (23) hours per day. This practice is subject to repetition, and has been visited upon the named Plaintiff in this cause. 6. Imposition of solitary confinement on pretrial detainee juveniles violates John Doe’s and other juvenile pretrial detainees’ rights to be free of cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment, and their rights to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>l983 for Defendants’ violations of his civil rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 8. This court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1343(a)(3) (civil rights). 9.

The agency is statutorily required to provide services, treatment and protection for vulnerable children throughout the State of Tennessee, including children falling under its protection in this judicial District. DCS is specifically mandated to protect children adjudicated delinquent, and supervises all facilities housing juveniles under charges of delinquency. DCS participates in decisions affecting children housed at the Facility and specifically failed to take any action in order to prevent placement of John Doe into solitary confinement as described more fully herein.

Case No. 14-cv-4480 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201 and 2202 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT I. NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. Twitter brings this action for declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201 3 and 2202, requesting relief from prohibitions on its speech in violation of the First Amendment. 2. The U.S. government engages in extensive but incomplete speech about the scope 5 of its national security surveillance activities as they pertain to U.S. communications providers, 6 while at the same time prohibiting service providers such as Twitter from providing their own 7 informed perspective as potential recipients of various national security-related requests. 3. Twitter seeks to lawfully publish information contained in a draft Transparency 9 Report submitted to the Defendants on or about April 1, 2014. After five months, Defendants 10 informed Twitter on September 9, 2014 that “information contained in the [transparency] report is 11 classified and cannot be publicly released” because it does not comply with their framework for 12 reporting data about government requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 13 (“FISA”) and the National Security Letter statutes. This framework was set forth in a January 27, 14 2014 letter from Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole to five Internet companies (not 15 including Twitter) in settlement of prior claims brought by those companies (also not including 16 Twitter) (the “DAG Letter”). 4. The Defendants’ position forces Twitter either to engage in speech that has been 18 preapproved by government officials or else to refrain from speaking altogether. Defendants 19 provided no authority for their ability to establish the preapproved disclosure formats or to 20 impose those speech restrictions on other service providers that were not party to the lawsuit or 21 settlement. 5. Twitter’s ability to respond to government statements about national security 23 surveillance activities and to discuss the actual surveillance of Twitter users is being 24 unconstitutionally restricted by statutes that prohibit and even criminalize a service provider’s 25 disclosure of the number of national security letters (“NSLs”) and court orders issued pursuant to 26 FISA that it has received, if any. In fact, the U.S. government has taken the position that service COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT 1 providers like Twitter are even prohibited from saying that they have received zero national 2 security requests, or zero of a particular type of national security request. 6. These restrictions constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint and content-based 4 restriction on, and government viewpoint discrimination against, Twitter’s right to speak about 5 information of national and global public concern. Twitter is entitled under the First Amendment 6 to respond to its users’ concerns and to the statements of U.S. government officials by providing 7 more complete information about the limited scope of U.S. government surveillance of Twitter 8 user accounts—including what types of legal process have not been received by Twitter—and the 9 DAG Letter is not a lawful means by which Defendants can seek to enforce their unconstitutional 10 speech restrictions. II. PARTIES 7. Plaintiff Twitter, Inc. (“Twitter”) is a corporation with its principal place of 13 business located at 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, California. Twitter is a global 14 information sharing and distribution network serving over 271 million monthly active users 15 around the world. People using Twitter write short messages, called “Tweets,” of 140 characters 16 or less, which are public by default and may be viewed all around the world instantly. As such, 17 Twitter gives a public voice to anyone in the world—people who inform and educate others, who 18 express their individuality, who engage in all manner of political speech, and who seek positive 19 change. 8.

Plaintiffs THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY and CHARLIE SAVAGE, by their undersigned attorneys, allege for their Complaint: 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 (""FOIA""), to order the production of agency records from Defendant United States Department of Justice (""DOJ""), and its constituent part, the National Security Division (""NSD""), in response to a request properly made by Plaintiffs The New York Times Company and Charlie Savage (collectively ""The Times""). PARTIES Plaintiff The New York Times Company publishes The New York Times newspaper. The New York Times Company is headquartered in this judicial district at 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York. 3. Plaintiff Charlie Savage is a reporter for The New York Times. 4. Defendant DOJ is an agency of the federal government that has possession and control of the records that Plaintiffs seek. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B). 6. Venue is premised on the place of business of Plaintiffs and is proper in this district under 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B). Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies available in regards to the request at issue. DOJ failed to respond to the request within the time frames set by FOIA, and therefore Plaintiffs are deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies pursuant to 5 FACTS 8. In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (""FISA"") to govern the procedures for electronic surveillance conducted by the government for national security purposes. The statute created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (""FISC""), whose members would be unilaterally selected by the Chief Justice from the ranks of Article III judges to serve staggered, seven-year terms. Each judge sits for a week at a time, and there is a three-member FISA Court of Review to hear any appeals of the FISC's rulings. 10. Congress empowered the FISC to grant or deny wiretap orders requested by federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies involved in national security matters. Later, Congress expanded this authority to encompass orders for physical searches as well. 11. These orders are to be granted or denied based on a simple standard akin to ex parte requests for warrants in ordinary Article III courts: whether facts offered by the government provide probable cause to believe that the target is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power and that each of the facilities at which surveillance is directed is being used by that target. 12. From its inception, the FISC has been cloaked in a high degree of secrecy. Consistent with judicial practices in other courts for simple yes-or-no decisions about wiretap and search orders in ongoing investigations, FISC proceedings are not publicly noticed and only government lawyers are permitted to appear in the court, without adversarial process. 13. Virtually all of the court papers, including the government's filing and the court's orders and opinions, are designated as classified and withheld from public view. If the court grants a government request for authority, there is no one to file an appeal. 14. Over the past decade, there has been growing public attention to the expansion of government surveillance and data-collection activities set in motion following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 15. In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former government contractor, leaked classified documents to journalists. The resulting news articles, and subsequent declassifications, brought to light that the FISC had, since 2006, granted government requests to systematically collect data in bulk on Americans' domestic phone calls and, from 2004 to 2011, granted government requests to systematically collect data in bulk on Americans' e-mail traffic. They also showed how the FISC had become deeply involved in interpreting and overseeing the warrantless surveillance program authorized by the FISA Amendments Act of2008. 16. These and other revelations and declassifications showed that the court had evolved away from its basic task of approving surveillance, for which its structures and processes were designed. Rather than merely granting yes-or-no review of whether the standard had been met for wiretap or search orders, it was now also engaged in complex legal analysis interpreting constitutional rights and surveillance statutes, generating legal opinions that were dozens of pages in length and that have had nationwide, programmatic consequence for the privacy rights and civil liberties of Americans. 17. In the wake of those revelations, both members of Congress and civil liberties group intensified efforts to have the government provide a greater degree of transparency about what the FISC has been doing and how the court has interpreted the Constitution and federal statutes. 18. The government has begun selectively declassifying certain information related to surveillance activities and FISC, including certain redacted decisions.","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2018 | The New York Times Company | Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court | U.S. District Court | Southern District of New York | Freedom of Information Act | FISC | FISA Amendments Act of 2008 .<n>On September 2018, the plaintiffs filed this suit in the United States District Court for the District of Southern New York against the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the National Security Division (NSD) for the production of records related to foreign intelligence surveillance.

Plaintiff, SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT 21 UNITED STATES OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, and JOHN BERRY, Director 22 of the United States Office of Personnel Management, in his official capacity, Defendants. 24 SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT CASE NO. 3:10-cv-0257-JSW sf-2973146 INTRODUCTION 1. In this action, plaintiff Karen Golinski challenges federal discrimination against 4 her as a lesbian married to someone of the same sex, and the harm that such discrimination has 5 caused her and her family. 2. Plaintiff is a citizen of the State of California and of the United States of America. 7 She is legally married to a person of the same sex in accordance with California law. 3. The federal government does not license marriages, but many of its programs take 9 marital status into account to determine eligibility for federal benefits, protections and 10 responsibilities. Statutes, precedent, and principles of federalism establish that state law is the 11 touchstone for determining a couple’s marital status when establishing eligibility for federal 12 programs. 4. Plaintiff is an employee of the federal judiciary. She receives health insurance 14 through her employer and has elected a family health insurance plan to provide coverage to 15 herself and to her son. She requested that her employer enroll her spouse, Amy Cunninghis, in 16 her family plan, a benefit available to married employees of the federal judiciary. Defendants, on 17 behalf of the federal government, however, refused and blocked the enrollment, based on 18 plaintiff’s sexual orientation, and based on her sex in relation to the sex of her spouse. 5. As the basis for their denial of the benefits and protections of federal law, 20 defendants invoked Section 3 of the so-called “Defense of Marriage Act,” P.L. 104-199, codified 21 in part as 1 U.S.C. <unk>7 (“DOMA”), and stated that the federal government will only recognize 22 marriages between a man and a woman. 6. Defendants’ application of DOMA has barred plaintiff and her spouse from 24 receiving benefits that are routinely granted to other similarly situated married couples, based on 25 plaintiff’s sexual orientation and her sex in relation to the sex of her spouse. 7. This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 27 <unk>2201-2202 and Fed R. Civ P. 57 and for review of agency action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>28 701-706.

The result of these violations of the Constitution is that 3 plaintiff has been denied, and will continue to be denied, legal protections and benefits under 4 federal law that would be available to her if she were a heterosexual with a different-sex spouse.

This case was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a same-sex lesbian who was denied federal benefits and protections under the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) because of her sexual orientation and her sex in relation to the sex of her spouse. In April 2013, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the government. In May 2015, the court entered a final judgment against the government, concluding that DOMA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court also granted the government's motion to dismiss the case. The case was transferred to the federal district court in April 2014 for further proceedings. On April 2015, the parties filed a joint motion for summary judgment, which was granted. The parties agreed to a permanent injunction, and the parties entered a joint consent decree.</s>"

Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief I. INTRODUCTION 1. This civil rights action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the 3 devastating reduction in Medi-Cal funded in-home nursing care to Plaintiff Pablo Carranza. This 4 young man has Muscular Dystrophy, a severe and progressive disease that has left him unable even 5 to breathe or swallow on his own. Pursuant to his doctor’s orders, he needs constant skilled 6 nursing care to monitor his ventilator, feeding tube and oxygen levels, to clear fluids from his lungs 7 and tracheotomy tube, to transfer him from bed to wheelchair and back, and to bathe and reposition 8 him. While this kind of twenty-four hour care is often provided in a hospital or Subacute medical 9 care facility, Pablo has been able to remain at home with his family. If the Medi-Cal program 10 reduces Pablo’s in-home nursing care as planned, he will be placed at risk of unnecessary 11 institutionalization, and separated from his family and community. Due to his fragile medical 12 condition, placement in an institution is also likely to result in dire health consequences and even 13 death. 2. Until he turned age 21, Pablo was authorized to receive, and did receive, 615 hours 15 per month of Medi-Cal funded, one-to-one nursing care in his home. This was based on Medi- 16 Cal’s determination that he would otherwise be placed in a Pediatric Subacute medical facility. 17 The cost of his care was $230,000 per year, which is far less than the amount Medi-Cal would 18 actually pay for institutional placement for an individual with Pablo’s care needs. On Pablo’s 21st 19 birthday September 17, 2012 Defendant Department of Health Care Services and its Director, 20 Toby Douglas (collectively “DHCS” or “Defendants”), reduced the authorization for his in-home 21 nursing by more than 200 hours per month, even though his condition has not improved. The sole 22 reason for this drastic and life-threatening reduction in Plaintiff’s in-home nursing care is that 23 Defendants have placed arbitrary cost limitations on the home care services available to adults 24 versus those for children. Specifically, Defendants capped the cost of in-home nursing care for 25 adults such as Pablo at $180,000 per year, which is at least $90,000 below the actual cost of 26 equivalent care in an Adult Subacute facility, and also significantly below the cost that Medi-Cal 27 provided for his care prior to his 21st birthday. 3. Defendants have the discretion and the ability to modify State Medi-Cal rules to Carranza v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief 1 increase the arbitrary cap on Plaintiff’s in-home nursing care to enable him to receive the skilled 2 nursing care he needs, and that is ordered by his doctors. They have refused to do so. 4. So far, Defendants have not cut Plaintiff’s in-home nursing care but may do so at 4 any time after December 16, 2012, when his current authorization from Medi-Cal expires. Plaintiff 5 obtained a delay in the planned reduction in his nursing via an administrative appeal, but because 6 Defendant Douglas has the authority to set aside any administrative decision and substitute his own 7 decision, this process offers Plaintiff no protection after December",<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) | Disability Rights California (D.R.C.) | Western Center on Law Poverty (WCLP) | U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California ||| September 2013 ||| December 2014 ||| March 2015 ||| May 2015 | ||| June 2015 | May 2016 ||| July 2015 | July 2016 | August 2015 | September 2015 | October 2015 | December 2015 | January 2016 | February 2016 | March 2016</s>

But the District has failed to comply with this obligation, leaving between SOD and nearly 3,000 people with disabi li ties unnecessarily institutionalized in nursing fac il ities, segregated and isolated from their families and friends.

Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and 1988 to redress the deprivation under color of state law of rights secured by the United States Constitution. 4. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343. Jurisdiction to grant the declaratory relief requested is provided under 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201. 5. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>139l(b) because the defendant resides and offices within the district and a substantial portion of the events giving rise to plaintiffs' claims occurred in this district. FACTS 6. Oren and Mickey currently live in San Diego, California. Oren and Mickey are the parents of J, who was hom in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 2005. Oren and Mickey jointly adopted J in New York and obtained an Order of Adoption issued by the Ulster County Family Court dated April 27, 2006. 7. Whenever a person born in Louisiana is adopted in a court ofproperjurisdiction in any other state, the state registrar of vital records is the State official authorized, pursuant to R.S. 40:34 D and R.S. 40:76, to create a new record of birth and amend an original birth certificate in accordance with a fmal decree of adoption. 8. Oren and Mickey sought from the Louisiana Office of Public Health, Vital Records Registry, an amended birth certificate from the State ofLouisiaffi'!._that properly identifies both of them as J's legal parents. 9. In a letter to Oren and Mickey dated April 27, 2007, Smith rejected the request to issue an amended birth certificate listing Oren and Mickey as J' s parents. 10. In her letter, Smith stated, ""The Vital Records Registrar is not required to accept an out-of-state adoption judgment which names two unmarried persons as the adoptive parents."" Smith's position is based upon her belief that ""Louisiana is not required to accept such an out-ofstate judgment under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution if it violates public policy."" 11. To this day, Oren and Mickey have been unable to obtain an accurate birth certificate for their child, J. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Full Faith and Credit 17. Because Smith denies full faith and credit to plaintiffs' valid adoption decree by refusing to issue an amended birth certificate for J naming both Oren and Mickey and J' s legal parents, she violates plaintiffs' federal constitutional rights. SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF Equal Protection 18. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 through 17 as if set forth in full. 19. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S C. <unk>1983, provides that no state shall deny any person the equal protection of the laws. 20. Smith, acting in her capacity as Vital Records Registrar, recognizes and treats as valid adoptions by individuals or by married couples from any other state and issues accurate amended birth certificates for their adopted children born in Louisiana. Yet, Smith denies the legal benefit of an accurate amended birth certificate to a subset of children who are adopted by unmarried same-sex couples. In so doing, Smith has subjected J to adverse treatment because the child's parents are an unmarried gay couple. 21. The disparate treatment of children of unmarried parents based on the conduct or status of their parents violates the Equal Protection Clause. 22. Smith singles out unmarried same-sex couples and their adoptive children for unequal treatment for the improper purpose of making them unequal to everyone else.

SMITH, in his official capacity as the Director of the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts; AL JEAN BOGLE, in her official capacity as the Clerk of the Superior Court for Catawba County. Defendants. INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs are three North Carolina families. In each family, the adults are loving, committed same-sex couples who seek to have their legal out-of-state marriages recognized as lawful marriages in North Carolina. In addition, one couple is raising a child together, and seeks to ensure that both his parents have legally recognized parent-child relationships. Because North Carolina law does not respect their legal marriages, and in the case of the family raising a child, bars one parent from legalizing her relationship with her child, plaintiffs bring this suit alleging violations of the U.S. Constitution. 2. Plaintiffs Berlin, Blackburn, and Mejia have serious, life-threatening medical issues that make it likely that they and their families will suffer irreparable harm unless the state recognizes their legal out-of-state marriages. There is also an imminent risk of potential harm to child plaintiff J.G.-M.. 3. The adult plaintiffs seek to have their marriages from other jurisdictions recognized in North Carolina because of the numerous financial, psychological and social benefits that flow from a legally recognized marriage. Having their out-of-state marriages recognized by North Carolina will address the regular deprivations and indignities—economic, psychological and otherwise—the adult plaintiffs face each day. 4. Because of the gender and sexual orientation of the adult plaintiffs, they are denied the freedom to marry in North Carolina, and their out-of-state marriages are deemed invalid by North Carolina law, which specifies that the plaintiffs<unk>marriages are not “valid or recognized in the State.” N.C Const art. XIV, <unk>6 (as amended). 5. In addition, to secure similar benefits that flow from a legally recognized parent-child relationship, Ms. Mejia and Ms. Ginter-Mejia want to establish, via adoption, a full, legal parental relationship between their child J. G.-M. and his second parent. Specifically, Ms. Mejia, who is the non-legal parent, wishes to apply to adopt J.G.-M. whom she is currently raising with Ms. GinterMejia, J.G.-M.<unk>s legal parent. This adoption process is often referred to as “second parent adoption.” 6. North Carolina law prevents Ms. Mejia from forming such a legal relationship in the only way she can—through application for adoption—also because of her sexual orientation. 7. Plaintiffs bring this action (“Action”) to challenge the constitutionality of North Carolina<unk>s laws that exclude same-sex couples from marrying and that effectively void the marriages of same-sex couples lawfully entered into in other jurisdictions. In addition, Ms. Mejia and Ms. Ginter-Mejia challenge the constitutionality of North Carolina<unk>s adoption laws that prevent J.G.-M., the child plaintiff, from having a legal relationship with both of his parents. 8. The adult plaintiffs seek the same legal recognition of their family relationships afforded to heterosexual married spouses and their families for the same reason all families seek such relationships: so the members of each of the plaintiff couples can publicly declare their love and commitment before their friends, family and community, so each family member can achieve the benefits, security and protection that only a legal marriage and a legal adoption can provide, and so each family member can avoid the numerous psychological, social and financial detriments that arise from the lack of a legally recognized marriage or a legally recognized relationship between a parent and child.

Gerber and Pearl Berlin, and Lyn McCoy and Jane Blackburn, are spouses in every sense except that North Carolina law will not permit them to marry or recognize their marriages from other jurisdictions. 10. The adult plaintiffs wish to have their out-of-state marriages recognized in North Carolina. 11.

CASE NO. COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs are loving, committed same-sex couples who seek to marry in Nebraska or already are married, having wed in another state, but are treated as legal strangers in Nebraska. They bring this action pursuant to 42 USC <unk>1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for the violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution caused by Nebraska‘s exclusion of same-sex couples from marrying and its prohibition against recognizing the marriages of same-sex couples validly entered into in other jurisdictions Neb. Const art. I, <unk>29. 2. The plaintiff couples, like other committed couples, have cared for each other, supported each other, sacrificed for each other, and made plans for the future with each other. Some have endured great challenges and hardships together, such as serious illness. Some are raising children together. Like other couples who have made a lifetime commitment to each other, the plaintiff couples are spouses in every sense, except that Nebraska says they cannot marry and, if they have married in other states, their marriages are not honored here. 3. Nebraska‘s exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage adversely impacts the plaintiffs and other same-sex couples across the state in significant ways. It denies samesex couples and their families the numerous legal protections afforded to married couples. For example, when one partner or spouse dies, the survivor may face serious financial hardship, including the loss of her home, because she is denied the inheritance tax exemption and homestead protection provided to different-sex widows. Public employees with same-sex spouses and partners are denied spousal health insurance and pension benefits. And for lesbian and gay couples with children, the exclusion from marriage profoundly impacts their families by denying their children the security of having a legal relationship with both of their parents, depriving them of critical resources and leaving them vulnerable in the event their legal parent dies or becomes incapacitated. 4. In addition to significant tangible harms, Nebraska‘s exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage stigmatizes lesbian and gay couples and their children by denying them <unk>a dignity and status of immense import.<unk>United States v. Windsor, 133 S.Ct. 2675, 2692 (2013). The exclusion <unk>tells [same-sex] couples, and all the world,<unk>that their relationships are <unk>unworthy<unk>of recognition Id. at 2694. And it <unk>humilates the... children now being raised by same-sex couples<unk>and <unk>makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.<unk>Id. 5. Nebraska‘s exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage is unconstitutional. <unk>[N]o legitimate purpose overcomes [its] purpose and effect to disparage and to injure<unk>lesbian and gay couples and their families Id. at 2696. 6. Thirty-three states and Washington, D.C., have now ended their discriminatory exclusion of same-sex couples from the revered institution of marriage, many as a result of the growing judicial consensus that such discrimination cannot stand after the Supreme Court‘s decision in Windsor. Without intervention by the Court, lesbian and gay couples in Nebraska will continue to be denied the respect and critical protections that only marriage provides. 7. Accordingly, the plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that Nebraska‘s exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage and refusal to recognize the valid marriages of same-sex couples from other jurisdictions and defendants enforcement of the marriage exclusion violates the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

CATHERINE E. HEIGEL, in her official capacity as Director of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and State Registrar of Vital Statistics, Defendant. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. Plaintiffs Casy Carson (“Casy”) and Jacqueline Carson (“Jacqueline”) are a married couple who were denied accurate birth certificates for their newborn twins, simply because Casy and Jacqueline are spouses of the same sex. Even though South Carolina’s Department of Health and Environmental Control (“DHEC”) routinely lists both different-sex spouses as parents on their children’s birth certificates (including when their children were born through assisted reproduction and one of the parents is not genetically related to the children), Casy and Jaqueline’s twins received birth certificates inaccurately stating that they have only one parent, because DHEC refuses to recognize Casy and Jacqueline’s marriage on the same terms as the marriages of different-sex couples. 2. Casy and Jaqueline legally married in Washington, D.C. in 2014. They quickly began planning to have children, and Jacqueline subsequently became pregnant through assisted reproduction using an anonymous sperm donor. In the Fall of 2015, Jacqueline gave birth to twins, including a baby boy, S.B.C., and a baby girl, S.D.C., in Seneca, South Carolina. Casy and Jacqueline filled out forms at the hospital indicating that they were married, and that they both are the parents of their newborn boy and girl. 3. South Carolina law provides that children born into a marriage are automatically treated as the legal child of both spouses, and requires DHEC to provide a birth certificate memorializing the parental status of each spouse. This recognition of the family’s parent-child bonds allows parents instantly and reliably to establish their status in a range of important settings, from authorizing emergency medical care to enrolling a child for daycare or school. 4. In keeping with the importance of these familial relationships, DHEC has a duty under state law to provide birth certificates that accurately memorialize these parent-child relationships based on the parents’ marriage, even where it is definitively known that one spouse lacks a genetic connection to the child. DHEC currently applies these automatic protections only to children born to different-sex spouses, however. Children born to same-sex spouses are denied accurate birth certificates – receiving instead a certificate falsely stating that the child has only one parent – unless and until same-sex spouses undertake a costly and time-consuming process to obtain a court order requiring DHEC to issue an accurate birth certificate. 5. Even though Casy and Jacqueline indicated their marital status on the forms at the hospital, the birth certificates they received for S.B.C. and S.D.C. falsely indicate that the children have only one parent – Jacqueline, and contain no reference to Casy. 6. DHEC’s policy of refusing to provide accurate birth certificates to the children of Casy and Jacqueline and other same-sex spouses, as implemented through Defendant Catherine Heigel’s individual actions, violates guarantees of equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S Constitution. This discriminatory policy also denies the children of same-sex spouses the dignity, stability, autonomy, and privacy afforded to the families of different-sex spouses, and stigmatizes same-sex spouses’ family relationships as inferior. Casy and Jacqueline bring this suit, on their own behalf and on behalf of their children (together, “Plaintiffs” or the “Carson family”), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for the violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs ask this Court to: (1) declare that the denial of accurate birth certificates for the children of same-sex spouses is unconstitutional; (2) enjoin Defendant Heigel’s ongoing refusal to issue accurate two-parent birth certificates for the children of same-sex spouses on the same terms as the children of different-spouses; and (3) order Defendant Heigel to ensure that corrected birth certificates are issued upon request to the Carson family, and to other same-sex spouses and children previously denied them, without charging any fees that otherwise might apply to a corrected birth certificate.

ADAM MONREAL, in his official capacity as Chairman of the Illinois Prisoner Review Board; S.A. GODINEZ in his official capacity as Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections; and PAT QUINN, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Illinois, Defendants. CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Plaintiffs MOISES MORALES, MONTREAL THOMAS AND JOAQUIN ROCHA individually and on behalf of all similarly situated individuals, file this complaint against ADAM MONREAL, Chairman of the Illinois Prisoner Review Board, S.A. GODINEZ, Director of the Department of Corrections, and PAT QUINN, Governor of the State of Illinois, and allege as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. This is a civil rights class action complaint filed on behalf of the men and women who are in the custody of or under the supervision of the Illinois Department of Corrections (hereinafter, the DOC) and who are at risk of imprisonment without adequate due process as a result of the unconstitutional practices and procedures of both the DOC and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board (hereinafter, the PRB) with respect to parole revocation proceedings. The Defendants have developed a fundamentally unfair and procedurally flawed parole revocation process that violates the Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as set forth in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973) and related cases. This court should declare those procedures unlawful and it should enjoin them. 2. In direct violation of the U.S. Constitution, the Defendants unilaterally refuse to provide attorneys to parolees at any point in the parole revocation process. This is true even if a parolee has a colorable claim that he did not commit an alleged violation, has mitigating evidence explaining why revocation is inappropriate and/or the parolee cannot speak for him or herself. Consequently, parole revocation hearings in Illinois are a sham. The hearing officer (who adjudicates the preliminary parole hearing) and PRB member(s) (who adjudicate the final revocation hearing) preside over faux-hearings that have few of the trappings of due process required before an individual can be imprisoned or otherwise deprived of their liberty. In most instances, the hearing officer and the PRB members merely rubber stamp parole violation reports. 3. The Defendants conduct over 10,000 of these unlawful hearings each year. The Defendants have, in effect, created a procedural vortex from which people on parole cannot escape. As a result of the Defendants’ policies and procedures, the Plaintiffs are continually rotated in and out of the prison system—often as a result of non-criminal technical parole violations, and often based merely on an unsubstantiated accusation that the parolee committed a new criminal offense. The vast majority of parolees in the State of Illinois need and are entitled to appointed counsel to help them navigate these arcane proceedings. Yet, as a matter of practice and procedure, the Defendants systematically deny parolees their right to counsel. They fail to consider whether parolees qualify for the appointment of counsel, at cost to the State, and they fail to appoint counsel to those parolees who do qualify, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 4. This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 to redress the deprivation under color of law of the Plaintiffs rights as secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 5. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1367. Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) because the events giving rise to the claims asserted in this complaint occurred in this judicial district. PARTIES 6. Moises Morales is a parolee who is currently in the custody of the DOC. He is facing parole revocation because he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. Even though all criminal charges against him have been dismissed, the PRB hearing officer found probable cause at his preliminary parole hearing Mr. Morales is currently awaiting his final revocation hearing. He has a colorable claim that he did not commit the alleged violation, mitigating evidence to justify why he should not be imprisoned, and needs assistance presenting this evidence. Even so, the Defendants failed and will continue to fail to ensure that Mr. Morales is represented by counsel during his parole revocation proceedings. 7. Montreal Thomas is a parolee who is currently in the custody of the DOC. He is facing parole revocation because he was arrested on suspicion of possession of marijuana. Even though all criminal charges against him have been dismissed, the PRB hearing officer found probable cause at his preliminary parole hearing Mr. Thomas is currently awaiting his final revocation hearing.

The plaintiff sought an injunction ordering the Department to transfer her to a women's facility. On November 7, 2018, Judge Nancy Rosenstengel of the Southern District of Illinois granted a preliminary injunction requiring the defendants to provide basic mental health services to the plaintiff and consider all evidence as to whether she should be transferred to a women's prison. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS DEON HAMPTON (M15934), Plaintiff, v. ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS DIRECTOR JOHN BALDWIN, et al., Defendants. Case No. 18-cv-550 Judge Nancy J. Rosenstengel PLAINTIFF’S RENEWED MOTION AND MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION Plaintiff is a transgender woman currently housed in segregation in Dixon Correctional Center, a medium security men’s prison. Plaintiff has identified as a female since the young age of five. In 2012, she was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria by an IDOC psychiatrist and began receiving cross-sex hormone treatment while in IDOC custody in July 2016—as a result of the treatment, her testosterone level is virtually nil and she is chemically castrated. Despite being a transgender woman, Plaintiff has exclusively been placed in men’s prisons since entering IDOC custody. Prior to being housed in Dixon, Plaintiff was at Lawrence Correctional Center, Menard Correctional Center, and Pinckneyville Correctional Center; she was constantly sexually and physically abused by officers and other prisoners at all these institutions. When she reported this abuse, the officers at these institutions retaliated by filing false disciplinary charges against her that resulted in Plaintiff’s placement in segregation for approximately one year. Although Plaintiff was released from segregation at the end of May, Dixon staff placed her back in segregation one month later based on two false and retaliatory disciplinary tickets; Plaintiff does not know when she will be released from segregation. Plaintiff was transferred from Lawrence to Dixon on March 16, 2018, after she filed the instant lawsuit and her first Motion for a Preliminary Injunction seeking emergency relief from conditions arising out of her placement in Lawrence, namely unconstitutional physical and sexual violence, unlawful discrimination, denial of mental health care, and unlawful placement in segregation. When the Defendants’ initially transferred Plaintiff to Dixon, they began providing her some mental health treatment in segregation. Then, on May 25, 2018, the Defendants released Plaintiff from segregation, housed her in general population, and added group therapy to her mental health treatment plan. Because Plaintiff was no longer experiencing a mental health crisis, she withdrew her Motion for a Preliminary Injunction without prejudice on June 8, 2018. Immediately upon withdrawing her Motion for Preliminary Injunction, staff at Dixon began treating Plaintiff much worse, placing her in danger and causing the rapid deterioration of her mental health. Dixon staff escalated their verbal harassment based on her gender identity, continuously calling her “faggot,” “fag,” “it,” and “he-she,” among other derogatory terms. Dixon staff have made it clear that they will not protect Plaintiff from other prisoners who wish to harm her due to her gender identity. Staff failed to protect Plaintiff from one prisoner who sexually assaulted Plaintiff by groping her breasts and exposing himself. They also failed to protect Plaintiff from another prison who for weeks sexually harassed and assaulted her by kissing her and groping her private parts; this prison also threatened to rape her and cause her physical harm. When Plaintiff has attempted to speak up about the mistreatment she is enduring at the hands of staff and other prisoners, Dixon staff have chastised her for filing too many complaints. On June 26, 2018, Plaintiff received two false, retaliatory disciplinary tickets after officers repeatedly maced her in the face, resulting in her placement back in segregation. At that point, Plaintiff lost all hope and attempted suicide by hanging that same day. Staff found her unconscious and placed her on crisis watch. When she tried to come off crisis watch, she had a panic attack and was found trying to hang herself again. She was put back on crisis watch until July 2, 2018, when she was returned to segregation. Plaintiff continues to feel unstable and experience suicidal ideations. She fears that in segregation, she will try to hurt herself again, and that in general population, she will be hurt by other prisoners and staff. Plaintiff has already faced serious physical and emotional injury since arriving at Dixon and will continue to face a grave risk of serious injury if she remains there. For these reasons, and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, Plaintiff seeks a preliminary injunction ordering Defendants Director John Baldwin and Warden John Vargas in their official capacities to: 1) transfer Plaintiff to Logan Correctional Center, a women’s prison; and 2) remove Plaintiff from segregation. Preliminary injunctions are granted in extraordinary situations where there is a clear showing of need. Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997); Cooper v. Salazar, 196 F.3d 809 (7th Cir. 1999). The need here could not be more obvious or more immediate. Plaintiff’s situation satisfies each requirement for a preliminary injunction: (1) she will succeed on the merits because Defendants have so clearly violated (i) her rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against her on the basis of her gender identity and housing her in a men’s prison, and (ii) her rights under the Eighth Amendment by failing to protect her from sexual and physical assault and subjecting her","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) | U.S. District Court | Southern District of Illinois ||| March 2019 ||| July 2019 | ||| August 2020 ||| November 2020 | Plaintiff | Gender Dysphoria ||| June 2019 | Plaintiff filed this suit on March 16, 2019, seeking emergency relief from conditions arising out of her placement in a men's prison, including unconstitutional physical and sexual violence, unlawful discrimination, denial of mental health care, and unlawful placement in segregation.

THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, JOHN BALDWIN, JEFF SIMS, SHANE REISTER, DR. DOE 1, MELVIN HINTON, SYLVIA BUTLER, KELLY ANN RENZI, WILLIAM PUGA, DR. CHESS, DR NUNEZ. WEXFORD HEALTH SOURCES, INC. and DOES 2-5 Defendants. Case No. JURY TRIAL DEMANDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff, ANTHONY GAY by his undersigned attorneys, complains against the abovenamed Defendants as follows: INTRODUCTION When Anthony Gay was a teenager, he got into a fight with another teen who had insulted his sister. The teen claimed that Anthony had stolen his hat and a $1 bill in the process, so Anthony was charged with robbery. Anthony pleaded guilty, received a suspended prison sentence, and was placed on probation. Then, in another youthful error, Anthony violated his probation by driving a car without a license. As a result of these two events, in 1994 Anthony – then only 20 years old – was imprisoned by the Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”). With good behavior, he should have been released in 31<unk>2 years. But Anthony suffers from borderline personality disorder. After he was imprisoned the symptoms of this mental illness manifested, and he began to act out. Instead of providing treatment for his mental illness, the IDOC cited him for a variety of violations. Eventually, in 1998, the IDOC placed Anthony in solitary confinement—and it kept him there for the next twenty years. For twenty years, Anthony lived alone in a small, bare, stifling cell, where he was deprived of all human contact for close to 24 hours per day. The impact of solitary confinement on Anthony was catastrophic. Deprived of any sustained human interaction, Anthony’s mental condition deteriorated, and he began to engage in horrific acts of self-mutilation. He cut his forearm and his neck. He cut into his left inner thigh and wove the wound together with strips of a blanket. He cut into his scrotum and embedded a zipper there. He cut off a testicle and hung it on his cell door. He cut open his scrotum again and pierced it with paperclips. He mutilated his penis on multiple occasions, embedding a pen, plastics, and a zipper into the cuts. He stuck a pen into his eyelid and stabbed his thigh with a spoon, so deep that it had to be removed surgically. His documented acts of self-mutilation number in the dozens and continued for nearly the entirety of his solitary confinement. It was plain for anyone to see that solitary confinement was ravaging Anthony’s mind, and that he was in desperate need of appropriate mental healthcare. But instead of placing Anthony in a setting that would alleviate the impact on his mind, or providing him treatment to get better, the Defendants responded by prolonging Anthony’s extreme isolation, depriving him of access to human contact, programming, mental health care, and activities—for decades. As a result, Anthony’s torture was both compounded and extended. Solitary confinement had triggered Anthony’s mental illness, causing him to act erratically and irrationally. One manifestation was Anthony’s self-mutilation. Another was irrational “assaults” on prison staff, in which Anthony would do things like throw his body fluids at prison guards through cracks in his cell door. Instead of recognizing these acts for the manifestations of mental illness that they were, the Defendants doubled down. Anthony was given “tickets” that punished him with consecutive sentences of solitary confinement until the year 2152 – or two lifetimes of solitude. Anthony was also charged criminally for his “attacks” on prison staff, which ultimately extended his actual prison sentence by about fifteen years, with all but a few weeks of it to be served in solitary. This extreme isolation continued even though in Rasho v. Baldwin, No. 07-cv-1298 (C.D. Ill.), an ongoing class action concerning the IDOC’s treatment of mentally ill prisoners, the Defendants acknowledged that Anthony was among a handful of IDOC prisoners who were so mentally ill that they needed acute, inpatient psychiatric care. Defendants refused to provide this care. Instead, they continued to hold Anthony in extreme isolation, with the devastating impact that Anthony continued to mutilate himself. All told, Anthony spent nearly two decades in solitary confinement in a state of acute mental decompensation. By the time he was finally released from prison in 2018, he had mutilated himself hundreds of times. Throughout his solitary confinement, it was obvious to the Defendants that Anthony was in desperate need help. And at any point during his confinement, they could have rescued him, either by providing adequate services within prison or by transferring him to inpatient psychiatric hospital. For the Defendants, however, it was simply more convenient to deal with a difficult inmate by keeping him locked away in an isolation cell.

As discussed in the accompanying memorandum, this action meets the requirements for class certification under Rules 23(a) and 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the interests of justice would best be served by adjudication of the proposed class members’ claims in a single action.

Civil Action No.: 07-1155 (RMU) Document Nos.: 5, 29 MEMORANDUM OPINION GRANTING THE DEFENDANTS’ MOTIONS TO TRANSFER I. INTRODUCTION This case comes before the court on the defendants’1 motions to transfer the case to the Eastern District of North Carolina. The plaintiffs filed a proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of past, present and future prisoners at Rivers Correctional Institute (“Rivers”) who are dependent on the institution for medical, dental and mental health care. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants, owners and operators of Rivers, failed to provide adequate care and reasonable accommodations for disabled prisoners in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. <unk>791 et seq.; and state contract and tort law. In the alternative, the defendants request that the court transfer this suit to the Eastern District of North Carolina, the district in which the Rivers is located, because the events giving rise to the claims occurred there, the evidence is prevalent there, and the majority of prospective witnesses reside there. The court agrees that transferring the case furthers the interests of justice and grants the defendants’ request. Defendant Geo Group filed a motion to transfer on July 26, 2007. Approximately two months later, defendants Federal Bureau of Prisons and its director, Harley Lappin, also filed a motion to transfer. For ease of reference the court refers to these parties collectively as “the defendants.” II. FACTUAL PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Title XI of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, entitled the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 (the “Revitalization Act”), requires the Bureau of Prisons to incarcerate “at least 50 percent of the District of Columbia sentenced felony population” in “private contract facilities.” Pub L No. 105-33, 111 Stat. 251 (1997). Rivers is one such private contract facility, which defendant GEO Group (“GEO”) owns and operates pursuant to a contract with its co-defendant the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). Compl. 21. In 1998, the plaintiffs allege that GEO entered into a contract with BOP to house prisoners at Rivers (the “Rivers Contract”). Id. 31. Since its opening in 2001, thousands of D.C. felony offenders have been incarcerated at Rivers, which currently houses 1,300 prisoners. Id. 32. The plaintiffs contend that the defendants have neglected their contractual obligations, which require GEO to provide medical, dental and mental health care and require the BOP to ensure that appropriate care is being provided Id. 31, 33-35 (listing types of reports and other documents GEO must submit to the BOP pursuant to the Rivers Contract). On June 28, 2007, ten named plaintiffs, who are current or former prisoners at Rivers, brought suit against the defendants – GEO, the BOP and its director – on behalf of all former, present and future prisoners at Rivers. Id. 40. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants “are deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs, [which]... perpetuates a health care delivery system... that is so grossly inadequate as to violate the legal rights of the Plaintiffs....” Id. 38.

The plaintiff, bringing suit pro se, sought compensatory and punitive damages plus special damages for future legal fees. The plaintiff specifically claimed that the defendants violated his Second and Fourteenth Amendment rights by attempting to break in and enter his home, threatening to imprison him, fabricating stories to have him incarcerated, and asserting false criminal charges, which led to plaintiff spending three months and five days in county jail. The district court denied the defendant’s and plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment. In Dec. 2014, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to deny summary judgment. Settlement discussions have since been unsuccessful and the case is ongoing in the district court, pending trial once public health conditions allow.","DONELL L. PRINCE P.O.

Instead, defendant required Mr. VanValkenburg to train 4 inmates to act as interpreters for him, who were unqualified and failed to keep Mr. 5 VanValkenburg's infoiniation confidential. Defendant's ongoing conduct violates the Americans 6 with Disabilities Act as Amended and Oregon disability discrimination Iaw and constitutes a 7 pattern and practice of discrimination and a disability-based environment of hostility that started 8 in 2000 and continues to this day. PARTIES At all times mentioned herein, plaintiff David VanValkenburg, an individual, was an 12 inmate within the Oregon Department of Corrections correctional system, and was housed at the 13 the following facilities: Oregon State Penitentiary (""OSP""), Oregon State Correctional 14 Institution (""OSCI""), Snake River Correctional Institution (""SRCI""), Santiam Correctional 15 Institution (""SCI"") and Columbia River Correctional Institution (""CRCI'').

On January 5, 2015, the parties executed a settlement agreement for dismissal of the matter, in which the PDOC agreed to implement certain improvements and to pay $750,000 to DRN.  In particular, the PDOC will evaluate all incoming prisoners for serious mental illness, and will place prisoners with serious mental illness in solitary confinement only in ""exceptional"" circumstances; even then, a prisoner with serious mental illness can be kept in solitary confinement for no longer than 30 days and must be allowed out of their cells for 20 hours per week. The settlement also provided for a monitor to report on compliance, and will remain in effect for 3 years (less if the defendant demonstrates substantial compliance for a period of 18 months). There has been no activity on the docket since May 2015 and the case is presumably closed since the three year time period set in the agreement has lapsed. ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA DISABILITY RIGHTS NETWORK OF PENNSYLVANIA, Plaintiff, v. JOHN WETZEL, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, Defendant. Civil Action No. COMPLAINT I. Introduction 1. This action seeks to stop the cruel and unusual punishment of prisoners in Pennsylvania prisons diagnosed with serious mental illness. These men and women are confined in so-called Restricted Housing Units (RHUs) under horrific conditions, through an unconstitutional process that takes no account of—and exacerbates—their mental illness. Defendant’s mistreatment of these prisoners violates their rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 2. RHU prisoners are locked in extremely small cells for at least 23 hours a day on weekdays and 24 hours a day on weekends and holidays. Typically, the lights are on in the cell all the time. The prisoners are denied adequate mental health care and prohibited from working, participating in educational or rehabilitative programs, or attending religious services. They have only the most minimal contact with other human beings, except when they are assigned a cellmate, who may be psychotic or violent, which can be as deleterious to their mental health as solitary confinement. 3. Prolonged isolation under these extremely harsh conditions exacerbates the symptoms of the prisoners’ mental illness, which can include refusing to leave their cells, declining medical treatment, sleeplessness, hallucinations, paranoia, covering themselves with feces, head banging, injuring themselves and prison staff, and suicide. Frequently, these symptoms are regarded as prison rule infractions, which prison officials punish with still more time in the RHU. 4. The result is a Dickensian nightmare, in which many prisoners, because of their mental illness, are trapped in an endless cycle of isolation and punishment, further deterioration of their mental illness, deprivation of adequate mental health treatment, and inability to qualify for parole. 5. Defendant, the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC), knows or is deliberately indifferent to the fact that the DOC’s treatment of prisoners with mental illness, including the practice of segregating them for long periods of time in RHUs, can cause grave harm to their mental and physical health. Yet, Defendant has displayed deliberate indifference to the effects of the DOC’s mistreatment of these prisoners. Unlike correctional systems and officials in many other states, the Pennsylvania DOC does not adequately consider these prisoners’ mental illness before forcing them into RHUs, does not provide sufficient beds in units designed especially for prisoners with mental illness, and fails to take other reasonable measures to ameliorate the risk of serious harm to these prisoners. Defendant’s deliberate indifference to the effects of the DOC’s policies and practices on prisoners with mental illness systemically violates the Eighth Amendment. 6. Plaintiff, the Disability Rights Network of Pennsylvania (DRN), is a non-profit organization designated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pursuant to federal legislation to advocate for and protect the rights of Pennsylvanians with mental illness. DRN seeks an injunction requiring Defendant to cease violating the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners with mental illness in Pennsylvania prisons, provide them with constitutionally adequate mental health care, and protect them against dangerous and unconstitutional conditions of confinement. II. Jurisdiction and Venue 7. This Court has jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343. 8. Plaintiff’s claims are authorized by 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201 and 2202. 9.

JOHN E. WETZEL, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections; LOUIS S. FOLINO, in his official capacity as Superintendent of the State Correctional Institution at Greene; and JOHN KERESTES, in his official capacity as ELECTRONICALLY FILED Superintendent of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. JURY TRIAL DEMANDED Defendants. COMPLAINT Plaintiff Russell Shoatz, a/k/a Russell Shoats (“Shoatz”), by and through his undersigned counsel, files the following Complaint. Introduction Russell Shoatz is a 69-year-old who has been locked in solitary confinement at various State Correctional Institutions for the past 21 consecutive years, and 28 of the past 30 years. Shoatz is a father, grandfather, great-grandfather, human rights advocate, and published author. For the last 23 years, Shoatz has had an impeccable disciplinary record, receiving only one misconduct for a rule violation when he covered a vent in his cell that was blowing cold air in an attempt to stay warm. Sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 1972, Shoatz escaped from imprisonment in 1977 and in 1980. After he was recaptured, Shoatz was held in solitary confinement until being released to the general prison population at SCI Pittsburgh in 1982. Upon release to the general population, Shoatz committed himself to abiding by the rules and regulations of the prison. Toward this end he became involved with the Pennsylvania Association of Lifers (PAL), an officially-approved prison organization dedicated to advancing the interests of life-sentenced prisoners. In late 1982, Shoatz was one of a group of prisoners serving life sentences at the SCI Pittsburgh who began discussing ways to change the PAL to better serve the needs of the membership. Shoatz wanted the PAL to work with their non-incarcerated family members and public supporters to lobby the state legislature to repeal life without parole sentences. The membership of the PAL expanded from approximately 12 people to more than 100. The night that the old leadership was impeached and Shoatz appointed interim President in spring 1983, he was placed in solitary confinement. Pennsylvania prison officials have refused to release him from solitary confinement ever since. For a 19-month period from November 1989 to June 1991, Shoatz was housed in the general prison population at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. During his time in general population, Shoatz was an exemplary prisoner and did not commit any prison rule infractions. Despite this fact, following his transfer back to the state system, Shoatz was immediately placed back in solitary confinement where he remains to this day. For the better part of 30 years, Shoatz has lived in virtual isolation confined to a 7 x 12 cell for 23-24 hours per day, 7 days a week. The continuous prolonged exposure to the brutal conditions of solitary confinement have caused Shoatz physical and mental harm and anguish, and imposed a significant hardship on him in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. Prison officials refuse to explain what Shoatz must do in order to be released into the general prison population, and continue to warehouse him in solitary confinement based on an irrational fear of and animosity toward his human rights activism and perceived dissident politics. For Shoatz, it seems that death is his only hope of being released from the torturous conditions of solitary confinement. Jurisdiction and Venue 1. This is an action for injunctive, declaratory and monetary relief for violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983. 2.

Hoffman, Monty King, Larry Macon, Marvin McClain, Benjamin Perdue, Jr., Henry Stump and Barbara Tabor, by counsel, bring this class action on behalf ofthemselves and all other similarly situated inmates and for their causes of action allege as follows: NATURE OF THE CASE 1. This is a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of a class of inmates in Virginia's prisons whose constitutional rights are being violated by the practices, policies and procedures of the Virginia Parole Board (""the Board""). Plaintiffs were convicted of ""violent"" offenses committed prior to January 1, 1995, and have been legally eligible for parole under Virginia law for eleven years or more. Plaintiffs are serving lengthy prison sentences that were imposed at a time when the expectations and assumptions of the courts, prosecutors and defense counsel were that Plaintiffs would receive fair and meaningful consideration for parole, as required by Virginia law, if they demonstrated themselves suitable for release once they became eligible for parole. These expectations and assumptions, however, were misplaced. In the years since enactment of Virginia Code <unk>53.1-165.1 abolishing parole for offenses committed on or after January 1, 1995, the Board has administered the parole process in a manner that eliminates any fair or meaningful consideration of parole for Plaintiffs, thus effectively abolishing parole retroactively even for offenses committed prior to January 1, 1995. Specifically, the Board has adopted and implemented practices, policies and procedures for making parole determinations without considering all the circumstances that Virginia law requires to be considered, resulting in a drastic reduction in the availability of parole for inmates convicted of violent offenses and the defacto abolition of the provisions of Virginia law governing parole for such inmates. Moreover, these practices, policies and procedures have created a significant risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to such inmates' crimes at the time of sentencing. The Board's actions have violated due process and constitute an ex postfacto enhancement of Plaintiffs' punishments, in violation of the United States Constitution. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. This action arises under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 because it is a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief to address the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights, privileges and immunities secured to Plaintiffs by the Constitution of the United States. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.c. <unk>1331 and 1343. 3. Venue is proper in the Eastern District of Virginia pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391, because the Board's offices are located, and most or all of Defendants reside and may be found, in the Eastern District of Virginia, and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs' claims have occurred in the Eastern District of Virginia.

She has been incarcerated for more than 28 years. She first became eligible for parole in 1994. By letter dated February 22,2009, the Parole Board denied her parole for the twelfth time.

She first became eligible for parole in 1999. On December 16,2009, the Parole Board denied her parole for the seventh time. With one exception, on each occasion the sole reason given for the denial has been ""the serious nature and circumstances of the crime"" or words to that effect.

The plaintiffs alleged rampant discrimination on the basis of race and family status, rent overcharges, and a failure to maintain rental units. After participating in settlement conferences, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice and without costs in July 2017.

LOUIS DIVISION PAUL LAMBERT, MARY HOLDER, BARBARA HOLDER, WILLIAM FREY, PAMELA PURDIMAN, SHAMEKA NELSON, and KIMBERLY SIMELTON, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, v. ALEXANDER COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY, JAMES WILSON, THOMAS UPCHURCH, JOANNE PINK, and MARTHA FRANKLIN, an Illinois municipal corporation, Defendants. Case No. 3:16-cv-513 JURY TRIAL DEMANDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. This lawsuit is brought on behalf of current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (“ACHA”) to remedy rampant race discrimination and family status discrimination as well as substantial rent overcharges. For years, ACHA and its agents have discriminated against residents of its McBride and Elmwood family housing developments based on their race and familial status, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3604, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003. ACHA also has overcharged its residents for rent, in violation of the Brooke Amendment to the U.S. Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1437a, in many instances collecting $100-$200 per month in excess of the limit permitted by federal law. 2. ACHA has engaged in a pattern and practice of segregating its public housing developments by race, even though the United States Department of Justice previously found that it engaged in the same conduct more than 40 years ago. 3. ACHA also has engaged in a pattern and practice of not maintaining the Elmwood and McBride developments – which are occupied almost exclusively by African-American tenants – so that they have deteriorated to the point that they are nearly uninhabitable. McBride and Elmwood apartments, which are located in Cairo, Illinois, are infested with mice, roaches, and bedbugs. For years, Elmwood and McBride residents made request for repairs, and ACHA ignored them or repaired them in a substandard manner. Both developments also have long suffered from serious security problems. Despite these safety issues, ACHA failed to provide security guards or cameras. 4. Meanwhile, ACHA has adequately maintained its Connell Smith development in satisfactory condition and provided both security cameras and security guards. Until very recently, approximately half of Connell Smith residents were white, and almost all were over the age of fifty. 5. ACHA has refused to place families with children in certain public housing developments, such as Connell Smith, in order to prevent African American families from living in majority white public housing developments. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6. This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 (federal question), 1343 (color of state law), 3613 (Fair Housing Act), and 1367 (supplemental jurisdiction). 7. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the ACHA, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201 and 2202. 8. Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) because ACHA violated federal law in this judicial district. PARTIES 9. Paul Lambert is a 65-year-old African-American man who has lived in ACHA’s Elmwood development since approximately 1978. He lives in a three-bedroom unit with his wife, Bessie, and 21-year-old disabled son, Sharonne. 10. Mary Holder is a 68-year-old African-American woman who has lived in ACHA’s McBride development since approximately 1992. She lives alone in a two-bedroom unit. 11. Barbara Holder is a 70-year-old African-American woman who has lived in ACHA’s McBride development since approximately 1970. She lives alone in a three-bedroom unit. 12. Pamela Purdiman is a 41-year-old African-American woman who has lived in ACHA’s Elmwood development since approximately September 2015. Before that, she lived in ACHA’s McBride Development between April 2001 and August of 2012 or 2013. She lives alone in a two-bedroom unit. When she lived in McBride, she lived with her minor children. 13. William Frey is a 55-year-old Caucasian man who has lived in ACHA’s Shoemaker development since approximately June 2015. He lives alone in a one-bedroom unit. 14. Kimberly Simelton is a 41-year-old Caucasian woman who has lived in ACHA’s Elmwood development on and off since approximately 1994. She has been in her current unit since approximately 2008. She lives in a three-bedroom unit with her husband, Kenneth Simelton, and her 19-year-old daughter.

Black people have been hunted, brutalized and killed by the police since the 2 inception of law enforcement in the United States, including a demonstrable history of 3 violence in San José. This action arises out of protests across the nation in response to 4 the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police Department officers. 5 Floyd’s death, so soon after law enforcement killed Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud 6 Arbery, mobilized millions of people around the country to condemn the deaths of 7 Black and Brown people by law enforcement in one of the largest social justice 8 movements in U.S. history.1 9 2. In San José, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on May 29, 2020, and 10 for several days thereafter, to express their view that police brutality and 11 institutionalized racism must end.

Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated seeking class certification compensatory damages, and attorney’s fees pursuant to 4 2 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and 42 U.S.C. <unk>1988 for violations of theirs and others similarly situated civil rights, as said rights are secured by said statutes and the Constitu tions of the State of New York and the United States. 2. Under a pattern and practice set and enforced by city officials, the New York City Police Department (""NYPD""), and New York City Police Officers stop, search, seize, arrest and issue summonses to individuals without probable cause in orde r to m eet summons quotas, in violation of the U.S. Constitution. 3. To encourage this pattern and practice, th e NYPD rewards police officers with more summonses issued and punishes officers w ith fewer summonses issued, regardless of probable cause, the number of summonses actuall y filed or the num ber of summonses that are successfully prosecuted. 4. At least two (2) po lice officers, P.O. Adrian Schoolcraft and P.O. Adil Polanco, have provided evidence of the aforementioned incentives and pressures to increase the number of summonses issued by NYPD officers in the form of tape recordings of Supervising Officers from the 81st and 41st precincts instructing officers to meet quotas in order to secure their jobs and gain incentives. 5. Specifically, in an interview conducte d by Eyewitness News on March 2, 2010, P.O. Polanco provided evidence of the polic y of issuing summ onses pursuant to a quota regardless of probable cause, the num ber of summonses actually file d or the num ber of summonses that are successfully prosecuted. 6. In that inte rview, P.O. explicitly stated that of ficers were instruc ted to issue summonses regardless of whether any crim e or vi olation had occurred but instead in order to meet quotas (“numbers”) set forth by NYP D: “EVEN IF THE CRIME IS NOT COMMITTED, THE NUMBER IS STILL THERE.” 7. P.O. Polanco further stated that if an officer does not m eet the aforementioned quotas for issuing summonses, he or she could receive punishment in the form of losing overtime, having their shifts changed or being denied days off. 8. Further, in that same interview, Eyewitness News provided additional evidence of this policy in the f orm of tape reco rdings of commanding and supervising officers pressuring officers to meet their summons quota. Specifically, one commanding officer at the 41 st precinct was recorded as stating in sum and substance: “NEXT WEEK YOU COULD BE AT 25 (SUMMONS ES) AND 1 (ARREST), YOU COULD BE AT 35 (SU MMONSES) AND 1 ARREST) AND GUE SS WHAT UNTIL YOU DECIDE T O QUIT T HIS JOB AND BEC OME A PI ZZA HUT DELIVERY MAN, THIS IS WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO BE DOING UNTIL THEN.” 10. Additionally another supervising of ficer from the 41 st precinct was recorded as stating in su m and substance: “THINGS ARE NOT GOI NG TO GET ANY BETTER, ITS GOING TO GET A LOT WORSE. IF YOU THINK 1 (ARREST) AND 20 (SUMMONSES) IS BREAKING YOUR BALLS GUESS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE DOING, YOU’R E GOING TO BE DOING A LOT MORE, A LOT MORE THAN WHAT YOU THINK.” 11.

As a result of our investigation, we have determined that the City of Steubenville, the SPD, and the City Manager, in his role as Director of Public Safety (collectively, the ""City"") have violated the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. <unk>14141. I have authorized filing a civil suit in United States District Court to remedy this violation. (The lawsuit would name as a defendant the Civil Service Commission,<unk>in addition to the above parties, in order to allow the District Court to accord complete relief.) We would be willing to defer filing suit, however, if you are interested in negotiating a voluntary settlement in the form of a consent decree to be filed with a civil complaint. During the course of our investigation, we reviewed: policies and procedures of the SPD; SPD internal files relating to civilian complaints of police misconduct and discipline of officers; complaints and other documents from recent civil lawsuits against the City relating to police misconduct; hundreds of arrest and incident reports; criminal judicial decisions excluding evidence or dismissing criminal charges on the basis of police misconduct; and internal City documents relating to allegations of misconduct. We also interviewed many individuals, and met with City representatives, including you and the City Manager, the Mayor, and the Chief of Police, and, with your consent, a number of SPD officers. Our investigation has revealed that SPD officers engage in a pattern or practice of misconduct. Specifically, SPD officers engage in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, including when they are off-duty but acting under color of law, and in a pattern or practice of making false and retaliatory arrests and charges. In addition, SPD officers tamper with evidence and/or witnesses, falsify official reports and filings, and conduct unlawful searches and seizures of Steubenville residents and their homes and property. The misconduct of individual officers is caused and condoned by City policies and practices inadequate use-of-force policies; inappropriate offduty-conduct policies; a civilian complaint policy that both discourages and fails to investigate complaints; failure to monitor and supervise police conduct; failure to train; failure to discipline; and retaliation against civilians who complain. 1. Misconduct by SPD officers We have uncovered substantial evidence of SPD officers' use of excessive force, especially when they are off-duty but acting under color of law, or prompted by minor resistance to police action. In addition, SPD officers frequently falsely arrest and charge individuals. Moreover, SPD officers tamper with evidence and/or witnesses, and falsify in official reports and filings. Finally, SPD officers conduct unlawful searches and seizures of residences and residents. This behavior amounts to a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives persons of their federal civil rights. 2. City policies and practices a. Lack of use-of-force policies. The City has no policy and provides no training about what types of force are useful and acceptable in different types of situations. In addition, it fails to require use-of-force reports or otherwise investigate or review uses of force. b. Off-duty policies. SPD policy requires police officers to carry a firearm at all times and to ""take action"" whenever the need arises without respect for whether they are on or off duty. Misconduct and harm to civilians arises not from either policy alone, but from the combination of the policies and the absence of guidance about how SPD officers should deal with predictable but difficult situations. The result is two problems: First, police are able to abuse their authority to vindicate their side of a personal dispute. Second, off-duty police are encouraged to place themselves and civilians at risk when they respond to an emergency situation in the heat of the moment, unprepared and not readily identifiable as police officers. c. Civilian complaint practice and failure to investigate complaints. The City's practice is to discourage civilians from making complaints, and to fail to investigate adequately those that are made. Civilians who do make formal complaints are discouraged from seeking formal resolution. Instead, the Chief of Police encourages his shift commanders to resolve complaints ""in-house"" <unk>. without documentation or disciplinary result. Where there is formal resolution of a civilian complaint, the documentation leading to such resolution, and apparently the investigation that would otherwise be documented, is practically nonexistent. Only seldom are statements taken from police officers, and even more rarely from other witnesses. Equally rarely is physical evidence collected or evaluated. d. Failure to monitor and supervise. The SPD has in place no mechanisms to monitor police officers for the possibility of a developing problem","<pad>The U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division conducted a civil investigation of the Steubenville Police Department to determine whether its officers were engaging in a pattern or practice of violating individuals' federal civil rights. The investigation uncovered substantial evidence of SPD officers' use of excessive force, including when they are off-duty but acting under color of law, and making false and retaliatory arrests and charges. In addition, SPD officers tamper with evidence and/or witnesses, falsify official reports and filings, and conduct unlawful searches and seizures of residences and property.

Plaintiffs are three distinguished law faculty and a human rights attorney who work with 11 or advocate before the International Criminal Court (“ICC”), and specifically its Office of the Prosecutor 12 (“OTP”), on human rights and humanitarian law matters. Plaintiffs file this suit to challenge the Trump 13 administration’s unprecedented imposition of sanctions against two senior OTP officials, which violate 14 Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights by prohibiting their constitutionally protected speech with the OTP. 2. The ICC is a permanent court based in The Hague, The Netherlands. The international 16 community joined together to establish the ICC in 1998 in order to hold accountable perpetrators of 17 genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity (collectively known as “atrocity crimes”). The 18 establishment of the ICC reflects a shared international understanding that global peace, security, and 19 well-being require an international, independent court of last resort able to ensure accountability for these 20 most serious crimes when national justice systems are unable or unwilling to do so. 3. The effort to provide an avenue for justice for atrocity crimes and other serious violations 22 of international human rights and humanitarian law is a legacy of the post-World War II trials at the 23 International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. The ICC has enjoyed broad international support since its 24 founding: 120 States initially adopted the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (the “Rome 25 Statute”) creating the ICC and, as of today, 123 States Parties have ratified or acceded to it.

Plaintiffs request immediate emergency relief enjoining Defendant from enforcing the deadline for third party presidential candidates to file election petitions with Defendant and extending the deadline to September 1, 2020. 1. To secure access to the District’s general election presidential ballot, independent and third-party presidential candidates are required to file petitions with Defendant containing the signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of all registered voters within the District of Columbia. See, D.C. Official Code <unk>1001.08; 1-23. 2. On May 13, 2020, responding to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic raging within the District, the District of Columbia passed emergency legislation altering a variety of statutory requirements to minimize personal interactions within the District in support of social distancing requirements deemed necessary to combat the continuing transmission of the Wuhan novel coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic. 3. As part of the District’s emergency response to the ongoing health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the District dramatically reduced the number of signatures required to be filed with Defendant for every candidate for elective office in the District and gave those candidates substantial notice prior to the filing deadline to take advantage of the reduced signature requiments except independent and third party presidential candidates for the Office of President and Vice President of the United States.

The failure to extend coronavirus relief to the signature requirements for thirdparty and independent presidential candidates caused Plaintiffs to abandon their intended effort to secure ballot access in the District of Columbia judging that in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and the constant public messaging directing citizens to engage in constant social distancing it would be nearly impossible to collect the required number of signatures to secure ballot access, would be a waste of money and campaign resources, and, more importantly, place their volunteers and professional petition circulators at increased risk of endangering their health by contracting the virus which causes COVID-19 as a result of the prolonged petition drive that would be necessary to attempt to collect the required number of signatures. 5. Had Plaintiffs been given the same notice as all other candidates before the deadline to file signatures with Defendant that the total number of signatures would be reduced from 5,007 signatures to 250 signatures, Plaintiffs would have collected and timely filed the signatures and all other necessary documents to secure access to the District’s 2020 general election presidential ballot. 6. On August 6, 2020, the Mayor of Washington D.C., signed Bill B23-0864 into law, reducing the presidential petition signature requirement from 5,007 signatures to just 250 signatures. 7. However, the deadline to file petitions for independent and third-party presidential candidates to secure access to the District’s 2020 general election presidential ballot was August 5, 2020. 8. As a result, independent and third party presidential candidates who refrained from collecting signatures when the signatures total was kept at 5,007 signatures because of the judged likelihood that it would be both nearly impossible to collect the required signatures in an environment where voters have been instructed by government officials at every level to avoid contact with strangers within 6-feet (hereinafter “social distancing”) and because any prolonged petition drive to attempt to collect the then required 5,007 signatures would place their volunteers and professional petition circulators","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] May 13, 2020 | District of Columbia | Coronavirus Emergency Amendment Act of 2020 ||| August 5, 2020 | First and Fourteenth Amendments ||| Washington D.C.

PARRISH, LONNIE GRIFFIN and CONCERNED UNITED PEOPLE, Plaintiffs, vs. JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, JEFFERSON COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD, and MARTY BISHOP, SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS, in his official capacity, Defendants. Case No.: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF NATURE OF THE CASE 1. Plaintiffs challenge the redistricting plan the Jefferson County Board of Commissioners and the Jefferson County School Board adopted in 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the “2013 Redistricting Plan” or “the Plan”), as a violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal representation under the “one person, one vote” principle of the Equal Protection Clause. Plaintiffs assert that the 2013 Redistricting Plan is a form a prison-based gerrymandering. Defendants’ decision to include the inmate population at Jefferson Correctional Institution (“JCI”) unlawfully inflates the political strength of actual residents in the district that houses the prison (District 3) and dilutes the voting strength of those living in all of the other districts in the county (Districts 1, 2, 4 and 5). 2. “Prison-based gerrymandering” is a practice whereby local governments like Jefferson County include inmates as residents of the district where the prison is located when drawing election lines. The Jefferson County Board of Commissioners (“Board of Commissioners”) and the Jefferson County School Board (“School Board”), adopted the same redistricting plan in 2013 for their respective five single-member districts. The Plan treats the approximately 1,157 inmates at JCI as if they were ""residents"" of District 3 even though the overwhelming majority of these individuals remain residents of their pre-incarceration community for virtually all legal purposes, including voting. 3. The incarcerated population at JCI constitutes a full 37.73% of the people who make up District 3, and 43.2% of the voting age population in the district. As a result, every four actual residents of District 3 have as much political influence in county and school affairs as seven residents in any other district. Consequently, the voting strength of persons residing in District 3 is artificially inflated and the voting strength of persons residing in all of the other districts is weakened, in violation of the “one person, one vote” principle established by the Fourteenth Amendment. 4. The 2013 Redistricting Plan has a discriminatory effect on Jefferson County residents outside of District 3. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the use of the Plan for any and all future elections, and to replace it with a plan that protects their right to equal protection under the law pursuant to Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

537,CJ-MI-0004,"[ENTITYCHAIN] 2012 | Eastern District of Michigan | the Sex Offender Registration Act ||| 2018 | Sixth Circuit | SORA [SUMMARY] In 2012, plaintiffs filed suit in the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging that the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), when applied retroactively, violated their rights to due process, was unconstitutionally vague, violated prohibitions on ex post facto laws, and violated their fundamental rights. In 2018, upon remand from the Sixth Circuit, the district court held that SORA violated the Ex Post Facto clause and could not be applied retroactively.  ","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN SOUTHERN DIVISION JOHN DOES #1-4 and MARY DOE, Plaintiffs, v. File No. 2:11-cvHon. RICHARD SNYDER, Governor of the State of Michigan, and COL. KRISTE ETUE, Director of the Michigan State Police, in their official capacities, Mag. Judge COMPLAINT PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Plaintiffs John Does #1-4 and Mary Doe are Michigan residents who have been retro- actively required to comply with Michigan’s Sex Offender Registration Act for the rest of their lives. See M.C.L. <unk>28.721 et. seq., as amended July 1, 2011 (SORA 2011). 2. The plaintiffs were all charged or convicted before SORA 2011 came into effect. 3. Under SORA 2011, the plaintiffs have been and will be subjected to constant supervision; required to report frequently in person; banned from living or working in many areas; restricted as to when they can travel; limited in their rights to free speech; hindered from maintaining nor- mal family relationships; identified publicly and falsely as dangerous; and subjected to a vast array of state-imposed restrictions that encompass virtually every facet of their lives. See Obligations, Disabilities, and Restraints Imposed by SORA 2011 (Exh. 1). The plaintiffs must comply with these extensive restrictions and obligations for as long as they live, or face criminal sanctions. 4. The plaintiffs ask this Court to recognize what other courts across the country have increasingly found: that the nature of sex offender registration has fundamentally changed since 2003, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a registration scheme that imposed only “minor and indirect” restraints on registrants. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 100 (2003). 5. Numerous courts have now recognized that the retroactive application of sex offender registration schemes and their associated restrictions violate the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws. See, e.g., U.S v. Juvenile Male, 590 F.3d 924 (9th Cir. 2009), vacated as moot, 131 S.Ct. 2860 (2011); State v. Williams, 952 N.E.2d 1103 (Ohio 2011); Wallace v. State, 905 N.E.2d 371 (Ind. 2009); State v. Letalien, 985 A.2d 4 (Me. 2009); Commonwealth v. Baker, 295 S.W.3d 437 (Ky. 2009); Doe v. State, 189 P.3d 999 (Alaska 2008). 6. SORA 2011 imposes such extensive and punitive restrictions on the plaintiffs that it violates the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws. 7. In addition, SORA 2011 violates the plaintiffs’ fundamental rights to travel, work, speak, and raise their children, without being narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest. 8. SORA 2011 also violates the Due Process Clause because it (a) requires John Doe #1 to register even though he was never convicted of a sex offense; (b) requires John Doe #2 to register on a public registry even though he was promised privacy in his plea agreement; and (c) extends the registration periods for John Does #3-4 and Mary Doe from 25 years to life. 9. Finally, many provisions of SORA 2011 are void for vagueness. The plaintiffs are strictly liable for complying with a sweeping and complex law, even though the language of the law does not provide clear notice of what is prohibited or required, either for those subject to it or for those who enforce it, making full compliance with the law impossible. 10. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief barring retroactive application of the law as applied to them, and limiting the application of SORA 2011 to individuals who are actually dangerous. JURISDICTION 11. Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343 because the plaintiffs seek redress for the deprivation of rights secured by the U.S Constitution. The plaintiffs’ federal claims are brought under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983. 12. The plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201-2202, by Fed R. Civ P. 57 and 65, and by the legal and equitable powers of this Court. 13. State claims may be heard by virtue of the Court’s supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1367. 14.

Plaintiffs challenge the federal government’s unwarranted and unlawful decision to designate a musical band’s supporters as a criminal gang, thereby subjecting them to significant harm, including repeated police harassment and denial of employment. 2. Among the supporters of almost any group – whether it be a band, sports team, university, political organization or religion – there will be some people who violate the law. Inevitably, some will do so while sporting the group’s logos or symbols. However, it is wrong to designate the entire group of supporters as a criminal gang based on the acts of a few. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened here. 3. Plaintiffs self-identify as “Juggalos,” or fans of the musical group Insane Clown Posse (“ICP”) and other bands on ICP’s independent record label, Psychopathic Records. Some of ICP’s songs, such as “Juggalo Homies,” “Juggalo Island,” and “Miracles,” have hopeful, life-affirming themes about the wonders of life and the support that Juggalos give to one another. Other music, called “horrorcore hip hop,” uses very harsh language to tell nightmare-like stories with an underlying message that horrible things happen to people who choose evil over good. 4. Many people view Juggalos as nonconformists because of their musical tastes, their practice of painting their faces to look like clowns, and the distinctive Juggalo symbols – including the “hatchetman” logo – that they often display on their clothing, jewelry, body art and bumper stickers. Yet when Juggalos come together at concerts or their annual week-long gathering every summer, they know that they are in a community where all people are equal and where they will be accepted and respected for who they are. The unifying theme for Juggalos is that no matter what one’s economic status, racial background or past problems, Juggalos are a “family” of people who love and help one another, enjoy one another’s company, and bond over the music and a philosophy of life. Organized crime is by no means part of the Juggalo culture. 5. The Defendants, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), estimate that there are over a million Juggalos in the United States. As with any large group, a relative handful engage in criminal activity, sometimes while wearing Juggalo symbols. Yet, in 2011, Defendants seized on reports of independent crimes to brand Juggalos across the country as a “loosely-organized hybrid gang” in the DOJ’s 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment (“2011 Assessment”). 6. This gang designation has caused real harm to ordinary Juggalos from coast to coast. Defendants widely published the designation to state and local police agencies through an online law enforcement database, as well as through reports and other means. As a result, state and local police routinely stop, detain, interrogate, photograph and document people like Plaintiffs, who do not have any connections to gangs, because they have exercised their First Amendment rights to express their identity as Juggalos by displaying Juggalo symbols. Other Juggalos, including plaintiff Scott Gandy, have been denied consideration for employment because of the gang designation.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. The City of Buffalo has, for over five years, engaged in a systematic practice of targeting Black and Latino neighborhoods and residents for aggressive and punitive traffic en- forcement. The City employs this unlawful practice in part to generate municipal revenue. The City has thus effectively sought to balance its budget on the backs of its Black and Latino citi- zens. 2. Plaintiff Black Love Resists in the Rust (“Black Love Resists” or “BLRR”) and individual plaintiffs and class representatives, Dorethea Franklin, Taniqua Simmons, De’Jon Hall and Jane Doe (“Class Plaintiffs”) bring this civil action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 on their behalf and as representatives of similarly situated individuals, to obtain an injunction ending and remediating the City’s unlawful and discriminatory traffic enforcement practices. The Class Plaintiffs also seek monetary damages from the City on behalf of the class for the considerable and cumulative financial harm, humiliation, and loss of liberty and property that these invasive and punitive traffic stops have imposed over the years. 3. Beginning around 2012, high-level Buffalo Police Department (BPD) officials deployed a crime “Strike Force” that implemented a vehicle Checkpoint program to conduct socalled “traffic safety” stops and searches of drivers without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. These Checkpoints impose no minor inconvenience. They operate as roadblocks that block off residents’ streets and driveways and prevent them from traveling out of their targeted neighborhoods without being stopped and possibly searched, as they are trying to carry out the most basic activities of civic life such as going to work, dropping children at school, grocery shopping, or attending medical appointments or religious appointments. 4. The City believes it has the authority to subject Buffalo residents to suspicionless searches and liberty restrictions as part of a general crime control strategy or in the undifferentiated interest in deterring criminal activity. But the Constitution does not permit the police to sit in wait and presume all citizens who come before it may have committed a crime. 5. Moreover, Buffalo residents do not bear this burden on freedom of movement and civic engagement equally. The City places the Checkpoints overwhelmingly in Black and Latino neighborhoods, predominantly in Buffalo’s highly segregated East Side. Publicly available data detailed in this complaint demonstrates the dramatic racial disparity in the uses of vehicle Checkpoints and the corresponding, racialized distribution of the burdens they impose. For example, over 85% of Checkpoints in a study of Checkpoint deployment occurred in predominantly Black or Latino neighborhoods, and nearly 40% of all Checkpoints conducted since 2012 occurred in just three of Buffalo’s 77 Census tracts, each of which had a Black or Latino population exceeding 86%. Statistically, the variable of “Black or Latino population” is the dominant explanation for Checkpoint location, explaining nearly 80 percent of the variation in Checkpoint location. 6. The City has deployed vehicle Checkpoints to generate revenue. The year the City implemented a vehicle Checkpoint strategy, the Buffalo Police Department (BPD) issued more than 36,000 traffic violations, an increase of 92% over the prior year. And after the City created the Buffalo Traffic Violations Agency (BTVA) to keep all of the revenue from traffic tickets, BPD’s issuance of traffic tickets increased dramatically, as did the corresponding revenue to the City. Thus, the Checkpoints that the City operated for the constitutionally impermissible purpose of crime control also served to harvest revenue from poor, Black and Latino residents at grossly disproportionate levels—in violation of the requirement of fundamental fairness embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 7. The City enhances its revenue harvesting by regularly layering multiple tickets on an individual during one stop, and for seemingly pretexual bases. For example, one class member was issued four separate tickets for having four tinted windows, costing him $720 ($180 per window). Furthermore, in an effort to secure additional payment, the issuing officer offered that class member a choice: jail or the immediate impoundment of his","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Black Love Resists in the Rust | City of Buffalo | U.S. District Court | Western District of New York | August 20, 2018 | | [email protected] On August 20, 2018, a group of African-American residents of Buffalo, New York filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Western New York against the city of Buffalo and the Buffalo Police Department.

DRC challenges Defendants’ needless and illegal segregation of adults with 6 serious mental health disabilities into Alameda County’s psychiatric institutions. DRC also 7 challenges Defendants’ practice of subjecting adults with serious mental health disabilities to a 8 high risk of such institutionalization, including those experiencing homelessness and those who 9 have been incarcerated in Alameda County’s jail. Defendants must increase access to 10 community-based mental health services to end this unlawful and extremely damaging disability 11 discrimination. Defendants’ failure to provide intensive community-based services puts adults 13 with serious mental health disabilities, especially Black adults with such disabilities, at constant 14 and high risk of unnecessary institutionalization. Alameda County’s psychiatric detention rate 15 for people with mental health disabilities is more than three-and-a-half times the California 16 statewide average. Defendants have detained more than 10,000 people in the County’s 17 psychiatric institutions since January 2018. During this time, Defendants have also detained 18 hundreds of people more than ten times, the majority of whom are Black. Some people have 19 been institutionalized more than 100 times. These “cycling admissions” are “the hallmark of a 20 failed system.” United States v. Mississippi, 400 F. Supp. DRC is California’s Protection and Advocacy (“P&A”) system. It is 22 empowered and charged by federal law to protect the rights of California residents with mental 23 health disabilities. In 2018, DRC opened an investigation into Alameda County’s practices 24 regarding unnecessary segregation in the County’s psychiatric institutions. These institutions 25 include John George Psychiatric Hospital (“John George”), a public psychiatric hospital operated 26 by Alameda Health System, and Villa Fairmont Mental Health Rehabilitation Center (“Villa 27 Fairmont”), a locked psychiatric institution located on the same campus as John George. On 28 November 1, 2019, DRC issued a written probable cause finding detailing the results of DRC’s COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1 investigation, attached herein as Appendix A.

541,DR-CO-0022,"[ENTITYCHAIN] 2015 | deaf individual | Parkview Health Systems Inc ||| the Americans with Disabilities Act [SUMMARY] In 2015, a deaf individual filed a lawsuit against Parkview Health Systems Inc.  He claimed that he was not provided an interpreter in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which severely influenced his communications with hospital staff regarding his critically injured daughter. The case settled for changes in policy and practice.  ","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO Civil Action No. 1:15-cv-00270 GEORGE BACA, Plaintiff, v. PARKVIEW MEDICAL CENTER, INC., and PARKVIEW HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC., Defendants. COMPLAINT Plaintiff George Baca, by and through his attorneys, the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center, hereby brings this Complaint against Parkview Medical Center, Inc. and Parkview Health Systems, Inc. (collectively, “Parkview”). INTRODUCTION 1. Twenty-four years after the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) was passed and more than 40 years after Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), Parkview failed to provide sign language interpreters and other accommodations for the deaf father of a critically injured minor, denying him effective communication and deeply exacerbating an already stressful situation. JURISDICTION AND VENUE This action arises under the laws of the United States. Jurisdiction is conferred upon this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1343 for the federal law claims, and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1367 for the state law claim. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b)(2), as all of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in the District of Colorado. PARTIES 4. Plaintiff George Baca is currently and at all times relevant to this suit has been a resident of the State of Colorado in Pueblo County Mr. Baca is an individual with a disability because he is substantially limited in major life activities, including hearing. 5. Defendants Parkview Medical Center, Inc. and Parkview Health Systems, Inc. are private, nonprofit corporations one or both of which own, operate, lease and/or lease to a private hospital, the Parkview Medical Center, which is a place of public accommodation as that term is used in title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12181(7) and the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, COLO REV STAT. <unk>24-34-601. On information and belief, both Parkview Defendants are recipients of federal financial assistance as that term is used in Section 504. On information and belief, Parkview Medical Center employs more than 15 people. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 6. Plaintiff Baca is deaf, and does not understand speech. His first language and primary mode of communication is American Sign Language. 7. Like many individuals who have been deaf since childhood, Mr. Baca does not read or write with fluency. American Sign Language, not English, is his native language. 8. In order to communicate effectively with strangers and/or in situations that call for more than routine language, Mr. Baca requires the services of a qualified sign language interpreter. Specifically, he requires a sign language interpreter in communications relating to medical topics and in conversations involving multiple individuals. 9. At all times relevant to this lawsuit, Parkview has known that Mr. Baca is Deaf. 10. On the evening of July 6, 2013, Mr. Baca was notified that his minor daughter was struck by a car and taken by ambulance to Parkview. He arrived at the hospital not long after. 11. In the emergency room lobby, Mr. Baca immediately requested to see his daughter and to be provided a sign language interpreter. No interpreter was provided. 12. On the evening of July 6, for most of July 7, and for the morning of July 8, Mr. Baca repeatedly requested an interpreter to speak with doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff. He was receiving no effective communication concerning what staff were doing and desperately wanted to understand. 13 Mr. Baca requested a sign language interpreter on July 6, 2013. 14. Defendants did not provide an interpreter for Mr. Baca on July 6, 2013. 15 Mr. Baca requested a sign language interpreter on the morning of July 7, 2013. 16. Defendants did not provide an interpreter for Mr. Baca until approximately noon on July 7, 2013. 17. The interpreter Defendants provided to Mr. Baca on July 7, 2013 interpreted for him for approximately two hours. 18. After the interpreter provided to Mr. Baca on July 7, 2013 left, Defendants did not provide an interpreter for Mr. Baca for the remainder of that day. 19. On the morning of July 8, 2013, medical staff met in Mr. Baca’s daughter’s hospital room to discuss her condition. 20 Mr. Baca again requested an interpreter for this meeting. 21. Parkview did not provide an interpreter for the meeting with medical personnel on the morning of July 8, 2013. 22. Although a sign language interpreter was provided later in the day on July 8, medical personnel did not return to Mr. Baca’s daughter’s room to discuss her condition in the presence of the interpreter. 23. When Mr. Baca arrived at the Emergency Room on the evening of July 6, he was unable to understand what Parkview staff were telling him about his daughter’s condition. The only way the doctor could convey the extent of Mr. Baca’s daughter’s injuries was to pull back the curtain on her room and show Mr. Baca her critical injuries. Without effective communication to convey the context of his daughter","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] July 2013 | Parkview Medical Center | Colorado | U.S. District Court | District of Colorado ||| American Sign Language | American Disabilities Act | Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act ||| Parkview Health Systems, Inc.<n>On July 6, 2013, a resident of the State of Colorado filed this lawsuit against Parkview Medical center and Parkview Health systems in the United States District Court for the district of Colorado.

COMPLAINT 1. This is a class action lawsuit based on the willful and deliberate refusal of the Defendants to comply with federal laws protecting the rights of the Plaintiffs, who are deaf or hard of hearing individuals in the custody of Defendant Kentucky Department of Corrections 2. The state agencies, entities, and officials named as Defendants in this case have failed to comply with federal laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. <unk>794 et seq., and the Constitution of the United States. 3. Through their policies and practices, Defendants discriminate against deaf and hard of hearing individuals in KDOC’s custody. They have done this by denying deaf and hard of hearing individuals in their custody adequate and equally effective means of communication with individuals outside of prison—including effective communications between the Plaintiffs and their loved ones. Defendants have also failed to provide adequate access to other auxiliary aids and services necessary to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing individuals in a variety of settings, including in connection with educational, religious, healthcare, and rehabilitative programs. Defendants also refuse to provide deaf and hard of hearing individuals in KDOC custody with adequate notification of important daily events and safety announcements, or to provide adequate interpretative services at disciplinary hearings. Additionally, Defendants have discriminated against inmates who are deaf or hard of hearing in work assignments. 4. As a result of the Defendants’ discriminatory policies and practices, deaf and hard of hearing individuals in KDOC’s custody and care: • have been prevented from effectively communicating by telephone with family, friends, and attorneys outside of prison; • have been unable to receive necessary and adequate medical treatment; • have missed prison-wide safety announcements, prison counts, and announcements for meals and other important daily activities; • have been excluded from participation in educational and counseling programs offered by KDOC, including those required under the terms of their sentencing; • have been unable to and discouraged from attending standard religious services due to inadequate accommodations; • have been discriminated against in work assignments; • have been denied the ability to meaningfully participate and defend themselves in disciplinary hearings; and • have been prevented from learning a trade and receiving educational and industrial credits that could reduce their overall incarceration time. 5.

Scarborough Middle School, Defendants. CLASS ACTION CASE NO. CV-11-245 COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. This is a federal civil rights action brought by six Mobile County Public School (""MCPS"") students on behalf of a class of other MCPS students to challenge the violation oftheir Fourteenth Amendment right to receive notice and a hearing before being punished with long-term suspensions. The named Plaintiffs, who range in age from thirteen to eighteen, have been long-term suspended without proper notice or a hearing for minor infractions. One was long-term suspended for having his shirt untucked, another for not carrying his identification badge. When another student arrived late to lunch, he was expelled for the remainder of the semester and never given an opportunity to defend himself. Under the Due Process Clause ofthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, school administrators must provide students with notice and a fair hearing before punishing them with long-term suspensions. The Defendants have deprived the named Plaintiffs and many other students of these important constitutional rights. These violations impact not only the students, but also their families and communities. 2. Long-term suspensions are devastating for students and their families. Suspended students are forced to miss weeks or months of classroom instruction. While out of school, students often receive automatic zeros and are rarely given makeup work. As a result, they often fall behind their classmates and become frustrated with school. These consequences are magnified for students who are already struggling academically. Many students fail courses solely because of the number of missed class days, and some are forced to repeat a grade level as a result. Moreover, suspensions do nothing to address the underlying causes of misbehavior, which can range from academic issues and fear of embarrassment, to peer pressure, immaturity, disabilities, and the effects oftrauma. 3.<unk>Long-term suspensions also have serious consequences for the entire community. Mobile faces a graduation rate crisis: less than 50 percent ofMCPS students graduate from high school. Research has found that that the more days a student is suspended, the less likely the student is to graduate from high school. Students who do not graduate from high school cost the community millions of dollars in lost economic activity, increased social costs, and crime. The MCPS system consistently suspends well over 10,000 students at least one time per year; thousands of these suspensions are for minor infractions, such as dress code violations and tardies. Yet in 2010, MCPS significantly reduced the due process protections that principals must follow before suspending students. 4. This complaint raises two procedural due process claims. First, it presents a facial challenge to the official disciplinary procedure approved by the Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County-aprocedure that allows principals to impose long-term suspensions without first holding hearings at which students and parents can challenge proposed suspensions. Second, it challenges the practices ofthe named Defendant Principals, who summarily suspend students until the end of the semester without following even the minimal procedures set forth in the Board's official policy. 5. The Defendants' actions have caused the Plaintiffs and countless other students to suffer academically and emotionally. Most, ifnot all, of the Plaintiffs will be forced to repeat classes or whole grades, and many will not graduate on time. They want to return to school but do not feel welcome there. 6. To address these harms and to stop them from occurring in the future, the Plaintiffs, on behalf of a class of similarly situated students, seek orders requiring an end to these unconstitutional practices, the immediate provision of notice and fair hearings for all affected students, and a change of the MCPS disciplinary procedure to ensure basic fairness to students facing lengthy suspensions from school and the resulting loss of educational opportunity.

DEFENDANTS OPINION AND ORDER This cause is before the Court on the Motion of Defendants to Dismiss. Having considered the pleadings, the Court finds the Motion is well taken and should be granted. I. Factual Background and Procedural History On January 9, 1861, Mississippi became the second state to secede from the Union. In February of that same year, the Confederate States of America was formed, and Mississippi was among the states in the Confederacy. The Confederate States of America were defeated by Union troops during the Civil War, which ended in 1865. In January of 1868, Mississippi assembled a constitutional convention for the purpose of drafting a state constitution. The Mississippi Constitution was adopted on May 15, 1868, and was ratified on December 1, 1869. Relevant to this case, the Mississippi Constitution that was adopted in 1868 contained the following education clause: As the stability of a republic form of government depends mainly upon the intelligence and virtue of the people, it shall be the duty of the Legislature to encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement, by establishing a uniform system of free public schools, by taxation or otherwise, for all children between the ages of five and twenty-one years, and shall, as soon as practicable, establish schools of a higher grade MISS CONST. of 1868, art. VIII <unk>1. On February 23, 1870, the United States Congress passed the Mississippi Readmission Act, the purpose of which was “to admit the State of Mississippi to Representation in the Congress of the United States.” 16 Stat. 67 (1870). The Act provides, in relevant part: WHEREAS the people of Mississippi have framed and adopted a constitution of State government which is republican; and whereas the legislature of Mississippi elected under said constitution has ratified the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States; and whereas the performance of these several acts in good faith is a condition precedent to the representation of the State in Congress: therefore, Be it enacted... That the said State of Mississippi is entitled to representation in the Congress of the United States... ... [T]he State of Mississippi is admitted to representation in Congress as one of the States of the Union upon the following fundamental conditions: First, That the constitution of Mississippi shall never be so amended or changed as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United States of the right to vote who are entitled to vote by the constitution herein recognized... Second, That it shall never be lawful for the said State to deprive any citizen of the United States, on account of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude, of the right to hold office under the Constitution and laws of said State... Third, That the constitution of Mississippi shall never be so amended or changed as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United States the school rights and privileges secured by the Constitution of said State Id. Following its ratification in 1868, the education clause of the Mississippi Constitution was amended in 1890, 1934, 1960, and most recently in 1987. In its current form, the education clause provides: The Legislature shall, by general law, provide for the establishment, maintenance and support of free public schools upon such conditions and limitations as the Legislature may prescribe. In May of 2017, Indigo Williams, Dorothy Haymer, Precious Hughes, and Sarde Graham (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), who identify themselves as being low-income African-American women with schoolaged children in various public elementary schools in Mississippi, filed suit in this Court on behalf of their children against several Mississippi officials including Governor Phil Bryant, Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives Philip Gunn, Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves, State Superintendent of Education Carey Wright, and the individual members of the Mississippi State Board of Education. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the prior amendments to the education clause of the Mississippi Constitution, which have removed the requirement that the State establish “a uniform system of free public schools”, have resulted in a grave disparity in the education being provided to students who attend either predominantly White or predominantly Black schools around the state. Plaintiffs further allege that their children, who attend predominantly Black schools, are being substantially harmed by the educational opportunities, or lack thereof, that have resulted because of the non-uniform school system that exists in the state. Through their Complaint, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the amendments made to the education clause in the Mississippi Constitution following its ratification in 1868 violate the “Readmission Act’s fundamental condition that Mississippi’s Constitution never be amended or changed [so] as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United States of the school rights and privileges” secured thereunder.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Charles Patrick Pratt (“Charlie” or “Charles”) endured a decade of discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and se x as a student in the Indian River Central School District before he was forced to forsak e his public education to escape the escalating abuse. For Charlie, school was not a time to learn while making new friends – it was a course i n cruelty that grievously impaired his education, health, and well-being, and threatened his dignity and personal safety. 2. Beginning in Charlie’s earliest years in the School District, students subjected him to antigay and sexis t harassment, while school employees – ignoring multiple pleas from his parents – allowed the hostility to intensify. In middle school, the discrimination and harassment became a near daily occurren ce, as students att acked Charlie relentlessly and with i mpunity, hurling antigay and sexist slurs at him like “fa ggot,” “sissy,” “queer,” and “fudgepacker” – sometimes many times in a single school day and often in the presence of teachers. Students also physically intimidated and attacked Charlie in middle school, frequently shoving him in the hallways, knocking books from his hands and threatening to “beat [his] ass.” 3. At Indian River High School, the discri minatory abuse further intensified. In addition to the vicious nam e-calling, students re peatedly threatened Charlie with physical violence, vandalized his locker with antigay sl urs, slammed him forcefully into walls and lockers, and humiliated him by spitting on him hurling food and spitballs at him grabbing and pinching his buttocks, taunting him with offensive gestures, a nd knocking his belongings from his hands. 4. School District em ployees were aware of the ram pant antigay and sexist harassment on cam pus but deliberately refused to undertake even the most basic correctiv e or remedial measures, despite these employees’ clear authority and ability to do so. Instead, staff members at the Indian River High School whose very job it was to monitor and supervise student behavior in the cafeteria and ha llways frequently joined in on the harassment, ridiculing Charlie with stereotypically effem inate gestures in fr ont of other students and telling Charlie he was “disgusting” and “shouldn’t be gay.” 5. Particularly egregious were the blat ant discriminatory acts and callous indifference of Mr. Jam es Kettrick, the Indian R iver High School pr incipal at the tim e. Rather than conduct investigations or im plement remedial measures in response to known acts of antigay and sexist harassment, Mr. Kettrick responded to the abuse by blaming the victim, telling Charlie, for example, to “tone it down” if he wanted to avoid the verbal and physical intimidation and mistreatment from other students. 6 Mr. Kettrick, whose responsibilities included ensuring the security and welfare of all students at Indian River High Sc hool, told Charlie’s parents that their son’s safety on ca mpus could not be guaranteed. When Cha rlie’s parents decided that, to protect their son from further physical and em otional harm, they had no option other than to withdraw Charlie from Indian River High School, Mr. Kettrick did not propose or undertake any appropriate action to i mprove the school clim ate or change the co nditions that le d to th is drastic m easure. Instead, he told Charlie’s parents that he agreed with the decision. 7 Mr. Kettrick’s indifference and discrim ination extended far beyond Charlie. Despite Mr. Kettrick’s knowledge that antigay and sexist bully ing was seriously im pairing students’ health and edu cation, Mr. Kettrick refused to allow","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Indian River Central School District | Northern District of New York ||| March 2014 ||| May 2015 ||| June 2016 ||| October 2018 ||| December 2018 | ||| January 2019 ||| February 2019 | | May 2019 | May 2020 ||| July 2019 | March 2020 | March 2021 | May 2021 | June 2020 | July 2021 | March 2019 | July 2020 | June 2021 | February 2020 | May 2021, May 2021, March 2020, and March 2021 (the ""Plaintiffs"") filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Northern New York on March 14, 2014.

(“USSF”) is the single, 3 common employer of female and male professional soccer players who play on the 4 United States Senior Women’s National Soccer Team (“WNT”) and the United States 5 Senior Men’s National Soccer Team (“MNT”). Despite the fact that these female and 6 male players are called upon to perform the same job responsibilities on their teams 7 and participate in international competitions for their single common employer, the 8 USSF, the female players have been consistently paid less money than their male 9 counterparts. This is true even though their performance has been superior to that of 10 the male players – with the female players, in contrast to male players, becoming 11 world champions. 2. The USSF has claimed that its mission is to “promote and govern soccer 13 in the United States in order to make it the preeminent sport recognized for excellence 14 in participation, spectator appeal, international competitions and gender equality.” 15 (Emphasis added.) In reality, the USSF has utterly failed to promote gender equality. 16 It has stubbornly refused to treat its female employees who are members of the WNT 17 equally to its male employees who are members of the MNT. The USSF, in fact, has 18 admitted that it pays its female player employees less than its male player employees 19 and has gone so far as to claim that “market realities are such that the women do not 20 deserve to be paid equally to the men.” The USSF admits to such purposeful gender 21 discrimination even during times when the WNT earned more profit, played more 22 games, won more games, earned more championships, and/or garnered higher 23 television audiences. 3. During his 2017 campaign for president of the USSF, current President 25 Carlos Cordeiro, who had been a member of the USSF’s Board of Directors since 26 2007 and Vice President of the USSF from 2016 to February 2018, admitted, “Our 27 women’s teams should be respected and valued as much as our men’s teams, but our 28 female players have not been treated equally.” The USSF, however, has paid only lip COMPLAINT 1 service to gender equality and continues to practice gender-based discrimination 2 against its champion female employees on the WNT in comparison to its less 3 successful male employees on the MNT. 4.

Plaintiff Joseph Gooden was hired as an employee at Timpte’s Commerce City plant in April 1998. He was the only African-American employee in a plant with at least 65 employees. From the start of his employment at Timpte, Mr. Gooden experienced subtle discrimination in the form of being shunned by many of his co-workers. This continued throughout his employment at Timpte. 8. This subtle discrimination soon became quite blatant. Shortly after he began working at Timpte, Mr. Gooden found out that another employee referred to Mr. Gooden as a “nigger.” Despite the fact that this slur was made in the presence of a Timpte supervisor, Defendant Harold Crabtree, the employee who made the statement was not disciplined. 9. In July 1998, Defendant Crabtree anticipating and apparently condoning the appalling discrimination to come told Mr. Gooden that if he saw a noose around the shop he should not worry, that it would merely be a “joke” arising from the O.J. Simpson trial. Defendant Crabtree also said that there had been nooses in the shop in the past. 10. Also in July, Mr. Gooden discovered that another co-worker had referred to him as a “nigger” and that this slur had been voiced in Defendant Crabtree’s presence Mr. Gooden discussed the incident with the President and the Human Resources Director at Timpte. Despite reassurances made to Mr. Gooden that they would deal with the situation, the employee who made the racial slur was not terminated and received only minor, if any, discipline. 11. On August 7, 1998, Mr. Gooden arrived at work and opened the cabinet where his tools and other belongings were kept. Inside he found a black doll with a noose around its neck hanging from the top of the cabinet. Finding a depiction of an African American being lynched appalled, distressed and frightened Mr Gooden. Faced with a workplace in which he was the only African American employee, in which he had been the target of racial slurs, and in which his supervisors and managers did not nothing to stop the discrimination, Mr. Gooden feared for his personal safety. 12. On information and belief, the noose and doll were placed in Mr. Gooden’s locker by Timpte employees, supervisors and/or managers whose identity is unknown to Mr Gooden. These individuals are designated herein as Does 1 through 10. 13 Mr. Gooden often witnessed other Timpte workers using offensive ethnic epithets in reference to and to the face of Latino co-workers. Such epithets were often used in the presence of Timpte supervisors and managers. Such supervisors and managers tolerated, approved of, and condoned the racially and ethnically hostile workplace. 14. The conduct described herein created intolerable working conditions for Mr Gooden. The racial harassment and intimidation were sufficiently severe and/or pervasive that they altered the terms, conditions and/or privileges of his employment Mr. Gooden felt demeaned and humiliated by the environment of racial intolerance and abuse and felt fear for his personal safety in reaction to the mention and eventual appearance of a noose. A reasonable person in Mr. Gooden’s position would likewise feel demeaned, humiliated and frightened by the conduct he encountered. 15. The events described above had the effect of unreasonably interfering with Mr. Gooden’s work performance and of creating an intimidating, hostile, and offensive working environment. 16.

Charles TAYLOR, et al., Plaintiffs, v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WATER SEWER AUTHORITY, Defendant. No. CIV.A. 01-00561HHK Jan. 2, 2002. Attorneys and Law Firms *44 David A. Branch, Washington, DC, for plaintiff. *45 Julia Perkins, Washington, DC, Mary E. Pivec, Greenberg Traurig, L.L.P., Washington, DC, for defendant. Opinion OPINION AND ORDER KENNEDY, District Judge. In this case Charles Taylor alleges that the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (“WASA”) discriminated against him and other WASA African American employees in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. <unk>2000e et seq. (“Title VII”), and Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1981 (“1991 Act”). In addition to his own claims, Taylor seeks to prosecute claims on behalf of a class of WASA African American employees. Before the court is WASA’s motion to dismiss Taylor’s class claims. WASA argues that because Taylor seeks compensatory damages and trial by jury in addition to injunctive relief, he cannot, as a matter of law, satisfy the requirements for class certification set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b) “Rule 23(b)” or “23(b)”). Upon consideration of WASA’s motion, the opposition thereto, and the record of the case, the court concludes that the motion to dismiss should be denied. I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND Taylor seeks to prosecute this action on behalf of a plaintiff class consisting of all African American employees and applicants who sought and were denied positions or career ladder promotions at WASA from October 1996 through December 2000. Taylor alleges that after WASA became an independent authority in 1996 and ceased to be bound by District of Columbia personnel regulations and civil service protections, it instituted an “at-will” employment system without uniform personnel policies. Taylor alleges that this system allows management to hire and promote candidates based on word of mouth and to manipulate candidates’ scores in favor of those handpicked in advance. As a result of this system, Taylor alleges, African American employees are denied the opportunity to advance to the same level and at the same rate as similarly situated white employees. Specifically, Taylor claims that African American employees are hired at the lowest level of the career ladder and are required to serve as long as five years for career ladder promotions, while similarly situated white employees are hired at higher levels and regularly receive promotions in less than five years. Taylor also claims that equally qualified African American employees are often passed over for promotions in favor of white employees of the Washington Suburban Sanitation Commission and other outside agencies. In addition, Taylor alleges that African Americans encounter a “glass ceiling” at WASA: although they make up approximately seventy-five percent of the agency’s employees, they are “underrepresented” at higher pay grade levels. With respect to his individual claims, Taylor asserts that he applied for several promotions during his tenure at WASA, but was passed over despite demonstrating the required qualifications. Taylor has been employed by WASA as a civil engineering technician for the past twelve years. The civil engineering career ladder ranges from grade DS-2 through grade DS-11; Taylor’s current grade is DS-8. Advancement to a higher grade within the series requires that the employee serve the required time in-grade, demonstrate the ability to perform at the next grade, and receive the recommendation of his or her supervisors. According to WASA, “ability” is determined by the employee’s supervisors, and includes dedication to the job, getting along well with co-workers and clients, and technical aptitude. Taylor alleges that in June 2000, his supervisor at the time, an African American male, wrote a letter recommending Taylor for a promotion to grade DS-9 on the basis that Taylor had demonstrated the above qualifications. Nonetheless, the Director of the Department of Engineering and Technical Services, a white male, denied Taylor the promotion. Taylor filed a race discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) on September 19, 2000, and filed the present action within ninety *46 days of receiving a right to sue letter from the EEOC.1 The time within which Taylor is required to file a motion for class certification was stayed pending the court’s ruling on WASA’s motion to dismiss. II. ANALYSIS A. Statutory Background Taylor alleges disparate treatment and disparate impact claims under Title VII and requests declaratory and injunctive relief as to both claims. Taylor also requests compensatory damages and trial by jury on his disparate treatment claim as provided for under the 1991 Act. Before addressing whether Taylor’s disparate treatment claim qualifies for class certification under Rule 23(b), it is helpful to review the disparate treatment cause of action and the effect the 1991 Act had upon it. 1.

OPINION BASSLER, J. *1 The certified class action presently before the Court challenges the terms of AT T’s management pension plan. Plaintiffs commenced this action on August 5, 1998. Now before the Court is Defendants’ third motion for partial dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Before turning to the merits of the pending motion, mindful that this action is now in its fifth year and is before its second District Court Judge, the Court will endeavor to briefly recount how much (or, depending on one’s point of view, how little) has already occurred in the dispute. In February, 1999, Defendants AT T and the AT T Maragement Pension Plan (collectively “AT T” or “Defendants”) filed their first motion for partial dismissal. In April, 1999, Judge Nicholas Politan granted Defendants’ motion. A number of Counts were dismissed with prejudice, and the remainder of the Complaint was dismissed without prejudice, so that Plaintiffs could re-file an appropriate Amended class action Complaint. Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint on June 7, 1999. In October, 1999, Defendants filed their second motion for partial dismissal, seeking to dismiss portions of the First Amended Complaint. Before the Court issued its ruling on the second motion for partial dismissal, Plaintiffs moved for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The Court took both motions under advisement in December, 1999. On June 29, 2000, Judge Politan granted Plaintiffs leave to file their Second Amended Complaint. Judge Politan also granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ second motion for partial dismissal, and dismissed the First, Second, and Eighth Counts of Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint with prejudice. On July 28, 2000, Plaintiffs moved for reargument of the Court’s dismissal of Counts One and Two. The Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for reargument on October 4, 2000. On October 20, 2000, Plaintiffs moved for class certification. Before ruling on the motion, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to submit additional materials in support of their application for class certification. On June 7, 2001, Judge Politan granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification with regard to the remaining claims in the Second Amended Complaint, dismissed the Ninth claim for relief, and directed plaintiffs to submit additional evidence in relation to the class’s claims. On June 25, 2001, Defendants moved for reconsideration of the Court’s June 7, 2001 decision. On July 6, 2001, Plaintiffs moved for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint.1 On November 20, 2001, in his last action in this case before retiring from the bench, Judge Politan granted Plaintiffs’ motion to file a Third Amended Complaint, denied Defendants’ motion for reconsideration, and clarified his June 7, 2001 class certification ruling. Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Complaint on November 29, 2001. On January 11, 2002, the case was reassigned from Judge Politan to this Judge. As previously mentioned, now before the Court is 2002 WL 32159586 Defendants’ third motion for partial dismissal, which is directed to Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) Defendants seek to dismiss Counts Ten, Eleven, and Twelve from the Third Amended Complaint. Defendants also seek to strike Counts One, Two, Eight, and Nine from the Third Amended Complaint, on the grounds that these Counts were previously dismissed from the Second Amended Complaint by Judge Politan. *2 Having reviewed the extensive submissions of the parties, and having reviewed Judge Politan’s earlier decisions, for the following reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss counts One, Two, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, and Twelve is granted. I. STANDARD Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), a complaint will be dismissed on the pleadings if it appears beyond doubt that a plaintiff can prove no set of facts consistent with the allegations of the claim that would entitle him to relief.

The Plaintiffs argued that the U.S had violated equal protection under the fifth amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs represented by Winston and Strawn LLP, LAMBDA Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Outserve-SLDN (now known as the Modern Military Association of America) sought declaratory and injunctive relief allowing HIV positive service members to continue to serve and damages. The Plaintiffs allege that they were discharged from their duties in the Air Force due to their HIV status. The case was assigned to Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.  On January 11, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to  prevent the defendants from restricting Roe and Voe and others similarly situated from being promoted, changing duty station, or re-training on the same terms as other service members living with HIV who are not being separated.  A hearing was held before Judge Brinkema on February 15, 2019. The same day, Judge Brinkema issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.  The order enjoined the defendants from separating or dicharging from military service Richard Roe, Victor Voe, and any other similarly situated active-duty member of the Air Force because they are classified as ineligible for worldwide deployment or deployment to the United States Central Command area due to their HIV-positive status.  The defendants appealed to the decision on the preliminary injunction to the Fourth Circuit.  Oral argument was held on September 18, 2019 before a panel of Fourth Circuit Judges comprised of Judges James A. Wynn Jr, Albert Diaz, and Henry F. Floyd.  In January 2020, the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the district court's decision.  In the district court, both parties have filed motions for summary judgment, and oral argument is set for August 4, 2020.  The case is ongoing.","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA Alexandria Division RICHARD ROE, VICTOR VOE, and OUTSERVE-SLDN, INC. Plaintiffs, v. JAMES N. MATTIS, in his official capacity as Secretary of Defense; HEATHER A. WILSON, in her official capacity as Secretary of the Air Force; and the UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, Defendants. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Plaintiffs Richard Roe, Victor Voe, and OutServe-SLDN, Inc. (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), by and through their attorneys, bring this action for declaratory and injunctive relief stemming from Roe’s and Voe’s unconstitutional and improper impending discharges from the United States Air Force. Roe and Voe are being discharged despite the contrary recommendations of their commanding officers and physicians solely because they have tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”)—even though they are asymptomatic, they adhere to a treatment regimen that has been scientifically established to halt the progression of HIV, and their viral loads are undetectable. As such, their discharges violate the U.S. Constitution and federal statutes and regulations. (In order to protect their medical privacy and to reduce further stigma and discrimination if their HIV diagnoses were made public, Plaintiffs Roe and Voe have sought leave to proceed under pseudonyms simultaneously with this complaint.) STATEMENT OF THE CASE 1. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces embody the best of the American spirit. They serve and defend us for love of country and community. Our military treats Service members’ wounds and illnesses, and, when able, they continue to serve. When military physicians determine that Service members are unable to continue serving, they are afforded a process to be medically separated or to retire. 2. Service members with HIV, however, do not enjoy the same treatment. Asymptomatic HIV has been diagnosed in a significant number of active-duty Service members. Contrary to widespread misunderstandings about HIV, a new diagnosis does not have the same ramifications it did when HIV first entered the public consciousness decades ago. For most people living with HIV, medication renders their HIV inconsequential to their daily lives. Those who adhere to these medication regimens have no symptoms or significant effects on their immune systems. The number of copies of the virus in their blood is suppressed to a level so low that they can no longer transmit it to others. Service members with HIV continue to contribute meaningfully to the military and to their country, just as any other Service member would. 3. Dating back to 1988—at the height of the AIDS crisis—and continuing today, the Department of Defense (“DoD”) has had clear policies and regulations favoring the retention of Service members who are diagnosed with HIV while on active duty. While these policies unduly (and unnecessarily) restrict the ability of Service members living with HIV to deploy and change duty stations or assignments, even as of late 2017, the Air Force allowed at least 13 Airmen living with HIV to serve overseas and support vital missions. According to DoD publications, from 2011 to 2016, the Air Force diagnosed 181 Airmen and the Navy diagnosed 388 sailors with HIV. In 2016, 119 of those Airmen—more than 65 percent—and 266 of those sailors—more than 68 percent—were still serving. In 2011, the U.S. Army counted 480 soldiers with HIV serving on active duty, with some serving for more than 20 years after they were diagnosed. Indisputably, these Service members are fit for duty, have the skills they need to contribute, and are able to manage their HIV without it affecting their ability to perform their duties. 4. Unfortunately, current military policies make Service members with HIV who are allowed to deploy the exception rather than the rule, even though one’s HIV status has no effect on deployability for the vast majority of Service members with HIV. Requiring Service members to secure a waiver or exception to policy from those who lack both medical training and a complete understanding of HIV in 2018 often invites or facilitates discrimination. This case highlights two such examples: Air Force personnel ignored the recommendations of their own medical officers and operational commanders and instead arbitrarily and wrongly decided to separate Airmen based solely on their HIV status. 5. Plaintiff Roe fulfilled a childhood dream—and a family legacy—by enlisting in the Air Force in 2012. He has been stationed in two foreign countries. The Air Force recognized Roe’s leadership skills and outstanding job performance by promoting him to a non-commissioned officer position earlier than anticipated. He aspires to one day commission as an officer. But his dream was placed in peril when he was diagnosed with HIV in October 2017. 6. Roe began treatment immediately and his viral load was soon undetectable. Yet under current regulations he is restricted from deploying outside the continental United States solely because of his HIV status. 7. Because of his HIV status, Roe underwent a standard medical evaluation process to determine whether he should be retained or separated from the Air Force. Despite the recommendations of Roe’s doctor and commanding officer that he be returned to duty, the Secretary","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] October 2018 | Alexandria Division | U.S. District Court | Eastern District of Virginia | United States Department of Defense ||| HIV-infected service members filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Alexandria Division on October 10, 2018.

LEW, in his official capacity as the Secretary of the United States Department of the Treasury, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, and SETH D. HARRIS, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of the United States Department of Labor, Defendants. Case No. COMPLAINT Plaintiffs Paul Joseph Wieland and Teresa Jane Wieland, for their Complaint, state: NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. This case challenges regulations issued under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“Act”) that force the Plaintiffs to either (a) violate their sincerelyheld religious opposition to contraceptives, sterilization and abortifacients by paying to make such services available to their three daughters, (b) forfeit the valuable benefit of employersponsored health insurance for themselves and their daughters and purchase more expensive satisfactory coverage on the open market, if such coverage even exists, or (c) forgo health insurance for their daughters altogether. The Act also unconstitutionally interferes with the Plaintiffs’ parental rights and fundamental right to family integrity. 2. Plaintiff Paul Joseph Wieland is a resident of Jefferson County, Missouri and member of the Missouri House of Representatives. 3. Plaintiff Teresa Jane Wieland is a resident of Jefferson County, Missouri and is married to Paul Joseph Wieland. 4. The Plaintiffs have three daughters, ages 12, 18 and 19. 5. The Plaintiffs strive to raise their daughters according to Christian principles and corresponding sincerely held religious beliefs. As part of these beliefs, the Plaintiffs oppose the use, funding, provision or support of contraceptives, sterilization and abortifacients. 6. Health insurance coverage is a benefit of Mr. Wieland’s employment with the State of Missouri and is provided through the Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan (“MCHCP”), a corporate entity of the State of Missouri that was created by Missouri statute. 7 Mr. and Mrs. Wieland pay a portion of their health care plan premiums in order to maintain coverage for themselves and their daughters. Said premiums also partially fund medical services provided to other employees covered under the same plan. The State of Missouri contributes the remaining portion of the health care insurance premiums as a benefit of Mr. Wieland’s employment. 8. Between January 2011, when the Wielands’ coverage under the plan began, and August 1, 2013, the plan did not include coverage for contraceptives, sterilization or abortifacients, because the Wielands had opted out of such coverage. On July 18, 2013, MCHCP sent the Wielands a letter stating that because of federal law MCHCP must provide contraception and sterilization coverage in all medical plans it offers. MCHCP stated that “[e]ffective August 1, 2013, you will be placed in the corresponding medical plan that includes contraception and sterilization coverage in accordance with federal law.” 9. Plaintiffs’ premiums increased in conjunction with and because of the addition of contraception and sterilization coverage. 10. The Plaintiffs do not believe that contraceptives, sterilization, or abortifacients constitute medicine, health care, or a means of providing for the well being of persons. Rather, Plaintiffs believe contraceptives, sterilization, and abortifacients involve gravely immoral practices and that abortion in particular involves the intentional destruction of innocent human life. 11. The Defendants have issued an administrative rule (“Mandate” or “Final Rule”) pursuant to authority created by the Act requiring that group health plans cover, without cost sharing, “all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.” Such contraceptive methods include certain drugs and devices such as the “Plan B” and “ella” pills and copper IUDs, all of which are widely known as abortifacients in that they frequently function to destroy fertilized eggs, which Plaintiffs consider to be abortion. This not only forces the Plaintiffs to treat contraceptives, sterilization, abortifacients and related education and counseling as health care, but also subverts the expression of the Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs by forcing them to fund, promote, and assist and participate in the provision of the acquisition of drugs and services which they believe involve gravely immoral practices, including the intentional destruction of innocent human life. 12. The Mandate unconstitutionally forces the Plaintiffs to violate their sincerely-held religious beliefs under threat of having to forfeit the valuable job benefit of employer-sponsored insurance coverage or health coverage for themselves and their daughters. The Mandate also forces the Plaintiffs to fund government-dictated speech that is directly at odds with their own speech and religious beliefs and practices. The government forcing the Plaintiffs to pay money for the privilege of practicing their religion or controlling their own speech is un-American, unprecedented, and flagrantly unconstitutional.

CITY OF MCCRORY and PAUL HATCH in his Official Capacity as the Police Chief of McCrory, Arkansas, Defendants. Case No. 2: f 7-c.v- 2 f)f;t1 CLASS ACTION Afarslv;.ll This case assigned to District Judge and to Magistrate Judge Kearn<unk>CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Introduction 1. This case is about the City of McCrory banishing some of its poorest residents simply because they are poor. In September 2016, the McCrory City Council passed a TrailerBanishment Ordinance forbidding any mobile home worth less than $7,500 to remain within the city limits, levying fines of up to $500 per day. Plaintiffs David Watlington and Lindsey Hollaway are an engaged couple living in McCrory below the federal poverty line in a trailer worth approximately $1,500. They cannot afford a more expensive home, and although they would like to begin their married life in McCrory close to family and employment, the McCrory Police Chief has ordered them to leave the county, banishing them because their mobile home is valued at less than $7,500. 2. The City of McCrory bans trailers and mobile homes within the City unless the resident can establish by a certified appraiser or a bill of sale a value of $7,500 or more. If Mr. Watlington and Ms. Hollaway could afford to live in a mobile home valued at $7,500 or more, they would be permitted to remain in McCrory. Because the only criterion preventing Plaintiffs from living in the City of McCrory is the value of their home, McCrory is operating a wealthbased banishment scheme. 3 Mr. Watlington is currently unemployed. He cannot seek work because the local police records incorrectly show him as having a suspended license. He has been stopped on numerous occasions and has stopped driving because he cannot afford to pay the tickets and resulting court costs Ms. Hollaway does shift work at the Worldwide Label facility in McCrory. In spite of their poverty, their home meets all reasonable health standards and complies with all other regulations. Plaintiffs have been ordered to leave McCrory only because they cannot afford a more expensive home. McCrory's ordinance is, therefore, a wealth-based banishment scheme, imposing a ""fate universally decried by civilized people."" Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 102 (1958). Banishment is a drastic punishment so much so that the Arkansas State Constitution forbids it at the state level Art. I, <unk>21. 4. Plaintiffs challenge McCrory's Trailer-Banishment Ordinance because it is unconstitutional. Defendants' wealth-based banishment ordinance (1) violates substantive due process by infringing on Plaintiffs' fundamental right not to be forcibly expelled from their place of residence; (2) discriminates on the basis of wealth status without any rational connection to a legitimate government interest in violation of the Equal Protection Clause; (3) criminalizes poverty and thus violates the Constitution's proscription against criminalization of status; (4) imposes excessive fines in violation of the Eighth Amendment for violators of the ordinance whose only offense is being poor; and (5) violates procedural due process by imposing punishment without any process whatsoever. 5. By and through their attorneys, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, Plaintiffs seek the vindication of their rights, injunctive relief preventing future enforcement of the Trailer-Banishment Ordinance to allow them quiet enjoyment of their property, and a declaration that the Trailer-Banishment Ordinance is unconstitutional. Defendants cannot banish residents from the City simply because they are poor. Nature of the Action 6. The City of McCrory has enacted an ordinance prohibiting the placement of mobile homes within the City unless the owners show at their own cost that the trailers have a value of at least $7,500. See Exhibit 1, Trailer-Banishment Ordinance, Section 2.C.6. Owners can be fined between $50 and $500 per day for violation of the ban, and the Police Chief, Defendant Paul Hatch, has ordered Plaintiffs to leave the City, effectively banishing them from the place they call home. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants' wealth-based banishment scheme. Jurisdiction and Venue 7. This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 and 28 U.S.C. <unk>2201, et seq., the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Action No. COMPLAINT Tiara Moore, 5841 W. Ohio Street, Chicago, IL 60644, Plaintiffs, v. Ben Carson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in his official capacity, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Defendants. INTRODUCTION 1. This suit challenges the decision of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to abruptly and unlawfully suspend implementation of its own promulgated rule, the Small Area Fair Market Rent Rule (Small Area FMR Rule). The rule provides that, as of January 1, 2018, tens of thousands of low-income families who participate in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program—families who disproportionally are African-American, Latino, and other racial minorities—can use their housing vouchers to move from poor and racially segregated communities to areas that provide greater opportunity in education, jobs, and more. In doing so, the Small Area FMR Rule aligns the federal government’s primary rent subsidy program with HUD’s statutory mandates to ensure fair housing and avoid contributing to concentrated poverty. 2. HUD has announced that it is suspending this important rule, depriving thousands of families of housing choices, without following notice-and-comment requirements or providing adequate reasons. Plaintiffs—two HCV voucher holders who want to move to areas of greater opportunity but are being blocked by HUD’s action from doing so, along with an organization whose mission to foster such mobility is being frustrated—bring this action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to require HUD to implement the Small Area FMR Rule on schedule. 3. The HCV program—formerly known as the Section 8 voucher program— provides a housing subsidy to more than two million households nationwide, enabling them to secure affordable, decent-quality housing in the private market. A participating household generally pays 30 percent of its monthly income towards rent. An HCV voucher covers the remainder of the total rent amount (including utilities), so long as the rent does not exceed an amount based primarily on what HUD determines is the “fair market rent,” or FMR, for a comparable dwelling in the area. By subsidizing housing through these vouchers, rather than through public housing projects, the HCV program aims to provide low-income families greater geographic choice in housing. A primary objective of the HCV program is to permit low-income families to settle throughout metropolitan areas, thereby avoiding the high concentrations of poverty and racial segregation that have been linked to significant adverse health, educational, and economic outcomes for children and adults. 4. In operation, however, the HCV program has not provided this meaningful choice to participating families, in large part because of how HUD calculates a voucher’s worth. HUD historically has calculated FMRs based on the average rent for entire metropolitan regions, without regard for the stark differences in housing costs from neighborhood to neighborhood within such regions. In low-rent (and low-opportunity) neighborhoods, these crudely calculated FMRs exceed what the market would bear, providing some landlords with a substantial windfall at taxpayer expense. Conversely, those same FMRs are too low for HCV households to use their vouchers in higher-rent neighborhoods with better schools, employment options, transportation, and other opportunities. 5. The Small Area FMR Rule, which HUD adopted in 2016 after years of community input and careful study and analysis, is a major step toward correcting this problem. The rule requires the public housing agencies (PHAs) that administer the HCV program locally to set voucher values in 24 metropolitan areas based on the prevailing private market rents for each distinct zip code within those regions. This revised methodology recognizes the existence of very different local rental markets within each metropolitan area and calibrates vouchers more finely to the amount needed to live in various neighborhoods. It thus enables voucher holders to access a wider range of housing, outside of voucher-concentrated, racially-segregated areas. 6. The experiences of Plaintiffs Crystal Carter and Tiara Moore illustrate how the Small Area FMR Rule transforms the FMR methodology from one that contributes to racial segregation and concentrated poverty to one that helps combat it Ms. Carter and Ms. Moore are African-American women who want to use their HCV vouchers to move their families from poor areas of Hartford and Chicago, respectively, to the higher-rent (and predominantly white) suburbs outside those cities. They have been stymied from doing so by voucher rates too low to secure housing where they want to live. That situation is due to change on January 1, 2018, pursuant to the Small Area FMR Rule. 7. For example, Ms. Moore’s voucher currently allows her to rent a two-bedroom apartment for about $1,200 per month anywhere in the greater Chicago area. That amount proved inadequate when she searched for such an apartment in DuPage County, just outside the City of Chicago. Under the Small Area FMR Rule, her voucher would be worth as much as $1,770 per","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2018 | U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ||| Small Area Fair Market Rent Rule (Small Area FMR Rule) | Open Communities Alliance (OCA) ||| February 2019 ||| March 2019 .<n>On January 1, 2018, the OCA filed this suit in the U.N.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT and BEN CARSON, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Defendants. Civil Action No. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs Massachusetts Fair Housing Center (“MFHC”) and Housing Works, Inc. (“Housing Works”) seek a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief vacating a new rule promulgated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), Implementation of the Fair Housing Act’s Disparate Impact Standard, 85 Fed Reg. 60288 (September 24, 2020) (the “2020 Rule”). The 2020 Rule, as it would be codified in 24 C.F.R. <unk>100.5 and 100.500 on October 26, 2020 (when the 2020 Rule is set to take effect), is attached as Exhibit A. 2. The 2020 Rule undermines the ability of victims of housing and mortgage lending discrimination to pursue disparate impact claims under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>3601 et seq. (the “FHA”), by introducing novel pleading and proof requirements that will be virtually impossible to meet, and creating broad new defenses to liability, contrary to the language and intent of the FHA and decades of practice, both at HUD and in the courts. 3. The ability to bring disparate impact claims to root out and eliminate subtle, disguised or ignorant discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status or national origin is central to the FHA’s structure and purpose to eradicate systemic housing discrimination and create inclusive communities. 4. If the 2020 Rule is allowed to take effect, the vitally important remedial purposes of the FHA will be seriously undermined. Victims of housing and lending discrimination will face unreasonably high barriers, erected by HUD to deter the pursuit of valid disparate housing claims, and fair housing advocates such as the Plaintiffs will be stripped of an essential tool they have relied on for decades in the continuing fight against segregated housing. 5. By making it nearly impossible for a victim of housing or lending discrimination to plead and prove their case, the 2020 Rule will allow perpetrators of housing and lending discrimination to act with impunity, defeating the central goal of the FHA. 6. The Court should issue a preliminary injunction, extending the effective date of the 2020 Rule during the pendency of this review proceeding, and then declare the 2020 Rule to be unlawful, and set it aside under the Administrative Procedure Act (the “APA”), to prevent irreparable harm and provide complete, uniform and fair protection to the Plaintiffs and similar organizations, and the victims of housing and lending discrimination they represent. PARTIES Plaintiffs Massachusetts Fair Housing Center 7. Massachusetts Fair Housing Center is a non-profit, charitable corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with a principal place of business at 57 Suffolk Street, Fourth Floor, Holyoke, Massachusetts. 8. MFHC is a full-service fair housing organization dedicated to eliminating systemic housing discrimination and creating inclusive communities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Founded in 1989, MFHC has been continuously operating for over thirty years, with a service area that includes Worcester, Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden and Berkshire Counties. 9. MFHC provides free legal services, conducts housing discrimination testing, and accepts housing discrimination complaints based on race, national origin, color, ancestry, religion, sex, disability, presence of minor children, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, marital status, military or veteran status, receipt of public assistance, including Section 8 housing assistance, receipt of housing subsidies, or rental assistance, and genetic information. 10. MFHC accepts over 300 housing discrimination complaints per year, and has recovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and extensive injunctive relief for victims of housing discrimination. 11. In addition to its legal work, MFHC provides extensive education and outreach services on issues of fair housing and fair lending. 12. MFHC provides training in fair housing to community groups, healthcare providers, tenants, landlords, property managers, realtors, first-time home buyers, and others. MFHC’s trainings focus largely on educating the public about their rights under the FHA and state anti-discrimination law and educating housing professionals about their obligations under these laws. MFHC has expended resources in preparing training materials and training its own staff in the legal standards applicable to FHA cases in order to provide this education. 13. MFHC also advocates for local, state and federal policy changes to end systemic discrimination and promote housing choice. 14. MFHC’s legal, education, and advocacy efforts have resulted in changes in behavior in the landlord and realtor communities in Massachusetts. 15. HUD has for many years recognized that as an organization with experience providing quality fair housing enforcement activities, MFHC is eligible under HUD’s Fair Housing Initiatives Program (“FHIP”) for grants to carry out testing and enforcement activities to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices. 16.

The court monitored implementation of the agreement until 2011, when the case was closed.  ","U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Special Litigation Section PHB 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20530 The Honorable Paul E. Patton Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky Office of the Governor 700 Capitol Avenue Suite 100 Frankfort, KY 40601 Re: Investigation of the Oakwood Developmental Center Dear Governor Patton: On June 22, 2001, we notified you, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>1997, that we were investigating conditions of confinement at the Oakwood Developmental Center (“Oakwood”), a facility for individuals with developmental disabilities located in Somerset, Kentucky. On November 5-9, 2001, we conducted an on-site review of the care and treatment of individuals at Oakwood with experts in behavior management, and medical and nursing care. We reviewed numerous records and interviewed administrators, staff and residents. At an exit interview conducted on the last day of the tour, we verbally conveyed our preliminary findings to selected facility staff, counsel, and senior officials of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health Services. Consistent with the requirements of CRIPA, we are now writing to inform you of our findings. At the outset, we wish to acknowledge and express our appreciation to the hardworking and committed staff of Oakwood and the Cabinet for Health Services officials for their assistance during our tour. At all times, Oakwood staff, Cabinet officials, and counsel were very cooperative and professional. We particularly recognize the commitment demonstrated by the Secretary of the Cabinet for Health Services, Marcia R. Morgan, who attended our exit conference, and the Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services, Margaret Pennington, who was present throughout our on-site review. Oakwood opened in 1972 as a residential facility for persons with developmental disabilities. It consists of 27 buildings on 200 acres. The facility is licensed to serve 420 individuals and has an average daily census of 394. Oakwood consists of 18 separate residential buildings, therapeutic and habilitative service areas, a medical services building that includes an infirmary, and administrative and support buildings. Each of the 18 residential buildings consists of two wings with approximately 12 beds each that are separated by a shared kitchen and laundry area. As of the time of our visit, the population of Oakwood consisted of approximately 249 men and 143 women ranging in ages from 19 to 67 years with the majority of residents between the ages of 22 and 46. The majority of residents (332) are persons with severe or profound mental retardation; approximately 52 residents use a wheelchair for mobility, seating, and/or positioning; approximately 190 of the residents receive antiepileptic medications; and 154 residents receive psychotropic medications. Recently, Oakwood has initiated a plan to divide the institution into four separate facilities called communities. As this process was still being implemented during our tour, our letter evaluates Oakwood as a single facility. Our findings, the facts supporting them, and the minimum remedial steps that we believe are necessary to correct constitutional deficiencies are set forth below. Residents of state-operated facilities have a right to live in reasonable safety and to receive adequate health care, along with habilitation, to ensure their safety and freedom from unreasonable restraint, prevent regression and facilitate their ability to exercise their liberty interests. See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982). Similar protections are accorded by federal statute. See, e.g., Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396; 42 C.F.R. Part 483 (Medicaid Program Provisions). The State also is obliged to provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate to individual residents’ needs. Title II of the American with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. <unk>35.130 (d); see Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (1999). As a brief summary, we find that Oakwood fails to provide adequate: (1) protection of its residents from harm due to abuse, mistreatment, neglect, improper use of restraints, pica behavior, and an overall lack of environmental safety; (2) behavioral and psychology services, including adequate treatment team meetings, individual and behavioral support plans, and training programs; (3) psychiatric services; (4) medical care, including neurological care; (5) nursing care; (6) staffing and staff training; (7) nutritional management; (8) physical therapy, and (9) quality assurance mechanisms designed to self-correct institutional problems. I. PROTECTION FROM HARM A. Abuse and Mistreatment Oakwood fails to protect its residents from harm. There have been numerous and recurring incidents of abuse and mistreatment by staff members over the past several years. A serious example of abuse occurred on August 22, 2000, when an Oakwood staff member stomped on a resident’s head and rendered the resident unconscious.

Acting through their agents, Defendants recruited Plaintiffs to work on their Arkansas farms. Defendants, through their hiring agents, made binding promises regarding wages, hours and working conditions. In reliance upon and in consideration of these binding promises, Plaintiffs left their homes and spent a considerable money and effort to travel to Arkansas to work for the Defendants. Despite making such binding promises, Defendants consistently failed Pis.

Defendants failed to pay Plaintiffs the hourly wages and overtime required by federal law throughout Plaintiffs' employment with Defendants. 4. In order to obtain these temporary positions with Defendants, all of the workers had to pay travel, visa, and hiring fees, some as much as $3,500.

The Defendants took full advantage of Plaintiffs' and other class members' indigence, inability to speak or understand English, isolation, and lack of understanding of the laws of the United States regarding payment of wages, to grossly underpay Plaintiffs and other class members. Plaintiffs file this action to secure and vindicate their rights under the FLSA and state and federal contract law. 6. On behalf of themselves and other similarly situated farm workers, Plaintiffs seek restitution of unpaid wages, an award of money damages, and declaratory relief both to make themselves whole for damages they suffered due to Defendants' violations oflaw and to ensure that Defendants will not subject them and other H-2A workers to such illegal conduct in the future.

This class action is brought by Plaintiffs Andres Morales, Juan 5 Miguel Real, Hugo Alcantar Fernandez, and Osfel Andrade (collectively 6 “Plaintiffs”) on behalf of themselves and a class of all former and current hourly employees of Defendant Terra Universal, Inc. (“Terra”), and its owner and 9 operator, Defendant George Sadaghiani (“Sadaghiani”) (collectively “Defendants”). 2. Terra, which produces highly-specialized cleanroom and laboratory equipment, has earned annual sales in the range of $50 to $100 million per year and 13 contracts with numerous federal government agencies, including the Army, the 14 Navy and NASA. Yet Terra’s success has been unlawfully built off the backs of an 16 immigrant workforce, whose vulnerabilities Defendants exploited to swindle them 17 out of their earned wages. 3. Defendants exploited their immigrant workforce by preying on their 20 unfamiliarity with U.S. labor law and their desperate need for work. Through 21 fraudulent compensation schemes, Defendants required their Latino and immigrant 22 workforce to toil long hours without overtime pay: for instance, requiring workers 24 to clock out at the completion of eight-hour shifts and clock back in, under a 25 “second job,” for additional hours, so as to avoid paying overtime wages and escape detection by the government. And by creating a two-tiered system of rights, one for 28 those it perceived to be documented and another for those it perceived to be CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES 1 undocumented, Defendants created an underclass of exploitable workers. Branding employees believed to be undocumented with red stickers on their personnel files, 4 Defendants discriminated against those workers by paying them far less than lawful 5 permanent residents or citizen employees and refusing them the holidays, sick days and vacation days that these employees received. All the while, Defendant 8 Sadaghiani subjected the immigrant workforce to such hostile treatment that 9 employees feared demanding lawful compensation and, even, reporting serious workplace injuries for fear of reprisals. 4. Accordingly, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others similarly 13 situated, and the general public, hereby complain of violations of numerous federal and state employment laws for failure to pay mandated minimum and overtime 16 wages, to pay wages, to pay wages in a timely manner, and to keep and furnish 17 accurate wage statements. Plaintiffs also complain of violations of federal civil rights statutes for discrimination and disparate treatment on account of their race 20 and/or alienage in depriving Plaintiffs and other class members of equal pay, 21 lawfully compensated overtime wages, benefits and raises, and subjecting them to hostile treatment. They also charge Defendants with fraud and misrepresentation in 24 inducing Plaintiffs to accept unfavorable conditions of work in reliance on promises 25 and representations made by Defendants, which Defendants knew or should have known were false. Finally, Plaintiffs bring claims for unfair business practices for 28 unlawful, unfair and fraudulent business practices that run counter to the public’s 1 interest in ensuring compliance with minimum labor standards for all workers. JURISDICTION 5. The Court has original subject matter jurisdiction over this action 5 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1337 and Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), 29 U.S.C. <unk>216(b). The Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law 8 claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1367(a). VENUE 6. Venue is proper in the Central District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(b) because the acts, events and omissions giving rise to the action 13 occurred in this District.

He is sixty-two years old Mr. Morales has worked for 19 Defendants from approximately August 1998 until the present day. He works as an electronic technician on the factory floor. 8. Plaintiff Juan Miguel Real is a Latino and noncitizen who resides in 23 Garden Grove, California. He is thirty-five years old Mr. Real worked for Defendants from approximately December 1999 until July 2010. For the last four 26 years of his employment, Mr. Real worked as the manager of the sheet metal shop 27 on the factory floor. 9. Plaintiff Hugo Alcantar Fernandez is a Latino and noncitizen who 1 resides in Fullerton, California. He is twenty-eight years old Mr. Fernandez worked for Defendants from approximately June 2004 until February 2007 and 4 from approximately September 2007 until July 2010 Mr. Fernandez worked as a 5 polypropylene welder in the plastics shop on the factory floor. 10. Plaintiff Osfel Andrade is a Latino and noncitizen who resides in 8 Anaheim, California. He is forty-three years old Mr. Andrade worked for 9 Defendants from December 2000 until July 2010.

This is a class action for injunctive and declaratory relief necessary to remedy 3 ongoing violations of the constitutional and statutory rights of immigrants held in government 4 custody pending deportation proceedings. Because such proceedings seek to deprive immigrants 5 of the opportunity to live and work in the United States, the United States Constitution and 6 federal statutes afford them substantive and procedural rights, including the right to be 7 represented by counsel, the right to gather and present evidence, and the right to a fair hearing. 8 Those rights (and others) are systematically denied by Defendants. 9 2. Plaintiffs Audley Barrington Lyon, Jr., Edgar Cornelio, José Elizandro Astorga- 10 Cervantes, and Lourdes Hernandez-Trujillo (“Individual Plaintiffs”) bring this class action 11 lawsuit to challenge policies and practices that deny and severely restrict their ability to make 12 telephone calls necessary to consult with or obtain counsel, to gather information and evidence 13 necessary for their cases, and to obtain a fair hearing while in government custody. 14 3. Individual Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) 15 are held in detention facilities under the custody of Defendant Immigration and Customs 16 Enforcement (“ICE”) pending resolution of ICE’s charges that they should be deported or 17 “removed” from the United States. Respondents in immigration proceedings are not entitled to 18 appointed counsel and most in northern California are held in remote locations that render in- 19 person visits impractical at best. Telephone access is therefore critical to Plaintiffs’ ability to 20 locate, retain and seek advice from legal counsel. For those who cannot afford an attorney and 21 are not able to retain pro bono counsel, telephone contact with the outside world is essential to 22 gather the evidence and government documents essential to defending removal charges, locate 23 witnesses, and do other things necessary to represent themselves in complex legal proceedings. 24 It is also necessary to enable Plaintiffs to exercise their First Amendment rights to petition 25 government agencies to obtain immigration benefits and related documents that may provide 26 relief from removal. 1 4. However, ICE, and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security 2 (“DHS”), have engaged in a common course of conduct that severely restricts Plaintiffs’ 3 telephone access in violation of their rights under the United States Constitution and the 4 Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”). 5 5. Defendants’ policies, practices, and omissions in denying and restricting 6 telephone access have a dramatic impact on the outcomes of removal proceedings. As a result of 7 Defendants’ conduct, many Plaintiffs who would be eligible to remain in the United States are 8 deported. 9 6. Many Plaintiffs are also unnecessarily detained for months. Such prolonged 10 incarceration is a direct result of Defendants’ violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory 11 rights not as punishment for conviction of a crime. Plaintiffs are forced to seek continuances 12 while they struggle to locate, retain and communicate with counsel, to gather evidence to be 13 presented in the removal proceedings, and to obtain documents and immigration benefits that can 14 provide relief from removal.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of immigrants held in ICE custody pending deportation proceedings. The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief to remedy violations of their constitutional and statutory rights under the United States Constitution and ICE's policies, practices, and omissions in denying and restricting telephone access in violation of their rights. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and the district court entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.</s>"

(3) VIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION (PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS) (4) VIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION (SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS) INTRODUCTION 1. The immigration enforcement agencies operating in Southern 20 California regularly pressure, deceive, and threaten Mexican nationals who are 21 eligible to reside in the United States lawfully—and have built lives in the United 22 States over decades—into signing their own expulsion orders through misuse of a 23 process known as “voluntary departure.” These abusive and illegal practices rob 24 victims of their right to seek relief from removal. As administered and practiced in 25 Southern California, the “voluntary departure” program has become a regime of 26 unlawful coerced expulsion—one which tears numerous families apart every year. 2. Several courts have noted that voluntary departure is the immigration 28 equivalent of a criminal plea bargain. An individual who consents to voluntary FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT 1 departure avoids removal proceedings and possible detention, and in return accepts 2 expulsion from the United States. The criminal plea process, however, includes 3 rigorous procedural protections. In contrast, as administered in Southern 4 California, the “voluntary departure” program is unconstitutional and violates the 5 immigration enforcement agencies’ own statutes and regulations. 3. Voluntary departure must be accepted knowingly and voluntarily. Yet 7 in Southern California, immigration officials’ misstatements, omissions, pressure, 8 and/or threats prevent this from happening. For instance, immigration officers 9 regularly tell individuals that: (1) if they do not agree to “voluntary departure” they 10 will be incarcerated for months; and (2) if they take “voluntary departure” they can 11 quickly and easily “fix” their papers in Mexico so that they can thereafter reside 12 legally in the United States. Such statements are patently false and fail to convey 13 the consequences of taking voluntary departure. Immigrants who elect not to 14 pursue voluntary departure are not automatically or necessarily detained pending a 15 hearing before an immigration judge. Moreover, obtaining a visa to return to the 16 United States from Mexico after a voluntary departure can be slow and difficult, if 17 not entirely impossible. Persons who would be eligible to remain in the United 18 States legally if they appeared before an immigration judge instead of taking 19 voluntary departure lose the ability to pursue many paths to legal status. 20 Additionally, after leaving the United States, many individuals are precluded from 21 obtaining a visa to return to the United States for up to ten years—even though they 22 could have obtained legal status if they had not been misinformed or coerced into 23 accepting voluntary departure. 4. Immigration officers’ misstatements and omissions are exacerbated by 25 the fact that they regularly pressure individuals to agree to voluntary departure 26 before they have had any opportunity to speak to an attorney. 5. Immigration enforcement agencies in Southern California expel 28 individuals who have taken voluntary departure as rapidly as logistically possible— FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT 1 in many instances, on the same day. This practice violates the agencies’ governing 2 regulations, which require that immigration officers exercise discretion to 3 determine whether to allow an individual who has taken voluntary departure a 4 period of up to 120 days to leave the United States. Thus, individuals who have 5 been in the United States for decades are unlawfully ripped from their families and 6 established lives for up to ten years without having time to consider their other 7 legal options, put their affairs in order, or even say goodbye to family members. 6. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to correct immigration 9 enforcement officers’ unlawful voluntary departure practices in Southern 10 California.

Case No. 3:18-cv-04105 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 et seq. FOIA COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 3 et seq., to obtain information about the treatment of immigration detainees by the U.S. Department 4 of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). 2. ICE’s activities, particularly with respect to its treatment of immigrant detainees, is 6 of great public interest and concern. In California, ICE regularly subjects detained immigrants to 7 burdensome and lengthy voyages fully shackled, with limited access to food, water, and toilets. 8 Plaintiff is aware of several particularly egregious instances, including one in which detained 9 immigrant women were subjected to a 24-hour journey that included traveling in a dark, 10 windowless van in suffocating heat for several hours, causing some of them to vomit or faint. The 11 women’s cries for help went unanswered, and several women thought they would die. 3. In many regions throughout the country, ICE subcontracts with G4S Secure 13 Solutions, Inc. (“G4S”) for the transportation of immigration detainees. G4S is a highly- 14 controversial private contractor that has been criticized internationally for its treatment of 15 detainees in detention centers and during the provision of transportation services. G4S receives 16 hundreds of complaints annually from immigration detainees, including complaints alleging acts 17 of assault and racism by its employees.1 4. People have died or been seriously injured as a result of G4S’s careless treatment 19 during transport. For example, in Australia, a coroner deemed the death of a detained immigrant 20 that resulted from extreme temperatures in the back of a G4S van to be “wholly unnecessary and 21 avoidable.”2 In another instance in 2014, just days before a transportee was beaten to death by 1 See Stephen Matthews, Scandal-hit security firm G4S receives ‘unprecedented levels’ of complaints after taking over a private ambulance service, Daily Mail (Oct. 23, 2017, 12:13PM), http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5008247/Security-firm-G4S-unprecedented-levelscomplaints.html (noting that detention centers run by G4S received more than 700 complaints in 2010 and that nine staff members at an immigration detention center were suspended in 2017 after claims of abuse and assault); Lizzie Dearden, G4S Suspends Nine Staff for Alleged Abuse of Migrants at Brook House Immigration Removal Centre, The Independent (Sept. 1, 2017, 9:30AM), https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/g4s-migrants-absue-staff- 27 suspended-immigration-removal-centre-private-security-company-a7923731.html. 2 Melissa Fyfe, Uproar Over New Prison Contract, The Sydney Morning Herald (Oct.","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 2019 | Northern District of California | G4S Secure 13 Solutions, Inc. | U.S. Department of Homeland Security ||| October 2018 ||| March 2019 ||| May 2020 ||| June 2020 | ||| July 2020 | August 2020 | May 2021 | July 2021 | August 2021 | September 2020 | October 2020 | June 2021 | December 2020 | March 2020 | January 2021 | March 2021 | April 2020 | July 2021, May 2021, May 2020, June 2021, July 2021, August 2020, March 2020, May 2021, June 2020, July 2021, July 2020, August 2021, March 2020, April 2020, May 2021.<n>On January 2019, the ACLU of Northern California filed this Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) complaint in the Northern District Court of California.

The state of California filed this suit against ICE and DHS on July 9, arguing that the directive was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in two ways. First, the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to take into account students' and universities' reliance interests and the defendants gave no reasoned basis for the new order. Second, the defendants were in violation of procedural elements of the APA, because they failed to use proper notice-and-comment rule-making when issuing the new order.

On July 15, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance and as a result, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. California continued to monitor the alterations ICE made to its website between July and September and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on October 19, 2020.

Plaintiff, COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 17 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY; U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT; CHAD F. WOLF, in his official capacity as Acting Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security; and MATTHEW ALBENCE, in his official capacity as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Defendants. Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief 1. The State of California (the State or Plaintiff) brings this lawsuit to stop 2 Defendants from proceeding with their callous plan, issued in the midst of an escalating health 3 crisis, to force either: (a) up to 32,000 international students, who are attending public higher 4 education institutions in California, to depart the United States; or (b) the State’s higher 5 educational institutions to increase the risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) 6 through expanded in-person instruction contrary to the advice of public health experts. In 7 addition to being cruel, Defendants’ attempt at a policy change to force in-person learning in the 8 middle of a pandemic is absurd and the essence of arbitrary and capricious conduct in violation of 9 the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). If that were not enough, Defendants have failed to 10 follow the procedures for notice and comment rulemaking required by the APA prior to enforcing 11 and implementing this policy. 2. As the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has emphasized 13 throughout the pandemic, social distancing is one of the core tools to stop the spread of the highly 14 contagious COVID-19. California has been vigilant in adopting social distancing guidelines. On 15 March 19, Governor Gavin Newsom issued the first statewide stay-at-home order in the United 16 States. Contemporaneous with the Governor’s stay-at-home order, the California State University 17 system and California Community College system (collectively, California higher education 18 institutions) switched to almost exclusively online learning for the spring 2020 semester. 3. The federal government, including Defendants, has recognized the unique threat 20 posed by the pandemic. On March 13, the President declared the crisis a national emergency, a 21 declaration that remains in effect to this day. At that same time, Defendant Immigration and 22 Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued guidance documents granting exemptions to F-1 and M-1 23 nonimmigrant students, who are international students attending school in the United States, from 24 federal regulatory requirements to take in-person classes in order to maintain their status. ICE 25 acknowledged that the exemptions were necessary “[g]iven the extraordinary nature of the 26 COVID-19 emergency,” and asserted that the policy would be “in effect for the duration of the 27 emergency.” 4. While other parts of the world have stabilized their COVID-19 numbers since Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief 1 March, the federal government has struggled to forge a national response to combat the virus. In 2 recent weeks, as certain businesses and public spaces have re-opened, confirmed COVID-19 3 cases have surged throughout the United States to the highest levels of the entire pandemic. 4 Despite its best efforts to curb the effect of the pandemic, California, like the rest of the country, 5 has experienced increases in recent weeks of new confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths 6 attributed to the disease. 5. Inexplicably, on July 6, the date that marked the highest number of new COVID- 8 19 cases in the United States since the start of the pandemic, ICE announced that it was 9 rescinding the exemptions on in-person learning for F-1 and M-1 students. Any such students 10 who cannot meet the in-person learning requirements of ICE’s must either leave the United States 11 or transfer to a school that meets those requirements. ICE justified the change in policy by 12 claiming that the prior exemptions were issued at the “height of the [COVID-19] pandemic.” 6. In changing its policy, ICE not only acted contrary to the clear record showing that 14 the COVID-19 emergency has escalated, not receded, but it also showed no consideration of the 15 significant harms presented by the pandemic. Because of the public health risks associated with 16 in-person education and in an effort to safeguard the health and safety of students, faculty","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] California | Immigration and Customs Enforcement | U.S. District Court | Northern District of California ||| March 2019 ||| April 2020 ||| May 2020 | ||| June 2020 | July 2020 | August 2020 | September 2020 | October 2020 | December 2020 | January 2021 | March 2021 | February 2021 | April 2021 | May 2021 | June 2021 | July 2021 | August 2020, September 2020, April 2020, March 2020 | April 2020, May 2020, March 2021, April 2020, June 2020, May 2021, June 2020, July 2020, August 2020, and September 2020, the State of California filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District Of California on March 19, 2019.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>701 et seq., seeking the release of withheld records concerning agency policies and procedures relating to nonimmigrant temporary workers and particularly the adjudication of petitions for their lawful employment in the United States. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (“AILA”) seeks declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief with respect to the unlawful withholding of these records by the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and its component the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) with oversight responsibility for immigration to the United States.

Venue lies in this district pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(e)(2) as both plaintiff and defendants are located in the District of Columbia and because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in the jurisdiction. The Parties 4. Plaintiff AILA is a national association of over 11,000 attorneys and law professors who practice and teach immigration law. Founded in 1946, AILA is a nonpartisan, not-for-profit organization that provides continuing legal education, information, professional services, and expertise through its 36 chapters and over 50 national committees. AILA member attorneys represent U.S. families seeking permanent residence for close family members, as well as U.S. businesses seeking talent from the global marketplace. AILA members also represent foreign students, entertainers, athletes, and asylum seekers, often on a pro bono basis. 5.

In order for a nonimmigrant to come to the United States to lawfully work, a prospective employer must file and have granted a nonimmigrant petition on the individual’s behalf. Congress has mandated certain restrictions on eligibility for admission to the United States through H-1B classification as well as set certain caps on the number of foreign workers who may annually seek status through this program. 9. At a “high level,” the process by which the government handles the receipt and review of H-1B petitions is generally known.

INTRODUCTION 1. This is an immigration case involving life and death stakes. 2. Plaintiffs are mothers and children from El Salvador and Honduras who, like many other Central Americans, have fled persecution in their countries of origin. 3. The United States government arrested Plaintiff mothers and children shortly after they crossed into the United States near the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, and brought them to a makeshift detention facility in Artesia, New Mexico. The detention facility is profoundly isolated, miles away from any major cities and lawyers. The closest major metropolitan area is El Paso, Texas, which is close to 200 miles away. 4. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) and its implementing regulations— as well as under the Due Process Clause—Plaintiffs have an indisputable right to seek asylum and related relief, and to a fair hearing to present their claims. But that process at Artesia has been anything but fair, and falls far short of the government’s obligations under existing law. Instead, the government has created what can only be described as a “deportation mill” that is sending mothers and children back to their home countries to face serious harm without ever having given them a meaningful opportunity to present their claims. 5. In its new policies reflecting this rush to judgment, the government has sacrificed the individualized consideration of asylum claims required by the statute, regulations, and Constitution, and imposed a more stringent—and unlawful—standard to deny meritorious claims presented by mothers and children detained at Artesia. 6. Further, the government has instituted various procedural changes to the process, which are designed to limit the number of successful claims. The government’s new policies make it much more difficult for detained women and children to present and substantiate their claims to asylum or other forms of immigration relief, and to seek the assistance of counsel in doing so. Under these new policies, families detained at Artesia are almost completely cut off from communications with the outside world, provided insufficient information and in some cases no information about their rights under the INA, affirmatively precluded from effectively contacting and receiving assistance from attorneys, and ultimately forced","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] September 2014 | U.S. District Court | District of Columbia ||| Artesia Family Residential Center ||| El Salvador and Honduras ||| Central American mothers and children detained at the detention facility in Artesia, New Mexico .<n>This is an immigration case involving life and death stakes.

This lawsuit challenges the federal government’s recent decision to indefinitely separate immigrant parents from their young children. The government’s separation policy is designed, intended, and administered as a means of deterring all immigration, even legal immigration by those with a right to seek asylum. This is punishment, it interferes with family integrity, and it interferes with access to courts, all of which our Constitution’s Fifth Amendment does not allow. Families naturally experience forced separation as torture and they urge this Court to stop it. PARTIES 2.

The complaint alleges that in preventing a Syrian national with a valid U.S. visa from returning to the U.S. pursuant to the EO, the defendants violated the First Amendment Establishment Clause, Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and international law. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. 

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and Bernard Harcourt of Columbia Law School, is a resident in the University of Illinois Chicago/Advocate Christ Hospital. He returned to the United Arab Emirates to get married on Jan. 23, and upon returning to the U.S. to continue his residency, he was detained at Abu Dhabi International Airport on Jan 29. Despite his valid visa, he was detained pursuant to the EO. If the plaintiff cannot return to the U.S., he faces the risk of being deported to Syria, where he is a citizen but has never been a resident. 

That same day, the plaintiff also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.

The case was assigned to Judge Elaine Bucklo.  At a status hearing on February 1, the parties told the judge they had reached a ""settlement in principle.""

On February 2, the plaintiff successfully entered the United States at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. On February 8, the plaintiff filed a motion for voluntary dismissal and leave to reinstate on or before August 1, 2017. Judge Bucklo granted this motion and terminated the case.

Trump’s ill-planned and discriminatory Executive Order entitled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.” Dr. Al Homssi is a resident in Internal Medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago/Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn, Illinois. On January 18, 2017, Dr. Al Homssi returned to the United Arab Emirates to get married, which he did on January 23, 2017. In order to return to his residency program timely, on January 29, 2017, he attempted to board his flight to Chicago O’Hare on Etihad Airways at the Abu Dhabi International Airport. At the U.S. PreClearance Security, a U.S. officer seized Dr. Al Homssi’s passport, form DS-2019, and boarding pass, and ordered him to secondary screening. At secondary screening, Dr. Al Homssi was asked a number of questions by U.S. Pre-Clearance Security Officers, and he voluntarily provided the U.S. officers his cellular telephones and other personal belongings for inspection. Included on one of his cell phones was a mobile prayer app entitled “Islamona,” a screenshot of which is attached as Exhibit A and made part hereof. At no time was Dr. Al Homssi asked any questions pertaining to terrorism, terrorism related activity, affiliation with any international terrorist organizations, or any other conceivable question related to his being someone who should be denied entry to the U.S. because he is suspected of being a terrorist. In fact, Dr. Al Homssi, age 24, has an impeccable background and no criminal record whatsoever. In the words of his supervisor, Dr. Armand Krikorian of the University of Illinois Advocate Christ Medical Center, Dr. Al Homssi “is in good standing in the program and his performance has been excellent at all levels.” Nevertheless, after being questioned and having his belongings searched, one of the U.S. Officers returned his documents, including his valid J-1 and B1/B2 Visas. Remarkably, the Visas had black marking pen drawn through them with the hand-written notation “Cancelled E.O. 59447v.8.” Copies of said Visas, marked Exhibits B, are also attached hereto and made part hereof. The U.S. Officers then informed Dr. Al Homssi that he could not board his flight because he was not able to return to the United States based upon President Trump’s Executive Order. The U.S. Officers also told Dr. Al Homssi that it might be 90 days or longer before he could ever expect to board a flight to the U.S Dr. Al Homssi now finds himself unable to return to his residency program at UIC, and if he cannot complete this program he faces the risk of being excluded from the UAE and forced to return to war-torn Syria—where he has not been since he was 17 years old on vacation, and where he has never lived. All of these dreadful consequences, the foregoing Complaint will show, are the result of his being a member of the Muslim faith that is now being treated differently in the United States in stark violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause. His treatment and the Executive Order also violate a number of other constitutional and statutory provisions discussed below. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. Under U.S Const Art.

(aka MEDTECH CONSULTANTS), Defendants. COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND I. This is a human trafficking case brought by workers from India who were trafficked into the State of Mississippi. Defendants collectively engaged in a scheme to defraud Plaintiffs out of tens of thousands of dollars and, in the wake ofa devastating hurricane in the Gulf Coast region, unlawfully turned them into an exploitable source of cheap labor. The Defendants worked together to defraud each of the Plaintiffs, falsely promised them that they would receive permanent residence in the United States, trafficked them into the United States, forced them to live in squalid and unsanitary conditions that damaged their health and psychological well-being, discriminated against them on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, and alienage, and threatened them with financial ruin and adverse immigration action if they balked or complained. 2.

Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC, Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., Kurella Rao, IndoAmerisoft LLC, Michael Pol, and Global Resources Inc. 3. Plaintiffs are skilled workers and Indian nationals who responded to advertisements in local newspapers in India and the United Arab Emirates promising employment and permanent residence in the United States. The advertisements invited welders, pipefitters, and other skilled workers to attend seminars run by Defendants Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants in late 2003 and early 2004 to learn about this seemingly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Hundreds of workers responded, including Plaintiffs. 4. At the seminars, Plaintiffs heard directly from Sachin Dewan, Kurella Rao, and Malvern Burnett that, for the price of between five and six lakh rupeesI (between $11,000 and $14,000 in 2004 U.S. dollars), they would be transported to the United States, given high-paying jobs in their fIeld, and permitted to live permanently in the United States with their families. All this would take only 18 months to accomplish. Although the cost was extraordinarily high for working-class Indians, Defendants promised them that they would quickly recoup these costs with steady, lucrative jobs in the United States. 5. Skilled workers such as Plaintiffs often struggled to find work in India. Many of them had traveled around the world-to Dubai, Qatar, South Africa, Nigeria, and other countries-for paying jobs, so they were accustomed to offers for work overseas. Defendants' offer, however, was too good to refuse because it included permanent residence in the United States. So each of the Plaintiffs signed an agreement written in English with Defendants, although Plaintiffs-mostly Malayalam speakers-generally could not read or understand the agreement. Plaintiffs then raised the money to pay for the opportunity by depleting their savings, selling any property they had, and borrowing money from family members, or even worse, from moneylenders (often referred to as ""bladesmen"" in India) at usurious rates. 6.

Enforcement of the consent decree is ongoing as of November 2018.","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK PATRICK TUYIZERE, SUK MAYA RAI, BBT by her parent and natural guardian BIRKHA BOLON, ALI JANAR, CHO CHO WIN, ADO LAR, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, v. UTICA CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION, UTICA CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT, BRUCE J. KARAM, Superintendent of Utica City School District, in his official capacity, Defendants. Index No. 15-cv-488 (TJM)(TWD) AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This action challenges the Defendants’ policy and practice of excluding limited English proficient (“LEP”) immigrants aged 17-20 from Thomas R. Proctor High School (“Proctor High School”) in Utica, N.Y. This action is brought on behalf of six refugees, Patrick Tuyizere, Suk Maya Rai, BBT by her parent and natural guardian Birkha Bolon, Ali JaNar, Cho Cho Win, and Ado Lar, and a class of similarly situated individuals. 2. Patrick Tuyizere, Suk Maya Rai, BBT by her parent and natural guardian Birkha Bolon, Ali JaNar, Cho Cho Win, and Ado Lar are refugees who fled violence and persecution in their home countries. Each came to the United States longing for freedom and opportunity, only now to be the subject of national origin discrimination. They want to go to high school, make American friends, and learn more than just English. But Defendants Utica City School District Board of Education, Utica City School District, and Superintendent Bruce J. Karam have excluded them from high school and diverted them instead to alternative programs that provide limited educational instruction. Their experience is typical among the 17-20 year old refugee population in Utica. 3. For the last 35 years, Utica has served as a safe haven for refugees fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries. The refugee population in Utica is large, comprising nearly 1 out of every 6 residents. Nicknamed “The Second Chance City,” in part for the second chance it offers refugees fleeing persecution, Utica has, in many respects, been welcoming of refugees. The exception: For the last 8 years, Defendants have been excluding LEP immigrants (primarily refugees) over 16 years of age from Proctor High School, the only high school in Utica, and diverting them to alternative education programs. 4. Under New York law, individuals have the right to attend high school until they turn 21 or earn a high school diploma. The last compulsory age of education, i.e., the age until which students are required by law to attend school full time, is 16 years old. While students over 16 may choose to enter into alternative education programs, it must be their choice. For the last eight years, however, the Defendants have been robbing immigrant students of that choice. By contrast, upon information and belief, Defendants allow non-immigrant students over 16 to enroll in Proctor High School. 5. From 2007 until November 2014, the Defendants diverted LEP immigrants aged 17-20 to the “Newcomer Program,” an alternative education program for newly arrived immigrants in Utica. For seven years, the Newcomer Program provided English as a second language (“ESL”) instruction to immigrant students, but no content area instruction, such as math, science, and history. In January 2014, the Newcomer Program began offering high school equivalency classes, commonly known as GED classes, to students who test well on an English proficiency exam, while those who do not test well remain in classes that teach only English (“ESL-only” classes). 6. In November 2014, following complaints about the inadequacy of ESL-only instruction for immigrant students aged 17-20, the Oneida-Herkimer-Madison Board of Cooperative Educational Services (“BOCES”), in consultation and coordination with the Defendants, created the Alignment of Pathways and Programs for Learners of English (“APPLE Program”). Located in New Hartford, N.Y., the APPLE Program provides GED classes for LEP immigrants aged 17-18. The Defendants continue to divert LEP immigrants aged 19-20 to the Newcomer Program, excluding them from high school. 7. A GED program is not, in reality, a substitute for a high school education. Compared to high school, GED instruction in the core subjects of reading, writing, science, history and math, is cursory. Students in GED programs are only taught what is necessary to pass the GED exam. In high school, instruction in the core subjects is more in-depth, students can take advanced courses, and they can take art, music, health and physical education classes. Thus, a high school education is not only more rigorous than a GED program, it is more comprehensive. As a consequence, the high school diploma provides its recipients with more promising employment opportunities than recipients of a GED. Yet, in Utica, LEP immigrants aged 17-20 have been relegated to either ESL-only classes or GED programs, with no option to attend high school. Moreover, the limited educational programs available to these students are not located","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] Utica City School District Board of Education | U.S. District Court | Northern District of New York | May 21, 2019 ||||| May 21, 2020 ||| June 20, 2020 | ||| May 31, 2020 | .<n>On May 21, 2019, a group of refugees filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District Of New York, alleging that the school district's policy of excluding limited English proficient (LEP) students from high school violated their right to education under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitutions.

WILLIAM BARR, in his official capacity as Attorney General of the Department of Justice; UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE; JAMES MCHENRY, in his official capacity as the Director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review; EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR IMMIGRATION REVIEW; MATTHEW ALBENCE, in his official capacity as Deputy Director and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; CHAD F.

INTRODUCTION 1. The government jails thousands of people each year—separating them from families and communities, depriving them of their livelihoods, and often holding them in remote facilities, practically incommunicado—solely because it alleges they are removable from the United States. Immigration and Customs Enforcement incarcerates them for months or even years without ever having to affirmatively prove that a particular individual’s detention serves a legitimate government interest. In the Batavia and Buffalo Immigration Courts, this practice permits agency adjudicators to deny release entirely or condition it on prohibitively high bond amounts, even when individuals pose little or no risk of flight or danger. In fact, two Immigration Judges sitting within this District—Philip Montante and Mary Baumgarten—have adopted what is in effect a blanket policy of denying bond across the board (“the No Bond Policy”). The No Bond Policy demonstrates the extreme injustice that can result from such a procedurally deficient custody-review scheme. 2. But liberty is supposed to be the norm throughout the American legal system, and detention a carefully limited exception. Accordingly, when an individual faces a severe deprivation of liberty, the Constitution requires adequate procedural protections to ensure they are not incarcerated arbitrarily and unlawfully. The petitioners in this case—Junior Onosamba-Ohindo and Antonio Lopez Agustin, on behalf of a class of people similarly situated—respectfully ask this Court to restore these core due process principles at the Batavia and Buffalo Immigration Courts. Specifically, they seek declaratory and injunctive relief that ends the respondents’ unlawful No Bond Policy and prohibits further detention without an adequate custody hearing that includes the following procedural protections: (1) the government bears the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that detention is necessary because the detained immigrant is a danger to others or a flight risk; (2) the government bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that there is no condition or combination of conditions that will reasonably assure the individual’s future appearance and the safety of the community; (3) the immigration judge considers the individual’s ability to pay and alternatives to detention in setting bond.

The Court conducted a hearing on the application on October 2, 2015. Having considered the application, response, record in the case, and the applicable law, the Court is of the opinion that Plaintiffs’ application for a preliminary injunction should be denied. See FED R. CIV P. 65(b). I. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs in this action are La Union del Pueblo Entero, Inc. (“LUPE”), which describes itself as a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the health, education, labor, and civil rights of indigent farmworkers and other low-wage workers in the Rio Grande Valley, and undocumented person Maria Isabel Perales Serna, and other similarly situated parents, who bring this action on behalf of themselves and minor children. Plaintiffs assert claims against defendants the Texas Department of State Health Services, Vital Statistics Unit (“DSHS”), as well as DSHS Commissioner Kirk Cole and Unit Chief Geraldine Harris in their official capacities challenging recent policy changes adopted by DSHS. At issue in this case is the claim by Plaintiffs that persons without legal immigration status in the United States are effectively denied the ability to obtain a birth certificate for children born in Texas, who are thus citizens of the United States. Plaintiffs contend the effective bar creates numerous issues in obtaining the rights and benefits which inure to citizens of the United States, including enrollment in schools and social welfare programs, as well as other services such as baptism and day care services. They maintain access to those benefits, services and programs is contingent on presentation of a birth certificate, and thus the inability to obtain a birth certificate effectively denies access to children born in Texas to persons without legal immigration status. DSHS is the Texas state agency statutorily empowered to “administer the registration of vital statistics.” TEX. HEALTH SAFETY CODE ANN. <unk>191.002(a).

I. SUMMARY 1. Texas’ suit seeks to fabricate a case or controversy based upon public statements by City officials who believe Senate Bill No. 4 (SB 4) is unconstitutional. The suit fails to establish jurisdiction because Texas has suffered no injury, the law is not in effect, and the State’s complaint seeks an impermissible advisory opinion. Thus, the City’s motion to dismiss should be granted. II. FACTS DEFEATING JURISDICTION A. Texas Filed Suit Before SB 4 Went into Effect 2. The State filed this suit on May 7, 2017. Dkt. 1. 3. Because SB 4 did not garner a two-thirds majority of all members elected to each house, the law will go into effect on September 1, 2017.1 See Dkt. 1-1 at 16 (<unk>7.02); id. at 17 (showing votes of Senate and House achieving less than a two-thirds majority) B. Texas Complains that City Officials Criticized SB 4 Before it Became a Law 4. Texas complains that City officials publicly expressed their belief that SB 4 is not a constitutional exercise of the State’s power. See Dkt. 1 10, 113, 147-149. 5. Although Texas alleges that the City is violating SB 4 in various ways, it fails to identify any alleged acts or omissions of the City occurring between the time the Governor signed SB 4 into law and the time of suit. Texas has not—and cannot—identify any City acts or omissions violating SB 4 that occur after the effective date of September 1, 2017 C. SB 4 Contains Provisions to Punish Non-Compliant Municipalities and Officials 6. SB 4 prohibits “local entities” (a term defined to include municipalities and their employees and officials) from adopting, enforcing, or endorsing any policy that would prohibit or “materially limit” local police or other officials from enforcing “immigration laws.” Dkt. 1-1 at 56 (<unk>752.053). To enforce compliance with this provision, SB 4 provides that the Texas Attorney General may file suit to seek a civil penalty against a non-complaint local entity. If awarded by the 1 Texas inexplicably omits the effective date of SB 4 from its complaint, instead pleading “Senate Bill is Texas law as of May 7, 2017.” Dkt. 1 115. court, the penalty must be between $1,000 and $1,500 for the first day of a violation, and between $25,000 and $25,500 for each additional day of a violation Id. at 6-7 (<unk>752.055-752.056). 7. SB 4 punishes any elected or appointed official who “adopt[s], enforce[s], or endorse[s]” a policy that limits local police investigations of immigration status Id. at 8-9 (<unk>752.0565 (incorporating by reference <unk>752.053). Pursuant to this provision, SB 4 requires the Attorney General to file a quo warranto action against any elected or appointed official if the AG is presented with evidence, “including evidence of a statement by the public officer,” establishing probable cause that the official violated SB 4 by, for example, endorsing an objectionable policy. The penalty for an official found “guilty as charged” is removal from office. Id. III. ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES A. A Plaintiff Must Establish Standing to Invoke the Jurisdiction of this Court 8.

Throughout the course of this investigation, County officials, including the Sheriff, County Attorney, Jail Warden and other jail personnel, provided us with substantial assistance and their full cooperation. ,Our consultants expressed appreciation for this assistance, and we wish to join then _ir. thanking you for your cooperation. In making our findings, we recognize that Harrison County Jail confines both pretrial detainees and post-conviction .inmates. In general, inmates nay not be subjected to conditions that are incompatible with evolving standards of decency or deprived of their basic human needs while incarcerated. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976). With respect to the pretrial detainees, the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits punishment of these persons and restrictive conditions or practices that are not reasonably related to the legitimate governmental objectives of safety, order and security. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1S79). For those convicted of a crime, the standard to be applied is the Eighth Amendment's proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. Wi1son v. Seiter, U.S. 111 S.Ct. 2321 (1991); Rhodes v Chapman. 452 U.sT<unk>337 (198T). When convicted prisoners are not, as here, separated from pretriai detainees, the Fourteenth Amendment standard applies to all inmates. U.S v. Harrison Co.

Each cf the four cellblocks (three of which hold up to 19 2 inmates) has only one officer, who is stationed and r.ust regain in a central observation room. In the event of a disturbance, this officer must summon cutside help. This staffing arrangement poses significant safety and security problems. Known incidents cf inmate aggression, sexual assaults, sexual activity involving female inmates, and a recent major escape that may have been avoided with proper staffing attest to the dangers presented. 2. The training provided to Jail officers is inadequate. Currently, the only training offered is a correspondence course administered by the National Sheriff's Association.

The plaintiffs alleged that the Erie County Sheriff's Department had an unconstitutional policy and practice of strip-searching prisoners when they entered the county facilities. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar strip search policy was constitutional in <i>Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders</i>. The plaintiffs in this case argued that their case was distinguishable from <i>Florence</i>. However, no further action occurred in the case after 2012.

McCARTHY GIBSON, both individually and as Superintendent of the Erie County Holding Center, CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT JURY TRIAL DEMANDED Defendants. INTRODUCTION This is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights secured to the Plaintiffs and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States of America. For the past several years, the Erie County Sheriff’s Departmem has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who emer either the Erie County Holding Center and/or the Erie County Correctional Facility, regardless of the crime upon which they are charged. Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from the written procedures of the Erie County Sheriff’s Department, and was promulgated by senior Department officials; specifically, Defendants Sheriff Patrick Gallivan, Undersheriff Timothy Howard, Acting Superintendent Daniel J. Livingston, Deputy Superintendent Robert Huggins, and Superintendent H. McCarthy Gibson. It has been welt established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals charged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized suspicion that they possess weapons or contraband. In short, the policy of Erie County and the Erie County Sheriff’s Department to force those charged with minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Erie County Holding Center and/or the Erie County Correctional Facility is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary. Adam Pritehard, Edward Robinson, and Julenne Tucker bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class ot"" thousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their civil rights and those of the class members they propose to represent. All three of these individuals were charged with misdemeanor and/or violation offenses, and all were subject to strip searches, in violation of their right against unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. They seek monetary damages for themselves and each member of the proposed class, a declaration that the Sheriff’s Department’s policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding Erie County and the Erie County Sheriff’s Department from continuing to violate the rights of those.placed into their custody. With this as a background, Plaintiffs Adam Pritchard, Edward Robinson<unk>and Julenne Tucker complain as follows: JURISIJlCTION 1. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the previsions of 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331, 1341 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state taw, of the rights of citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1981 1983.

They claimed that failure to take sufficient COVID-19 precautions violated the Fourteenth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and they sought release. The court appointed an ""Independent Inspector"" to assess conditions at the jail and, based on his report, denied preliminary relief. The court also denied defendants' motion to dismiss, and a trial is scheduled for May 2021. 

An Independent Inspector was tasked with inspecting the jail to evaluate the conditions. While praising defendants' professionalism, he wrote that several adjustments needed to be made in order for the jail to be a safe place for detainees. 

After attending mediation and filing a joint motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement, the court preliminarily granted the consent decree requiring monthly reports on the status of COVID-19 in the Jail and unannounced, periodic inspections by the Inspector.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. <unk>2241 AND CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. We are in the midst of the most significant global pandemic in generations. COVID-19 is a highly contagious and deadly respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The death rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be at least 2.3 percent, which is several times more than the common flu that kills thousands a year.1 The World Health Organization estimates that one in five people who contract the disease requires hospitalization.2 2. This action seeks urgent habeas and injunctive relief to protect medically vulnerable people and people with disabilities detained at Shelby County Jail3 (the “Jail”) who are at high risk of severe injury or death from COVID-19. Favian Busby and Michael Edgington (the “Named Plaintiffs”) seek to represent a class of all current and future medically vulnerable (as defined below) pretrial detainees held at the Jail who, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), are at high risk of severe infection or death from COVID-19 (the “Class”). Named Plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of current and future pretrial detainees who are medically vulnerable and at high risk of severe injury or death from COVID-19 due to disabilities protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (the “Subclass”). 1 The University of Tennessee Health Science Center estimates the fatality rate may be as high as 3.4 percent and notes that the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 are “100s of times worse than influenza.” Expert Responses, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, https://uthsc.edu/coronavirus/expert-responses.php (last visited May 19, 2020).

COVID-19 has already spread throughout the Jail, infecting hundreds of people, yet Defendants continue to detain the members of the Class and Subclass (collectively, the “Classes”) despite the fact that they are likely to suffer severe infection or death if they contract COVID-19 and despite the Petitioners-Plaintiffs’ (“Plaintiffs”) high risk of contracting the disease by virtue of their housing at the Jail. Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek emergency relief from this Court provisionally certifying the Class and Subclass and compelling Defendants to (a) release4 immediately Favian Busby and Michael Edgington; (b) promptly identify COVID vulnerable individuals held at the Jail who are members of the Class; and (c) promptly release members of the Class from detention.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1.1 Conditions at the Franklin County Jail in Pasco, Washington (“Jail”) 3 violate the constitutional rights of the people incarcerated there. Jail administrators 4 (“Defendants”) have ordered, authorized or condoned each of the following illegal 5 actions: (a) chaining inmates to fixed objects for days on end; (b) holding inmates in restraint chairs for many hours without adequate cause or supervision; (c) pepper spraying inmates without adequate cause or supervision; (d) locking all inmates in their cells for a minimum of 23 hours a day; (e) denying inmates regular outdoor recreation; (f) completely denying all inmates visitation with friends and family and severely limiting all contact between inmates and their families; and (g) disciplining inmates without providing any procedural protections. 1.2 The Defendants lock all inmates in their cells for at least twenty three 19 hours per day, with no programming, religious services, and only very rare Columbia Legal Services Institutions Project 1 opportunity to breathe fresh air or see the sun. Rather than provide inmates with 2 disciplinary procedures, due process or adequate exercise, the Defendants 3 indiscriminately utilize restraint chairs, shackles, long-term isolation, and pepper 4 spray in an attempt to maintain order and to punish inmates. 1.3 The Defendants’ actions have caused inmates physical, emotional and 6 psychological injuries and deprived them of contact with their families. One 7 inmate recently died at the Jail and others have seriously injured themselves as a 8 result of the Defendants’ horrendous actions. 1.4 The Defendants’ actions violate the First, Eighth and Fourteenth 10 Amendment protections afforded the people incarcerated at the Jail. The 11 Defendants will continue to violate the rights of all inmates absent injunctive and 12 declaratory relief as requested below. 1.5 Inmates at the Jail have therefore brought this class action lawsuit 14 against the Jail administrators to stop the Jail’s widespread unconstitutional 15 practices.

The government was therefore enjoined from issuing NSLs under § 2709 or from enforcing the nondisclosure provision in this or any other case. The government appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, but while the appeal was pending, Congress amended § 2709 and 18 U.S.C. § 3511 as part of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. The district court and Ninth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the revised § 2709 and § 3511.

In just the past year, the public has learned that the NSA hacked into United Nations videoconferences,1 intercepted the phone calls of allied foreign leaders,2 and engaged in bulk collecting and storage of telephone metadata relating to calls made in the United States.3 1 David Meyer, “NSA Hacked into Encrypted UN Communications, leaked documents show,” The Guardian (Aug. 25, 2013). 2 Ian Traynor, “Angela Merkel: NSA Spying on allies is not on,” The Guardian (Oct. 24, 2013). 13. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has ruled that the NSA’s bulk collection and storage of telephone metadata is consistent with both the Fourth Amendment and Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. In re application of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for an order requiring the production of tangible things from [REDACTED], No. BR 13-109 (F.I.S.C. 2013). According to the court, bulk collection is permissible because there is no requirement for “specific and articulable facts” or that the records pertain to “a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.” Id. Though the court required access to the bulk data to be limited through a query that requires reasonable, articulable suspicion, the FISC “Court is aware that in prior years there have been incidents of non-compliance with respect to NSA’s handling of produced information,” despite the fact that “[a]ccording to the government, in the prior authorization period there have been no compliance incidents.” Id. 14. The vast scope of the NSA’s surveillance program has raised questions about whether the agency has spied on the coordinate branches of the federal government. In response to an inquiry from Sen. Bernie Sanders about whether the NSA spies on members of Congress, NSA director Gen. Keith Alexander responded, “Nothing NSA does can fairly be characterized as ‘spying on members of Congress or other American elected officials[.]’”4 But the response stated that the agency could make no guarantees that representatives or senators have not had their telephone metadata caught in broad government sweeps.5 Further, Alexander did not rule out the possibility that the NSA would, in the future, examine the telephone metadata of specific members of Congress or other American elected officials. According to Alexander, “The NSA can query the metadata only based on phone numbers reasonably suspected to be associated with specific foreign terrorist groups” and “[f]or that reason, NSA cannot lawfully search to determine 3 Roberta Rampton, “Obama to propose ending NSA bulk collection of phone records: official,” Reuters (Mar. 25, 2014). 4 Adam Silverman, “Responding to Sanders, NSA director denies spying on Congress,” Burlington Free Press (Jan. 14, 2014). 5 Id. if any records NSA has received under the program have included metadata of the phone calls of any member of Congress, other American elected officials, or any other American without that predicate.”6 But according to Sen.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20535-0001 Defendant. Case No. 16-cv-1850 COMPLAINT Plaintiffs The Associated Press (“AP”), Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC d/b/a USA TODAY (”USA TODAY”), and Vice Media, LLC (“Vice”) (together, “News Organizations”), by and through their undersigned attorneys, allege: 1. This action is brought pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, et seq., for basic contracting information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) regarding one of its most publicly-discussed and controversial acquisitions: a technological tool openly purchased from a third-party vendor that was used to circumvent the need for a court order to access the locked iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the perpetrators of the mass killings in San Bernardino, California Mr. Farook and his wife were both killed in the attack, appear to have acted alone, and investigators long ago stated that they had uncovered no connection between the shooters and any foreign terrorist groups.1 The News Organizations seek injunctive and other appropriate relief, including release of agency records from the FBI. 2. More specifically, through this action, the News Organizations seek to compel the FBI to provide records of the publicly-acknowledged business transaction that resulted in the purchase this March of the so-called iPhone access tool. The public interest in receiving this information is significant. The FBI’s purchase of this tool allowed government access to Mr. Farook’s phone, providing new information about one of the deadliest attacks on American soil in recent years, but also apparently failing to reveal any evidence of links between Mr. Farook and foreign terrorists or terrorist organizations.2 At the same time, the tool sparked tremendous nationwide debate about both the proper balance between national security and privacy in personal communications, and the degree to which law enforcement should be empowered to compel access to encrypted and protected devices.3 FBI Director James Comey has himself stressed the essential importance of a nationwide “adult conversation” about whether and when 1 See Doug Stanglin and Kevin Johnson, FBI: No evidence San Bernardino killers were part of a cell, USA TODAY (Dec. 5, 2015), available at: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/12/04/suspects-family-shockedkillings/76773382/. 2 See, e.g. Ellen Nakashima and Adam Goldman, No links to foreign terrorists found on San Bernardino iPhone so far, officials say, The Wash.

FBI timeline: 43 days that rocked tech, USA TODAY (Mar. 30, 2016) (collecting coverage and summarizing history of debate), available at http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/03/15/apple-v-fbi-timeline/81827400/. law enforcement should be able to access encrypted devices because, “‘We’ve got to get to a point where we can reach [wrongdoers] as easily as they can reach us and change behavior by that reach-out.’” 4 Mr. Comey also noted the need for increased information sharing with the public, an acknowledgment particularly critical given the potential of future legislative action on this issue, noting, “‘We need to understand in the FBI, how is this exactly affecting our work, and then share that with folks.’”5 3. Moreover, the FBI’s purchase of the technology – and its subsequent verification that it had successfully obtained the data it was seeking thanks to that technology – confirmed that a serious undisclosed security vulnerability existed (and likely still exists) in one of the most popular consumer products in the world.6 And in order to exploit that vulnerability, the FBI contracted with an unidentified third-party vendor, effectively sanctioning that party to retain this potentially dangerous technology without any public assurance about what that vendor represents, whether the vendor has adequate security measures, whether the vendor is a proper recipient of government funds, or whether it will act only in the public interest. 4.

This lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of a secret government program to intercept vast quantities of the international telephone and Internet communications of innocent Americans without court approval (hereinafter ""the Program""). The National Security Agency I Central Security Service (""NSA"") launched the Program in 2001 and t11e President of!he United States ratified it in 2002. 2. Plaintiffs are a group of prominent journalists, scholars, attorneys, and national nonprofit organizations who frequently communicate by telephone and email with people outside the United States, including in the Middle Bast and Asia. Because of the nature of their calls and emails, and the identities and locations of those with whom they commimicate, plaintiffs have a well-founded belief that their communications are being intercepted under the Program. The Program is disrnpting the ability of the plaintiffs to talk with sources, locate witnesses, conduct scholarship, and engage in advocacy. 3. By seriously compromising the free speech and privacy rights of the plaintiffs and others, the Program violates the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution. It also violates constitutional separation of powers principles, because it was authori,-.ed by President George W. Bush in excess of his Executive authority and contrary to limits imposed by Congress. ln response to widespread domestic surveillance abuses committed by the Executive Branch and exposed in the 1960s and 1970s, Congress enacted legislation that provides ""the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance... and !he interception of domestic wire, oral, and electronic communications may be conducted."" 18 U.S.C. 2511 (2)( l) (emphasis added), Plaintiffs respectfully seek a declaration that the Program is unlawful, and a permanent injunction against its use.

COMPLAINT COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, for 20 declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the disclosure and release of agency records 21 improperly withheld from Plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union of Washington (“ACLU”) by 22 Defendant U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). 2. The ACLU seeks to compel the release of records describing the operation and 26 Organization File (“VGTOF”) maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), a 27 component of Defendant, DOJ. The NCIC is a computerized system that makes criminal history COMPLAINT information instantly and widely available to police officers and tens of thousands law 1 2 enforcement agencies across the United States. The object of this action is to obtain information 3 about how the NCIC VGTOF database is maintained and used by the FBI. 3. Inclusion in the NCIC VGTOF database can have significant impact upon even routine 5 interactions with the police and may affect an individual’s employment opportunities and 6 financial standing. The NCIC database has been exempted from the Privacy Act since 2003 7 because the Justice Department has argued that “it is impossible to determine in advance what 9 information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete.” Thus, despite the serious potential harms 10 resulting from misinformation in the NCIC system, traditional governmental mechanisms for 11 ensuring accuracy and accountability do not apply to that database. No process exists for 12 individuals to contest or ensure the accuracy of their designation, or even to ascertain how, why, 13 or whether they are included. 14 4. Despite the ACLU’s compliance with all statutory requirements in requesting records 15 regarding the NCIC, Defendant has been entirely unresponsive to the ACLU’s request. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This Court has both subject matter jurisdiction over the ACLU’s claims and personal 19 jurisdiction over Defendant agency pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B). This Court also has 20 jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>1331 and 1346. 21 6. Venue lies in this district pursuant to 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. <unk>1391(e), 22 as Plaintiff resides in Seattle, Washington. PARTIES 24 7. Plaintiff ACLU is a Seattle, Washington based civil liberties organization. The ACLU 26 seeks access to these records in order to understand how the FBI is using the NCIC VGTOF as a 27 law enforcement tool and whether it is doing so in a manner consistent with civil liberties. COMPLAINT 8. Defendant DOJ is the federal agency responsible for the legal business of the United 1 2 States, including the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity within the United States. 3 The FBI, a component entity of DOJ, is responsible for investigating violations of the criminal 4 laws of the United States. The FBI maintains the NCIC database and regularly employs it in 5 carrying out investigations. DOJ is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(f). 6 STATEMENT OF FACTS 8 The NCIC Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File 9. The National Crime Information Center (“NCIC”) is a nationwide clearinghouse of 11 records operated by the FBI. The NCIC provides direct on-line access to its computerized index 12 of criminal justice information for local, state, federal, and tribal law enforcement officers, 13 government agencies, financial institutions, prospective employers, and others nationwide. 14 10. The NCIC database includes a Violent Gang and Terrorist Organizations File 15 (“VGTOF”), which contains entries on suspected terrorist organizations and individuals. 11. Upon information and belief, as of 2003, there were over 7000 individuals listed in 18 VGTOF as “terrorists,” many of whom have no criminal records. Entry into the terrorist member 19 portion of the VGTOF does not require prior arrest or conviction for a terrorism offense. 12. An incorrect entry into the VGTOF carries potentially grave ramifications. For 21 instance, a simple traffic stop can become a prolonged search, result in harsher treatment of 22 individuals, and lead to direct contact between the patrol officer and the FBI. VGTOF entries often advise a responding officer: “WARNING: APPROACH WITH CAUTION.” Once an 24 25 officer receives an NCIC “hit,” the officers are likely to treat the encounter as potentially 26 dangerous, as the “hit” sharply raises the perceived risk of harm to the officer, the subject, and COMPLAINT bystanders. Actions officers may take include unlocking the safety control on the officer’s 1 2 handgun, flattening the individual against the police car, or calling for back-up. 13. The NCIC VGTOF screen also frequently",<pad>The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) seeking information about the FBI's use of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database. The NCIC is a computerized system that makes criminal history COMPLAINT information instantly and widely available to police officers and tens of thousands law enforcement agencies across the United States. The ACLU sought information about how the NCIC VGTOF database is maintained and used by the FBI. The court granted the ACLU's motion for partial summary judgment in favor of the DOJ. The case is now closed.</s>

The results of the census help determine the balance of political power among and within the States and the distribution of day-to-day government services. The federal government uses Census data to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, draw legislative districts, enforce voting rights, build schools, and allocate more than $400 billion in federal funds. The critical task of conducting the decennial census falls to the Census Bureau (“the Bureau”), a unit within the Defendant U.S. Department of Commerce. The Bureau has six regional offices and dozens of temporary processing facilities, and employs more than half a million temporary workers. The scale of the census is reflected by its cost: more than $12 billion in 2010. Yet despite the Bureau's extensive planning and funding, the agency routinely undercounts minorities, young children, home renters, and lowincome persons. Undercounted communities, in turn, may not receive their fair share of federal funding, especially in key areas such as education and infrastructure. Given the scale, cost, and impact of the census, the public has an overwhelming interest in ensuring that its count is accurate and fair. And given the Census Bureau’s history of undercounting minorities, transparency is of particular importance to Plaintiffs, as well as to their tens of thousands of members. The Census Bureau faces serious obstacles in preparing for the 2020 count. These include hiring and personnel gaps, exacerbated by a federal hiring freeze imposed in January 2017; an unprecedented move to digitize the census, with unknown vulnerabilities to cyberattack and disparate impacts on communities with less access to broadband internet services; a lack of senior leadership; and budgetary shortfalls at a time when the Bureau’s funding should be substantially increasing. These deficiencies recently prompted the U.S. Government Accountability Office to label the 2020 census a “high-risk” program. Yet the Bureau has failed to fully communicate to the public how it plans to carry out the 2020 census in light of these obstacles. Plaintiffs submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) to obtain records about the Bureau’s plans for the 2020 census. Plaintiffs requested records concerning hiring practices, cancellations/delays of tests, digitization, and outreach to hard-to-count populations, and other topics. The Bureau failed to respond to Plaintiffs’ request within the statutory deadline, in violation of the FOIA. Plaintiffs bring this action to compel the Bureau’s immediate production of responsive, non-exempt records. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1.

As her parents have aged, their health has deteriorated, and they can no longer provide the attendant services Ms. Jones requires to survive. 2 Ms. Jones is eligible for and receives Medicaid. For more than four years, Ms. Jones has applied for Medicaid's home health services, but Defendants have not provided her with any home and community-based services. Instead they have placed her on a ""wait list."" Recently, Defendants have acknowledged that Ms. Jones is at imminent risk of being institutionalized in a nursing home in order to receive the same services she has requested and needs to continue living in the community. Defendants have Medicaid funded services which would permit Ms. Jones to continue to live successfully at home and to participate in church, family and community life. 3.

This civil rights action is brought to remedy the systematic and continuing violation of federal law by Florida state health officials. Specifically, this action seeks to redress the failure of Florida state health officials to provide children in Florida who are enrolled in federally- funded medical assistance (commonly known as Medicaid) with essential medical and dental services as required by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>1396 et seq. (""Title 2. Title XIX mandates that all of these children be furnished Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment Services (""EPSDT"") the primary, preventive, acute and specialty care and services which are necessary to their good health and development. 3. This action is brought on behalf of the more than 1.6 million children who are enrolled in the Florida Title XIX and EPSDT services program (collectively referred to as ""Medical Assistance""), by the Florida Pediatric Society/The Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics ('FPS""), the Florida Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, Inc. (""FAPD""), and the named plaintiffs and their families. 4. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to end the violation of federal law taking place in Florida which denies our state's children the delivery of prompt, complete and continuing health care. 5. The defendants are the Secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (""AHCA""), the state governmental agency designated by the Governor to be Florida's single agency responsible for implementing Title XIX, the Secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Family Services, and the Secretary of the Florida Department of Health. 6. The failure of the defendants to comply with federal law has resulted in, and, if left unremedied, will continue to result in, the needless infliction of pain, the endangerment of young lives, the preemption of learning, development, and growth, and the stunting of the children's life chances. 7. Because of the defendants' violation of federal law, hundreds of thousands of eligible Florida children have not been furnished any preventive health care services. According to the State of Florida's own statistics, in FFY 2004, for example, more than 500,000 Medicaid enrolled Florida children were furnished no preventative health care services at all. Among these children • more than 30,000 infants (children under the age of 1) received no preventative medical services during the first year of their life • more than 152,000 toddlers (children between the ages of I and 5) received no preventative medical services an d • more than 337,000 school age children (children between the ages of 6 and 18) received no preventative medical services. 8. These statistics are not isolated examples but are demonstrative of the systematic failure of the defendants to comply with the mandates of federal Medicaid law. Indeed, statistics provided to the federal government by Florida's Medicaid Agency show that for the years 1999 to 2004 at least 44% of the children enrolled in Florida's Medicaid program failed to receive even one of the health check ups that they were entitled to under federal law. During that same time period more than 75% of Florida's enrolled children were furnished no dental care whatsoever, despite their entitlement to such care. 9. To remedy Florida's systemic failure to comply with federal law, this action requests tha t the Court inter alia a. Require the defend ants to conform to the mandates of Title XIX, its implementing regulations and guidelines and provide the children of Flo ri da with timely, complete and continuing health care and services b. Require the defendants to ensure that payments to providers including pediatricians, dentists pediatric subspecialists and other specialty care physicians, are sufficient to provide children receiving Medical Assistance access to care and se rvices to the same extent that such care and se rvices are available to other children in the same geographic area c.

Troy, New York 518 273-1614 Dennis Zeller, Ph. D., M.S.S.W..Helaine Hornby, M.A. Contents Part I. Reasons for Redesigning the Front Door Part II. Structure of the New Front Door System Part III. Issues to be Resolved Part IV. Implementation Steps t I Part I. Reasons for Redesigning the Front Door The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has embarked on an effort to redesign the way the initial services are delivered to families who have been the subject of an abuse allegation. The project most directly impacts the investigative function and in-home services but also affects prevention and out-of-home services. Its genesis is a series of issues that have been articulated by planning groups, agency administrators, caseworker staff and community leaders. For example, the July 1994 Framework for Illinois Child Welfare System cites, as one of its central themes, the need for ""Front Door"" improvements to the child and family services system. In the current model, the State Central Register receives a report of abuse and/or neglect and assigns a specific allegation to the report which is then transmitted to the Child Protection Investigator (CPI). The investigator goes out to evaluate the situation, focusing on the specific allegations. His or her goal is essentially to verify the truth in the allegations. Because of this single focus, the investigator provides few if any links to services to the family. At the conclusion of the investigation, the investigative worker passes the case on to the Division of Child Welfare if additional services are needed. Statute requires that the investigation worker not only establish the truth of the allegations but also conduct a safety assessment. There is, however, no direct connection between the simple truth of an allegation and the jeopardy to the child's current safety. The safety assessment is therefore a distinct function performed by the investigator which requires consideration both of the immediate dangers the child faces and of the resources that may eliminate that danger. In short, the safety assessment is a casework function, yet the investigator has neither access to nor training in the use of services other than out of home placement. Thus the separation between the investigative and the casework functions and the simultaneous assignment of the assessment to the investigator leaves only two strictly correlated choices: either the child is safe and can remain in the home or the child is not safe and must be removed. To evaluate the proposed model adequately, it is important to understand the problems the model is attempting to address, the goals of the system of which it will be part, the theoretical framework behind the solution, the objectives of the model, the strategies for pursuing those goals and the questions which have to be resolved before implementation can -be completed. This paper provides an overview of these points. D Problems to be Addressed by Model Between fiscal years 1990 and 1994, the number of child abuse and neglect reports accepted by the State Central Register (SCR) rose by 24 percent, from 60,737 to 75,514. Because the indication rate has remained constant during that period, the number of families needing services has risen by an equal proportion. Many of the families coming into the child protective system in Illinois require more intensive interventions than those seen in early times. While child abuse reports were rising by one-quarter, the number of protective custodies taken by DCFS rose by more than 40 percent. Moreover, families who receive services are staying in the system longer now than previously, whether they are served while intact or while a child is placed in foster care. No change the agency can make will have an impact on the numbers and types of families appearing before it. What the agency can do, however, is create mechanisms through which it is better able to respond to families in need. DCFS now struggles with its ability to respond to the families in greatest need, to select the most appropriate service strategy, and to define the specific outcomes which it can reasonably expect to achieve. The model proposed here is intended to address internal barriers to DCFS' ability to provide responsive and effective services. Some of these barriers include the following. Investigative approach towards families: Perhaps the biggest problem to be addressed by the model is a problem endemic in child protective services nationally, the approach public agencies take towards the families they serve, spawned by the investigatory function of the state. Since the federal adoption of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act in 1974 child protective services have gradually and consistently evolved toward a quasi-police function in many states. Under current rules the investigator is responsible for deciding what happened, who did it, what are the safety and risk issues, and what resources should be employed to assure the immediate safety of the child. The initial investigatory process which focuses on substantiating or proving an allegation of abuse can be a process which alienates families, placing them on the defensive and making it difficult to establish a helping relationship once the agency has decided",<pad>The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) has embarked on an effort to redesign the way the initial services are delivered to families who have been the subject of an abuse allegation. The project most directly impacts the investigative function and in-home services but also affects prevention and out-of- home services.<n>The model proposed here is intended to address internal barriers to DCFS' ability to provide responsive and effective services.</s>

VanNess II, and Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller (collectively, “Defendants”), and allege as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. Veronica and Mayra are a committed same-sex couple (“adult Plaintiffs”) residing in Indiana with their two minor children, B.Y.R. and I.R. (“child Plaintiffs”). Plaintiffs bring this 1 The undersigned counsel hereby provides notice to the Court that this action is being taken on behalf of Mayra Yvette Rivera to avoid imminent and irreparable harm pursuant to Rule 1.14 of the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct. QB<unk>29437283.1 action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 seeking declaratory and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief for Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ rights — the guarantees of liberty and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution — caused by the discriminatory exclusion of same-sex couples from the right to marry and refusal to recognize marriages lawfully entered by same-sex couples in other jurisdictions pursuant to the laws of the State of Indiana (“State”). See Indiana Code <unk>31-11-1-1. 2. Marriage plays a unique role in society as the universally recognized and celebrated hallmark of a couple’s commitment to build family life together. It confers upon couples a dignity and status of immense import. The adult Plaintiffs have formed committed, enduring bonds equally worthy of the respect afforded by the State to different-sex couples through marriage. Yet, the State, without any adequate justification, has enacted, interpreted, and enforced its laws in ways that single out lesbian and gay couples in Indiana by excluding them from the freedom to marry and by refusing to recognize and respect lawful marriages from other jurisdictions, based solely on their sexual orientation and their sex. 3. Through Defendants’ adherence to and enforcement of Indiana Code Section 3111-1-1 and their interpretation and enforcement of the State’s other laws to preclude same-sex couples from marrying or having their marriages lawfully entered into other jurisdictions recognized in Indiana, the State and Defendants send a message that lesbians, gay men, and their children are second-class citizens who are undeserving of the legal sanction, respect, protections, and support that different-sex couples and their children receive automatically through marriage. This discrimination (referred to herein as the State’s “marriage ban”) is established in the State’s statutes, which prevent same sex couples from entering into a civil marriage in the State and prohibit the State from honoring a civil marriage validly entered by a same-sex couple in another jurisdiction. 4. The marriage ban inflicts serious and irreparable harm on same-sex couples and their children.

I.R. and B.Y.R. seek the protections, security, support, and benefits conferred upon the children of married parents, and to end the stigma, shame, and humiliation imposed upon children of lesbian and gay parents by the law’s refusal to permit them to belong to families with married parents and designation of their families as inferior to others and unworthy of marriage. 5.

AND I.D., minor children, by and through their parents and next friends, GREGORY BOURKE and MICHAEL DELEON Plaintiffs vs. STEVE BRESHEAR, in his official capacity as Governor of Kentucky; and JACK CONWAY, in his official capacity as Attorney General of Kentucky; and BOBBIE HOLSCLAW in her official capacity as Jefferson County Clerk Defendants COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiffs bring this action to challenge the constitutionality of Kentucky’s laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage and voiding within the State of Kentucky the marriages of same-sex couples entered in other states or countries. KRS 402.040(2) 2. Plaintiffs Gregory Bourke and Michael Deleon are already married, having wed in Ontario Canada. Kentucky does not recognize same-sex marriages. The Plaintiffs are treated as legal strangers in their home state of Kentucky. 3. Plaintiffs I.D. and I.D. are children of the Plaintiffs, Gregory Bourke and Michael Deleon. The fact that their parents’ marriage is not recognized in Kentucky harms them materially by reducing family resources and stigmatizes them by denying their family social recognition and respect. 4. The Plaintiffs all reside in Louisville and are active members of the Catholic Church. The adult Plaintiffs work as an application consultant and database administrator and have been employed as such for 19 years and 25 years respectively. They have been together for thirty one years, having met as students at the University of Kentucky. They have been raising children together for over a decade. The situations faced by the adult Plaintiffs are similar to those faced by thousands of same-sex couples in Kentucky who are being denied the basic rights that are afforded to them by marriage. 5. The Plaintiff couple, like other committed couples, have cared for each other, supported each other, sacrificed for each other, and made plans for the future with each other. Like other couples who have made a lifetime commitment to each other, the Plaintiff couple are spouses in every sense, except that Kentucky law says even though they are married in another jurisdiction, their marriage is not honored here in Kentucky. 6. As the Plaintiff couple’s marriage is not recognized by the state, when they adopted the minor Plaintiffs, they were only able to have one parent listed as the adoptive parent, and the other parent had to go to court to acquire guardianship papers for his own children so that he could be their legal guardian, but not their legal parent. This is just one example of how the Commonwealth materially impacts the Plaintiff children’s lives. 7. The Commonwealth’s exclusion of same-sex couples from recognition of their marriages adversely impacts the Plaintiffs and same-sex couples across the Commonwealth in other significant ways. It excludes them from the many legal protections available to spouses. For example, when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse may face serious financial hardship, including the loss of the family house, because he is denied the inheritance tax exemption provided to surviving spouses. Due to Kentucky’s refusal to allow or to recognize their marriages, same-sex couples are also denied many federal protections afforded to other married couples such as the ability to take time off work to care for a sick spouse under the Family Medical Leave Act and access to a spouse’s social security retirement benefits. 8. The exclusion from marriage undermines the Plaintiff couples' ability to achieve their life goals and dreams, threatens their mutual economic stability, and denies them ""a dignity and status of immense import."" United States v. Windsor, No. 12-307, Slip Op., at 18 (U.S. June 26, 2013). Moreover, they and their children are stigmatized and relegated to a second class status by being barred from marriage. The exclusion ""tells [same-sex couples and all the world that their relationships are unworthy"" of recognition Id. at 2223. And it ""humiliates the...children now being raised by same-sex couples"" and ""makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives."" Id. at 23. 9. The adult Plaintiffs are old enough to remember when a majority of states had laws prohibiting marriage between people of different races and when the Supreme Court struck down such prohibitions in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967), declaring: ""The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men."" 10.

The plaintiffs each claimed to be qualified welfare beneficiaries who had been improperly denied assistance by one of New York City’s new job centers in violation of the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process, the city’s obligations under 7 U.S.C. §2020 (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—then referred to as Food Stamps) and 42 U.S.C. §1396 (Medicaid), in addition to violating state law; the plaintiffs sought class certification for all similarly situated New York City residents, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 16, 1998, with Judge William H. Pauley presiding. The court entered a temporary restraining order on the same day directing the city to provide emergency food stamps and cash assistance to the named plaintiffs. The court granted a preliminary injunction in-part to the plaintiffs on January 21, 1999. The court ordered the city to (1) allow applicants for public assistance to apply for benefits the first day they visit a job center, (2) cease conversion of income support centers to job centers without a formal hearing, (3) make eligibility requirements for food stamps and Medicaid separately from the eligibility determination from cash assistance, (4) send applicants timely notice of the city’s decision on whether they qualify for benefits, and (5) form a corrective plan for achieving its policy goals while also meeting the needs of public assistance applicants. The city moved to vacate the preliminary injunction on December 10, 1999, after procuring more evidence surrounding the efficacy of the job centers in achieving their welfare obligations. Meanwhile, the State of New York moved to dismiss the complaint against them for failure to state a claim. Judge Pauley denied both motions and granted the plaintiff’s motion for class certification on July 21, 2000. 

The court entered a permanent injunction in favor of the plaintiffs on December 30, 2004. The permanent injunction directed both the city and state to: (i) provide expedited food stamp service to eligible applications within 7 days; (ii) separately process applications for food stamps when the applications for cash assistance are denied or withdrawn; (iii) send notices to applicants confirming voluntary withdrawals for Medicaid in accord with 42 C.F.R. 435.913 and document such withdrawals pursuant to 7 C.F.R. 273.2(c)(6); and (iv) provide adequate and timely notice by correctly completing certain documentation. The injunction also required the state to supervise the city and make sure it met the obligations of the injunction. On January 13, 2005, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the part of the December order in which the court concluded that 8 N.Y.C.R.R. § 387.8(a)(2)(i)(a) did not confer a privately enforceable right of action and that plaintiffs’ claim under New York Social Services Law § 133 was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court granted the motion on February 14, 2005. Final judgement was entered on December 14, 2005; the court also granted the plaintiffs declaratory judgment.

Both the state and the city appealed the permanent injunction to the Second Circuit on January 12, 2006, but the city dropped its appeal. On October 31, 2007, the Second Circuit reversed the district court, ruling that the state did not have a non-delegable duty to administer the decentralized Medicaid and Food Stamp programs, the state’s efforts in supervising the city since the permanent injunction was issued were adequate, and the district court exceeded its authority by issuing a permanent injunction in light of New York State’s affirmative supervisory steps it had taken to assure compliance. In a series of stipulations and orders from January 31, 2007 to July 22, 2011, the City of New York agreed to pay a total of $2,920,675.94 to plaintiffs for attorney fees and costs sought; the state agreed to pay a further $639,918.98.

Jonathan Pines, New York, New York, for the City Defendants. William H. Bristow, III, Assistant Attorney General, New York, New York, for the State Defendants. Opinion MEMORANDUM AND ORDER PAULEY, J. *1 On December 21, 1998, this Court received an ex parte application from Mr. Posr A. Posr, executive director of an organization known as Pro Se Views, seeking permission to videotape and televise further courtroom proceedings in this civil action Mr. Posr submitted a second ex parte application on December 22, 1998 requesting the same relief. Copies of both applications were promptly circulated to all counsel of record. On December 23, 1998, Mr. Posr and the parties were given an opportunity to be heard on this matter. For the following reasons, the application is denied. Background On December 16, 1998, plaintiffs commenced this action against the City of New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and several other defendants challenging the procedures through which the City provides food stamps and other public assistance to needy individuals. The complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief on behalf of a proposed class of all New York City residents who have or will apply for such assistance. An evidentiary hearing concerning plaintiffs’ application for preliminary injunctive relief is scheduled to begin on January 14, 1999. Discussion Local Civil Rule 1.8 is entitled “Photographs, Radio, Recordings, Television” and states: No one other than court officials engaged in the conduct of court business shall bring any camera, transmitter, receiver, portable telephone or recording device into any courthouse or its environs without written permission of a judge of that court. Environs as used in this rule shall include the entire United States Courthouse property, including all entrances to and exits from the buildings. S.D.N.Y. Local R. 1.8 This Court has complete discretion to permit or reject television coverage of its proceedings. See Williams v. New York City Police Department, 1997 WL 361974, at *1 (S.D.N.Y.1997); Sigmon v. Parker Chapin Flattau Klimpl, 937 F.Supp. 335, 336 (S.D.N.Y.1996); Katzman v. Victoria’s Secret Catalogue, 923 F.Supp. 580, 584–85 (S.D.N.Y.1996). In his ex parte submissions to the Court, Mr. Posr avers that he successfully videotaped an oral argument before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and caused that videotape to be televised on public television; that he is a member of a registered press organization; and that further proceedings in this action should be televised because they concern a matter of public importance. When he appeared in open court on December 23, Mr. Posr conceded that he has never videotaped an evidentiary hearing or trial. In response to questioning by the Court, Mr. Posr described how he proposed to operate a camera and microphones in my courtroom Mr. Posr explained that he would stand behind a single camera and manually operate it in the well of the courtroom directly across from the witness box. A microphone would be placed at the judge’s bench, at the witness stand and at the attorney’s podium. Reynolds v. Giuliani *2 On further questioning by the Court, Mr. Posr explained that employing only one camera, he would pan from counsel at the podium, to the witness on the stand, and ultimately to the bench—depending on who was speaking. The distance from the witness stand to where Mr. Posr would operate his camera manually is only approximately 16 feet. From that vantage point (which incidently is exactly where a law clerk typically sits), Mr. Posr would be required to pan his camera nearly 180 degrees as he alternately focused on the judge, the witness and counsel—a task akin to videotaping a tennis match from mid-court. Counsel for the New York City defendants oppose Mr. Posr’s application. In a letter to the Court dated December 30, 1998, the City defendants state that Mr. Posr’s efforts to videotape the upcoming evidentiary hearing and any subsequent proceedings could prove distracting to witnesses and counsel. The Court agrees. Plaintiffs’ counsel has intimated that her clients are unhappy with the prospect of having to testify about their plights on public television. Conclusion Mr. Posr’s admitted inexperience in videotaping trial court proceedings, coupled with the physical dimensions and spacial constraints of my courtroom, dictate that his application be denied Mr. Posr’s presence would be exceedingly conspicuous and unduly distracting. Given the intrusive way in which Mr. Posr plans to station himself in the courtroom, the Court is concerned","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] January 7, 1999 | U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ||| New York City ||| December 16, 1998 ||| January 14, 1999 ||||| December 23, 1999 | ||| [redacted] On January 7, 1999, the plaintiffs in this case brought this action against the City and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, alleging that the City's procedures for providing food stamps and other public assistance to needy individuals violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.

GEORGE PATAKI, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of New York, ANTONIA C. NOVELLO, in her official capacity as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, JAMES STONE, in his official capacity as Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health, THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, AND THE NEW YORK STATE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH, Defendants. COMPLAINT Plaintiff Disability Advocates, Inc., a New York protection and advocacy agency, sues the defendants on behalf of residents in large New York City adult homes and those at risk of entry into such homes and alleges: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131, 12132, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities, including those with mental illness. Similarly, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. <unk>794, provides that no person with a disability, including those with mental illness, shall: “solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” Doc #:NY6:510626.4 2. Further, Title II of the ADA requires that “a public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” See 28 C.F.R. <unk>35.130(d) (emphasis added). 3. In the landmark decision Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the U.S. Supreme Court held that these provisions of law are violated when a state places people with mental illness in “unjustified isolation,” and that a person with mental illness may sue the state for failing to place him or her “in the most integrated setting appropriate to [his or her] needs.” 4. This action is brought in furtherance of these mandates. Rather than comply with these laws, New York State officials and agencies responsible for the care and treatment of people with mental illness (and hospitals they license and supervise) discharge thousands of these people from psychiatric hospitals to equally oppressive, large and isolated institution-like settings commonly referred to as “adult homes,” which offer little or no rehabilitative treatment to promote integration into the community. As chronicled in an April 2002 Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles in the New York Times, abuse, neglect, negligent supervision, inadequate medical care and chaos pervade many of these adult homes – referred to as “psychiatric flophouses” – in New York City. Clifford J. Levy, For Mentally Ill, Death and Misery, N Y. TIMES, Apr. 28, 2002, <unk>1, at 1; Levy, Here, Life Is Squalor and Chaos, N Y.

Ironically, people with mental illness are often left to languish in these adult homes while equally affordable and more humane residential settings exist and/or could be made available. Such residential settings are more integrated and more appropriately meet the needs of thousands of people with mental illness currently residing in adult homes. 6. By this action, Plaintiff seeks an end to New York State’s practice of knowingly placing and maintaining individuals with serious mental illness in these substandard adult homes rather than in superior, more integrated residential settings already existing in this State. 7. In addition, permitting such substandard conditions in adult homes constitutes discrimination pursuant to Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by providing housing and services to those with mental illness in a manner not commensurate with the quality of housing and services directed primarily at individuals without mental illness. PARTIES 8. Plaintiff Disability Advocates, Inc. (“Disability Advocates” or “Plaintiff”), is a not-for-profit corporation, authorized to practice law under New York State law. Disability Advocates is an authorized protection and advocacy agency under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (“PAIMI”), 42 U.S.C. <unk>10801 et seq.

The law, the Trade Act of 1974, creates a Trade Adjustment Assistance program for workers who lose their jobs to foreign competition. Workers are to receive training so they can obtain a job that pays at least 80 percent of what the workers made previously. However, the DOL instead has approved remedial English classes for thousands of Hispanic workers despite the fact that these classes do nothing to help the workers learn new job skills. The DOL’s own Office of Inspector General documented the waste of more than $100 million federal taxpayer dollars on ineffective English classes in El Paso, Texas, alone. As a result, Hispanic workers who lose good jobs to overseas competition often end up in minimum wage jobs that they could have obtained even without the DOL’s remedial education classes. “The Department of Labor’s mismanagement of trade laws that require retraining of U.S. workers has hurt not only thousands of workers and their families but also the entire economy of El Paso, Texas – the city hit hardest by NAFTA layoffs,” said Guillermo Glenn, director of ATF. Added attorney Carmen Rodriguez of Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, “First the workers are stunned by sudden job loss, and then the promise of job training turns into a bureaucratic nightmare and no real job skills. The so-called ‘training benefits’ are of no benefit at all to Spanish-speaking workers.” The suit alleges that the DOL violates the law by: 1) allowing state agencies, including the Texas Workforce Commission, to approve incomplete training; 2) allowing state agencies to renounce Congress’ 80 percent wage replacement objective for all Trade Act training; and 3) making on-the-job training – which the law requires as much as possible – an option that state agencies may ignore. Records show that the DOL pays roughly $8,000 to train each worker in other states, but only $2,000 to train the average worker along the U.S.-Mexico border. A high proportion of training for workers with limited English skills consists exclusively of English as a Second Language courses, which cannot by themselves provide the job skills that workers need to return to the workforce. Spanish-speaking workers need bilingual skills training that provides the vocational skills needed to work in a specific occupation. Bilingual training is used throughout the United States to train Englishproficient workers in occupations ranging from truck driving and phlebotomy to precision machining. Yet the DOL persists in approving cheaper English classes as a substitute for vocational training. “The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is questionable enough as far as its effectiveness in helping displaced workers,” said Michael Kirkpatrick, an attorney for Public Citizen who is representing ATF. “But now the agency charged with implementing the law has blown it. Congress should know how incompetently the DOL manages these training programs as it considers accelerating outsourcing of U.S. jobs as part of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.” ATF seeks an order directing the DOL to adopt policies that comply with Congress’ statute, to enforce those policies and to provide adequate training for workers who were denied it, particularly workers who need bilingual skills training to remain productive members of the U.S. labor force.

The plaintiffs alleged that Missouri Department of Social Services and MO HealthNet denied medically necessary treatment to Medicaid beneficiaries with Hepatitis C, discriminated against similarly situated Medicaid beneficiaries, failed to provide ""reasonably prompt"" treatment, violated due process, and violated the American with Disabilities Act. In November 2017, MO HealthNet modified its policies and the case was dismissed as moot without prejudice.

Case No. 2:16-cv-04273 I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This case challenges the policies of the Missouri Department of Social Services which result in the denial of medically necessary treatment for Plaintiffs J.E.M., J.L.M., and numerous other Medicaid beneficiaries infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a serious and communicable disease that can cause severe liver scarring, liver damage, cancer, and death. 2. This case is filed on behalf of enrollees in the Missouri Medicaid program, also known as MO HealthNet, who are infected with HCV, who meet the FDA’s standards for coverage of curative Hepatitis C medication, but who are denied coverage for medically necessary treatment because of the Defendants’ arbitrary and improper policies that restrict treatment only to the sickest beneficiaries.

Because of his Hepatitis C, J.E.M. has experienced a significant decrease in energy and motivation. He also experiences anxiety regarding his disease’s progress and the potential fatal effect of the infection, which recently took the life of his father. His doctor has prescribed Harvoni®, ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (“Harvoni”), a drug that will likely cure his Hepatitis C. MO HealthNet denied his prior authorization request for Harvoni. 7. Plaintiff J.L.M. is a 36-year-old Medicaid recipient living with her two teenage daughters in Foley, Missouri. She has Hepatitis C and also fibromyalgia. Because of her Hepatitis C, J.L.M.’s underlying fibromyalgia pain and fatigue has worsened. She also experiences continual anxiety and fear that she may inadvertently infect her children. Her doctor has prescribed Epclusa®, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (“Epclusa”), a drug which will likely cure her Hepatitis C. MO HealthNet denied her prior authorization request for Epclusa. Defendants 8. Defendant Brian Kinkade is the Director of the Missouri Department of Social Services (“DSS”) and, as such, is responsible for the administration and implementation of laws concerning the social welfare of the people of the State of Missouri, including the Medicaid program.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ET AL., Defendants. CIVIL ACTION NO. 7:16-CV-00054-O PLAINTIFFS’ RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION BY JEANETTE DRIEVER, ET AL. In conjunction with moving to intervene, ECF No. 101, three female prisoners contend that the Court should enjoin Defendants from transferring male prisoners to Federal Medical Center Carswell (“Carswell”), a federal prison hospital for women. ECF No. 102. As the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the requested relief, the motion should be denied. I. FACTS Jeanette Driever, Charlsa Little, and Rhonda Fleming (collectively, “movants”), are inmates at Carswell, “the only full service hospital in the country for chronically ill women who have been convicted of federal crimes.” Betty Brink, Death by Indifference, FORT WORTH WEEKLY (Apr. 18, 2012), available at https:// www.fwweekly.com/2012/04/18/death-by-indifference/. The inmates allege that, recently, Carswell began accepting male prisoners who self-identify as women. ECF No. 101 at 2–4. Movants assert that the transfers are “[b]ased on the Obama Administration’s directives on sexual identity,” ECF No. 102 at 7. And, on December 30, 2016, they requested that the Court grant “the same relief” that was awarded to Plaintiffs, to Plaintiffs’ Response to Motion for Preliminary Injunction by Jeanette Driever, et al. wit: an injunction preventing the housing of both sexes in the same prison Id. at 8. Before movants sought injunctive relief, however, Defendants filed a notice of appeal, ECF No. 88 (Oct. 20, 2016), and have proceeded to challenge the breadth of the Court’s injunction before the Fifth Circuit. See Defendants-Appellants’ Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal, Texas, et al., v. United States of America, et al., No. 1611534 (5th Cir Nov. 23, 2016). II. LEGAL STANDARD “A federal district court and a federal court of appeals should not attempt to assert jurisdiction over a case simultaneously.” Henton v. Stephens, No. 3:14-cv-345, 2016 WL 6125454, at *1 (S.D Tex Oct. 20, 2016) (citing Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982)). The filing of a notice of appeal deprives the district court of jurisdiction to hear matters connected to the appeal. Procter Gamble Co v. Amway Corp., 280 F.3d 519, 524 (5th Cir. 2002); Erly Indus v. M/V CHADA NAREE, 226 F.3d 641 (5th Cir. 2000) (“A district court is divested of jurisdiction upon the filing of notice of appeal with respect to any matters involved in the appeal.”) (per curiam). III. ARGUMENT A district court lacks “the power to alter the status of the case” in the manner that the movants request. Dayton Ind Sch. Dist v. U.S. Mineral Products Co., 906 F.2d 1059, 1063 (5th Cir. 1990). As the Court is well aware, Plaintiffs have sought to uphold longstanding principles protecting the privacy and dignity of both sexes in intimate areas at educational facilities and workplaces. See, e.g., ECF No. 90 at 11. These principles are evidenced in case law and further protected by statutory text Id. at 15–27. And they are overruled by Defendants’ new rule, which turns “workplaces and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment” without basis in law or common sense. ECF No. 6 at 3. The Court properly concluded that the law does not prohibit schools and Plaintiffs’ Response to Motion for Preliminary Injunction by Jeanette Driever, et al. employers from maintaining sex-designated intimate areas. ECF No. 58; ECF No. 86; ECF No. 100. The scope of the Court’s injunction is now on appeal. See DefendantsAppellants’ Motion for Partial Stay Pending Appeal, supra, at 9–21. Yet movants ask the Court to revisit precisely that question. They request that the Court rule that the injunction applies to the housing of inmates in federal prisons, and enjoin federal officials from transferring prisoners to facilities designated for the opposite sex. “Given the current posture of this case,” movant’s requested relief, “would, if granted, alter the status of the case as it rests before the Fifth Circuit and constitute an action outside this Court’s jurisdiction.” Henton, No. 3:14-CV-345, 2016 WL 6125454","<pad>[ENTITYCHAIN] April 2018 | Federal Medical Center Carswell | U.S. District Court | Northern District of Texas ||| October 2018 ||| November 2018 | 5th Circuit ||| January 2019 ||| March 2019 .<n>In April 2018, three female inmates at the federal prison hospital for women filed a class action suit against the federal government, alleging that Carswell was violating the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by housing female inmates in the same prison as male inmates.

CASE NO. 3:17-cv-05714-BHS-JRC REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION NOTED FOR: August 31, 2018 WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS et al., 15 Defendants. 16 This 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 civil rights matter has been referred to Magistrate Judge J. Richard 17 Creatura pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <unk>636 (b)(1)(A) and (B) and Local Magistrate Judge Rules MJR 18 1, MJR 3, and MJR 4. 19 Plaintiff Nonnie M. Lotusflower (a.k.a. Nathan Robert Goninan) argues that defendants’ 20 policy regarding gender confirmation surgery is an unconstitutional blanket ban on its face and is 21 also a de facto blanket ban because defendants’ expert Dr. Stephen Levine, the doctor retained to 22 evaluate plaintiff, allegedly believes gender confirmation surgery is never appropriate for 23 incarcerated transgender individuals. However, Dr. Levine has not yet evaluated plaintiff and 1 plaintiff has not yet been denied gender confirmation surgery. Thus, plaintiff asks the Court to 2 grant summary judgment based on a medical opinion that has not yet been rendered. As such, 3 plaintiff has not carried her burden entitling her to summary judgment. Therefore, the Court 4 recommends plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 48) be denied. BACKGROUND and PROCEDURAL HISTORY Plaintiff initially filed this action pro se in September of 2017. Dkt. 1. Plaintiff is a 7 transgender woman who has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Dkt. 8. She argues that, 8 though she was receiving gender affirming therapy when she was incarcerated in Oregon, she 9 has since been transferred to the custody of the Washington Department of Corrections (“DOC”). 10 Id. She argues that the DOC policy governing treatment of gender dysphoria contains a blanket 11 ban on all gender confirmation surgery for transgender prisoners, even if such surgery is deemed 12 medically necessary Id. She argues she has received recommendations from medical experts 13 stating gender confirmation surgery is medically necessary for her, but she argues that it is 14 inaccessible because of the policy Id. She further alleges that the DOC maintained this policy 15 even though the DOC knew that individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria have a greater risk 16 of self-harm and other injury if they are denied gender confirmation surgery when it is medically 17 necessary Id. She requests that the Court enjoin Defendants from interfering with her medically 18 necessary treatment, enjoin Defendants to provide her with adequate medical care including 19 gender confirmation surgery, require defendants to house plaintiff in female housing after she 20 receives surgery, and declare that the DOC’s policy regarding gender dysphoria is 21 unconstitutional both on its face and as applied Id. at p. 9. After receiving representation, plaintiff’s counsel filed a motion for partial summary 23 judgment, arguing that defendants’ gender dysphoria policy is unconstitutional on its face 1 because it was a blanket ban on gender confirmation surgery, precluding surgery without any 2 consideration for medical necessity. Dkt. 48. Defendants responded, arguing the policy as it 3 stands provides for gender confirmation surgery in cases of medical necessity. Dkt. 52. Plaintiff 4 replied, noting that the policy at the time referenced the DOC’s “Gender Dysphoria Protocol,” 5 which still prohibited “cosmetic or elective surgical procedures for the purpose of reassignment.” In light of this, the Court ordered the parties to file supplemental briefing, addressing 8 whether the protocol does in fact prohibit all gender confirmation surgery. Dkt. 60. Defendants’ 9 supplemental materials stated that, even under that protocol, they would not necessarily have 10 denied plaintiff’s gender confirmation surgery, and that the DOC has since revised the protocol 11 to explicitly allow for gender confirmation surgery in cases of medical necessity Dkt. 61; Dkt. 12 62-1, p.4. Plaintiffs responded, noting that the DOC did not revise the protocol until five days 13 after the Court ordered supplemental briefing. Dkt. 63. They also argue a de facto ban on gender 14 confirmation surgery is in effect because Dr. Levine, the doctor retained to evaluate plaintiff for 15 surgery, “has [already] concluded that gender reassignment surgery ‘is always an elective 16 procedure.’” Dkt. 63, p. 4 (quoting Norsworthy v. Beard <unk>87 F. Supp. 17 2015)) (in that case, also involving a transgender prisoner seeking gender confirmation surgery, 18 Dr. Levine provided testimony about gender affirming therapy in the prison context).

COMPLAINT Plaintiffs Cable News Network, Inc. and Abilio James (“Jim”) Acosta, for their complaint against Defendants Donald J. Trump, John F. Kelly, William Shine, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the United States Secret Service, Randolph Alles, and John Doe, allege, by and through their attorneys, as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. Plaintiff Jim Acosta has been a journalist for more than two decades. For more than five years, Acosta has been CNN’s national political correspondent and, since January 2018, he has been the network’s chief White House correspondent. Acosta has covered the White House since 2012 and, since 2013, has possessed press credentials—often called a “hard pass”—that allow him regular and unescorted access to the White House and White House briefings. He is widely reputed as a diligent and thorough reporter for one of the nation’s most respected and widely watched networks. 2. But on November 7, 2018, Defendants revoked Acosta’s White House credentials because, in the President’s own words, Acosta failed to “treat the White House with respect” at a White House press briefing. This severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting—an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the President’s point of view. 3. While CNN and Acosta have been favorite targets of abuse by the administration, the President’s criticism has been directed at other news organizations too. The President has actively criticized and discredited any journalist or media outlet he believes might report something he considers negative. As the President explained to Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes: “You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you.” 4. And the revocation of Acosta’s credentials is only the beginning; as the President explained, there “could be others also” who get their credentials revoked. 5. The Framers of our Constitution embraced a “profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.” N.Y. Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964). The President lacks the authority to quash “[t]he sort of robust political debate encouraged by the First Amendment”— debate that is “bound to produce speech that is critical of those who hold public office.” Hustler Magazine, Inc v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 51 (1988). That is why the D.C. Circuit has been clear that “the protection afforded newsgathering under the first amendment guarantee of freedom of the press requires that... access [to White House press facilities] not be denied arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons.” Sherrill v. Knight, 569 F.2d 124, 129 (D.C Cir. 1977). And “notice... of the factual bases for denial [of access to White House press facilities] with an opportunity to rebut is a minimum prerequisite for ensuring that the denial is... [not] based on arbitrary or less than compelling reasons.” Id. at 131. 6. Plaintiffs bring this action to enforce this constitutional commitment, restore Acosta’s well-deserved press credentials, and ensure that the press remains free to question the government and to report the business of the nation to the American people. PARTIES 7. Plaintiff Abilio James (“Jim”) Acosta is chief White House correspondent for Cable News Network, Inc. (“CNN”) and is a member of the White House Correspondents’ Association (“WHCA”).

The district court found that Detroit's schools were illegally segregated, in part because of decisions made by the school board to create and maintain and segregated system. The district court found that a Detroit-only remedy would be insufficient, and ordered a busing plan that would have affected students in city schools and 53 largely white suburban school districts, but the Supreme Court rejected this plan and a Detroit-only remedy was implemented.","433 F.2d 897 (1970) Ronald BRADLEY et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v.

Before PHILLIPS, Chief Judge, and EDWARDS and PECK, Circuit Judges. PHILLIPS, Chief Judge. This case involves an effort by the Detroit Board of Education, as constituted on April 7, 1970, to effect a more balanced ratio of Negro and white students in twelve senior high schools. This effort was thwarted by an Act of the Michigan Legislature, Act No. 48, effective July 7, 1970, a copy of which is made an appendix to this opinion. The appeal is under 28 U.S.C. <unk>1292 (a) from the interlocutory order of the District Court entered September 3, 1970, which, among other things, refused to grant a preliminary injunction.

The defendants are the Governor of Michigan, the Attorney General of Michigan, the Acting State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Board of Education, the Board of Education of the City of Detroit, three members of the latter board,[1] and the Superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools. On April 7, 1970, the Detroit Board of Education adopted a plan which provided for changes in twelve high school attendance zones, designed to effect a more balanced ratio of Negro and white students at the senior high school level. The plan was applicable to twelve of the twenty-one high schools in Detroit that serve particular neighborhood or geographical areas. The April 7 plan was to take effect over a three-year period, applying initially to those students entering the tenth grade in September 1970 at the beginning of 1970-71 school year. In successive stages the eleventh grade was to have been affected at the opening of the 1971-72 school year, and the twelfth grade at the beginning of the 1972-73 school year. Dr. Norman Drachler, the Superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools, testified that the plan was adopted after an extended study. He described the purpose of the plan as follows: ""Q What was the purpose of the plan as adopted? ""A The purpose of the plan was, in addition to complying with the regulations of the State Act 244, to bring about a decentralized school system within the city which would allow for the election of regional boards which would bring about greater participation at the local level by the community. That it would undoubtedly, in the opinion of most of us, add towards the improvement of quality education, quality integrated education insofar as possible. 899*899 ""The Board of Education has, as long as I can recall, always accepted the premise that the task of improving education is a very complex one in a large city, but they have consistently held to the premise that wherever possible, wherever reasonably we can bring about integration in the process of developing our educational program, that this would enhance the opportunity of all children, black and white, both in terms of their educational achievement as well as their potential as responsible citizens in a democracy. ""So in this plan the Board saw an opportunity, the majority, that we could at the high school level in some twelve high schools bring about over a three-year period a certain amount of integration although it involved only the movement of some ten to twelve thousand children over the three-year period, nevertheless, that is, the transfer of 12,000 children in three years — nevertheless these children were in twelve schools which involved about 35,000 students, which is over 50 per cent of our total high school enrollment.
