IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO Civil Action No. 18-cv-02593 MICKEY HOWARD Plaintiff, v. THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER, COLORADO Plaintiff Mickey Howard, by and through his counsel, Rebecca Wallace and Mark Silverstein of the AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION FOUNDATION OF COLORADO, respectfully alleges for his Complaint and Jury Demand as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. In the City and County of Denver (Denver), when a judge sets a monetary bond, Denver will release the defendant upon payment of that bond only if the defendant also pays a $50 bond fee. That means that even if the defendant can pay the monetary bond, Denver will not release the defendant if he cannot also pay the additional bond fee. Plaintiff Mickey Howard was a victim of this practice. In June of this year, he was arrested for alleged violations of municipal ordinances. The Denver judge set a $10 cash bond for his release, a sum Mr. Howard could pay Mr. Howard could not, however, pay the additional $50 bond fee that Denver’s policy required as an additional condition of his release. As a result, Mr. Howard spent four additional nights in jail until the Colorado Freedom Fund, a non-profit bail fund, paid the required fee and secured his release. While out on bond, Mr. Howard fulfilled all obligations related to his case, and Denver ultimately dismissed all of the charges against him Mr. Howard brings this case to seek compensation and to spur Denver to end the oppressive and irrational practices described herein.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FREDERICK SIMMS Plaintiff, v. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al., Defendants. MEMORANDUM OPINION Pending before the Court is the Motion for Preliminary Injunction of Plaintiff Frederick Simms (“Simms”). Plaintiff’s car was seized by the Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”) on May 29, 2011, when he was accused of weapons violations. Plaintiff was acquitted of all charges in December 2011; nevertheless, the District of Columbia (“District”) continues to maintain possession of the car in the hope of eventually getting title to it by prevailing in civil forfeiture litigation. The forfeiture proceedings were not commenced until June 1, 2012 and according to the District, could last another year, until June In the nearly seven months following his acquittal, Mr. Simms has been unable to challenge the validity of the initial seizure and continuing retention of his vehicle prior to judgment in the forfeiture proceeding, nor will he have any opportunity to do so for the next year while those proceedings are pending. He contends that the District’s failure to provide him with the opportunity for a prompt post-deprivation hearing to challenge the seizure and subsequent retention of his car, prior to judgment in his civil forfeiture case, violates his Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights.

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that municipal courts cannot have, or appear to have, an independent interest, such as a financial interest, in obtaining convictions. 4.

The Plaintiffs—four individuals who were cited for various infractions by the City—challenge that practice as unconstitutional.

The plaintiff alleged that the Dodge City's wealth-based post-arrest detention scheme violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and a declaration that the City's wealth-based detention practices were unlawful. The parties agreed to settle that the City would be enjoined from holding an arrestee in custody after a non-warrant arrest on the basis of inability to post bond.

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS LAWRENCE J. MARTINEZ, et al., Plaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF DODGE CITY, and FORD COUNTY Defendant. Case No. 15-CV-9344 (Class Action) CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Introduction This case is about Dodge City’s wealth-based post-arrest detention scheme, which operates to jail some of Dodge City’s poorest residents solely because they cannot pay an arbitrary amount of money. Named Plaintiff Lawrence Martinez was arrested yesterday and is currently imprisoned in the county jail solely because he is too poor to pay the amount of money generically set by the fixed “bail schedule” used by Dodge City. In Dodge City, arrestees face two different outcomes depending on their wealth status. Wealthy arrestees purchase their freedom by paying an arbitrary amount set by the bail schedule. Poor arrestees are stuck behind bars for 48 hours simply because they cannot afford to pay the City’s pre-determined sum of money. The amount of the bond is fixed and predetermined for each offense, ranging from $250–$2,500. Those arrestees who are too poor to afford several hundred dollars remain in jail because of their poverty for at least two days, at which time Dodge City typically releases them for free
AGREEMENT TO SETTLE ALL EQUITABLE CLAIMS Plaintiff Lawrence J. Martinez (""Plaintiff'), individually, and by and through counsel, and the City of Dodge City (""Defendant""), individually, and by and through counsel, for good and valuable consideration, enter into this Agreement as a full and final settlement of the equitable claims in the lawsuit styled Lawrence Martinez, et al v.

WHEREAS, Plaintiff filed the Lawsuit seeking equitable relief and damages while he was in the custody of the Defendant after an arrest for disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, alleging that the Defendant had a policy which unlawfully kept him in the custody of the Defendant in the Ford County Jail because he could not afford to post a cash bond pursuant to an established schedule for the alleged offense; and WHEREAS, the Defendant denies such allegations and any liability for the claims asserted in the Lawsuit and described herein, and denies liability to the Plaintiff for any claim arising out ofhis arrest on October 20, 2015; and WHEREAS, the Plaintiff and the Defendant enter into this Agreement to resolve the equitable claims in the

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' practice of holding people in the EBRPP without bail violates the Due Process and Equal Protection rights of people who are poor and Black. The case is now closed."
17,CJ-MD-0001,"On January 19, 2006, a death-sentenced inmate of the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center in Baltimore, Maryland filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Maryland Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiff objected to the three-drug cocktail (sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in Maryland's lethal injections. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's lethal injection procedures arbitrarily and unnecessarily created a grave risk that he would suffer extreme pain during his execution, thus violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

The plaintiff also filed a similar complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleging that the defendants failed to follow Maryland law because the execution protocol had not been adopted under the Maryland Administrative Procedures Act (MAPA). 

On December 19, 2006 the Maryland Court of Appeals invalidated the Maryland execution protocols until such time as they were properly adopted under MAPA or exempted from that requirement by an act of the Maryland General Assembly. On January 29, 2007, two bills were introduced in the Maryland General Assembly, one that would exempt the death penalty protocols from the MAPA requirement and one that would repeal the death penalty in the state. The judge agreed to stay the proceedings of this case pending the outcome of the legislation. According to the status report on March 14, 2011, all executions in Maryland had been stayed until the proper administrative regulations were adopted. On August 16, 2012 this case was administratively closed. In May 2013 the Maryland legislature repealed the death penalty for all future convictions and in December 2014 Governor O'Malley commuted the death sentences of the four remaining death-row inmates to life without the possibility of parole.

Saar et al Assigned to:","On February 3, 2006, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSC) alleging that the DPSC violated the Constitution by failing to provide adequate medical and mental health care to inmates at the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center (MAC) in Baltimore City, Maryland. The plaintiff alleged that the MAC's lack of adequate medical care violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. On March 14, 2011, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the defendants had violated their constitutional rights. The court also granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction."
18,CJ-MD-0006,"In response to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act, which created, among other things, the “Paycheck Protection Program.”  Under this program, small business owners could apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration; if they later certified that all of the loan funds had been used for qualifying expenses, the loan would be forgiven.  

The SBA’s rules disqualified many small business owners with criminal records.  Several small business owners brought this lawsuit against the SBA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenging this criminal record exclusion.  On June 29, the court granted a preliminary injunction requiring the SBA to extend the application deadline for the named plaintiffs from June 30 to July 21, 2020.  The following week, Congress passed follow-up legislation extending the deadline for all applicants to August 8, 2020. 

As of July 29, 2020, further developments in the litigation are pending.","

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AMARILLO DIVISION RACHEL McKEE and LONETA JACKSON Plaintiffs, v. CITY OF AMARILLO, TEXAS Defendant. COMPLAINT – CLASS ACTION Plaintiffs Rachel McKee and Loneta Jackson by and through undersigned counsel, bring this Class Action Complaint against Defendant City of Amarillo, Texas (“the City”), on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated and, as grounds therefore, state and allege as follows: INTRODUCTION1 1. This case involves a deliberate choice by the City to prioritize the collection of fines, fees and costs revenue over the Constitutional rights of its residents by instituting a modern day debtor’s prison. 1 Plaintiffs make the allegations in this complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which they have had personal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters alleged. 2.

Under this practice, known as “pay or lay,” no consideration was given to individual defendants’ financial circumstances and no alternative methods of punishment were considered before sending people to jail for not paying their fines. 3. “

The plaintiffs alleged that the state was violating the federal civil rights of children by failing to protect them from violence, neglect, abuse, and neglect. The court ordered the state to monitor and report to the plaintiffs on its progress in complying with the terms of its monitoring agreement. The monitoring agreement was terminated in December 2013 and the case was closed in April 2014."
31,CW-NY-0001,"Plaintiffs, children in the custody of the New York City Child Welfare Administration (""CWA""), and children who, while not in the custody of CWA, are or will be at risk of abuse or neglect and whose status is known or should be known to CWA, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against both the city and state for systematic deficiencies that jeopardized their well-being. The case was filed on December 13, 1995, and the parties reached to two separate settlement agreements, one with the city and one with the state, on December 2, 1988. The plaintiffs returned to court in January 2001, seeking an order directing the state to comply with specific terms of the state settlement agreement. The court found that the state had acted with insufficient diligence in implementing the information management system, and therefore extended the terms of the agreement in this area and directed that the plaintiffs receive semi-annual reports. The defendants provided a January 2017 report to show that they were continuing to develop, implement, and update their information systems for child welfare needs. A year later, the court ended its supervision of the portions of the settlement that it had retained jurisdiction to enforce. ","

39,DR-DC-0009,"On December 2, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (“Amtrak”) for allegedly violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165, by failing to make its intercity rail stations accessible to individuals with disabilities by July 26, 2020, as required by the Act. The case was never properly docketed or assigned to a judge, however, because the government announced its settlement with Amtrak on the same day. The settlement agreement required Amtrak to design at least 135 accessible stations, complete construction at 90 stations, and be in the process of constructing at least 45 stations within 10 years of the settlement date. The agreement also required Amtrak to train staff on ADA compliance, establish a monitor-approved process for managing ADA complaints, and create a settlement fund to compensate individuals who were harmed by Amtrak’s most inaccessible stations. The settlement was monitored by the Federal Railroad Administration and the Department of Justice. ","

Amtrak denies these allegations and asserts that it is, and has been, committed to complying with the ADA and to accommodating individuals with disabilities, but it enters into this Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) voluntarily in order to continue in good faith to devote significant resources to improve transportation services to passengers with disabilities as it has for several years, rather than in litigation. 2.

The DOJ alleged that nearly two hundred children with disabilities were unnecessarily segregated from their communities and the general population by the State, which had placed them in nursing homes. The DOJ sought an injunction requiring the State to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131-12134, which, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of disabled individuals, and mandates that their rehabilitative and medical needs be provided in a manner that enables disabled individuals to be independent and integrated members of the community.

The Honorable Pamela Jo Bondi Attorney General for the State of Florida Florida Department of Legal Affairs PL-01 The Capitol Tallahassee, FL 32399-1050 Re: United States’ Investigation of the State of Florida’s Service System for Children with Disabilities Who Have Medically Complex Conditions, D.J No. 204-18-212 Dear Attorney General Bondi: We write to report the findings of the Civil Rights Division’s investigation of the State of Florida (the “State”) with respect to its system for delivering services and supports to children with disabilities, including those who have medically complex or medically fragile conditions.1 During our investigation, we assessed the State’s compliance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. <unk>12131-12134 (the “ADA”), as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), requiring public entities to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. Our review of the State’s system reveals that the State fails to meet its obligations under Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 35, by unnecessarily institutionalizing hundreds of children with disabilities in nursing facilities. Many children entering nursing facilities in the State are unnecessarily separated from their families and communities for years. With adequate services and supports, these children could live at home with their families or in other more integrated community settings. The State’s policies and practices also place numerous other children who have medically complex or medically fragile conditions at risk of placement in nursing facilities and other institutional settings. 1 For the purposes of this letter, the
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v. THE STATE OF FLORIDA, Defendant. COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Nearly two hundred children with disabilities in Florida are segregated unnecessarily in nursing facilities. Many young adults, who entered nursing facilities as children and grew up in these institutions, remain unnecessarily segregated from their communities.1 As a result of limitations on community-based services and deficient assessment and transition planning processes, the Institutionalized Children have spent their formative years separated from their families and apart from their communities, often very far from home. 2. Unnecessary institutionalization denies children the full opportunity to develop and maintain bonds with family and friends; impairs their ability to interact with peers without disabilities; and prevents them from experiencing many of the social and recreational activities that contribute to child development. 3. Other children with significant medical needs who reside in the community and receive 1 These institutionalized children and young adults are collectively referred to hereinafter as the ""Institutionalized Children."" private duty nursing or personal care services have also been harmed by policies and practices limiting community-based services.2 Many have faced repeated service reductions and lengthy and unduly burdensome recertification processes that place them at serious risk of unnecessary institutionalization. 4.. The United States brings this action against the State to enforce the rights of children with significant medical needs to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. The State discriminates against children and young adults with disabilities by administering and funding its programs and services for these individuals in a manner that has resulted in their prolonged and unnecessary institutionalization in nursing facilities or placed them at risk of such institutionalization in violation of title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of

45,DR-NY-0017,"Students sued the New York City Department of Education, the City of New York, and the chancellor of the New York City Department of Education to seek injunctive relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and New York state law. The student plaintiffs are either student in Staten Island District 75 schools or vulnerable to being sent to those schools, which are separated from New York City community schools. District 75 students receive their education in a restrictive setting where they are largely isolated from interactions with students who do not have disabilities.

No. 1.21-CV-00419 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. This civil rights class action lawsuit is brought against the New York City Department of Education (the “DOE”), the City of New York (the “City”), and Richard A. Carranza in his official capacity as the Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education (the “Chancellor”) (collectively “Defendants”) on behalf of a class of almost 2,000 Staten Island students with disabilities who are being educated in segregated and unequal public schools and classrooms in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), and the New York City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”). 2. The DOE funds and operates a wholly separate citywide school district based solely on disability known as District 75, which on Staten Island draws students from Staten Island public schools (“Staten Island District 75”). 3. The DOE created District 75 to serve as a separate school district for students with “moderate to severe disabilities,” including autism spectrum disorders, cognitive delays, sensory impairments, emotional disturbances, and multiple disabilities. 4. Over 25,000 students with disabilities attend District 75 schools citywide, and almost 2,000 students with disabilities attend Staten Island District 75 schools. 5. District 75 students are placed in a separate District 75 school (containing only District 75 students) or a co-located District 75 placement that is composed of classrooms located within a neighborhood DOE school. 6. Regardless of the District 75 setting in which students are placed, District 75 students spend all or almost all of their school day segregated from students without disabilities. 7. Students with disabilities placed in Staten Island District 75 schools could be educated successfully alongside students without disabilities in traditional, neighborhood public schools—also called “community schools”—in Staten Island, if provided with appropriate and legally required services and supports.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA DENICE BROWN, KAREN COMORATO, PATRICIA GREBLOSKI, and ANTOINETTE WHALEY, Plaintiffs, vs. FREE LIBRARY OF PHILADELPHIA, Defendant. COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Almost forty years after Congress mandated, through passage of the Rehabilitation Act, that institutions in receipt of federal funds could not discriminate on the basis of disability, defendant Free Library of Philadelphia (“Library”) has initiated and subsequently expanded a NOOK e-reading device lending program for older library patrons knowing that this device is completely inaccessible to its blind patrons. The Library has developed this lending program in an effort to “bridge the digital divide” between young and old patrons, but in doing so has needlessly exacerbated the “digital divide” between disabled and non-disabled library patrons. 2. Because today’s technology can offer blind individuals greater access to books, periodicals, and other materials that were traditionally available only in print, the Library has the statutory responsibility to ensure that it offers fully accessible e-reading technology. In the past, when libraries provided only print books, the libraries and their blind patrons had to rely on separate processes to obtain accessible versions of books. However, because e-books are not inherently visual, audible, or tactile, they provide individuals with an opportunity to access content through whatever methods are accessible to them. For the first time, there exist commercially available portable e-book readers that allow blind and sighted readers to use the same means of accessing the written word and get at the same content. By choosing to lend inaccessible devices, the Library discriminates against its blind patrons and segregate

COMPLAINT Plaintiff The Trustees of Princeton University (the “University”), by and through its attorneys, hereby complains against Defendants United States Department of Education (the “Department”), and its sub-agency the United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”), as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. The University brings this “reverse FOIA” action pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. <unk>701-706, the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, and the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. <unk>1905, to prevent the disclosure of certain confidential and commercially sensitive documents and information relating to the University’s undergraduate admissions program submitted to OCR in the course of an OCR compliance review. These materials fall generally into two categories: (1) documents and information about undergraduate applicants to the University (“Applicant Documents and Information”), and (2) documents and information about the University’s proprietary admissions processes (“Admissions Documents and Information”).

U.S. Department of Education, No. 1:16cv-02154-TSC (D.D.C.) (the “FOIA Action”). In that case, the plaintiff is seeking an order directing the Department to produce “all documents concerning the investigation of Princeton University in [OCR] Case Number 02-08-6002,” which includes the Applicant Documents and Information and Admissions Documents and Information. 3. The Applicant Documents and Information and Admissions Documents and Information are composed of sensitive applicant and admissions information and data that the University disclosed to OCR in response to specific requests by OCR during the compliance review, in good faith and in a spirit of voluntary cooperation to assist OCR.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF MARYLAND KNOW YOUR IX, a project of Advocates for Youth; COUNCIL OF PARENT ATTORNEYS AND ADVOCATES, INC.; GIRLS FOR GENDER EQUITY; and STOP SEXUAL ASSAULT IN SCHOOLS, Plaintiffs, -against- ELISABETH D. DEVOS, in her official capacity as United States Secretary of Education; KENNETH L. MARCUS, in his official capacity as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the United States Department of Education; and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, Defendants. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. Nearly half a century since the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), sexual harassment and assault remain a widespread problem for students of all ages. In 1972, Congress delegated to Defendant U.S. Department of Education (“ED” or “the Agency”) the power and responsibility to hold educational institutions receiving federal funds accountable for their responses to sex discrimination. Since 1997, the Agency has set standards governing the responsibilities of funding recipients to address sexual harassment, including sexual assault, and to take steps to prevent it. Under statutes imposing virtually identical obligations, schools that receive federal funding have also been required to respond to and prevent harassment and assault on the basis of race, national origin, and disability.1 Until now, 1 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”); Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“Title II”). Compare Title VI, 42 ED has imposed the same responsibilities on recipients to respond to harassment based on sex that it imposes on them to respond to harassment based on race, national origin, and disability. With the promulgation of the Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance regulation (RIN 1870-AA14, Docket No. ED2018-OCR-0064) (the “Rule”), however, the Agency has radically reduced the responsibility of schools to respond to complaints of sexual harassment and assault, creating an arbitrary and wholly unexplained disparity between its treatment of sex discrimination on the one hand, and race, national origin, and disability discrimination on the other. 2. Defendant ED Secretary Elisabeth DeVos has discarded decades of ED’s experience addressing sexual harassment and assault by promulgating regulatory provisions that sharply limit educational institutions’ obligations to respond to reports of sexual harassment and assault.

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated Title IX by failing to adequately address sexual harassment, assault, and discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, and disability. The parties filed a joint motion for summary judgment, which was denied by the Court."
56,ED-MI-0001,"On November 7, 2006, the people of Michigan approved by majority vote a statewide ballot initiative-Proposal 2-which amended the Michigan Constitution to prohibit discrimination or preferential treatment based on race or gender in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting in the State.  Both Proposal 2 and the University of Michigan's announcement that it would comply triggered litigation.  On November 15, 2012, the en banc Sixth Circuit held that Proposal 2 created a comparative structural burden that undermined the Equal Protection Clause (which the court called the ""political process"" argument).  Accordingly, the court found Proposal 2 unconstitutional.  On March 24, 2013, the Supreme Court granted review of the case.  Argument will be after the Court's summer break.  

On October 15, 2013 the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case.  In an opinion written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, the court reversed the Sixth Circuit.  There were two concurring opinions and a single dissent.  In his opinion Kennedy asserts that this is not a case about resolving the debate about racial preferences, but rather about whether it is constitutional for Michigan to allow its voters to decide the issue.  The court holds that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in this Court’s precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school admissions.

The court granted the school district's motion to dismiss, but the appeals court reversed and remanded, and the district court has since granted a preliminary injunction allowing plaintiff access to the boy's bathroom. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the school district's appeal in 2016, but later remanded the case after the Department of Education and Department of Justice withdrew their prior guidance on the issue. The case was remanded to the district court to determine whether the plaintiff's graduation from high school rendered the case moot. On May 22, 2018, the district court denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss. The plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on February 15, 2019, and a motion for summary judgment on March 26, 2019. On August 9, 2019, the court granted the summary judgment; the defendant appealed the case. The case is ongoing. ","

The plaintiffs alleged that the company violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by failing to provide adequate benefits to its older employees.

73,EE-CO-0069,"On September 29, 2011, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC"") brought this lawsuit against Beverage Distributors Company, LLC (""BDC"") on behalf of a visually impaired company employee in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (""ADA""). The EEOC claimed that BDC discriminated against the employee in violation of the ADA when it conditioned his employment on the results of a medical exam and subsequently refused to hire him as a night warehouse loader upon learning that he had a disability. The jury initially awarded the employee $132,347 in back pay, but it found that his damages should be reduced by $102,803 because he could have mitigated those damages by finding a comparable position. On December 9, 2013, the District Court vacated these findings and awarded injunctive relief, only to be reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit because of erroneous jury instructions. The 10th Circuit denied the EEOC's petition for rehearing in May 2015. The parties entered into a consent decree in December 2015, and the matter appears to be closed. ","

The complaint alleged that Sears violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 by failing to accommodate its disabled employees with reasonable accommodation after they were injured while working for Sears. The case was brought on behalf of a class of Sears employees with disabilities who lost their jobs because of Sears' inflexible one year leave policy that did not provide for reasonable accommodation and which instead provided for termination of employment, all in violation of the ADA. On August 2, 2005, the court granted the EEOC's motion to dismiss the case."

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER REINHARD, J. *1 On July 12, 2000, plaintiffs filed a complaint against Daimler–Chrysler Corporation (“DaimlerChrysler”) and the International Union of the United Auto Workers Local Union 1268. On November 30, 2000, DaimlerChrysler filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m), 41(b) and 12(b)(6), which has been fully briefed. On May 15, 2001, certain plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against DaimlerChrysler only, and DaimlerChrysler filed another motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(5), 4(m), 41(b) and 12(b)(6), essentially asserting the same grounds for dismissal. The thrust of DaimlerChrysler’s motion is that plaintiffs served the original complaint 121 days after it was filed, in violation of Rule 4(m)’s 120–day limitation. Plaintiffs argue their complaint has two dates stamped on it. One stamp shows “Received” with a date of July 12, 2000 underneath, and another stamp shows “Filed” with a date of July 13, 2000 underneath. Based on these stamped dates, according to plaintiffs, they calculated Rule 4(m)’s 120–day as starting from the “Filed” date of July 13, 2000, and served the complaint on November 10

U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission PRESS RELEASE 12-24-13 Bright Petroleum Inc. Sued by EEOC for Retaliation Food Market Terminated Manager Who Filed Discrimination Charge, Federal Agency Charges INDIANAPOLIS Bright Petroleum Inc. d/b/a The Bright Market violated federal law by retaliating against a manager who filed and refused to drop a discrimination charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency charged in a lawsuit it filed yesterday. The Bright Market is a food market and gas station located in Lawrenceburg, Ind. According to the EEOC's lawsuit, The Bright Market retaliated against Deli Manager Michelle Bunte by singling her out for heightened scrutiny after learning that she had filed an EEOC charge and would not drop her charge. The company then disciplined and terminated her. Taking adverse actions against an employee who complains of discrimination, files an EEOC charge or otherwise exercises her rights under Title VII violates the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The prohibition against retaliation applies regardless of the outcome of the underlying charge. The EEOC asserts that the company's actions were intentional and demonstrated a reckless indifference to the worker's federally protected rights. The EEOC filed suit (Case No. 4:13-cv-00205)

95,EE-MD-0151,"On August 28, 2017, six transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland Maryland contesting the President's ban on transgender service in the U.S. military. Judge Garbis initially granted a motion for a preliminary injunction in September, but this was later stayed in 2019 when the Supreme Court issued a stay of this nationwide injunction in two factually similar cases contesting the ban. 

This case changed dramatically in 2018 when the government altered its policy on transgender service in the military, eliminating an outright ban and instead putting new guidance on transgender men and women entering the service. Judge Russell, reassigned to the case in 2018, dissolved the preliminary injunction, saying that it was only meant to stay a complete ban on transgender service in the military. This also dismissed all claims against the 2017 outright ban as moot, and removed all plaintiffs that were already in the service and not seeking to join. Discovery is ongoing in the case.","

The EEOC sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e) and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. § 1981a) on behalf of two female employees and similarly situated employees of the Defendants.

In 2012, the parties settled, and the Court approved a Consent Decree/Settlement Agreement (lasting 2 years) that awarded monetary damages to two female claimants and promised injunctive relief.

145,FA-MA-0001,"This case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts on May 16, 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiff claimed that the department's provision of more than a million dollars of public funds to a ministry called ""The Silver Ring Thing"" (SRT) that uses federal abstinence education funding to bring ""unchurched"" students to Jesus Christ constituted an unlawful establishment of religion and a governmental endorsement and preference for religion in general and specific tenets of the ministry in particular. 

The ministry developed a three hour presentation that was meant to occur directly following a mandatory abstinence education assembly in public schools and which, according to the plaintiff, was ""permeated with religion."" 

In a two-year settlement agreement entered on February 22, 2006, the defendants acknowleged that they had terminated the SRT grant effective January 31, 2006.  The agreement provided that defendants would not fund SRT's abstinence eduction as it had been structured and implemented during the fiscal year 2005, that strict requirements would be made before considering funding any future proposals from SRT, and that extensive monitoring of SRT's activities would occur if SRT was given a grant.

The 10th Circuit granted expedited en banc review, and oral arguments occurred on May 23.

The plaintiffs alleged that HHS's mandate requiring them to provide health insurance coverage for certain contraceptives violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Equal Protection Clause. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On October 26, 2013, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit issued a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, holding that the HHS mandate did not violate the RFRA because it did not require the plaintiffs to provide any coverage for contraceptives that would violate their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court held that the requirement did not apply to Hobby Lobby's religious beliefs because the plaintiffs did not show that they would be forced to comply with the mandate."
153,FA-OK-0005,"In 2013, a group of religious-based universities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Oklahoma under the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act against federal government. The plaintiffs alleged the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employee and student health plans provide coverage of contraception violated their religious foundings. On November 6, 2015, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the accommodation to the contraceptive services mandate as applied to religious nonprofits violates the RFRA. This case was consolidated with six others. The Supreme Court issued a per curiam order remanding all seven cases to their respective courts of appeals, and ordered that the parties be given time to come to agreement on ensuring contraceptive access without burdening religious freedom. Following revised HHS policies, the District Court permanently enjoined the defendants from forcing religious organizations to provide contraceptive care. The case is now closed","

159,FH-AL-0008,"In November 2011, two undocumented Mexican immigrants and three fair housing groups filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama against the State of Alabama. The plaintiffs alleged that a state statute violated the Fair Housing Act and was preempted by federal immigration law because it required mobile home owners to pay for a government-issued registration while prohibiting undocumented residents from making payments to government officials. Because the law made it illegal to possess a mobile home without registration and because it was illegal for undocumented residents to obtain the registration, the law effectively made such persons homeless.  The District Court (Judge Myron H. Thompson) enjoined the State from enforcing the law. The State appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit rendered it moot because in May 2012 the Alabama legislature amended the statute to exclude mobile home registration.  The District Court dismissed the case in May 2014, upon stipulation of the parties.","

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants' redevelopment plan, which razed numerous homes in a minority neighborhood, was discriminatory.  The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's pretrial decision in favor of the town to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reversed, and found that the plaintiffs were entitled to a trial.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the question whether disparate impact claims were available under the Fair Housing Act.  About two weeks prior to the scheduled argument, the parties settled; the city will construct 44 new homes, 20 for current residents in exchange for allowing redevelopment.

The suit alleged that the defendants violated the Fair Housing Act of 1968 by discriminating against African-American tenants. The court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the defendant's policy of blanket bans on tenants with criminal records had a negative impact on the tenants' ability to live in the community. The case was dismissed on July 19, 2016."
172,FH-NY-0025,"On May 12, 2005, individual New York residents and the New York ACORN local chapter filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Easter District of New York. The plaintiffs sued Nassau County and the Village of Garden City under the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with discriminatory zoning practices; to order Garden City to approve a proposed zoning that would allow for affordable housing; and to order the defendants to take all actions necessary to assure that the Social Service Site be redeveloped to maximize the availability of affordable and integrated housing. 

On February 15, 2012, Judge Arthur D. Spatt granted defendant County's motion for summary judgment dismissing all claims against it. 

On April 22, 2014, Judge Spatt issued a final order for the plaintiffs and ordered Defendant Garden City to take a number of steps to prevent discrimination and to increase access to affordable housing. After Judge Spatt's order, both parties appealed the decision. The Second Circuit affirmed in part and remanded in part. The case is back in the lower courts on remand. On remand, Judge Spatt found that the plaintiffs had met their burden at trial in demonstrating that the Garden City’s proffered reasons for its chosen zoning change could have been met by another practice, such as R-M zoning, that had a less discriminatory effect. Magistrate Judge Arlene R. Lindsay thereafter awarded plaintiffs $5,255,108.94 in attorneys fees and costs from Garden City. On March 15, 2019, Judge Spatt signed the parties’ stipulation of discontinuance with prejudice, except without prejudice as to the court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of interpretation or enforcement of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement required the County to pay $5,400,000 to the plaintiffs to be used for the purpose of furthering and promoting mixed-income affordable housing; $120,000 to NYCC to be used for activities related to fair and affordable housing; and $400,000 to plaintiffs’ counsel for attorneys’ fees. The case is now closed.","

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v. SOUTHPORT BANK, Defendant. COMPLAINT Case No. 13-C-1086 Plaintiff, United States of America, alleges: INTRODUCTION 1. The United States brings this action against Southport Bank of Kenosha, Wisconsin (“Southport” or “the bank”) for discriminating against African-American and Hispanic borrowers in its residential mortgage lending.

In 2007 and 2008, Southport charged hundreds of African-American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers higher fees than non-Hispanic white (“white”) borrowers, not as a result of their creditworthiness or other objective criteria related to borrower risk, but because of their race and national origin. 3. It was Southport’s business practice to allow its mortgage brokers to vary their fees and thus alter the price set based on a borrower’s objective credit-related factors. This subjective and unsupervised pricing discretion resulted in African-American and Hispanic borrowers paying more than white borrowers for home mortgage loans. 4. As a result of the bank’s discriminatory practices, an African-American or Hispanic borrower paid, on average, thousands of dollars more for a Southport loan. 5.

The complaint alleged that the bank discriminated against African-American and Hispanic borrowers in its wholesale mortgage lending program by allowing its mortgage brokers to vary their fees and thus alter the price set based on a borrower's objective credit factors. The parties entered into a consent order in September 2013 to resolve the case. The consent order was entered by Judge J P. Joseph of the United States District Court for the Eastern district of Wisconsin and is available on the court's website."
177,ID-CT-0005,"Following an investigation by the United States Department of Justice, the U.S. filed this lawsuit against the State of Connecticut, its Department of Mental Retardation, and the Director of Southbury Training School (Southbury) on July 25, 1986, alleging that living conditions at Southbury placed residents in grave danger of bodily harm and death. On the same day, the parties also entered into a consent decree that required Southbury to provide better programming, disciplinary procedures, medical care, recordkeeping, and increase staffing. After some problems with compliance and placing the state in contempt, the Court assigned a special master to monitor Southbury. After making significant progress, on March 25, 2006, the court ended judicial oversight, but retained jurisdiction over the consent decree and remedial plan. On November 2, 2009, the Court granted a joint motion to dismiss the case because the parties agreed that the consent decree and remedial plan were fully implemented.","

182,IM-AZ-0016,"On May 17, 2010, a group of organizations and individuals filed a lawsuit against the Sheriff and Attorney of each of the 15 counties in Arizona, in their official capacities, in the U.S. District Court of Arizona, Phoenix Division.  The plaintiff, represented by organizations such as the ACLU and the National Immigration Law Center along with private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the recently enacted S.B. 1070 was a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Specifically, the plaintiff contends that S.B. 1070 conflicts with federal law and procedures and that local law enforcement agencies are ill equipped to deal with the complexities of immigration law.

The district court granted a preliminary injunction in February 2012, which the defendants appealed.  In a related case, Arizona v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down most of S.B. 1070.  The plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction against the remaining provisions of S.B. 1070 and while the parties were going through discovery disputes, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on March 17, 2015. The plaintiff filed a response to the defendant's summary judgment and on September 4, 2015, the district court ruled in favor of the defendant with regard to plaintiff's claims under the Supremacy Clause, Equal Protection Clause, the Fourth Amendment, Article II, Section 8 of the Arizona Constitution, the Due Process Clause, and 42 U.S.C. §1981. Notably, the court also entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on count three claim which was appealed. Finally, on September 15, 2016, both parties conferred and filed a joint case disposition in which the plaintiff settled for $1.4 million. ","

183,IM-AZ-0021,"On June 8, 2015, civil detainees confined in the Tucson Sector of the U.S. Border Patrol filed a class action lawsuit, alleging violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the APA due to inhumane and punitive conditions while they were detained in holding cells. The district court granted a PI mandating that defendants must maintain conditions of confinement adequate for the detainees' physical needs and provide detainees with mats and blankets after 12 hours. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the PI order. In 2018 the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of defendants' obligation to provide raised beds for detainees held for any period requiring sleep; the district court denied this motion. After a 7-day trial in January 2020, the district court held that these extended confinement conditions violated the Constitution and issued an order enjoining the defendants from holding detainees for longer than 48 unless they provided conditions of confinement that meet basic human needs. This permanent injunction was ordered and has been in effect since April 2020.","

Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and an order vacating and setting aside the policy. They also sought declarative relief and attorney's fees.

Plaintiffs (and other members of the class they seek to represent) are mothers and their minor children who escaped violence and persecution in these countries to seek asylum in the United States. After entering this country unlawfully and being apprehended, each was found to have a “credible fear” of persecution, meaning there is a significant possibility that she will ultimately be granted asylum here.

U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Defendant. Civil Action No.: 1:17-cv-00708 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Introduction 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA” or “the Act”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, seeking unlawfully withheld agency records relating to actions taken by Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) to revoke, suspend, or terminate participation in the Global Entry System (“GES” or “Global Entry”) for certain Arab and Muslim U.S. Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (“LPRs”) without any legal justification. 2. Global Entry is a CBP trusted traveler program that allows expedited security clearance and admission for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival in the United States. Approved GES travelers enter the United States through automatic kiosks at select airports and are normally exempted from the normal interview process. 3. Shortly after the November 2016 presidential election, and accelerating significantly following the new administration’s rollout of its first attempt at a Muslim travel ban, Plaintiff American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Council (“ADC”) began receiving reports that Arabs and Muslims who were previously approved for GES had these approvals inexplicably revoked by CBP. 4. As documented by ADC, and subsequently, by several media outlets, these Global Entry revocations were not isolated incidents. Rather, they are part of a wider pattern

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Muslim Advocates is a not-for-profit legal advocacy and educational organization. On January 11, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA Request (the “Request”) for materials related to denaturalization efforts by the federal government, including but not limited to “Operation Janus,” a joint initiative between DOJ and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), where federal agencies reviewed the files of naturalized citizens for the purpose of identifying misrepresentations in their naturalization applications that could render American citizens eligible for denaturalization. The Request was sent to the DOJ’s National Security Division (“NSD”), DOJ’s Civil Division (“Civil Division”), DHS, and DHS’s component agency, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). See Ex A. On January 25, 2018 DHS referred the Request to its component agency, ICE. On February 13, 2018, Muslim Advocates submitted a revised FOIA request to ICE after the agency requested clarification on the scope of the request (hereinafter, the “Second ICE Request”). See Ex. C. 2. As of this filing, Defendants have wholly failed to comply with their obligations under FOIA: Defendant DOJ wrongfully denied Plaintiff’s Request and has thereafter failed to adjudicate Plaintiff’s administrative appeal of the Civil Division’s denial within the time limit. Defendant ICE has outright refused to process either Muslim Advocates’ initial Request or the Second ICE Request and has likewise failed to respond to any appeals. To date, neither of the Defendants have produced a single document in response to Plaintiff’s FOIA requests. 1 3.

On November 20, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a class action suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia against the President and the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The plaintiffs filed this suit on behalf of their minor son, A.J.E.A.M., K.P.V., R.D.P, and Y. A.L.P who were detained at the border.

204,IM-DC-0070,"37 families detained at three ICE-managed family residential centers sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security alleging violations of their Fifth Amendment constitutional rights, violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, and violations of the Flores Settlement Agreement. The plaintiffs alleged that the congregate environment and unsanitary conditions of the detention centers make them a tinderbox for a COVID-19 outbreak. They sought immediate release until proper protocols could be implemented. The plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order which was granted in part and denied in part on March 30. The court ordered ICE to provide appropriate infection protocols for the adults (a similar order from another case, <i>Flores</i>, applies to the children), to comply with CDC guidelines for congregate institutions, and to file a report regarding FRC capacity, implementation of the CDC guidelines, the number of detainees released, and videotape of the living conditions at the FRCs. On May 26, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and a motion in opposition to the temporary restraining order. The court denied the plaintiffs' later motion for a preliminary injunction demanding wholesale release of detainees on July 22. On December 10, the court dismissed the claim under the APA and the writs of mandamus. A hearing is scheduled for February 16, 2021. The case is ongoing.","

Immediate intervention is necessary to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful conduct, which was intended to and has had the effect of chilling participation by immigrant communities and communities of color in Census 2020, which will in turn deprive these communities of the political representation and federal financial resources to which they are entitled. 2. On July 21, 2020, President Trump issued a Memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce titled “Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Ap

Section 2284(a) requires the appointment of a three-judge court in actions challenging “the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts,” as this action plainly does.

While the district court granted in part the government’s motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction. On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that DHS's decision to rescind DACA was subject to judicial review under the APA and that the rescission was unlawful. Shortly thereafter, the Acting DHS Secretary issued a memorandum suspending DACA while DHS reviewed it. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that the Acting Secretary lacked the authority to issue the memorandum because he had not been lawfully appointed to his position. The district court agreed. Accordingly, the court vacated the memorandum and ordered DHS to resume processing DACA applications. This case is ongoing. ","

228,IM-OK-0003,"On February 1, 2008, national, state and local chambers of commerce and other nonprofit organizations advocating for their members' business interests filed a lawsuit against the State of Oklahoma, claiming that Sections 7 and 9 of the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act, which impose tax penalties on businesses that don't check the work eligibility of all of their employees in a federal database and allow discharged employees to bring discrimination suits against their employers for employing unauthorized workers, were preempted by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act.
The Court granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on June 4, 2008, and on appeal to the Tenth Circuit the injunction was upheld except for as to the verification requirement. On remand to the District Court, the case was stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Whiting, which Supreme Court later held that an Arizona law requiring employers to use E-Verify was not preempted by federal law. Pursuant to this decision, the district court entered in a judgment on December 19th, 2012, holding that Oklahoma can require persons to contract with the State to use the employment authorization system. However, the provision creating a cause of action for discrimination against employers who terminate an authorized employee while retaining an unauthorized employee and the provision requiring businesses to verify individual independent contractors’ authorization status and creating a withholding for work performed by individual independent contractors, were both struck down.

By October 18, 2018, only one plaintiff was still represented by counsel and pursuing a claim (26 had dismissed their claims with prejudice, and 18 had fallen out of contact with counsel and were designated as pro se; their claims were later dismissed). That plaintiff reached a private settlement with the defendants and the court ordered entry of the final judgment on December 4, 2018. The plaintiff was to be paid $9,500. The case is closed.","

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO DIVISION EL PASO COUNTY; RICHARD WILES, SHERIFF OF EL PASO COUNTY in his official capacity; and the TEXAS ORGANIZING PROJECT EDUCATION FUND, Plaintiffs, v. THE STATE OF TEXAS; and GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT; ATTORNEY GENERAL KEN PAXTON; DIRECTOR STEVE MCCRAW, THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, all sued in their official capacity, Defendants. CIVIL ACTION NO. PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Senate Bill 4 (“SB 4”), also known as the “Show Me Your Papers Bill,” is an unprecedented, cruel, and vague law that is aimed at the heart of Texas. It violates the Constitution of the United States, the Texas Constitution, and federal law and should be immediately and permanently enjoined. 2. There are many legal flaws with SB 4. Racial animus fueled SB 4’s enactment, tainting the entire law with an impermissible legislative purpose. The law’s language is unconstitutionally vague, chills policy dissent in violation of the First Amendment and leaves those potentially subject to its mandates without meaningful notice of what acts are forbidden. SB 4 will make all Texans less safe by eroding the discretion of our local law enforcement and law enforcement on college campuses, interfering with the chain of command and the existing decision-making processes of local officials, and preventing the reporting of crimes. Finally, SB 4 invites racial profiling, permitting local officers to demand “papers” from virtually any person in Texas at any time. History and logic supports that all Texans will not be equally subject to this harassment: Texans of Hispanic heritage and immigrants and their families, particularly those from Mexico, Central American and other Spanish-speaking countries, will be targeted. 3. This historic and unconstitutional attack on the core values and identity of Texas is especially harmful to the County of El Paso — comprised of residents, employees, and visitors — and to the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund (TOPEF) the population it serves. 4. El Paso is unique among Texas counties: it is bilingual, bi-national, multi-cultural, and geographically distinct. For instance, El Paso has over 800,000 residents, is over 82% Hispanic and over 25% of its residents are foreign born. It is part of the largest border community in the United States, and one of the safest communities in the nation, leading the country in public safety

235,IM-UT-0002,"This is one in a series of cases challenging comprehensive state immigration laws. In this case, a coalition of immigrant rights groups and individual immigrants challenged Utah's law, HB 497, on preemption grounds and as a violation of equal protection, the right to travel, and the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. A preemption case brought by the Department of Justice was later consolidated with this case. In 2011, the District Court for the District of Utah has issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the statute. Following the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Arizona, the Court ruled on the motions for preliminary injunctions in June 2014 and ruled against the key provisions of HB 497. In November 2014, the parties filed a joint report, in which the State of Utah agreed to permanently scrap the key problematic provisions of HB 497. On December 4, 2014, the Court entered a judgment per the parties' proposed final agreement and dismissed the remaining claims without prejudice. The parties settled on attorney fees and costs and the case closed. ","

The plaintiffs sued Alameda County and the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for violations of their rights under the U.S. Constitution and state law.  On April 12, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.  The plaintiffs elaborated on the allegations in the original complaint of the mistreatment against pregnant women prisoners and discrimination against women prisoners in general.  The second amended complaint also added additional causes of action under California state law and identified additional named defendants beyond the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office and individuals employed therein, including the California Forensic Medical Group, retained to provide medical services to prisoners and Aramark Correctional Services, a for-profit food services provider at the Jail.

The plaintiffs requested that the court certify a plaintiff class of women prisoners and the subclass of pregnant women prisoners, and that the court issue emergency remedy, by decree, to ensure that the women prisoners receive the medical care and other accommodations they needed to be safe while in custody at the Alameda County Jail.  Finally, in addition to the injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages requested in the original complaint, the plaintiffs requested that the court affirmatively direct the defendants to fully comply with all state statutes and regulations regarding medical treatment, nutrition, activities, and personal hygiene for women prisoners.  

The parties began engaging in settlement negotiations and entered an agreement in principle on May 14, 2018.  On May 7, 2019, one named plaintiff moved to relate the case to Gonzalez v. Ahern.

The plaintiffs alleged that the sheriff's office violated their constitutional rights by failing to provide them with adequate medical and mental health care while they were in custody. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The parties are now in the process of negotiating a settlement agreement."
249,JC-CA-0143,"This putative class-action lawsuit, brought by inmates in Orange County Jail, argued that county and the sheriff violated the U.S. Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in failing to provide adequate care amidst the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Plaintiffs sought habeas corpus, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. 

The district court granted class certification and partially granted a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which mandated more social distancing, providing for more PPE, and improved sanitation policies. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, and applied in both the district court and the Ninth Circuit to stay the case in the lower court until the appeals court had ruled. Both denied these applications, however the Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court saying that the defendants could try to modify the injunction if there were any changed circumstances. Defendants did so, but the district court denied any modifications once again. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which likewise rejected the defendants' motion. Finally, the defendants went to the Supreme Court and asked them to stay the injunction while the Ninth Circuit heard the case on the merits. The Supreme Court obliged on August 5, staying the injunction.

The case is ongoing as of February 17, 2021.","

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT COMES NOW the Plaintiff, John Doe, individually and on behalf of all others similarly sitiated, and for their causes of action against the Defendant would allege as follows: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. The Plaintiff and the proposed class, as defined in Paragraphs 74 et seq., include those individuals currently and formerly housed at the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility in. Davidson County, Tennessee, a private prison owned and operated by CoreCivic, an entity formerly doing business as Corrections Corporation of America (""CCA""). During the time of incarceration, the Plaintiff and proposed class were entirely dependent on the Defendants to provide them with access to basic health care. However, they have been, and with regard to those still incarcerated, continue to be deprived of access to basic healthcare. 2. Plaintiff files this Class Action seeking damages on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated due to the Defendant's deliberate indifference to their serious medical needs while they were incarcerated, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and their prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. 3. Plaintiff and all Class Members were exposed to Sarcoptes scabiei (hereafter ""Scabies"") caused by the spread ofparasitic mites. Scabies is most easily transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, bedding, clothing and towels. Female mites burrow under the skin, lay their eggs at the end of the tunneled burrows, and larvae hatch two to three days after the eggs are laid. The mites cause intense itching, which facilitates re-infestation and skin eruptions that transfer the mites to new hosts. 4. Defendant operates a private for-profit prison and therefore had direct control of the prisoners and detainees in its charge infected with scabies. The Defendant deliberately failed to adequately screen those entering its facility, respond to inmate requests for medical attention, treat those infested with the parasite, quarantine the infected individuals in its care, or to take any other precautions to prevent the spread of scabies outside the facility. This caused a foreseeable and preventable systematic outbreak which spread to the Plaintiff and all others similarly situated. THE PARTIES 5.

SIMONE MARSTILLER, in her official capacity as Secretary of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice; and the FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE, an agency of the State of Florida, CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Subjecting children to solitary confinement and depriving them of even minimal meaningful social interaction can cause trauma, depression, and anxiety, increase the risk of suicide and self-harm, and permanently interfere with children’s development. Despite these well-known risks of serious harm, the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) isolates thousands of children in solitary confinement every year. The risk of harm for children begins immediately when they are isolated in solitary confinement. 2. Solitary confinement is unnecessary, unproductive, and can be permanently damaging to the individuals subjected to it. A national consensus is emerging that solitary confinement poses a risk of harm for anyone, but is especially harmful for children, who are still developing physically, psychologically, and socially. For children with mental illness, developmental disabilities, or histories of trauma, the risk of harm from isolation is even greater.

The plaintiffs alleged that the detention facility failed to provide adequate medical and mental health care to the detainees, failed to comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and failed to protect the detainees from harm. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and the case was dismissed. The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the district court did not have jurisdiction to grant summary judgment because the plaintiffs did not show that the defendants had violated their rights."

The district court found that the Commonwealth violated provisions of the federal Medicaid Act by failing to provide home-based services to thousands of children across the state. In 2007, the district court approved a remedial plan intended to restructure the children’s mental health system by incorporating intensive home-based services, including behavioral health screenings, assessments, case management, crisis intervention and in-home therapeutic supports. It also appointed a monitor to oversee implementation and compliance. The parties agreed to extend the monitor’s appointment several times, with the final extension expiring on December 31, 2018. In July 2019, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to again extend the monitor’s appointment; the First Circuit overturned this ruling on May 4, 2020.

The federal government’s searches of electronic devices at airports—along with 9 intrusive questioning, lengthy detentions, and even refusal to allow certain travelers to enter the 10 country—has generated widespread media interest and public concern.

You have agreed that no further processing of your FOIA request is necessary if TSA provides a letter clarifying certain information discussed in the interim responses. Accordingly, for the purpose of finally resolving and closing this matter, TSA provides you with the following information: As indicated in the interim responses, TSA does not have policies that address searching passengers’ electronic devices for the purpose of copying or examining the data or information stored within, as TSA does not search for or collect information housed on passengers’ electronic devices and does not provide screening personnel with any means to do so (as indicated by TSA’s “no records” response to your Requests 2 through 4 seeking records regarding equipment that could be used for that purpose). TSA’s search for records responsive to your FOIA request located no records expressly addressing the content housed on passengers’ electronic devices.

Defendants. This action seeks to enhance public understanding of an urgent concern: discrimination in immigration enforcement against Muslims, Latinos, and other members of disfavored groups by the U.S. Department of State (“DOS”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The contemporary importance of this issue is no accident. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald J. Trump asserted he would ban all Muslims, including refugees fleeing war-torn regions of the world, from entering the United States. Candidate Trump also perpetuated harmful and racially charged stereotypes about Mexican and other Latino immigrants, to whom he referred as murderers, rapists, and “bad hombres.” He subsequently called for “extreme vetting” of immigrants. In his first week in office, President Trump continued his anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric and moved promptly to issue a thinly veiled “Muslim Ban” executive order that indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days, and prohibited individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for

In this Freedom of Information Act matter, pursuant to the parties’ stipulation of November 15, 2019, ECF No. 88, and this Court’s Order of November 18, 2019, ECF No. 89, Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”) is required to process 1,500 pages of potentially responsive documents every six weeks and produce those non-exempt records which have been fully processed. 2. CBP has now largely completed processing potentially responsive records in this matter, and after the next production of May 22, 2020, less than 1,500 potentially responsive pages will remain for review and potential production. 3. Of the remaining potentially responsive pages, multiple documents may require referral or consultation with outside agencies or entities within the Government, and CBP cannot currently predict when such referrals or consultations will be completed and when all such documents will be fully processed. 4. Accordingly, CBP proposes to modify the governing production order in this matter such that it will process the remaining potentially responsive pages in this matter, and produce those potentially responsive pages that have been fully processed, including completing any appropriate third party review, every six weeks.

INTRODUCTION 1. Defendants, Carnival Corporation (""Carnival"") and Fathom Travel Ltd., Corporation, (""Fathom"") (hereinafter collectively referred to as ""Defendants"") are refusing to allow Cuban-born persons to board its Fathom cruise line to Cuba, the first American cruise line to cruise to Cuba in over 50 years. 2.

Defendants' conduct including its refusal to allow any Cuban-born on the Fathom cruise line to Cuba is uniform among all passengers.

Bonta) were filed by Medicaid service providers and recipients seeking to enjoin California from reducing its disbursement rate to Medicaid providers by 5%. The cases were both filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, and the Court found that the issues in the cases were substantially similar and therefore chose to relate them, assigning them to the same Judge. The Judge at the District Court granted a preliminary injunction preventing California from implementing the rate reduction, finding that to do so would violate the federally guaranteed right to equal access to quality medical services for Medicaid beneficiaries. The Defendant appealed, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that their was no cause of action that would allow Medicaid providers or recipients to challenge a State's compliance with the equal access provisions of Medicaid.

315,PB-DC-0009,"In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (“Obamacare”) that expanded Medicare coverage to include additional groups of beneficiaries. Arkansas approved a work requirement in Medicaid as a requirement for health coverage in its amendments on March 5, 2018.

On August 14, 2018, three individuals filed a suit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as administrators involved in implementing the Arkansas Works Amendments (AMA) in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the SSA and the Constitution in approving the AWA in March 2018. All three plaintiffs were beneficiaries of Medicaid who lost or risked losing medical coverage due to changes in the AWA. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the AWA and attorney fees. 

On March 27, 2019, the court held that the AWA work requirement does not advance the purpose of the SSA. The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and vacated the approval for Arkansas’s program. On April 10, 2019, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 

On February 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment vacating the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas Works Amendments. The court emphasized that providing healthcare coverage is the primary purpose of Medicaid. The defendants' alternative objectives of better health outcomes, financial independence, and transition to commercial coverage, on the other hand, were not consistent with Medicaid. The court found the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas program to be arbitrary and capricious due to the failure to consider whether the program would result in loss of coverage, an important aspect of the approval analysis.","

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHARLES GRESHAM, et al., Plaintiffs, v. ALEX M. AZAR II, et al., Defendants. Civil Action No. 18-1900 (JEB) MEMORANDUM OPINION Adrian McGonigal is 40 years old and lives with his brother in Pea Ridge, Arkansas. He used to have a job working in the shipping department of Southwest Poultry, a food-service company located nearby, although he received no medical insurance through his employer. Like many Americans, he has several serious medical conditions. Beginning in 2014, McGonigal was able to receive medical care — including regular doctor visits and numerous prescription drugs — through the state’s expanded Medicaid program. In mid-2018, however, McGonigal learned that he would be subject to new work requirements, which he would have to report online, as a condition of receiving health benefits. These were imposed by the Arkansas Works Amendments (AWA), approved by the U.S.

A group of LGBTQ-focused private healthcare providers, organizations providing community services, health professional associations, and individual providers filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the revised rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act, First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. On September 2, the court found that the plaintiffs had standing for most of their claims, and enjoined the Administration from implementing two provisions: (1) the 2020 Rule's elimination of ""sex stereotyping"" from the 2016 Rule's definition of ""discrimination on the basis of sex"" and (2) the 2020 Rule's use of Title IX's exemption of certain religious organizations from the statute’s nondiscrimination mandate. It denied relief for the 2020 Rule's elimination of the 2016 Rule’s prohibition on categorical coverage exclusions for gender-affirming care, repeal of the 2020 Rule's notice requirements, and alleged violation of Section 1554, in addition to the plaintiffs' constitutional claims.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WHITMAN-WALKER CLINIC, INC., et al., Plaintiffs, v. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al., Defendants. Civil Action No. 20-1630 (JEB) MEMORANDUM OPINION In an effort to improve access to health care for LGBTQ individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services in 2016 promulgated a Rule that offered a bevy of protections for such patients. Those included explicit prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sex stereotyping, limits on exemptions from providing treatment that certain religious entities could invoke, proscriptions of categorical coverage exclusions, and a number of others. Believing that many of these protections were either unnecessary or misguided, the current administration has recently issued a Rule that revises or repeals the 2016 Rule in significant respects. Concerned by this change in policy, private health-care facilities that provide services to LGBTQ people, LGBTQ-services organizations, national associations of health professionals, and individual physicians and behavioral-health providers have joined forces to bring suit challenging the new Rule under both the Administrative Procedure Act and various constitutional provisions. They now ask this Court to preliminarily enjoin the measure while this litigation proceeds. I.

The plaintiffs alleged that underfunding and the flawed design of the 2020 Census might lead to undercounts of the US population in violation of the Enumeration Clause and to the detriment of minority populations, as the census count is tied to both public funding and governmental representation. The plaintiffs requested an injunction to require the US to develop a plan to ensure a fair and accurate count. The court dismissed the claim for injunctive relief as unripe because census preparations were ongoing, but allowed the claim on underfunding to continue. The court also allowed the plaintiffs to add two claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. On April 16, 2020, the court granted the government’s motion to dismiss; the case is closed. ","

328,PB-ME-0002,"On December 18, 2009 three young adult residents of Maine who were Medicaid recipients and who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, filed a lawsuit against the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services in her official capacity. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs alleged that DHHS had violated Title II of the ADA and other federal laws. The Plaintiffs alleged that the State had failed to accommodate Plaintiffs' disabilities and to provide medically necessary treatment in the most integrated setting possible, instead forcing them into nursing homes where they were functionally segregated from the outside world. In August, 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint reframing the case as a class action on behalf of all similarly situated Maine residents. The parties began settlement discussions shortly thereafter. On May 2, 2012, the Court (Judge Nancy Torresen) approved the settlement. The settlement agreement required the State to establish a Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW) program, which would provide a limited number of qualifying class-members the opportunity to live in community-based settings. The case is presumably closed.","

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA RICHARD ANDERSON, et al., Plaintiffs, vs. ED LAKE, et al., Defendants. NO. CIV-17-1236-HE ORDER Plaintiffs filed this putative class action asserting claims against the State of Oklahoma based on alleged violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The claims are based on notices sent in October 2017, to recipients of the Medicaid ADvantage Waiver and the Medicaid In- Home Supports Waiver for Adults programs indicating that, due to budget failures, their waivers allowing for community-based services would be terminated as of December 1, 2017. This case was filed on December 6, 2017. Oklahoma subsequently took steps to avoid the termination of waiver services. Plaintiff’s amended complaint alleges Governor Fallin signed a stopgap budget measure providing additional funding for the programs through February 2018. The parties’ submissions indicate additional funding measures have since been enacted which provide supplemental funding sufficient to maintain the programs through the end of the FY 2018 fiscal year. In light of those developments as to funding, defendants have moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), arguing that plaintiffs’ claims are now moot and that no live controversy

U.S. District Court [LIVE] Western District of Texas (San Antonio) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE","The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas held that the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to comply with the requirements of the Texas Open Records Act. The court held that DHHS's failure to comply was a violation of the First Amendment right to equal protection under the law. The case was brought by a former DHHS employee, Eric Steward, who claimed DHHS violated his constitutional rights when it failed to provide him with a copy of his medical records. The DHHS denied his motion for a preliminary injunction, and the case was dismissed."
341,PB-TX-0012,"In 2016, states and religiously affiliated healthcare providers filed this lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiffs alleged that the Affordable Care Act's regulation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex (which included gender identity and termination of pregnancy) violated the Administrative Procedure Act, Religious Freedom Restoration Act and constitutional rights. In October 2016, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of this regulation, which was granted on December 31, 2016. Defendants' motion to stay the preliminary injunction was denied in January 2017. In May 2017, the defendants filed a motion for voluntary remand and stay, arguing that HHS should be given the opportunity to reconsider the regulation at issue in this case, which would conserve the resources of both parties and the court. In July 2017, Judge O’Connor declined to remand the case, but imposed a stay of all proceedings while HHS reconsidered the regulation. He clarified that the December 31, 2016 preliminary injunction order would be unaffected by the stay and would remain in full force and effect throughout the stay. In December 2018, the stay was lifted, and the parties resumed litigating the case. In September 2019, Judge O'Connor vacated the rule's challenged provisions. An appeal is pending before the Fifth Circuit. ","

The MoU was entered on September 29, 1989 and the parties filed a motion for summary judgment on October 2, 1989; the case was dismissed on October 3, 1989."
345,PC-CA-0056,"In 2008, a California inmate filed a lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, alleging that the CDCR acted unconstitutionally by segregating the prisoners by race and locking down an entire race of prisoners due to the actions of certain prisoners of that race. The case survived the defendants' motion to dismiss and class certification was granted. 

In October 2014, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the CDCR agreed to a number of terms, including to cease implementation of race-based modified programs or lockdowns; to provide outdoor activity to prisoners in a modified program or lockdown for longer than fourteen days; to revise its policies concerning modified programs and lockdowns, and to train its staff on modified programs and lockdowns. The defendants also agreed to pay attorneys fees and costs. The court retained jurisdiction for 18 months to enforce compliance with the agreement, and on December 20, 2016, the parties filed notice that the court’s jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement had terminated and that the case was dismissed with prejudice in its entirety. The case is now closed.","

The plaintiffs were represented by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union and Legal Assistance to Prisoners. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff's rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated because the facility was overcrowded, unsanitary, lacking in security, and unable to provide adequately the basics of general human living needs. Judgments were reached that required screening of all admitted inmates, individualized health care summaries for HIV-positive inmates, routine health examinations, and the use of drug therapies for HIV-positive inmates; as well as requiring that the prison not increase its inmate population, continue operating as a medium security facility, and allow plaintiffs' lawyers access to the facility.","

(hereinafter “ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. <unk>701 et seq. (hereinafter “Rehabilitation Act”). At issue is the failure of Defendants, Idaho Department of Correction (IDOC) officials, to ensure that Plaintiff, Randolph Smith, an inmate who is deaf, was provided an opportunity to effectively communicate with persons outside the prison that was equal to that provided hearing inmates. Hearing inmates are provided COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF the use of standard telephones to communicate with persons outside the prison. Using a standard telephone, hearing inmates can communicate with persons outside the prison using their primary language. Moreover, in light of the continuing spread of this basic technology, using the standard telephone hearing inmates have an ever increasing potential audience with whom they can communicate. Because of his disability, Plaintiff cannot communicate using a standard telephone. In recognition of this, the IDOC has provided him the use of a text telephone (TTY). However, a TTY does not enable Plaintiff to communicate with deaf persons outside the prison in a manner that is functionally equivalent to that afforded hearing inmates. A TTY does not allow him to communicate in his primary language. Moreover, because of changing technologies and trends, the actual number of persons he can contact using a TTY is continually decreasing. In fact, the TTY is becoming increasingly obsolete and useless. In light of this, Plaintiff requested that he be provided the use of a videophone. A videophone would allow him to communicate with an increased number of people using his primary language. The request for a videophone was denied.

During trial, it became apparent that conditions at the subject prison have changed based, in part, on the appointing/hiring of new administrators, and the implementation of new policies and procedures. In order to insure that any award of injunctive relief in this case does not run afoul of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, the Court finds the impact of the changes at the prison must first be assessed.

The changes include, but are not limited to, new administrators, new prison personnel, and new service providers. Based on these changes, the Court concludes that the alleged constitutional violations that may have existed at the time this lawsuit was filed no longer exist and, therefore, that the injunctive relief

368,PC-NJ-0015,"This was a prison medical care case filed in 2002 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking damages and an injunction against contract medical care providers and New Jersey corrections officials.  The plaintiffs that the New Jersey prison system was failing to treat them for Hepatitis C.  By the time the court adjudicated the class action issue, in May 2008, the New Jersey Department of Corrections had adopted major changes in how prisoners with HCV were treated; it updated its procedures to match those of the federal Bureau of Prisons, and ""backscreened"" all the prisoners willing to be screened for the virus.  Given that the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs was this same set of reforms, Judge Hillman denied the request for injunctive relief as moot.  As to two individual class members who had HCV, the court held there was sufficient evidence in the record to go to trial on their constitutional claims (though not on their Americans with Disabilities Act claims), and denied the state's motion for summary judgment.  In October 2009, the case settled for money damages.  (However, it seems from some papers filed by one of the plaintiffs that he may never actually have received  his money.  But when he sought the assistance of the court in enforcing the settlement against his lawyer, Judge Hillman ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction, and directed him to file a collection action in state court.  )","

380,PC-TX-0022,"On May 21, 2012, a Native American prisoner incarcerated at the McConnell Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) filed this pro se federal civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. He sued multiple TDCJ employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. He alleged that TDJC policies that prevented his smoking a prayer pipe during Native American pipe ceremonies, limited his ability to wear a religiously significant medicine bag, and prevented him from growing long hair violated his rights under RLUIPA and the First Amendment. He sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief as well as attorney's fees and costs. An additional Native American prisoner plaintiff joined the suit shortly after filing. 

In February 2013, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, consented to proceedings before a Magistrate Judge, and voluntarily dismissed all of their claims except their three RLUIPA challenges against the TDCJ Director in his official capacity and their First Amendment claim seeking damages against the Program Analyst in his individual capacity. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. On February 27, 2014, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment was granted and a final judgment entered in their favor. The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit and were successful in getting judgement on the RLUIPA grooming policy claim vacated and remanded. On remand, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the RLUIPA grooming claim was denied. As the RLUIPA grooming policy claim moved towards trial, the initial prisoner plaintiff in the case was released and his claims were dismissed. The Court ordered the consolidation of cases Casey v. Davis (2:14-cv-13) and Cobb v. Morris (2:14-cv-22) with this case, as the two cases also were brought by Native American prisoner incarcerated at the McConnell Unit and involved RLUIPA grooming policy claims moving towards trial. After a bench trial, Judge Ramos granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief permitting them to grow their hair long, consistent with their Native American religious beliefs and entered a final judgment on February 26, 2019. The defendant appealed, but moved to dismiss the appeal shortly after. The Fifth Circuit granted the motion to dismiss the appeal on July 9, 2019. This case is closed.","

Named Plaintiffs William Thorpe, Frederick Hammer, Dmitry Khavkin, Gerald McNabb, Gary Wall, Vernon Brooks, Brian Cavitt, Derek Cornelison, Christopher Cottrell, Peter Mukuria, Steven Riddick, and Kevin Snodgrass bring this action against the Virginia Department of Corrections (“VDOC”) and the individual defendants, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. These men have been isolated in solitary confinement at Virginia’s twin maximum-security prisons, Red Onion and Wallens Ridge State Prisons—and have remained in long-term solitary confinement for between two and 23 years. No Virginia sentencing statute or regulation requires VDOC to place these men in long-term solitary confinement based on their crimes or sentences. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 2. As a result of their long-term solitary confinement, the Named Plaintiffs have suffered severe physical and mental health damage, including weight loss, auditory and visual hallucinations, emotional distress, PostTraumatic Stress Disorder, severe sensory deprivation, and suicidal thoughts. 3. As understood by the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Department of Justice, “solitary confinement”—including when referred to as “segregation,” “administrative segregation,” “restrictive housing,” or “isolation”—entails: (1) removal from the general inmate population; (2) placement alone in a locked room or cell; (3) inability to leave the room or the cell for the vast majority of the day; and (4) near-total deprivation of contact with

Judge John P. Jones denied the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief in 2017 and initially granted summary judgment in favor of VDOC in 2018, but the Fourth Circuit overturned him on appeal in late 2019, saying that VDOC's use of access to television for religious services as an incentive program unduly burdens the plaintiff's rights to practice a bona fide religious belief. The panel stated that religious practice should be a right, not a privilege that can be taken away through an incentive program. The case is ongoing.","

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA John Doe, Jane Doe, James Doe, Plaintiffs, vs. TODD ENTREKIN, Sheriff of the Etowah County Sheriffs Office, in his individual and official capacity; Officer Victor Payne, in his individual capacity; Officer James Craig Tyler, in his individual capacity; Defendants. Judge: Case No: FILED 2013 Sep-12 PM 02:20 U.S. DISTRICT COURT N.D. OF ALABAMA COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. The Etowah County Sheriffs Office operates a program of unannounced, random and suspicionless compliance investigations of every individual in the county who is subject to the registration requirements of the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act. Essential to the Sheriffs Office's program is that officers search the home of each registrant. Officers must also question the registrant about his or her registration information. 2. The Sheriffs Office conducts this program without regard to such factors as whether an individual was convicted as an adult or adjudicated as a juvenile; whether the individual presents a substantial risk of reoffending; whether the individual is on probation or parole; or whether the individual is fully compliant with his or her registration requirements. Under the Sheriffs Office's program, officers have unfettered discretion as to how often and when they conduct these unannounced inspections, so long as the officers make personal contact with every registrant at least once per month. 3. Plaintiff James Doe is an Etowah County resident who, under the Act, is required to register as a juvenile. To do so, he must appear in person at the office of Etowah County Sheriffs' Office four times per year. Nonetheless, the Sheriffs Office has conducted at least nine separate inspections at James' home, where he resides with his parents, Plaintiffs John Doe and Jane Doe. Sheriffs' Office officers routinely search Plaintiffs' home without consent during these inspections. Officers also interrogate Plaintiffs about James' registration information. Defendants have threatened to arrest Plaintiffs if they fail to cooperate. 4. Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. <unk>1983 to vindicate their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to not be deprived of liberty without due process of law. Plaintiffs seek a declaration from this Court affirming that their rights have been violated, a permanent injunction against future compliance inspections without suspicion, and damages from Defendants in their individual capacities to compensate Plaintiffs for their unlawful treatment.

The plaintiffs alleged that the sheriff's office violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by conducting at least nine separate inspections of their homes without their consent and by threatening to arrest them if they did not cooperate with the inspections. The case was settled on September 13, 2014. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied."
393,PN-CA-0018,"On June 26, 2003, two separate suits were filed against the City of Oakland and the Oakland Police Department (OPD), and related defendants, in federal court. The suits were filed in response to the OPD's actions on April 7 at a peaceful antiwar demonstration at the Port of Oakland. The Police, without giving sufficient notice to disperse and without provocation, barraged demonstrators with a variety of ""less-lethal"" munitions, while blocking the main exit routes. Police pursued demonstrators and others present when they attempted to disperse, while continuing to fire at them and intentionally strike them with motorcycles. On August 11, 2003, the Court ordered that the cases be officially related and heard before the same judge. One of the two cases, Local 10 ILWU v. City of Oakland, was filed as a class-action on behalf of all persons who attended the April 7 demonstration. The suit also named as plaintiffs Local 10 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, plus nine of its members who were ""standing by"" in the vicinity of the demonstration but not active participants in it. The other suit, Coles v. City of Oakland, sought relieve for several individual demonstrators who were allegedly injured by the OPD. In both cases, Plaintiffs sought compensatory, exemplary, and punitive damages, as well as to recover legal costs. They also sought declaratory judgments holding the Defendants' actions to be unlawful violations of the Plaintiffs' rights under the Constitutions of the U.S. and of California and of statutory law. They sought injunctions that among other things would prohibit the Defendants from unlawfully interference with the constitutional and statutory rights of participants in public demonstrations and protests.

On December 24, 2004, the parties entered a court-approved partial settlement addressing the Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief to the extent that those claims related to the Defendants' crowd control policies. Oakland adopted a new official Crowd Control Policy that forbade the police from dispersing crowds that had not behaved illegally or that did not pose a clear and present danger of imminent violence. It also forbade the indiscriminate use of less-lethal weapons directly against crowds, even when specific individuals in the group were violent. The remaining issues eventually settled, with awards of damages and attorneys' fees well in excess of $1,000,000.","

This action arises out of protests in Denver and across the nation following the murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, by Minneapolis police officers. The events in Minneapolis brought out millions of people around the country at once to peacefully protest the deaths of Black and Brown people by law enforcement and vigilantes condoned by local law enforcement as well as the systemic racism that oppresses Black, Indigenous, and people of color. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of people came out to demonstrate in Denver and elsewhere in Colorado. 2. Although the protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, the Denver Police Department (“DPD”) and officers from other agencies in DPD’s mutual-aid network (collectively, “Defendant Officers”) used violent crowd control tactics against these peaceful protestors.

Civil Action No. 14-1316 (RDM) MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER This is one of a series of cases pending before this Court seeking damages from the Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”) and individual officers for allegedly searching private homes without probable cause.1 The common thread in each case is an attack on the MPD’s practice of seeking search warrants based on an averment that the investigating officer “knows” based on his or her “training and experience” that individuals suspected of certain crimes— typically involving the illegal distribution of drugs or unlawful possession of a gun—are likely to have evidence of their unlawful activity in their homes. In each case, the plaintiff alleges that the officer who submitted the affidavit in support of the warrant knew, or should have known, that just the opposite is true—that, in fact

The plaintiffs argued that the defendants had violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and they sought both damages and injunctive relief.

After the case was consolidated with a number of related cases, in August 1981, the parties entered into a consent decree settlement. The consent decree barred the City from political spying, harassment, and investigation of certain activities protected by the First Amendment. Despite the settlement, decades of litigation addressing enforcement of the decree followed.

In April 2011, the district court granted the City's motion to dismiss the case. The court's order permitted the plaintiffs to file a motion to reinstate the consent decree within 45 days if the City did not conduct an audit showing compliance with the terms of the agreement.

Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech. Somewhere I read of the freedom of press. Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for rights.1 The document to which Nobel Laureate, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., referred is the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Unfortunately, some of the members of the Columbus Police Department had no regard for the rights secured by this bedrock principle of American democracy. This case is the sad tale of police officers, clothed with the awesome power of the state, run amok. Because cell phones captured last year’s police killing of George Floyd, the world stopped. Last year’s protests in the aftermath of Mr. Floyd’s death reignited the flashpoint around which this case revolves—the accessibility and protection of constitutional rights Dr. King’

413,PN-OR-0003,"This class-action lawsuit was filed on June 28, 2020 in response to Portland Police Bureau's allegedly illegal tactics in quelling the protests in that city after the police killing of George Floyd in May of 2020. The plaintiffs, who were members of media and legal observers of the protests, argued that their First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the PPB's use of pepper spray and rubber bullets, among other weapons. They sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief. 

The court granted a TRO against the city, prohibiting the police from arresting or seizing the equipment of reporters or legal observers of the protests. The court later granted a preliminary injunction against the city.  

By July 16, President Trump had sent in federal officers from the DHS and USMS as reinforcement. The plaintiffs added those two organizations as defendants and filed a motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction. 

The motion for temporary restraining order and the motion for preliminary injunction were both granted. These decisions were appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has yet to rule on them. However, on October 9, the Ninth Circut declined to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The federal defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which remains pending.

425,PR-WA-0001,"On March 5, 2019, the State of Washington filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for violating Title X’s “Nondirective Mandate,” the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Title X generally, and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706). On March 4, 2019, HHS published a Final Rule, scheduled to go into effect on May 3, 2019, which would alter longstanding regulations governing Title X grants for family planning services. Washington sought declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate the Final Rule and prohibit HHS from implementing or enforcing it, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. On March 18, 2019, this case was consolidated for pretrial proceedings with a separate case filed by the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA; a national membership organization of Title X providers that operate or administer more than 3,500 health centers providing family planning services to more than 3.7 million patients each year), a Washington-based NFPRHA member organization, and two health care professionals, challenging the same HHS Rule on behalf of themselves and their patients.

Washington and the NFPRHA parties filed preliminary injunctions on March 22, 2019, seeking to prohibit HHS from implementing the Final Rule. Judge Bastian granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Final Rule nationwide until further order of the court. On May 3, 2019, defendants filed a notice of appeal and motion to stay the preliminary injunction, as well as a notice of interlocutory and preliminary injunction appeal regarding plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction.

On June 20, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a three-judge panel per curiam decision granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit noted that the Final Rule was challenged in federal court in California, Oregon, and Washington (this case), and district courts in each case granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. HHS appealed in each case and sought to stay the injunctions pending a decision of the merits of its appeals. The panel found that HHS was likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and that the remaining factors also favored a stay pending appeal. 

On June 25, 2019, plaintiffs in the Oregon and Washington cases filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc regarding the stay. On July 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that the three cases (California, Oregon, and Washington) be reheard en banc, and that the motions for stay pending appeal granted by the Ninth Circuit panel would not be cited as precedent by or to any court of the Ninth Circuit. 

On July 11, 2019, the Ninth Circuit en banc court denied the motions for administrative stay of the three-judge panel’s order granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The en banc court stated they would proceed expeditiously to rehear and reconsider the merits of Defendant-Appellants’ motions for stay of the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders pending consideration of the appeals on the merits. This case is ongoing.","

426,SD-LA-0013,"In 1964, a group of African American families filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant Jefferson Parish School Board had violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by continuing to segregate the school system. The Court granted injunctive relief, mandated desegregation of the school system, and required that the defendants use busing to speed up the integration process. The injunction remained in place for several decades. In 2007, the School Board sought to implement a magnet school program in the hopes of boosting academics and increasing school diversity. The parties jointly moved to supplement the desegregation plan to include the magnet school program, and the Court issued Consent Orders in 2008-2009 that enabled the School Board's plans. However, issues arose in the following years with the School Board's implementation of the plan. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants were using the Consent Orders as a pretext to conceal attempts to continue a system of racially segregated schools. After the Consent Orders expired, the parties reached a settlement agreement and the Court declared Jefferson Parish Schools unitary in 2011. ","

COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. On and before January 6, 2021, the Defendants Donald J. Trump, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Proud Boys, and Oath Keepers conspired to incite an assembled crowd to march upon and enter the Capitol of the United States for the common purpose of disrupting, by the use of force, intimidation and threat, the approval by Congress of the count of votes cast by members of the Electoral College as required by Article II, Section 1 of the United States Constitution. In doing so, the Defendants each intended to prevent, and ultimately delayed, members of Congress from discharging their duty commanded by the United States Constitution to approve the results of the Electoral College in order to elect the next President and Vice President of the United States. 2. Plaintiff, the Honorable Bennie G. Thompson, Member of the United States House of Representatives, brings this action against the Defendants for conspiring to prevent him and other Members of Congress from discharging these official duties, in violation of 42 U.S.C. <unk>1985(1). Enacted as the “Ku Klux Klan Act” in 1871, Section 1985(1) was intended to protect against conspiracies, through violence and intimidation, that sought to prevent Members of Congress from discharging their official duties. The statute was enacted in response to violence and intimidation in which the Ku Klux Klan and other organizations were engaged during that time period. 3. The Defendants conspired to prevent, by force, intimidation and threats, the Plaintiff, as a Member of Congress, from discharging his official duties to approve the count of votes cast by members of the Electoral College following the presidential election held in November 2020.

Case No. 1:20-cv-03121 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Plaintiffs National Urban League and National Fair Housing Alliance, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), bring this civil rights class action for injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendants President Donald J. Trump; Eugene Scalia, United States Secretary of Labor; and the United States Department of Labor (collectively, “Defendants”) for violations of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Every nation’s history includes unsettling truths that many would prefer to forget or deny. But true patriotism demands confronting the truths of our history—no matter how embarrassing or dishonorable—and undertaking the difficult work of learning from the lessons of our past in order to move forward. For the United States, that work requires reckoning with our shameful legacy of racial subjugation of Black people in this country— from slavery and Jim Crow to mass incarceration and police violence—as well as our long history of express discrimination against other people of color, women, and LGBTQ persons. 2. Without uninhibited discussion and examination of that legacy, we are ill-equipped as a nation to address its ongoing manifestations in present-day forms of discrimination and bias. The First Amendment protection of free speech in the United States Constitution ensures that all Americans are empowered to engage freely in an exchange of ideas, truth-telling, and difficult conversations about this history. This protection extends equally to those who engage with the federal government, where the policies that affect the lives of all Americans are developed, enacted, and funded. 3. On September 22, 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order 13950, entitled “Executive Order on Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping” (“EO 13950” or “the Order”). Contrary to its title, the Order is an extraordinary

On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court held that the clearest case on point, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. 431 U. S. 209 (1977), did not apply because the public employees at issue there were distinct from the care providers here. Accordingly, the Court stated the agency-fee provision must serve a compelling state interest that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms. The Court found insufficient the interests contended by Defendants and held the Illinois PLRA unconstitutional.","

MICHAEL HANSEN, in his Official Capacity as Director of the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, Defendant. 4:11cv417-WS ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT The plaintiff in this case mounts a constitutional challenge to a Florida statute, section 393.11, that sets forth the state's scheme for involuntarily admitting mentally retarded persons to residential services provided by the Agency for Persons with Disabilities (""APD""). The plaintiff contends that the statute violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

See id. at 641–42, 644, 111 S.Ct. 2491. [12] Finally, we disagree with Mr. Jackson that <unk>2113(e) is sufficiently ambiguous such that the rule of lenity applies. Lenity is appropriate only

477,IM-CA-0146,"On July 16, 2019, the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, Al Otro Lado, Innovation Law Lab, and the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles brought this suit against the U.S. Attorney General and  Secretary of Homeland Security. Plaintiffs challenged the federal immigration rule restricting eligibility for asylum for noncitizens who transited through another country prior to reaching the southern U.S. border. Plaintiffs claimed the rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Plaintiffs successfully sought a preliminary nationwide injunction.  However, defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit and the nationwide scope of the injunction was stayed. Then the District Court restored the nationwide scope of the injunction on September 9, 2019, but the government again appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay pending disposition of the appeal in the 9th Circuit. The District Court issued a separate preliminary injunction against another rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in the closing days of the Trump Administration which was substantially similar to the one already enjoined. The Ninth Circuit upheld the original injunction in April, 2021. The case is ongoing but is likely to terminate soon given the change in presidential administrations.","

478,IM-CA-0149,"On August 16, 2019, several health care providers and nonprofit organizations serving immigrant communities filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs challenged the Department of Homeland Security's Final Public Charge Rule (the Rule), which added non-cash benefits to the factors considered in determining whether a person applying for legal permanent residence is likely to become a public charge. The plaintiffs alleged that the Government violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding its statutory authority, claimed that the Rule was ""arbitrary and capricious,"" and asserted that the Rule violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In October 2019, a district court judge denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining the government from implementing the Rule, but issued an order for preliminary injunction in a related case that would enjoin the implementation of the rule in California, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Maine, and Pennsylvania. This preliminary injunction was stayed by the Ninth Circuit in December 2019. It was affirmed a year later in December 2020, but the order was stayed pending petitions to the Supreme Court in the Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits. The Rule was abandoned by DHS on March 9, 2021. As of April 15, 2021, the case is ongoing.","

UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP IMMIGRATION SERVICES, and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, Defendants. Case No. COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552 against defendant United States Citizenship Immigration Services (“USCIS”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) (collectively, “the Defendants”), for declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief, seeking the disclosure of records concerning a policy called the Controlled Application Review Resolution Program (“CARRP”), which imposes extra-statutory rules and criteria to delay and deny immigration benefits to which applicants are entitled. Defendants have failed to respond to a request properly made by Plaintiff Council on American-Islamic Relations—Chicago (“CAIR-Chicago”), and have unreasonably denied a request to expedite the requested records. INTRODUCTION 1. Under the CARRP program, Muslim applicants for numerous immigration benefits, including those seeking to naturalize as American citizens, have had their applications delayed and ultimately denied without legal authority, and without even being informed of the existence of the program. 2. In order to obtain information about the extent of the CARRP’s program impact on Muslim applicants for immigration benefits, on August 1, 2017, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to Defendants seeking the release of agency records concerning demographic information and processing times for individuals applying for naturalization, change of status, and asylum since April 11, 2008, when USCIS instituted CARRP. On September 6, 2017, Plaintiff revised the timeframe for which it is seeking the associated records. 3. Plaintiff also requested that Defendants expedite processing of the request under 5 U.S.C. <unk>552(a)(6) based upon the urgency to inform the public about religious discrimination against Muslim applicants—which is the subject of great public interest—and based upon the status of the Plaintiff as an organization primarily engaged in civil rights advocacy and disseminating information to the public about civil rights violations. 4. The Defendants’ denial of the Plaintiffs’ request for expedited processing, and the Defendants’ failure to make any determination concerning the requested records within the statutory time period, violates FOIA and is impeding the Plaintiffs’ efforts to educate the public about important government activities. 5. The requested information is of interest to a wide cross-section of

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS IRISH INTERNATIONAL IMMIGRANT CENTER, INC., Plaintiff, v. KENNETH THOMAS CUCCINELLI II, Acting Director, U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services, LORI PIETROPAOLI, Regional Director, Northeast Region U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services MICHAEL J. McCLEARY, Director, Boston Field Office, U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services, U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES, KEVIN K. McALEENAN, Acting Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, Defendants. COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION This lawsuit challenges the Trump Administration’s abrupt termination of a longstanding government program that protects seriously ill people from deportation and death. The Administration’s action is unconscionable. It is also illegal. For decades, the United States Customs and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) has operated a small but vital humanitarian program that allows immigrant families battling serious illnesses to request immigration relief in the form of “deferred action.” The program recognizes that deporting seriously ill individuals and their families is in many cases tantamount to a death sentence. Deferred action does not grant immigration status to beneficiaries; it confers other benefits, including an opportunity to apply for work authorization, the tolling of any accrual of “unlawful presence” that could bar future entry into the United States, and a measure of protection against removal proceedings by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). Those protected by this program are in dire straits. They include the mother of a U.S. citizen baby that has spent eight of the last ten months in the hospital; a ten-year-old girl with eye cancer; and a partially-immobilized 18-year-old boy with burns over 70% of his body. In August 2019, the Trump Administration abruptly prohibited USCIS field offices from granting deferred action in cases of serious medical need, and has now put the lives of scores of medically fragile individuals at immense and immediate risk. In doing so, the Administration provided no opportunity for notice-and-comment, or any other procedural protection that is required under the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”). Nor did the Administration provide any rationale for its abrupt termination of the program, as required by law. But the reasons for the Administration’s actions are all too clear: they are part of an overarching anti-immigrant agenda that is driven by racial and ethnic

488,IM-PA-0009,"On April 15, 2009, two longtime permanent residents of the United States who had been detained in Pennsylvania prisons for periods exceeding six months while they pursued challenges to decisions to deport them filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the prisons that held them, claiming that their prolonged detention without a hearing to determine whether such detention was justified violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. On August 10, 2009, the Court (Judge John E. Jones III) declined to certify a class action or grant habeas class relief but granted the plaintiffs' individual habeas petitions. Alli v. Decker, 644 F. Supp. 2d 535 (M.D. Pa. 2009). Rather than present evidence on the reasonableness of the plaintiffs' detention at a bail hearing, the parties came to an agreement whereby defendants would release the plaintiffs without requiring that they post bail. One plaintiff was released in late January of 2010 under minimal reporting requirements, and the other was released in late March of the same year, subject to electronic monitoring.<br />","

489,IM-SC-0001,"This is a class action lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a South Carolina immigration law which requires state and local law enforcement officers to investigate the immigration status of any individual they stop, detain, or arrest whenever they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the individual lacks immigration status, allows law enforcement officers to arrest individuals solely for failing to carry registration documents, makes it a crime to harbor or transport an undocumented immigrant or to be harbored or transported by others if one is an undocumented immigrant, and imposes civil liability on the police for failing to enforce its provisions to the maximum extent possible. The law was patterned after Arizona's SB 1070. The District Court has issued a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the law, and this injunction has been appealed to the Fourth Circuit; in the meantime, the case, along with several others like it from different states, are stayed at the District Court or U.S. Appellate level pending the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Arizona.

After Arizona v. United States was decided the issue was remanded to the District Court. The district court left in place most of its original preliminary injunction, enjoining the state from enforcing Sections 4, 5, and 6 (B)(2). The 4th Circuit per Judge Davis agreed and affirmed the order on July 13, 2013. In March of 2014 Judge Gergel permanently enjoined South Carolina from enforcing Sections 4, 5, and 6(B)(2). Furthermore the state agreed to more favorable interpretations of Section 7, and the remainder of Section, encouraging the Plaintiffs to dismiss their claims on those sections without prejudice. ","

506,PB-CA-0031,"On January 20, 2010, an employee of the federal judiciary married to her same-sex partner under California law filed a lawsuit against the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, alleging that the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) violates the Fifth Amendment by refusing to recognize lawful same-sex marriages for purposes of the laws governing spousal health benefits for federal employees, thereby denying her of a benefit that would be available to her if her spouse were of the opposite sex. On February 22, 2012, the District Court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff, holding that the application of DOMA to deny spousal health benefits in this case did not have a rational basis and thus constituted a Fifth Amendment violation. It entered a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from interfering with the enrollment of the plaintiff's wife in her family health benefits plan.  On July 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a petition in the Supreme Court for certiorari prior to judgment.   That petition was held without decision while the Court considered the California Prop. 8 case (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11970"">PB-CA-0029</a> in this Clearinghouse) and Windsor, the DOMA case from the Second Circuit (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12113"">PB-NY-0017</a> in this Clearinghouse), in which the Court granted review on December 7. The case was dismissed following the decision in Windsor holding § 3 of DOMA unconstitutional.","

Although BOP designed the CMUs primarily for prisoners viewed as terrorists, Plaintiff Sabri Benkahla, a federal prisoner confined in the CMU at the Federal Correctional Institution in Terre Haute, Indiana (“FCI Terre Haute”), was found not guilty of providing support to the Taliban in 2004. The sentencing judge in the subsequent perjury trial that resulted in Mr. Benkahla’s current convictions stated that Mr. Benkahla, a first time offender, “is not a terrorist,” had “engaged in model citizenry,” posed no threat of recidivism, and had “demonstrate[ed] his dedication to his four-year-old son.” United States v. Benkahla, 501 F. Supp. 3. Nonetheless, as a CMU prisoner, Mr. Benkahla faces draconian restrictions on communications with friends and family has no interaction with non-CMU prisoners. Should he remain in the CMU, Mr. Benkahla will not be permitted to hug his son, now six years old, for the duration of his ten-year sentence. 4.

The plaintiff, bringing suit pro se, sought compensatory and punitive damages plus special damages for future legal fees. The plaintiff specifically claimed that the defendants violated his Second and Fourteenth Amendment rights by attempting to break in and enter his home, threatening to imprison him, fabricating stories to have him incarcerated, and asserting false criminal charges, which led to plaintiff spending three months and five days in county jail. The district court denied the defendant’s and plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment. In Dec. 2014, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to deny summary judgment. Settlement discussions have since been unsuccessful and the case is ongoing in the district court, pending trial once public health conditions allow.","

522,PC-PA-0031,"The Disability Rights Network (DRN), a Pennsylvania non-profit, filed this Eighth Amendment suit against the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (PDOC) for the PDOC's use of solitary confinement with severely mentally ill prisoners. On January 5, 2015, the parties executed a settlement agreement for dismissal of the matter, in which the PDOC agreed to implement certain improvements and to pay $750,000 to DRN.  In particular, the PDOC will evaluate all incoming prisoners for serious mental illness, and will place prisoners with serious mental illness in solitary confinement only in ""exceptional"" circumstances; even then, a prisoner with serious mental illness can be kept in solitary confinement for no longer than 30 days and must be allowed out of their cells for 20 hours per week. The settlement also provided for a monitor to report on compliance, and will remain in effect for 3 years (less if the defendant demonstrates substantial compliance for a period of 18 months). There has been no activity on the docket since May 2015 and the case is presumably closed since the three year time period set in the agreement has lapsed. ","

529,PN-IL-0026,"This is a lawsuit brought by several black activist groups, legal organizations, and news media outlets, against the heads of various federal agencies, including the DHS, ICE, Federal Protective Services, and the DOJ.

They argued that the defendants violated the First, Fourth, and Tenth Amendments by using these agents, and that they were in conspiracy to deprive Chicago residents of their rights. When Joe Biden replaced Donald Trump as President, the change in administration mooted the case. It was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs in January 2021.","

532,PN-TX-0002,"In July 2008, the plaintiffs sued the City of Tenaha under the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure) and the Fourteenth Amendment (equal protection).

The plaintiffs claimed that they had been victims of such stops and seizures of amounts up to $50,000, as well as false prosecution or detention. The parties reached a preliminary settlement in August 2012.  Their proposed consent decree included: video and audio recordings of all stops; written documentation with details of the stop; no more dog searches in routine traffic stops; written and oral consent for a search; all asset forfeiture revenue must be donated to nonprofits or used for audio/video equipment or training; and use of an impartial monitor.  The court approved the consent decree, which it later extended to early 2021 after the plaintiffs alleged noncompliance by the City. ","

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. The City of Buffalo has, for over five years, engaged in a systematic practice of targeting Black and Latino neighborhoods and residents for aggressive and punitive traffic en- forcement. The City employs this unlawful practice in part to generate municipal revenue. The City has thus effectively sought to balance its budget on the backs of its Black and Latino citi- zens. 2.

The Class Plaintiffs also seek monetary damages from the City on behalf of the class for the considerable and cumulative financial harm, humiliation, and loss of liberty and property that these invasive and punitive traffic stops have imposed over the years. 3. Beginning around 2012, high-level Buffalo Police Department (BPD) officials deployed a crime “Strike Force” that implemented a vehicle Checkpoint program to conduct socalled “traffic safety” stops and searches of drivers without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. These Checkpoints impose no minor inconvenience. They operate as roadblocks that block off residents’ streets and

The Plaintiffs allege that they were discharged from their duties in the Air Force due to their HIV status. The case was assigned to Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.  On January 11, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to  prevent the defendants from restricting Roe and Voe and others similarly situated from being promoted, changing duty station, or re-training on the same terms as other service members living with HIV who are not being separated.  A hearing was held before Judge Brinkema on February 15, 2019. The same day, Judge Brinkema issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.  The order enjoined the defendants from separating or dicharging from military service Richard Roe, Victor Voe, and any other similarly situated active-duty member of the Air Force because they are classified as ineligible for worldwide deployment or deployment to the United States Central Command area due to their HIV-positive status.

562,FA-MO-0007,"Private citizens sought an exception to the Affordable Care Act mandate requiring employers to provide contraception coverage on that basis that paying for this insurance plan violated their Catholic religious beliefs. On October 16, 2013, the Eastern District of Missouri (Judge Jean C. Hamilton) dismissed the claim for want of standing, but on July 20, 2015, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for merits decision. Judge Hamilton dismissed all but one of the plaintiff's claims but granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff on that claim, enjoining the defendants from requiring the plaintiffs to pay for contraception through their insurance. The government appealed this determination, but following President Trump's May 4, 2017 executive order directing a change in regulations to allow for conscience-based exceptions to the contraceptive-care mandate, the parties agreed to have the case dismissed. The case is now closed.","

Action No. COMPLAINT Tiara Moore, 5841 W. Ohio Street, Chicago, IL 60644, Plaintiffs, v. Ben Carson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in his official capacity, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Defendants. INTRODUCTION 1. This suit challenges the decision of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to abruptly and unlawfully suspend implementation of its own promulgated rule, the Small Area Fair Market Rent Rule (Small Area FMR Rule). The rule provides that, as of January 1, 2018, tens of thousands of low-income families who participate in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program—families who disproportionally are African-American, Latino, and other racial minorities—can use their housing vouchers to move from poor and racially segregated communities to areas that provide greater opportunity in education, jobs, and more. In doing so, the Small Area FMR Rule aligns the federal government’s primary rent subsidy program with HUD’s statutory mandates to ensure fair housing

CARSON, SR., Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in his official capacity, et al., Civil Action No. 17-2192 (BAH) Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell Defendants.

This case is not about what is good housing policy, however. This case is about the rule of law—whether an agency effectively may suspend a duly promulgated regulation without observing the procedures or identifying relevant factual criteria that the law requires to effect such a change. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), without notice and comment or particularized evidentiary findings, has delayed almost entirely by two years implementation of a rule requiring over 200 local Public Housing Authorities (“PHAs”) in 24 metropolitan areas, which HUD selected based on fixed, objective criteria, to calculate housing vouchers’ values based on local, rather than metropolitanwide, prevailing market rents

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' voluntary departure program violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The parties reached a settlement in the form of a class-action settlement in which the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs' fees and costs. The settlement was entered into on June 1, 2009."
573,IM-CA-0127,"On July 10, 2018, the ACLU of Northern California filed this FOIA suit against U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The plaintiff sought records pursuant to a FOIA request about the defendant's use of a contractor to process and transport immigration detainees, some of whom had allegedly suffered injury and death due to the contractor's malfeasance. The plaintiff sought an order from the court that the defendant provide the records. This case was combined with a suit from a private plaintiff alleging mistreatment in ICE and G4S custody in July 2019. Document production appears to be continuing smoothly at a rate of 750 pages per month, but shifting production online due to COVID-19 has yielded some issues in getting documents over to the plaintiff.

574,IM-CA-0167,"This case was filed in response to the July 6, 2020 directive by ICE that would effectively force international students studying under F-1 and M-1 visas to attend in-person classes or risk deportation. The state of California filed this suit against ICE and DHS on July 9, arguing that the directive was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in two ways. First, the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to take into account students' and universities' reliance interests and the defendants gave no reasoned basis for the new order. Second, the defendants were in violation of procedural elements of the APA, because they failed to use proper notice-and-comment rule-making when issuing the new order.

On July 15, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance and as a result, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. California continued to monitor the alterations ICE made to its website between July and September and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on October 19, 2020. ","

On August 22, 2014, Plaintiffs initiated this case to challenge the federal government’s unlawful expedited removal policies at the Artesia Family Residential Center. Plaintiffs are Central American mothers and children who are fleeing persecution in their home countries. After they entered the United States seeking refuge, they were arrested and detained by the federal government at a remote federal detention facility in Artesia, New Mexico. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs challenged policies and procedures by the federal government that denied them a meaningful opportunity to present their claims, prejudged their cases and applied an erroneous legal standard to deny their claims, and resulted in orders of removal that would have returned them to countries where they face extreme danger, despite obviously meritorious claims. Under the challenged policies, Plaintiffs and other families detained at Artesia were almost completely cut off from communications with the outside world, provided insufficient information and in some cases no information about their rights under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), affirmatively precluded from effectively contacting and receiving assistance from attorneys, and ultimately forced to navigate pro se a complex immigration process that was heavily weighted against them. Plaintiffs and others detained at Artesia were subjected to a highly truncated process in which they were provided virtually no notice of when critical proceedings were

After plaintiffs were apprehended at the border, the children were separated under the “zero-tolerance” immigration policy announced April 6, 2018, which criminally prosecuted adult entrants crossing the border illegally and placed accompanying minors in custody of the government. All three plaintiffs crossed the border prior to the Executive Order issued on June 20, 2018, which allowed immigrant parents and children apprehended at the border to remain together during the pendency of their proceedings. The plaintiffs alleged interference of family integrity in violation of Due Process, and sought preliminary and permanent injunctions to immediately reunite plaintiffs with their children. The plaintiffs obtained preliminary relief and were (along with another parent who joined the case later to prevent separation from her daughter) ultimately re-united with their children.

578,IM-IL-0019,"This action, filed Jan. 31, 2017, challenges President Trump’s Jan. 27, 2017 Executive Order ban on admission to the U.S. of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The complaint alleges that in preventing a Syrian national with a valid U.S. visa from returning to the U.S. pursuant to the EO, the defendants violated the First Amendment Establishment Clause, Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and international law. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. 

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and Bernard Harcourt of Columbia Law School, is a resident in the University of Illinois Chicago/Advocate Christ Hospital. He returned to the United Arab Emirates to get married on Jan. 23, and upon returning to the U.S. to continue his residency, he was detained at Abu Dhabi International Airport on Jan 29. Despite his valid visa, he was detained pursuant to the EO. If the plaintiff cannot return to the U.S., he faces the risk of being deported to Syria, where he is a citizen but has never been a resident. 

That same day, the plaintiff also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.

The case was assigned to Judge Elaine Bucklo.  At a status hearing on February 1, the parties told the judge they had reached a ""settlement in principle.""

On February 2, the plaintiff successfully entered the United States at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. On February 8, the plaintiff filed a motion for voluntary dismissal and leave to reinstate on or before August 1, 2017. Judge Bucklo granted this motion and terminated the case.

This case is now closed.","

584,JC-MS-0013,"On May 3, 1993, the U.S. Department of Justice investigated the Harrison County, MI jail. The DOJ found violations of inadequate staffing and medical care. Apparently after negotiation, the Attorney General filed an action under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. 1997 et seq., against the jail in 1995.  Six days later, Judge Walter J. Gex III approved a consent decree.

The consent decree mandated doubling the number of officers, increased training, and hiring of medical professionals for the physical and mental health of the patients. The decree was enforced sporadically throughout the next ten years. On August 11, 2015, the parties filed a joint motion for dismissal, with the county agreeing to continue to use its best efforts to improve its mental health and medical care. The case was dismissed on August 12, 1995. ","

586,JC-TN-0012,"Two detainees in Shelby County Jail in Tennessee filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus. They claimed that failure to take sufficient COVID-19 precautions violated the Fourteenth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and they sought release.

588,NS-CA-0001,"In early 2011, an electronic communication service provider that had received a National Security Letter (NSL) from the federal government filed a petition to set aside the NSL in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The recipient asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that a nondisclosure provision of the NSL Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2709, violated the First Amendment. On March 14, 2013, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston granted the petition to set aside the NSL, declaring that § 2709 violated the First Amendment. The government was therefore enjoined from issuing NSLs under § 2709 or from enforcing the nondisclosure provision in this or any other case. The government appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, but while the appeal was pending, Congress amended § 2709 and 18 U.S.C. § 3511 as part of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. The district court and Ninth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the revised § 2709 and § 3511. But the district court held that the government failed to justify nondisclosure in one case involving the recipient, and the government found that nondisclosure was no longer required in another case involving the recipient. As a result, the recipient could reveal itself as CREDO Mobile. ","

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA JASON LEOPOLD 1669 Benedict Canyon Drive Beverly Hills, California 90210, PLAINTIFF vs. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, 9800 Savage Rd. Fort Meade, MD 20755 and DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 950 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20530-0001 DEFENDANTS COMPLAINT THE PARTIES 1. Plaintiff Jason Leopold is a citizen of California residing at 1669 Benedict Canyon Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90210. 2 Mr. Leopold is an investigative reporter covering a wide-range of issues, including Guantanamo, national security, counterterrorism, civil liberties, human rights, and open government. His reporting has been published in The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, Salon, CBS Marketwatch, The Los Angeles Times, The Nation, Truthout, Al Jazeera English and numerous other domestic and international publications. Currently, he is a contributor to Al Jazeera America and is the editor-at-large for The Public Record. 3 Mr. Leopold seeks access to certain public records to write a news report for distribution to the general public. His connections and relationships with a wide range of domestic and international media organizations will ensure that any story he drafts based on the information contained in these records will be published
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA JASON LEOPOLD, Plaintiff, v. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, et al., Defendants. Civil Action No. 14-cv-805 (TSC) MEMORANDUM OPINION In March 2014, Plaintiff Jason Leopold submitted two Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests seeking records related to surveillance of federal and state judges – one to the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and one to the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (“OLC” and, together with NSA, “Defendants”). Both agencies indicated that they had no records responsive to the FOIA requests, prompting Plaintiff to initiate this litigation. In July 2015, this court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ first motion for summary judgment, finding that Defendants had failed to conduct an adequate search and to adequately explain the basis for their search in certain limited respects. Among other things, the court ordered OLC to reprocess Plaintiff’s FOIA request by searching for draft memoranda and legal opinions related to surveillance of federal and state judges. Defendants have now renewed their motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff challenges only the manner in which OLC searched for these draft memoranda and legal opinions. Upon consideration of Defendants’ renewed motion for summary judgment and the parties’ briefs
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA JASON LEOPOLD, Plaintiff, v. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, et al., Defendants. Civil Action No. 14-cv-805 (TSC) MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Jason Leopold submitted two FOIA requests seeking records related to surveillance of federal and states judges—one to the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and one to the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (“OLC”). Both agencies indicated they had no records responsive to Leopold’s requests. Defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment; Leopold opposes the motion because he claims the agencies failed to perform adequate searches for a variety of reasons. While the court agrees with Defendants on most of the issues raised by Leopold, the court finds that on a small number of issues, Defendants have failed to conduct an adequate search or failed to adequately explain the basis for their search. As a result, Defendants’ motion is granted in part and denied in part. I. BACKGROUND In March 2014, Leopold submitted two similar FOIA requests to NSA and OLC. The NSA request sought “disclosure of any and all National Security Agency policies, memoranda, training materials and guidance about the propriety of surveilling federal and states judges.” (Phillips Decl.

Case No. 16-cv-1850 COMPLAINT Plaintiffs The Associated Press (“AP”), Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC d/b/a USA TODAY (”USA TODAY”), and Vice Media, LLC (“Vice”) (together, “News Organizations”), by and through their undersigned attorneys, allege: 1. This action is brought pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. <unk>552, et seq., for basic contracting information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) regarding one of its most publicly-discussed and controversial acquisitions: a technological tool openly purchased from a third-party vendor that was used to circumvent the need for a court order to access the locked iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the perpetrators of the mass killings in San Bernardino, California Mr. Farook and his wife were both killed in the attack, appear to have acted alone, and investigators long ago stated that they had uncovered no connection between the shooters and any foreign terrorist groups.1 The News Organizations seek injunctive and other appropriate relief, including release of agency records from the FBI. 2.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ASSOCIATED PRESS, et al., Plaintiffs, v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, Defendant. Civil Action No. 16-cv-1850 (TSC) Plaintiffs have also moved to supplement the record with then-FBI Director James Comey’s May 3, 2017, Senate testimony. The court will GRANT Plaintiffs’ motion to supplement the record and consider the testimony as part of Plaintiffs’ brief. Upon consideration of the parties’ filings, the court concludes that Exemptions 1, 3, and 7(E) independently apply to the requested information, and that Exemption 4 does not. Accordingly, as set forth below, the FBI’s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, and Plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment is DENIED I. BACKGROUND In December 2015, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed fourteen people and injured twenty-two others in an attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California. See Government’s Motion to Compel Apple Inc. to Comply, No. 5:16-cm-10-SP (C.D. Cal.) at 1 ECF No. 1. The FBI led the federal investigation into the attack, and during the course of that investigation, discovered an employer-owned iPhone issued to Farook that was password-protected. See id. at 1, 5. The phone was equipped with an auto-erase function that would result in the permanent destruction of the information in the phone after 10 failed attempts at entering the passcode Id. at 5. Thus, the FBI was unable to access the phone without risking the loss of its contents Id.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE, NAACP CONNECTICUT STATE CONFERENCE, and NAACP BOSTON BRANCH, Civil Action No. COMPLAINT Plaintiffs, v. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, Defendant. Every ten years, the Constitution requires the federal government to attempt to count every U.S resident. The results of the census help determine the balance of political power among and within the States and the distribution of day-to-day government services. The federal government uses Census data to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, draw legislative districts, enforce voting rights, build schools, and allocate more than $400 billion in federal funds. The critical task of conducting the decennial census falls to the Census Bureau (“the Bureau”), a unit within the Defendant U.S. Department of Commerce. The Bureau has six regional offices and dozens of temporary processing facilities, and employs more than half a million temporary workers. The scale of the census is reflected by its cost: more than $12 billion in 2010. Yet despite the Bureau's extensive planning and funding, the agency routinely undercounts minorities, young children, home renters, and lowincome persons. Undercount

CAUSE No. 2:14-cv-325-JVB-PRC OPINION AND ORDER For centuries before Henry VIII, the Church was the arbiter of marriage in the western world. She defined marriage, granted it, and declared dissolutions when warranted; the sovereigns meanwhile deferred to the Church in these matters. This changed with Henry VIII, who, having become the head of the Church of England chipped away at the Church’s authority to define---or recognize, as the Church would view it---what marriage is. As the Sovereign and the Supreme Head of the Church of England became one, so did the state and church. With the growth of new governments in the continent and the unified church and state becoming the norm, marriage, in additional to its original attributes, began to be viewed as the good of the state. (And when, as was in the case of French revolution, the church and the state were separated, the state retained its authority over marriage.) The state’s authority over marriage also travelled to the new world, and, by the time the U.S. Constitution was adopted, “

601,PB-NY-0003,"This class action was about whether the City of New York improperly denied federally sponsored cash assistance to qualified New York City residents under a program implemented by the city in the late 1990s. The plaintiffs each claimed to be qualified welfare beneficiaries who had been improperly denied assistance by one of New York City’s new job centers in violation of the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process, the city’s obligations under 7 U.S.C. §2020 (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—then referred to as Food Stamps) and 42 U.S.C. §1396 (Medicaid), in addition to violating state law; the plaintiffs sought class certification for all similarly situated New York City residents, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 16, 1998, with Judge William H. Pauley presiding. The court entered a temporary restraining order on the same day directing the city to provide emergency food stamps and cash assistance to the named plaintiffs. The court granted a preliminary injunction in-part to the plaintiffs on January 21, 1999. The court ordered the city to (1) allow applicants for public assistance to apply for benefits the first day they visit a job center, (2) cease conversion of income support centers to job centers without a formal hearing, (3) make eligibility requirements for food stamps and Medicaid separately from the eligibility determination from cash assistance, (4) send applicants timely notice of the city’s decision on whether they qualify for benefits, and (5) form a corrective plan for achieving its policy goals while also meeting the needs of public assistance applicants. The city moved to vacate the preliminary injunction on December 10, 1999, after procuring more evidence surrounding the efficacy of the job centers in achieving their welfare obligations. Meanwhile, the State of New York moved to dismiss the complaint against them for failure to state a claim. Judge Pauley denied both motions and granted the plaintiff’s motion for class certification on July 21, 2000. 

The court entered a permanent injunction in favor of the plaintiffs on December 30, 2004. The permanent injunction directed both the city and state to: (i) provide expedited food stamp service to eligible applications within 7 days; (ii) separately process applications for food stamps when the applications for cash assistance are denied or withdrawn; (iii) send notices to applicants confirming voluntary withdrawals for Medicaid in accord with 42 C.F.R. 435.913 and document such withdrawals pursuant to 7 C.F.R. 273.2(c)(6); and (iv) provide adequate and timely notice by correctly completing certain documentation. The injunction also required the state to supervise the city and make sure it met the obligations of the injunction. On January 13, 2005, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the part of the December order in which the court concluded that 8 N.Y.C.R.R. § 387.8(a)(2)(i)(a) did not confer a privately enforceable right of action and that plaintiffs’ claim under New York Social Services Law § 133 was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court granted the motion on February 14, 2005. Final judgement was entered on December 14, 2005; the court also granted the plaintiffs declaratory judgment.

Both the state and the city appealed the permanent injunction to the Second Circuit on January 12, 2006, but the city dropped its appeal. On October 31, 2007, the Second Circuit reversed the district court, ruling that the state did not have a non-delegable duty to administer the decentralized Medicaid and Food Stamp programs, the state’s efforts in supervising the city since the permanent injunction was issued were adequate, and the district court exceeded its authority by issuing a permanent injunction in light of New York State’s affirmative supervisory steps it had taken to assure compliance. In a series of stipulations and orders from January 31, 2007 to July 22, 2011, the City of New York agreed to pay a total of $2,920,675.94 to plaintiffs for attorney fees and costs sought; the state agreed to pay a further $639,918.98. The case is now closed.","

603,PB-OK-0001,"Plaintiffs are lesbian couples who filed suit on November 3, 2004 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against the United States and the State of Oklahoma, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Article 2 § 35 of the Oklahoma Constitution (the ""Oklahoma Amendment"") violate the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs alleged that DOMA and the Oklahoma Amendment violates the Due Process, Equal Protection, Full Faith and Credit, and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The court found for the plaintiffs, holding on Jan. 14, 2014 that the ban on same-sex marriage violated the Equal Protection Clause.  

The Tenth Circuit found for the plaintiffs on July 18, 2014, and after the Supreme Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari (on October 6, 2014), the Court lifted the stay on its original mandate and enjoined the Defendant from enforcing the Oklahoma Amendment and denying same-sex couples marriage licenses.
