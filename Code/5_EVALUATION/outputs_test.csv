1,CJ-AL-0020,"In 2013, indigent detainee filed a complaint against the City of Montgomery and a Municipal Court Judge for unconstitutionally ordering the petitioner to serve time for her inability to pay court-order fines and fees for their traffic violations. The complaint was originally filed in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama and then transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, where it was consolidated with a similar case. In the amended complaint, petitioners alleged that the imprisonment orders violated their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. Petitioners sought remedy through injunctive and declaratory relief. In 2014, the parties reached a settlement that provided new judicial procedures for the Municipal Court to follow regarding indigent defendants and nonpayment. It also included three declarations, most importantly, it declared that the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S.

4,CJ-CA-0005,"On March 8, 2006, the Pacific News Service filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the California Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants had violated the constitutional rights of the press and the public to attend, meaningfully observe, and gather and report on important information at executions being carried out by the defendants at the California State Prison at San Quentin. On May 30, 2013, the issue in this case became moot due to a state court decision. In Sims v. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), the California Court of Appeals held that CDCR’s lethal injection regulations were invalid for failure to comply with the APA. The court permanently enjoined CDCR from carrying out the execution of any condemned inmate by lethal injection until their new regulations complied with the Administrative Procedure Act. This case closed after a voluntary dismissal filed by the plaintiff organization.","1 KEKER & VAN NEST, LLP JON B. STREETER - #101970 2 WENDY J. THU - #163558 AlA Y S. KRSHNAN - #222476 3 KATHERI J.

THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER, COLORADO Defendant. ______________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND ______________________________________________________________________________ Plaintiff Mickey Howard, by and through his counsel, Rebecca Wallace and Mark Silverstein of the AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION FOUNDATION OF COLORADO, respectfully alleges for his Complaint and Jury Demand as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. In the City and County of Denver (Denver), when a judge sets a monetary bond, Denver will release the defendant upon payment of that bond only if the defendant also pays a $50 bond fee. That means that even if the defendant can pay the monetary bond, Denver will not release the defendant if he cannot also pay the additional bond fee. Plaintiff Mickey Howard was a victim of this practice. In June of this year, he was arrested for alleged violations of municipal ordinances. The Denver judge set a $10 cash bond for his release, a sum Mr. Howard could pay. Mr. Howard could not, however, pay the additional $50 bond fee that Denver’s policy required as an additional condition of his release. As a result, Mr. Howard spent four additional Case 1:18-cv-02593-STV Document 1 Filed 10/10/18 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 12 nights in jail until the Colorado Freedom Fund, a non-profit bail fund, paid the required fee and secured his release. While out on bond, Mr. Howard fulfilled all obligations related to his case,Case 1:18-cv-02593-CMA-STV Document 22 Filed 12/21/18 USDC Colorado Page 1 of 2 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO Civil Action No. 18-cv-02593-CMA-STV MICKEY HOWARD, Plaintiff, v.
