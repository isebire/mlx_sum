0,CJ-AL-0007,"The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit on March 8, 2014, alleging that the City of Montgomery, Alabama, improperly imprisoned them for failing to pay traffic fines. They alleged that they did not have an ability to pay the fines due to their financial circumstances and that the city did not consider their ability to pay. On May 1, 2014, the District Court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the city from collecting more money from traffic tickets of plaintiffs'. On October 31, 2014 the parties filed to dismiss the case pursuant to a settlement agreement, which included numerous changes to Municipal Court proceedings. The case is now closed.","THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY, Defendant. COMPLAINT Introduction The Plaintiffs in this case are each impowrished people who were jailed by the City of Montgomery because they were unable to pay a debt owed to the City from traffic tickets. In each case, the City ordered the Plamtiff either to pay the City immediately or to ""sit out"" his or her debt in the City jail at a rate of $50 per day.
'Plaintiffs make the allegations in this Complaint based on personal knowledge as to matters in which they have had personal involvement and on information and belief as to all other matters. It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to contract with a private for-profit corporation, Judicial Correction Services, Inc. (""JCS, Inc""), to perform what the City calls ""probation"" services, which consists of collecting City debts in exchange for fees added to the debts owed by people who cannot afford to pay their traffic ticket fees, costs, and surcharges immediately. It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to rely on the discretionary recommendations and factual representations of this private entity to make decisions about Whether to arrest a person, what disposition to enter in a person's case, and whether to put the person on ""probation"" or to require immediate payment or jail despite the fact that the private entity has a significant personal financial stake in these judicial enforcement proceedings.
A JCS, Inc. employee often sits in the Courtroom near the judge and advises the judge about how to handle the cases of ""probationers"" and potential ""probationers."" JCS, Inc. and the City enforce a policy and practice of initiating and issuing arrest warrants when a person misses a payment or fails to make sufficient payments without considering the person's ability to pay—even when they have knowledge that the person is indigent—and without providing notice and summoning the person to court for a hearing. Instead, City policy allows the City to issue and serve arrest warrants, and City officers go to the homes of traffic debtors to arrest them.
The City did not hold any inquiry into their ability to pay as required by clearly established Alabama and federal constitutional law. These cases included: a. A diabetic man who claimed to be too poor to afford his debt.
The Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses have long prohibited imprisoning a person for the failure to pay money owed to the government if that person is indigent and unable to pay. Defendant violated Plaintiffs' rights by imprisoning them when they could not afford to pay the debt allegedly owed. Defendant violated Plaintiff's rights by imprisoning them, and by threatening to imprison them, without conducting any inquiry into their ability to pay and without conducting any inquiry into alternatives to imprisonment as required by the United States Constitution.
Count Three: Defendant City of Montgomery's Use of a Private Actor With a Personal Financial Stake in the Outcome of Judicial Proceedings and Case Decisions As a Supposedly Neutral Probation Official Violates Plaintiffs' Due Process Rights. The City unlawfully imprisoned Plaintiffs for a monetary debt owed to the City. On top of being unlawfully imprisoned for failure to pay debts owed to the City, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Williams were, pursuant to City policy, coerced with longer unlawful prison terms by City officials if they did not ""volunteer"" to labor in the City jail under disgusting conditions for an extra credit of $25 per day toward their debts..

INTRODUCTION This is a civil rights lawsuit brought by three Arkansas prisoners who were convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The prisoners challenge the Arkansas protocol for lethal injection. Plaintiffs’ Complaint is replete with unsupported assertions, but at bottom the Complaint alleges that Arkansas’ three drug lethal injection protocol is unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.
This Court granted his Motion on May 26, 2006. Defendants moved to dismiss the action, and that Motion was denied by this Court on June 19, 2006. [Doc.
Co., 49 F.3d 399, 401 (8th Cir. upheld Missouri’s lethal injection protocol. The Court emphasized that the proper focus when evaluating an execution protocol under the Eighth Amendment is not the risk of accident, but “whether the written protocol inherently imposes a constitutionally significant risk of pain.”
The Inm ates sought shelter under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), claiming that they lacked access to the facts necessary to oppose the ADC’s motion for summary judgment and that they needed further discovery. Before the district court ruled on the ADC’s motion for summary judgment, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Baze v. Rees 552 U.S. 945 (2007), a case challenging the constitutionalityof Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol. Accordingly, the district court denied the ADC’s motion for summary judgment without prejudice and stayed and administratively terminatedthe Inmates’ lawsuit pending the outcome in Baze.
The Supreme Court issued its decision in Baze on April 16, 2008, upholding Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol. 553 U.S. 35, 128 S Ct. 1520 (2008).
§ 5-4-617(a)(4). The parties refer to the set of execution instructions he has developed—and revised—as the Arkansas lethal injection protocol. Ray Hobbs, Chief Deputy Director of the ADC, submitted an affidavit (“the Hobbs affidavit”) dated July 28, 2008, stating that he was authorized to m ake statements about the protocol on behalf of the ADC.
Subsequently, the ADC voluntarily produced m ore than 300 pages of documents to the Inm ates. On November 9, 2007, the district court stay ed and adm inistratively terminated the lawsuit pending the Suprem e Court’s decision in Baze.

BACKGROUND On January 18, 2006, Michael Angelo Morales, a death row inmate at San Quentin State 16 Prison set to be executed on February 21,2006, filed a42 D.S.C. § 1983 lawsuit challenging 17 Californa's lethal injection protocol, San Quentin Operational Procedure 770 (""Procedure 770""). 18 Morales raised an Eighth Amendment challenge to Procedure 770, alleging that the protocol 19 would subj ect him to an undue risk of suffering excruciating pain while being put to death.

Ornoski, Acting Warden 23 of San Quentin State Prison; and Does 1-50, Defendants. [Docket No. 4] On January 13, 2006, Plaintiff Michael Angelo Morales filed an action, Morales v. 27 Woodford, No. C 06 219 JF RS, challenging California’s lethal-injection protocol as violating the 28 Eighth Amendment; on February 10, 2006, he filed a second action, Morales v.

Woodford, No. C 1 06 926 JF RS, which was substantially identical to the first action, for exhaustion purposes; the 2 Court consolidated the two cases on February 13, 2006.
18 Given that the First Amendment access right attaches to executions, the only remaining 19 question is whether the particular challenged restriction survives First Amendment scrutiny. The 20 restriction at issue here is San Quentin's use of pancuronium bromide to paralyze the inmate's 21 body so as to conceal from the public possible manifestations of pain or other important information. 23 In the prison context, courts typically use the four-factor balancing test of Turner v. 24 Sa/lev, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), to evaluate whether an asserted constitutional right outweighs the 25 legitimate penological interests of the prison.
Defendant Robert L. Ayers, Jr. is the Warden of the California State Prison at San 23 Quentin (“San Quentin Prison”). California death row inmates are incarcerated and executed at 24 San Quentin Prison. Ayers or those under his control developed the most recent version of 25 California’s execution protocol.
Accordingly, in the instant action, Plaintiff has the burden of establishing that its claim is ripe. Because Plaintiff's Claim Is Not Ripe, It Must Be Dismissed Without Prejudice. The ripeness doctrine determines the time, if any, at which a party may seek pre- enforcement review of a statute or regulation.
The Lethal Injection Regulations are the latest version of California’s lethal injection 25 procedure—formerly known as San Quentin Operational Procedure No. 770 (“Procedure 26 770”)—which has evolved since it was first adopted in the mid-1990’s. There have been three 27 recent revisions of California’s lethal injection protocol. First, the Department revised 28 Procedure 770 on March 16, 2006, following its February 21, 2006 decision to postpone 1 indefinitely the execution of Michael Angelo Morales.

6,CJ-CO-0005,"In October 2018, a plaintiff sued Denver over its bond fee requirement. Within a few months, the defendants changed their policy and submitted an Offer of Judgment. The case is now closed. ","JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2. This civil rights action is authorized and instituted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The events or omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in the District of Colorado, and at all relevant times the parties reside in the District. Venue is therefore proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).
The ordinance provides that the bond fee is to be collected as provided in Section 14-11, which directs that the fees are payable to the Denver Manager of Finance and are to be credited to Denver’s general fund. Denver assesses the bond fee for all pretrial monetary bonds. While not required by the Denver ordinance, pursuant to Denver’s policy and practice, the bond fee: a. is non-refundable regardless of the outcome of the criminal case or the defendant’s compliance with bond conditions; b. must be paid at the time the monetary bond is posted;1 and c. results in the defendant’s continued pretrial detention when left unpaid, even if the defendant has the means to post the monetary bond set by the court.
Upon information and belief, inability to pay these fees does not cause the defendant to be jailed. Instead, Denver generally bills the defendant for these fees after release. If the defendant fails to pay by a specified time, Denver sends these debts to collections but does not jail the defendant for nonpayment.2 Denver selected only one fee – the bond fee – for mandatory payment in order for a defendant to secure release from jail.
The predictable and inevitable result of Denver’s policy is that some individuals with low monetary bonds and limited resources, such as Mr. Howard, will be detained in jail pretrial solely because they are too poor to pay the $50 fee. Denver’s booking fee 12. A Denver ordinance permits Denver to collect a $30 booking fee for “committing and discharging convicted inmates to and from the county jail.”
Colorado law requires that the fee “shall be refunded to any prisoner who is not convicted.”
20 Mr. Howard was ready, willing and able to pay the $10 bond and agree to GPS monitoring. Denver, however, refused to release Mr. Howard on the conditions set by the court. Instead, pursuant to Denver’s policy and practice, it required Mr. Howard to pay an additional $50 bond fee in order to be released.
Despite this dismissal, Mr. Howard’s compliance with his conditions of bond, and the money already paid to Denver for the privilege of being arrested and bonding out, Denver is seeking additional significant amounts of money from Mr. Howard related to his now-dismissed criminal case.
Denver seeks a $504 payment for Mr. Howard’s GPS monitoring. Absent payment, Denver’s practice is to send such debts to collections. Additionally, two days after the case was dismissed, on August 10, 2018, Denver assessed a $25 public defender fee against Mr Howard.
On September 10, precisely one month after the public defender fee was assessed, Denver added a $50 failure-to-pay fee to Mr. Howard’s bill, as well as a $30 collection fee. Denver sent this $105 “debt” to collections. Thus, Denver now seeks $105 from Mr. Howard for a public defender fee that was originally $25.
These alternatives would not only have prevented the unconstitutional wealthbased detention that occurred in Mr. Howard’s case, they would also make fiscal sense. It costs Denver $70.20 per day to house an inmate in the jail. Thus, each day Denver detains a defendant because of failure to pay the $50 bonding fee or because Denver took $30 from the defendant for the booking fee, Denver loses money.
After bail was set, Defendant denied Plaintiff his pretrial liberty solely because he was unable to pay a fee. The only legitimate governmental interests in restricting pretrial release are ensuring the defendant does not flee prosecution and does not pose a risk to the safety of others.
That liberty interest becomes even stronger once bail is set. Defendant denied Plaintiff his pretrial liberty after bail was set solely because he was unable to pay a fee. The substantive arm of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the government have a constitutionally sufficient reason before its laws can interfere with the rights to life, liberty or property.

The court dismissed the case. The case was remanded to the Colorado Supreme Court."
7,CJ-DC-0002,"In 2012, U.S. District Court of D.C. found that the policy of seizing and retaining private vehicles pending civil forfeiture proceedings without providing a post-deprivation hearing was unconstitutional.","The District's policy that forces indigent property owners to pay a ""penal sum"" before even being able to commence the legal process to challenge the police seizure of their property violates Mr. Simms's right to due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 11 Mr. Simms seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Jurisdiction and Venue 12.
D.C. Code§ 48-905.02(d)(4)(B). Civil forfeiture in the District of Columbia is governed by the procedures set forth in D.C. Code § 48-905.02. Under the civil forfeiture statute, seized property ""shall not be subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody of the Mayor.""
Upon consideration of the plaintiff’s motion, the opposition and reply, the parties’ arguments during the June 13, 2012 motions hearing, the supplemental briefs submitted by the parties both before and after the hearing, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the District’s failure to provide Mr. Simms with a post-seizure hearing to challenge the deprivation of his vehicle pending the conclusion of civil forfeiture proceedings violates his constitutionally-protected due process rights. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED. BACKGROUND A.
9.4 Because Mr. Simms did not pay the bond, the District was not obligated to commence forfeiture proceedings, and did not do so. Plaintiff filed this action on May 1, 2012, and simultaneously filed a motion for preliminary injunction. Apparently in response to the litigation, on May 15, 2012, Lieutenant Gray waived the bond on Mr. Simms’s vehicle.
at 45-46. Writing for the panel, then-Judge Sotomayor found unconstitutional New York City’s continued retention of private vehicles seized incident to arrests, without providing vehicle owners a prompt post-seizure hearing at which the owners could challenge the legitimacy of the initial seizure and the City’s continued retention of the vehicle pending forfeiture proceedings. The Krimstock court relied on Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), and Good.
In Good, the Court applied Mathews to the realm of civil forfeiture. Property owner James Daniel Good challenged the government’s attempt to seize his house, which had been used in connection with a drug offense, for civil forfeiture without prior notice and a hearing. The Supreme Court invalidated the seizure, holding that, absent exigent circumstances, “individuals must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the government deprives them of property.”
CONCLUSION Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED. It is hereby ORDERED that the District shall forthwith release Mr. Simms’s vehicle to him pending the outcome of the forfeiture proceedings which were instituted in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, District of Columbia v.

8,CJ-GA-0015,"On May 23, 2018, four individuals who had been ticketed or threatened to be ticketed by the City of Doraville filed this lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The case was assigned to Judge Richard W. Story. Represented by Strickland Brockington Lewis, LLP, and the Institute for Justice, the plaintiffs sued the City of Doraville under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 and the Declaratory Judgments Act. The plaintiffs alleged that the city’s policy and practice of using its law enforcement and municipal court system for revenue generation violated the plaintiffs' due process rights. The plaintiffs sought declarative and injunctive relief from Doraville’s policy and practice of budgeting to receive revenues from fines and fees. The defendant sought to dismiss the case on July 2, 2018; the court denied the motion to dismiss on July 9, 2019. This case is ongoing. ","According to its 2015 budget audit, approximately 27 percent of Doraville’s general revenues were municipal court fines and forfeitures.6 64. Between August 2016 and August 2017, Doraville’s municipal court assessed approximately $3.84 million in fines against defendants. According to data reviewed by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Doraville ranked 66.

But as a homeowner in Doraville, and (as he owns and drives a motor vehicle) a driver in Doraville, Jeff is subject to the jurisdiction of Doraville’s municipal court.
CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:18-CV-02375-RWS ORDER This case involves the City of Doraville’s practice of including projected revenue from fines, fees, and forfeitures in its municipal budget. The Plaintiffs—four individuals who were cited for various infractions by the City—challenge that practice as unconstitutional. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that by relying on its municipal courts, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers to generate revenue, Doraville has created impermissible financial incentives for those civil servants, thus violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Doraville now moves to dismiss. Discussion Doraville argues this case should be dismissed for two reasons: (1) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, and (2) Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails to state a claim as a matter of law.
Take, for instance, Hilda Brucker. According to the Complaint she was ticketed for a number of violations related to the condition of her home. Those tickets were for having (1) “rotted wood” on her house and “chipping paint” on its fascia boards; .
However, the Court grants, sua sponte, a reconsideration of the motion’s arguments under Rule 12(b)(6). The Court ORDERS the Parties to appear for a hearing to address the proper standard of review and its application in this case. The Courtroom Deputy Clerk will contact counsel to schedule that hearing.
After reviewing the record and with the benefit of oral argument, the Court enters the following Order. Background1 This case involves the system through which Doraville raises revenue from fines, fees, and forfeitures. Doraville, like other Georgia “home rule” municipalities, passes its own criminal ordinances and tries violations of those 1 The facts of this case were fully set out in a previous Order partially ruling on the City’s Motion to Dismiss.
According to Plaintiffs—four individuals who have each been convicted or threatened with conviction in Doraville’s municipal court—“the City’s institutional reliance on revenue from fines and fees” incentivizes “the City to ticket, convict, and fine defendants, regardless of the nature of an individual’s offense” in violation of Plaintiffs’ due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit challenging the City’s conduct under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
Count I challenges the City’s adjudication of municipal violations, while Count II focuses on the incentives for law enforcement officers and prosecutors to obtain convictions. Doraville timely moved to dismiss both counts, (Dkt. The City argued this case should be dismissed because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and because Plaintiffs’ Complaint fails to state a claim as a matter of law.
On April 1, 2019, the Court denied Doraville’s motion, finding that it did indeed have jurisdiction. The Court went on, however, to grant reconsideration (sua sponte) on the Rule 12(b)(6) portion of the motion and invited supplemental briefing from the parties “to address which standard of review should guide the Court’s analysis... and define the parameters of this case, should it move forward.”
Both parties submitted briefs and appeared for oral argument to discuss their positions on June 4, 2019. The Court now reconsiders its previous denial of Doraville’s motion. Discussion I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND 24 A. Execution Protocol Paul Ezra Rhoades was executed by the State of Idaho on November 18, 2011. Prior to his execution, the director of the IDOC was contacted by members of the media, some of whom are represented above as plaintiffs, to voice the objection that the execution protocol as adopted by the IDOC is flawed and is not compliant with the dictates of a 2002 case issued by the Ninth Circuit, California First Amendment Coalition v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 868, 30 Media L Rptr.
Thereafter a letter dated February 1, 2012, was written on behalf of the State of Idaho by Mr. Kubinski, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit F and incorporated herein as through fully set forth. This letter indicates that the representatives of the State of Idaho were not going to change their execution protocol. The execution of Mr. Rhoades was the first execution in approximately 17 years in the State of Idaho and the only involuntary execution since 1957.
t l I am writing you in regard to the scheduled execution of Paul Ezra Rhoades set for this Friday, November 18,2011. It appears that Idaho's protocol conflicts with the law as set forth in theNintl1 Circuit. There is a20 minute window in Idaho's protocol that does not allow the media or any other witness to the execution to view the entirety of the process.
The Complaint and motion were filed on May 22, 2012. The Court granted the request for expedited briefing and also ordered the parties to participate in mediation with Chief United States Magistrate Judge Candy W Dale. The mediation was unsuccessful.
The Defendants filed their response to the motion on May 29, 2012 and a supplement on May 30, 2012.
The Defendants are sued in their official capacities. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction and declaratory relief in response to alleged First Amendment violations by the IDOC via the procedures or protocol used by IDOC for death penalty executions. Plaintiffs specifically seek a preliminary injunction regarding the procedures used for the execution of Mr. Richard Leavitt currently scheduled for June 12, 2012.
Prison officials have a legitimate interest in conducting an execution such that it does not impact the safety and security of prison officials and other inmates. IDOC’s current protocol to effectuate a death warrant is lethal injection. Plaintiffs have presented strong arguments based on binding Ninth Circuit case law that IDOC’s objectives may not justify restricting the viewing of the execution process until after the inmate has been restrained and IVs are placed.
Plaintiff’s interest in allowing the public to more fully view the execution process does not outweigh the public’s interest in proceeding with a scheduled execution. In this case, the condemned inmate, Mr. Leavitt, was originally sentenced to death in 1985. The public has a significant interest in enforcing its criminal judgments.

The court entered a permanent injunction on January 15, 2020,  requiring IDOC to present a plan for releasing class members from custody, and quarterly reports outlining steps that were being taken to ensure that all class members would be properly released by January 2, 2021.  As of July 2020, the court's supervision of IDOC's progress is ongoing.","This case, which arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenges the constitutionality of a legal scheme whereby individuals who have been convicted of certain sex-related crimes end up serving life sentences behind prison bars as the result of the interactions of various state laws and state agency regulations promulgated by three distinct entities—the Illinois legislature, the Prison Review Board (“PRB”), and the Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”). In particular, individuals convicted of sex-related crimes who are sentenced to three years to life of mandatory supervised release (“MSR”) find themselves stuck in prison for life as a result of the imposition of unmeetable restrictions on where they can live that must be satisfied in order for such individuals to be released on MSR. The challenged scheme results in what amounts to a Kafkaesque nightmare whereby these individuals are denied any semblance of proportionality in their prison sentences and due process of law.
Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the classes they seek to represent, allege violations of their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. As of the filing of this complaint, there are approximately 4,000 people imprisoned in the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been convicted of sex-related offenses for which state law imposes an indeterminate term of “three years to life” of Mandatory Supervised Release (“MSR”) (formerly known as parole). As set forth below, Illinois laws severely restrict where individuals deemed sex offenders may live while on MSR.
As a result, the vast majority of such prisoners are unable to find approved “host sites” at which to serve their MSR terms. Because of the unavailability of compliant housing, such prisoners are detained in the Illinois Department of Corrections long after they have served the term of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced.
For individuals with indeterminate MSR sentences, their prison terms are in effect converted to sentences of lifetime imprisonment without any possibility of release. The named Plaintiffs are individuals currently being held in the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been sentenced to serve “three years to life” MSR terms and are unable to find “host sites.” Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of two classes of similarly situated individuals (identified below), challenge the constitutionality of the statutory schemes that cause this severe deprivation of their constitutional right to liberty.
This statute is routinely applied to prohibit individuals seeking release on MSR from residing in the same trailer park or multi-building apartment complex as another individual with a past conviction for a sex-related offense. There are no halfway houses in the State of Illinois that accept parolees classified as sex offenders. Another statutory restriction is 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12), which prohibits anyone deemed a sex offender from “resid[ing] near... parks, schools, day care centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places where minor children congregate” without prior approval of the Illinois Department of Corrections while on MSR.
There is no transitional housing (or “halfway houses”) in Illinois that accept individuals with sex-related convictions. There are no homeless shelters in Illinois that accept sex offenders. Unless a parolee has money to pay for his own housing or people outside of prison who are willing to pay for his housing or take him in, he cannot be released from an IDOC facility to a “host site” on MSR.
1 at 12. Plaintiffs allege that the terms “near” and “other places where minor children congregate” are void for vagueness. Outside the context of the First Amendment, “a plaintiff can only succeed in a facial challenge by “establish[ing] that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid,” i.e., that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.”
The Motion is denied with respect to the remaining counts. Date: August 18, 2017 Virginia M. Kendall United States District Court Judge Northern District of Illinois IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS EASTERN DIVISION Paul Murphy, et al Plaintiff(s), v. Case No. 16 C 11471 Judge Virginia M. Kendall Lisa Madigan, et al, Defendant(s).
(Dkt. The defendants claim that the Department recently promogulated new guidelines that proscribe internet-related sex offenders from living in an internet-accessible home while individuals convicted of offenses not relating to the internet (and with no history of misusing computers or the internet) may be allowed to reside in a home with internet access.
See id. Instead, the plaintiffs in this case dispute the procedures used in host site review. As in Richmond v. Scibana, the wrong perspective to take is “to... question whether differences between... prison... and community confinement are sufficiently great that [the plaintiffs] can be deemed to challenge the fact of custody, rather than simply conditions of confinement acknowledged to be lawful.”

11,CJ-KS-0002,"On October 21, 2015, a private plaintiff sued the City of Dodge City, Kansas and Ford County in a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff alleged that the Dodge City's wealth-based post-arrest detention scheme violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and a declaration that the City's wealth-based detention practices were unlawful. The parties agreed to settle that the City would be enjoined from holding an arrestee in custody after a non-warrant arrest on the basis of inability to post bond. The court retains jurisdiction to enforce the injunction but the case otherwise appears closed.","The City operates the Dodge City Police Department and the Dodge City Municipal Court. Defendant Ford County operates the Ford County Jail. It instructs indigent arrestees such as Plaintiff that they must remain in jail unless they can pay the generically scheduled cash bond.
In a typical week, there are several people unable to make the money bail payment required by the City and who therefore sit in jail until they can come up with the general bail amount or until the City releases them for free after 48 hours. Dodge City’s wealthier arrestees are released immediately if they make payment of the scheduled amount of cash. Others remain detained for varying lengths of time until they or their families are able to borrow sufficient amounts of money or arrange for third-party payment.

No person may, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, be held in custody after a non-warrant arrest to be prosecuted by the City of Dodge City because the person is too poor to post a monetary bond.

12,CJ-KY-0005,"In 2015, prisoners in the Kentucky Clark County Jail filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, alleging that the state did not afford adequate procedural right prior to unlawfully charging inmates a fee for their incarceration without an order from the sentencing court. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment, permanent injunction of the practice, and monetary damages. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss and dismissed all claims alleged in the complaint with prejudice, and all pending motions were denied moot. In 2016, the plaintiffs appealed but the appeals court affirmed the judgment of the district court. ","according to Judge Bertelsman, is to allow the court to impose a judgment for any deficiency at sentencing which was not defrayed by automatic deduction. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision, stating as follows: May a municipal jail, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, withhold a portion of an inmate’s canteen-account in order to cover the costs of booking, room and board without providing the inmate with a hearing before it withholds the money. Yes, we hold, and accordingly we affirm the district court’s rejection of this claim and two others.
at 730-31. As Plaintiff alleges, the Jail’s incarceration fee policy is nondiscretionary as it applies to all persons confined in the Jail. Moreover, because Plaintiff was billed after being released, the risk of erroneous deprivation is arguably less than in Sickles where the plaintiffs were automatically debited while confined.
Here, given that the remaining claims are state law claims, and that this case is in its infancy, the Court finds that the balance of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity direct the Court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' pendent state-law claims will be dismissed without prejudice. Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief In his ninth cause of action, Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment and injunction enjoining Defendants from “any further pursuit of policies, procedures, customs or practices which resulted in persons being charged for the costs of their confinement absent an order of a sentencing court requiring that they reimburse the county for expenses incurred by reason of such person’s confinement.”
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: (1) Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [DE 4] is GRANTED; . (2) All claims alleged in the Complaint [DE 1] against all Defendants are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE; . (3) All pending motions or requests for relief are DENIED AS MOOT; .

ROGERS, Circuit Judge. This case presents a federal procedural due process challenge to the practice of Kentucky jailers of sending a bill for incarceration costs to jailed prisoners who have subsequently been discharged without any sentence. After arrest, David Jones was admitted to the Clark County Detention Center.
Jones paid $20, stopped paying, and sued Clark County and its jailor, asserting § 1983 and state claims both individually and on behalf of a class. The district court dismissed the federal claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims. Jones appeals, arguing once again that he has been deprived of procedural due process by the County and the County Jailor.
The complaint also asserted various state-law claims of conspiracy, negligence, conversion, fraud, and violations of the Kentucky Constitution. Defendants Clark County and Boyle moved to dismiss all claims. As a part of that motion, the defendants argued that Jones had not alleged a viable claim of violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Jones responded, opposing the motion to dismiss, but “not object[ing]” to the dismissal of his Fourth Amendment claims. The district court granted the motion to dismiss, dismissing the federal claims with prejudice, and dismissing the state claims without prejudice. Jones v.

Those who cannot afford the fee languish in jail for days, weeks, or even months as they and their loved ones scramble to pay off RHI. This scheme is arranged by Cleve Dunn, Sr. (“Dunn”), RHI’s Chief Executive Officer, and officials with the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison (the “Prison”), who, at RHI’s direction, refuse to release individuals ordered to RHI supervision until they pay the initial fee. These officials do not inquire into an individual’s ability to pay RHI’s initial fee.
Dunn then imposes conditions of supervision for arrestees assigned to RHI, including imposing fees for release and monthly supervision, and uses threats of incarceration for supervisees who do not comply with RHI’s conditions or pay the required fees. Dunn has made a separate agreement with Prison officials that prohibits the release of pretrial arrestees assigned to RHI unless the arrestees pay RHI’s initial fee and RHI sends confirmation to the Prison that the arrestee has paid said fee. Pursuant to and in furtherance of this unlawful scheme, Defendant Dunn has committed multiple, related predicate acts of extortion by refusing to authorize the release of Plaintiffs Ayo and White and the proposed Class from the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison until they paid the initial fee to RHI.

Pursuant to the Defendants’ policy and practice, all of these people with outstanding court debts are currently being threatened with arrest and indefinite jailing if they do not make the payments in the amount or frequency purportedly required by the Collections Department. The Defendants have jailed hundreds of people for nonpayment of debts in the past several years.

The complaint also alleged an improper financial incentive for judges to impose bail in order to receive a portion of the money for their general expense fund. ","Parties 6. Plaintiff Miles B. Moran is a pretrial detainee in the custody of Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman. He is currently detained at the Orleans Justice Center, 2800 Perdido Street, New Orleans, LA 70119.

As it is Mr. Moran’s intent for this Amended Complaint to relate back to his first-filed Complaint, he has not altered the allegations of this paragraph or of paragraphs 40–42. in cases that are allotted to her section. She has control over the Judicial Expense Fund and relies upon its income to fund the operations of the court.
That writ application was denied on the same day. On October 31, 2019, Mr. Moran sought review in by the Louisiana Supreme Court. The Supreme Court denied Mr. Moran’s petition on November 1, 2019.

Moran filed an emergency petition for writ of habeas corpus, challenging his current detention, in this Court on Nov. Moran v. Gusman, No. 2:19-cv-13503 (E.D La Nov.

Pretrial detention causes unnecessary lost employment, lost housing and shelter, and creates instability in care for dependent children and parents. It also unnecessarily subjects detained individuals to violent conditions in the Orleans jail, causing harm to arrestees’ physical and mental health. This increases community costs and make a person less stable and healthy upon their ultimate release.

Arrestees are detained in jail for varying lengths of time depending on how long it takes them to make the payment that Defendants require for their release, or to obtain a commercial surety. The number of current and future arrestees subjected to these policies is innumerable. Over fifteen thousand individuals are arrested in Orleans Parish annually.

Class action status is appropriate because Defendants, through the policies, practices, and procedures that make up their post-arrest money-based release and detention scheme, act in the same unconstitutional manner with respect to all class members. Defendants have created and applied a scheme of post-arrest detention and release procedures that requires presumptively innocent arrestees to pay a bond to a commercial surety to secure their release. Defendants release those who can pay and detains those who cannot, without considering alternative non-financial conditions of release or conducting the constitutionally required inquiry into ability to pay.

There are no known conflicts of interest among members of the proposed Class, all of whom have a similar interest in vindicating their constitutional rights in the face of their unlawful treatment by their local government. Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center in New Orleans (“MacArthur Justice Center”)8 and Civil Rights Corps9 who have experience in litigating complex civil rights matters in federal court and knowledge of both the details of the Defendants’ policies and practices and the relevant constitutional and statutory law. They have litigated a similar claim in this Court against OPCDC Magistrate Cantrell.
Having considered the applicable law and the parties’ arguments, the Court now rules as follows.
BACKGROUND Plaintiffs in Moran and Matthews are pretrial detainees who, at the time of filing, had cases pending in the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court (“OPCDC”). They claim that they were impermissibly jailed despite voicing to the court their inability to pay the bond amounts imposed. R Doc.

This system inflicts devastating harm on people solely because of their poverty and violates the most fundamental of American axioms, that all people are equal under the law and are innocent until they are found guilty. The Judges and Commissioners of the Criminal Division of the 19th JDC (collectively, “the Judicial Defendants”) are responsible for setting conditions of release for people who are arrested and charged with certain crimes in East Baton Rouge Parish. They consistently and unlawfully impose secured financial conditions of release (including what is commonly known as cash bail) in an amount that individuals cannot afford, without any inquiry into or findings concerning the individual’s ability to pay or alternatives to incarceration.
These pretrial detention orders are issued without the legal and factual findings and procedures required for valid orders of pretrial detention. Sheriff Sid J. Gautreaux, III, and Warden Dennis Grimes (collectively, “the Sheriff Defendants”) implement a policy of detaining people under the Judicial Defendants’ unconstitutional bail orders. Because Plaintiffs are indigent and cannot pay their bail, the Sheriff Defendants continue to confine them in the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison, the local pretrial detention facility.
By continuing to hold detained people under the Judicial Defendants’ unconstitutional bail orders, the Sheriff Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ and the putative class members’ constitutional rights. On behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, the named Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief against the Defendants. Plaintiffs seek an order enjoining the Defendants from operating their wealth-based post-arrest detention policies and practices and requiring the immediate release of each Plaintiff.
Plaintiffs sue Sheriff Gautreaux in his official capacity only. Defendant Lieutenant Colonel Dennis Grimes is the Warden of East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. He is responsible for supervision, administration, policies, practices, customs, operations, training of staff, and operation of the jail.
28 Mr. Franklin cannot pay $200,000 for his release, so he has remained imprisoned at EBRPP since October 27, 2020 Mr. Franklin suffers from Stage IV prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones and is incredibly painful. He is not receiving cancer treatments while he is in the Jail. In the time that he has been detained in the EBRPP on Judge Jackson’s bail order, Mr. Franklin’s mother died, and he was unable to attend the funeral.
The majority—about 81%—of detainees confined in the jail are there pretrial. The jail also holds individuals on work-release (both pretrial and post-conviction) and post-conviction detainees serving sentences with the Department of Corrections. Currently, the jail confines about 1,400 people.
The jail has a long and ignoble history of medical issues and poor medical care, and it has one of the highest death rates—largely related to medical neglect—of all jails in the country. The jail is responsible for the wrongful deaths of numerous men and women. For years, Baton Rouge policymakers have acknowledged that the old part of the jail—where COVID-19-positive detainees are confined—is unfit for the safe detention of people and the provision of health care.
Fed R. Civ P. 23(a)(1) 99.

17,CJ-MD-0001,"On January 19, 2006, a death-sentenced inmate of the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center in Baltimore, Maryland filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Maryland Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiff objected to the three-drug cocktail (sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in Maryland's lethal injections. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's lethal injection procedures arbitrarily and unnecessarily created a grave risk that he would suffer extreme pain during his execution, thus violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

The plaintiff also filed a similar complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleging that the defendants failed to follow Maryland law because the execution protocol had not been adopted under the Maryland Administrative Procedures Act (MAPA). 

On December 19, 2006 the Maryland Court of Appeals invalidated the Maryland execution protocols until such time as they were properly adopted under MAPA or exempted from that requirement by an act of the Maryland General Assembly. On January 29, 2007, two bills were introduced in the Maryland General Assembly, one that would exempt the death penalty protocols from the MAPA requirement and one that would repeal the death penalty in the state. The judge agreed to stay the proceedings of this case pending the outcome of the legislation. According to the status report on March 14, 2011, all executions in Maryland had been stayed until the proper administrative regulations were adopted. On August 16, 2012 this case was administratively closed. In May 2013 the Maryland legislature repealed the death penalty for all future convictions and in December 2014 Governor O'Malley commuted the death sentences of the four remaining death-row inmates to life without the possibility of parole. ","The DOC could use a less-painful heart-stopping drug. The DOC has arbitrarily and needlessly added potassium chloride to its lethal injection procedure. Unwarranted Risk of Maladministration 30.
On information and belief, DOC procedures governing lethal injections risk unnecessary pain, suffering, and death because, unlike procedures in effect in other States, DOC procedures make no provision for the possibility that a stay of execution will be received after the lethal injection process has begun. Several other states execute death-sentenced inmates using lethal injection. On information and belief, correctional officers in many of these States administer lethal injections pursuant to procedure~ sufferirig the same deficiencies as those used by DOC: failure to provide· adequate directions for preparation of drugs and training of staff, failure to establish necessary safeguards necessary supervision of personnel, and failure to establish appropriate criteria and standards that these personnel must rely upon in exercising their discretion during the lethal injection process.
Exhibit 2. Defendants provided Plaintiff with two heavily redacted Execution Operations Manuals pursuant to a request under the Maryland Public Information Act. One of these Manuals was dated June 14, 2004, and the other was dated May 26, 2004. See Tindall Decl.

Because the administration of pancuronium bromide impairs the ability to accurately assess anesthetic depth, this lethal injection sequence followed by the State of Maryland has the potential for allowing an individual to experience substantial pain and distress. Maryland's lethal injection protocol calls for the use of an ultra-short acting anesthetic, followed by pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride to be administered rapidly one after another. This has the very real potential of inflicting a torturous death as described above.
Accordingly, the Court decided not to count delay against Evans when applying the Blackwelder test. The Supreme Court’s Grant of Certiorari in Hill v. Crosby On January 25, 2006, in Hill v. Crosby, 05-8794, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and a stay of execution to a Florida inmate (Clarence E. Hill) who had challenged Florida’s lethal injection protocol under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. 27 Hill is set for argument on April 26, 2006.

So, securing a dismissal would be a fruitless victory for the State. Hence, the case will not be dismissed. “No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section [1983] ... by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.”

Notwithstanding that it was advised in 1994 o f how D OC inten ded to implement the lethal injection law if that law were enacted, we are un willing to assume that the L egislature intended to leave to DOC on its own and without any formal notice to the AELR Committee, without any opportunity for the Committee to object, without any oversight, unbridled authority to determin e and then change a t will, as a matter of internal management, how that statute is to be implemented. In this case, DOC has decided to use two chemical paralytic agents. Using the canons of statutory construction applied by courts, we have concluded, as a matter of statutory construction, that the current protocol is consistent with the statute.

On March 30, he issued a stay-at-home order to stop the spread of coronavirus and directed Marylanders to leave their homes only for an essential reason. Businesses across the state closed their doors. Lighting Electric was forced to shut down operations almost completely in March as a result of the coronavirus and Governor Hogan’s orders.

They asked the court for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, monetary damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The court denied multiple motions to dismiss, and the parties have engaged in extensive discovery.

The Plaintiffs in this case are each impoverished people who were jailed by the City of Ferguson because they were unable to pay a debt owed to the City from traffic tickets or other minor offenses. In each case, the City imprisoned a human being solely because the person could not afford to make a monetary payment.
Defendant City of Ferguson is a municipal corporation, organized under the laws of the State of Missouri. The Defendant operates the Ferguson City Jail and the Ferguson Municipal Court. Factual Background A.

After her “release,” she was kept in the Jennings jail, but shifted to the custody of Bellefontaine Neighbors and thenVelda City. She was then transferred to the Saint Louis County jail. After her “release” from Saint Louis County, she was transported to Maryland Heights for several days, and then to Ferguson.

Alfred Morris is a 62-year-old man. He is a disabled veteran who relies on a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs to meet the basic necessities of life. Although Mr. Morris cannot perform physical work because of serious medical problems, he volunteers at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital to sit with and assist other ill veterans.

(Doc No. 9 at 13.) He then brought a § 1983 action, alleging that the public defender’s office had a policy of failing to request indigency hearings for clients facing jail time for nonpayment of court-ordered fines. The Sixth Circuit found that the § 1983 action was cognizable, notwithstanding Heck, for two reasons.
For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs’ motion shall be granted. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs in this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action asserted six claims against the City of Ferguson, arising out of the City’s policies and practices of jailing them for failure to pay fines owed from traffic and other minor offenses. In its May 26, 2015 Memorandum and Order (the “Order”), the Court largely denied the City’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint.
Mo Rev Stat. alleged that they are similarly situated to private judgment debtors. Therefore, the Court found that Plaintiffs failed to state an equal protection claim in Count Five.
With respect to Count Six, Plaintiffs argue that they have stated a valid Fourth Amendment claim, notwithstanding their facially valid arrest warrants, based on the City’s alleged policy of issuing arrest warrants without probable cause. The City responds that the Court correctly dismissed both claims. The City argues that Count Five was correctly dismissed because, even if the underlying offenses for which Plaintiffs’ fines were imposed are only quasi-criminal in nature, Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded that, as quasi-criminal judgment debtors, they are similarly situated to private judgment debtors.
No. 4:15-CV-00253-AGF (Jury Trial Demanded) FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Introduction 1. The Plaintiffs in this case are each impoverished people who were jailed by the City of Ferguson because they were unable to make a monetary payment to the City arising from traffic tickets or other minor offenses. In each case, the City kept a human being in its jail solely because the person could not afford to make a monetary payment.
Pursuant to City policy, thousands of additional arrestees have been and will be charged by the City with new ordinance violations and kept in jail pursuant to the City’s illegal post-arrest money-based detention policies. The City has kept thousands of people in its jail for non-payment of fines, fees, and cash “bond” in each of the past five years. The City retains, and is required by law to retain, records of these instances.
Because the City disclaims any sovereign immunity for itself, and seeks only to invoke the sovereign immunity of a nonparty, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The six counts at issue stem from the City’s alleged detention of plaintiffs for their inability to pay traffic fines. The City’s motion to dismiss argued that sovereign immunity barred those claims because the alleged injuries are attributable to the Ferguson Municipal Court, which the City says is an arm of the State of Missouri.
The judge who heard the case in the district court was Honorable Audrey G Fleissig. The judgment of the district court was entered on February 13, 2018. If you have any questions concerning this case, please call this office.

(CAR) (Entered: 05/04/2018)","Kellen Powell filed this lawsuit against the City of St. Ann in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on May 29, 2015 after his arrest for traffic offenses. He alleged that the City unlawfully kept him in the custody of the City because he could not afford to post a cash bond pursuant to an established schedule. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in which the City agreed to pay Powell $10,000 as a ""Class Representative Fee"" and to end its use of a fixed cash bail system for new arrestees. The settlement agreement was entered into by Judge Rodney W. Sippel on January 3, 2017.","On May 2, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the City of St. Ann, Missouri.

The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice subject only to the continuing jurisdiction of the Court to enforce the settlement agreements and over the equitable claims."
21,CJ-MO-0018,"On August 9, 2016, a group of individuals who were placed in jail because of an inability to pay fines, penalties, and other charges filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The plaintiffs sued thirteen St. Louis County municipalities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 2201. The plaintiffs, represented by ArchCity Defenders and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief, claiming violations of the Fourth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. 

In their complaint, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant municipalities engaged in a deliberate and coordinated conspiracy to fill their coffers by extorting money from thousands of poor, disproportionately African-American people in the St. Louis region. On April 24, 2017, the case was dismissed as to all defendant municipalities except the City of St. Ann. The case (including mediation efforts) is ongoing against the City.","The St. Ann Jail held Mr. Thomas for three days on behalf of Normandy and Edmundson. The conditions in the St. Ann Jail were terrible. The jail cells were packed four people to a cell.


Jail officers provided Mr. Thomas (and other inmates) with a used blanket, but nothing else to separate himself from the disgusting and unsanitary mattress. The food in the St. Ann Jail was unhealthy and nearly inedible. Every meal consisted of a bologna sandwich (with greenish meat and hard bread), applesauce, and black coffee.


There was no bail hearing Mr. Carter could not afford to make this payment and thus was unable to secure his release. The St. Ann Jail held Mr. Carter for three days on behalf of Cool Valley. After three days, Cool Valley “released” Mr Carter.


This payment should have been sufficient to secure Ms. Davis’ release, but it merely cleared her debt to University City. University City held Ms. Davis in jail for approximately one hour. The jail was an older facility that was not well maintained, and had not been cleaned for quite some time.


Each time, the municipal court judge denied these pleas and sent her back to the St. Ann Jail. The conditions at the St. Ann Jail were overcrowded and unsanitary. Although there were only eight beds per cell, roughly 20 women were assigned to each cell.

Women who were ill and experiencing drug withdrawals⎯the symptoms of which included vomiting, flatulence, nausea, and disorientation, among many other things⎯were placed in the same cells, which exacerbated the unsanitary conditions. Inmates at the St. Ann Jail were not allowed to shower until they had been at the jail for a week. Further, there were no trashcans in the cells, so inmates regularly piled their trash in the corner.


In addition to being unsanitary, these conditions created a pungent, unpleasant odor in the jail. The officers at the St. Ann Jail refused to allow Ms. Pierce to use the phone. As a result, she lost her job and her house.


After the St. Ann Jail “released” Ms. Pierce, officers immediately transferred her to the Jennings Jail. The Jennings Jail held Ms. Pierce for three days in equally unsanitary conditions. At the end of three days, Ms. Pierce paid $100 to secure her “release” from Jennings.

After eight days, the St. Ann Jail finally “released” Ms. Ellis and immediately transferred her to the St. Louis County Justice Center on a Hazelwood warrant for traffic-related offenses. The St. Louis County Justice Center held Ms. Ellis for 12 days. During that time, officers at the Justice Center subjected Ms. Ellis to an extremely invasive search, forcing her to undress in front of a police officer who told her that she had “big breasts.”


In 2012, Ms. Fant was jailed in Pine Lawn for “Failure to Pay” or “Failure to Appear.” The Pine Lawn Jail held Ms. Fant with other women in a room the size of a parking lot. The jail provided her a cup to get water from a spout directly above the toilet.

Cool Valley did not provide Mr. Tucker and his fellow inmates with a toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, clean clothes, towel, or any other basic hygiene products. Cool Valley also failed to provide inmates access to a shower. Cool Valley provided Mr. Tucker with two meals per day, which typically consisted of, ostensibly, old food from McDonalds.

One of Ms. Adoboe’s relatives attempted to come to the St. Ann Jail to visit her, but the guards never informed her and she was not allowed to meet with her relative. Guards at the St. Ann Jail limited inmates’ use of phones. For example, if Ms. Adoboe placed a call and the person did not answer the first time, she was not allowed to call them back.


William A. Hellmich (See above for address) LEAD ATTORNEY ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED represented by Cool Valley, City of TERMINATED: 04/24/2017
241 Ms. Adoboe was never brought before a judge during her eight-day detention at the St. Ann jail, nor was she informed of her right to, or offered, a lawyer. 242 St. Ann’s jail refused to give Ms. Adoboe her medication for her serious chronic medical conditions. 243 St. Ann subjected Ms. Adoboe to the same deplorable jail conditions experienced by the other Plaintiffs and all others detained in the St. Ann Jail.
All of these people are currently being threatened with arrest and jailing if they do not make the payments in the amount or frequency purportedly required by Defendant. Defendant has kept hundreds of people in its jail for non-payment in each of the past five years. Defendant retains, and is required by law to retain, records of these instances.
ADR,PROTO,TRCK3 U.S. District Court Eastern District of Missouri (St. Louis) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE 4:16−cv−01302−SEP Thomas et al v","On April 24, 2015, a group of African-American residents of the St. Louis area filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the City of St. Ann. The plaintiffs alleged that the city's police department, municipal court systems, city prosecuting attorneys' offices, and jails had extorted money from thousands of poor, disproportionately African-Americans to fill the municipalities' coffers by extorting money from them. The defendants' unconstitutional revenue-generation scheme disproportionately targets African- American residents, placing jobs at risk, leaving children without supervision, and debasing fundamental human rights, for as long as it takes to strong-arm payment. The plaintiff sought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory damages as well as injunctive relief. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The case is now closed.","On April 24, 2014, the ACLU of Missouri filed this class action lawsuit against Cool Valley, the City of St. Louis, and the St. Ann Jail in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The plaintiffs alleged that the jail conditions were unsanitary, overcrowded, and unsanitary, and that the defendants failed to provide basic hygiene products, food, and access to a shower for inmates. The case was settled in July 2014 and the defendants paid the plaintiffs over $1 million in damages."
22,CJ-NJ-0003,"In June 2017, a man awaiting criminal trial and Lexington National Insurance Corporation filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiffs alleged that that the Criminal Justice Reform Act violated the bail provision of the Eighth Amendment, due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment because the act favored non-monetary pre-trial release conditions over bail. After and appeal to the Third Circuit regarding denial of preliminary injunction and a subsequent denial of certiorari in the Supreme Court, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case. This case is now closed. ","A class action is appropriate for the declaratory and injunctive relief class under Rule 23(b)(2) because New Jersey has acted on grounds that apply generally to the class—namely the new statute forbidding consideration of monetary bail if any combination of non-monetary conditions would reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance at trial. The class seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the unconstitutional provisions of the statute. That relief will necessarily apply to every member of the class and is thus appropriate respecting the class as a whole.
Prosecutors sought to detain Holland pursuant to N.J.S.A.
Plaintiff did not challenge the conditions of release in state court. Instead, he filed this class-action challenge to the CJRA. In addition to the challenge raised by Plaintiff Holland, Plaintiff Lexington National challenges the CJRA, contending that it has standing because under a money bail system “Plaintiff Holland would have used... financial resources... (likely with a surety company such as Plaintiff Lexington National) to pay the required amount for release.”

purchase the right not to be supervised pretrial. As a result, Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction must be denied. Indeed, even accepting all of Plaintiffs’ factual assertions as true, the decision to impose specifically-tailored, least restrictive, liberty-restricting conditions of pretrial release to protect public safety does not violate the Constitution.
Considerations of the Public Interest............... 92 F. Summary of Preliminary Injunction Factors........... 93 SIMANDLE, District Judge: INTRODUCTION This dispute centers on the constitutionality of New Jersey’s recently-enacted Criminal Justice Reform Act (“CJRA”). The matter is presently before the Court upon the motion of Plaintiffs Brittan B. Holland (“Holland”) and Lexington National Insurance Corporation (“Lexington”) for a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants Kelly Rosen, the Team Leader for Pretrial Services in the Criminal Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey; Mary E. Colalillo, the Camden County Prosecutor; and Christopher S. Porrino, the Attorney General of New Jersey, (collectively, “the State Defendants” or “Defendants”), as well as their agents, “from taking any actions to enforce statutory provisions [of the CJRA]... that allow imposition of severe restrictions on the pre-trial liberty of presumptively innocent criminal defendants without offering the option of monetary bail.”
In fact, given Holland’s initial PSA score of 2/6 for failure to appear and 2/6 for new criminal activity, it is possible that Holland could have been released on his own recognizance with lesser restrictions if he had been able to successfully challenge the NVCA flag he received in his PSA. Holland had a right to be released from jail under conditions that were not excessive. Nothing in the record suggests that Holland waived his right to a pretrial detention hearing because he was proffering a money bail as an alternative to home confinement or electronic monitoring; instead, it appears he waived it because he faced the very real possibility of going to jail as a pretrial detainee otherwise, given the state’s allegations of dangerousness.
The Fourth Amendment mandates that [t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

The plaintiffs sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), alleging that the defendant, RealPage, Inc., adopted and maintained a policy and practice of failing to timely update the criminal record information it maintained so as to eliminate records of cases that have been expunged, thus not accurately reflecting the final disposition of these cases. Moreover, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant systematically violated FCRA by failing to provide complete and accurate disclosures of all information the defendant maintains about consumers to these consumers upon request. The parties settled, and the defendant agreed to provide consumers additional information about federal agencies responsible for enforcing FCRA, refrain from including expunged criminal records in tenant screening reports, and disclose the names of vendors who retrieved criminal record information to consumers, plus damages. The settlement term ended in 2020, and the case is now closed. ","Preliminary Statement 1. This is a consumer class action brought for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1681x (FCRA). Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of consumers nationwide who have been the subject of misleading and inaccurate background reports sold by the Defendant RealPage, Inc. (RealPage) to landlords.
On or about January 13, 2015, and after Ms. Stokes had made her dispute of the report provided to Greenway, RealPage prepared and sold a consumer report about Ms. Stokes to Scottish Rite Tower which, like the report sold to Greenway, improperly included the expunged arrests from 2008 and 2010. As a result of the inaccurate report, Scottish Rite Tower denied Ms. Stokes’s rental application. In late January, 2015, Ms. Stokes requested a complete copy of her consumer file.
Instead, RealPage reported the expunged cases from its database, or from the database of a third-party vendor, without any effort to learn whether those cases had been expunged. As a result of the inaccurate report, Greenway denied Stokes’s rental application. Thereafter, she learned from Greenway that RealPage was the source of the report.

(“Defendant” or “RealPage”) willfully violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 – 1681x (“FCRA”) by (i) failing to timely update the criminal record information that it maintains to eliminate records of cases that have been expunged and (ii) failing to provide complete and accurate disclosures of all information it maintains about consumers to those consumers who made a request for their “file”; . WHEREAS, the Stokes Action alleges two class-claims on behalf of two putative classes: (1) a “Stokes Expungement” class alleging a claim for “willfully and/or recklessly failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom a consumer report relates, in violation of section 1681e(b)”; and (2) a “Stokes Disclosure” class alleging a claim for “willfully and/or recklessly failing to provide a complete copy all of [sic] the information on her file upon request, in violation of FCRA section 1681g(a)”; .
28 U.S.C. § 1715(b)(4). The parties have executed a Settlement Agreement and Release, which constitutes the proposed class action settlement. A copy of the agreement is included on the enclosed CD as Exhibit 3.
Plaintiff claims RealPage’s procedures relating to these reports did not conform with a federal law, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (""FCRA""), but RealPage disagrees. Both sides agreed to the Settlement. Who's Included?


What Does the Settlement Provide? The Settlement establishes a $143,000 Settlement Fund for payments to Expungement Settlement Class Members and for attorneys' fees and costs. The amount of the award received by Expungement Settlement Class Members will depend on the number of individuals that remain in the Class.
The Settlement establishes a $936,200 Settlement Fund for payments to Source Settlement Class Members and for attorneys' fees and costs. The amount of the award received by Source Settlement Class Members will depend on the number of individuals that remain in the Class.
What's this Case About? RealPage provided certain consumer report disclosures that included a chart that failed to provide the full address and phone number for every agency responsible for enforcing a federal law, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (""FCRA"").

26,CJ-TN-0015,"In 2020, the Nashville Community Bail Fund filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiff alleged that a local rule which required it to agree to garnishment of judgment fees from bail bonds before it could post bail for indigent arrestees violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution and threatened its ability to operate as a non-profit. The District Judge granted a preliminary injunction in March 2020 enjoining the County Criminal Court Clerk from garnishing fees from bonds posted by the Bail Fund. In December 2020, the District Judge approved a consent decree where the Bail Fund and the County Government agreed to make the injunction permanent. The matter is ongoing as the parties are litigating over who should pay attorneys fees and how much.","As a result, an increasing portion of NCBF funds remains on deposit with Gentry instead of returning to the NCBF’s revolving fund. This increasingly limits the funds available to the NCBF to bail out persons who are trapped in jail due to unaffordable bail amounts. As of the filing of this complaint, the NCBF estimates it will lose at least $7,463.49 bail deposits it has paid since September 30, 2019 due to the garnishment policy.

The court held that, while the Clerk was correct that the Twentieth Judicial District was an arm of the State of Tennessee, he was mistaken that he had no obligation to respond to the lawsuit in that capacity merely because service had—by his consent—been effected through Metro Legal. The court therefore did not dismiss any aspect of the action. The court also determined that the factors governing preliminary injunctions, including likelihood of success on the merits, favored granting an injunction prohibiting the Clerk from enforcing Rule 10(B) and the surrounding policies against NCBF.

27,CJ-TX-0009,"In May of 2016 two indigent people brought a suit against the City of El Paso in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for jailing them for failure to pay fines, despite their inability to do so. The plaintiffs brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983, and allege that the Defendants violated their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief. They want to enjoin the Defendants from enforcing their current debt collection program, which jails people who can't pay a certain portion of their fines for traffic and misdemeanor offenses. The Plaintiffs allege that Defendants adopted their debt collection program to generate revenue for they city, and the individual plaintiffs were not informed that they could assert their indigence. Rather, the Plaintiffs were simply told they had to pay or go to jail. On January 12th, 2017 Judge David Guaderrama granted the Defendant's motion to dismiss in part. Judge Guaderrama dismissed the Due Process claims, but did not reach the Equal Protection claims.

The Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in January 2017, and after the Court denied two motions to dismiss filed by defendants over the course of 2017, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the action pursuant to a settlement agreement. In the settlement agreement, defendants agreed to maintain certain administrative practices for three years. Among other things, these practices related to notice to defendants, policies and procedures for: payment plans; notice to defendants of court hearings and schedules; and indigency hearings and warrants issued for non-payment. ","The remaining thirty-five directly stemmed from Ms. Canaan's indigency, such as fines for driving with an expired license, inability to afford insurance, or inability to maintain her vehicle registration. In total, Defendant claimed that Ms. Canaan owed more than $10,000. Defendant's employees arrested Ms. Canaan on two occasstons as a result of warrants issued after Ms. Canaan failed to appear to pay her fines.

Defendant and its employees aod/or agents have entered into an agreement to intentionally violate due process rights in order to increase Defendant's revenue streams from traffic violations. Specifically, Defendant and its employees and/or agents have agreed to intentionally refuse to inform low-income debtors of their rights, and to intentionally refuse to properly inquire into a debtors' financial inability to pay their fines and/or the debtors' reasons for failing to pay. Defendant and its employees and/or agents knew this was and is a violation of due process requirements, and formed the agreement with the specific intent of violating those due process rights as a coercive mechanism in Defendant's debt collection efforts.
Further, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend; however, the Court will allow Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint consistent with this opinion. I.

28,CJ-TX-0015,"In January 2016, two indigent women that served imprisonment terms at the Randall County Jail filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Plaintiffs alleged that the City of Amarillo's municipal code created a modern-day debtors' prison and violated their Fourteenth Amendment Rights. In August 2016, the Court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss and ordered the plaintiffs to pay $3,660.00 in litigation costs. ","JURISDICTION 10. This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction) and § 1343 (civil rights jurisdiction).

The Municipal Court is a subdivision of the City’s Finance division. The City contracts with the Randall County Jail to house those who are ordered by municipal court judges to serve jail time. When someone is charged with a Class C Misdemeanor in Amarillo Municipal Court and is convicted either by plea or trial, they are ordered to pay a fine and court costs by a Municipal Court Judge.

Whether the City can employ incarceration, threats of incarceration, and other harsh debt-collection measures (such as applying arbitrary and unreasonable payment schedules) against debtors who cannot afford immediately to pay their debts in full; j.

Plaintiffs have no known interests which are adverse to or in conflict with other members of the putative classes that would make class certification inappropriate. Plaintiffs have retained attorneys who are competent and experienced in complex litigation including civil rights litigation. Counsel have both handled numerous cases on behalf of individuals who suffered Constitutional deprivations which resulted in personal injury, wrongful death, unlawful convictions, unlawful imprisonment, and other damages.

NO. 2:16-CV-00009-J MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint for Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted Per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(B)(6), filed on March 16, 2016. In that Motion, Defendant, the City of Amarillo, requests that the Court dismiss all of Plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (§ 1983) claims for municipal liability.

Plaintiffs filed a Response on April 6, 2016, arguing that Plaintiffs' Complaint plausibly alleged § 1983 claims. Defendant filed a Reply on April20, 2016.

Defendant's Motion is GRANTED. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs Rachel McKee, Lonetta Jackson, Janet Cato, Larissa Coil, Joshua Moore, and Hilario Nayola (Plaintiffs) filed suit under § 1983 against Defendant, the City of Amarillo (the City), alleging that the City's fine collection system is unconstitutional as applied to indigent individuals. Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges the City instituted a ""modern day debtor's prison"" by imposing ""a jail sentence on persons who did not pay fines assessed for non-jailable offenses.""
Plaintiffs eventually appeared before the Amarillo Municipal Court to address the unpaid fines. According to the Complaint, the municipal judge provided Plaintiffs with two options: pay the fines or go to jail. Plaintiffs, allegedly unable to pay, were incarcerated for failure to pay fines assessed for non-jailable offenses.
AMARILLO, TEX., CODE OF ORDINANCES § 2-8-111. Plaintiffs allege that municipal officers, by enforcing Section 2-8-111, violated constitutional rights afforded to indigent individuals unable to pay fines. 1 Plaintiffs' Complaint argues that the City is liable for such constitutional violations under § 1983.
The City Charter, by adopting Article 45.046 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, provides an exception to Section 2-8-111 's automatic incarceration. This exception prevents municipal judges from confining indigent defendants to jail for failure to pay a fine without first determining indigency status and considering adequate alternatives to incarceration. Only after conducting the proper procedures and concluding the indigent defendant willfully or unjustifiably failed to discharge the fine through payment or community service is the municipal court required to jail individuals for the failure to pay.
It is SO ORDERED.

This class action lawsuit began with the filing of a complaint on June 6, 2002, in the Superior Court of Fulton County. This case was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Generally, Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants DeKalb County, Fulton County, and the State of Georgia are violating various constitutional and statutory rights of children in the custody of the respective Juvenile Courts of DeKalb and Fulton Counties and in the custody of the State of Georgia’s foster care system.

I contend in part III that an enhancement on these grounds is not available in cases like the one before us. In NAACP, we vacated and remanded the district court's decision refusing to grant an attorney's fee enhancement.

Claiming that deficiencies in the foster-care system in two counties near Atlanta violated their federal and state constitutional and statutory rights, respondents sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as attorney's fees and expenses. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia eventually referred the case to mediation, where the parties entered into a consent decree, which the District Court approved. The consent decree resolved all pending issues 1670*1670 other than the fees that respondents' attorneys were entitled to receive under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.
Petitioners objected to the fee request, contending that some of the proposed hourly rates were too high, that the hours claimed were excessive, and that the enhancement would duplicate factors that were reflected in the lodestar amount. The District Court awarded fees of approximately $10.5 million. See 454 F.Supp.2d 1260, 1296 (N.D.Ga.2006).

The plaintiffs alleged that the Division failed to protect the children and provide them with legally required services. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in January 2015 that required the Division to implement a series of reforms to improve the child welfare system in the state. The agreement also required the Department of Human Services (DHS) to provide the plaintiffs with a report on the progress made in implementing the reforms.","On September 2, 2003, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Department of Children and Family Services (DCF) and the New Jersey Department of Social Services (DSS). The plaintiffs alleged that the DSS was violating the federal civil rights statute by failing to provide appropriate treatment to children in its care. The DSS filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state claim, which was granted in part and denied in part. The case was dismissed on October 2, 2012 and the parties entered into a modified settlement agreement (MSA) in October 2012. The MSA was designed to improve the state’s compliance with the goals, principles and outcomes of the MSA. The MSA required DSS to provide a written case plan for each child in foster care, provide training to foster care workers, provide case management services to foster parents, and provide services to the child's foster family. The settlement agreement was approved and entered into by the Court in September 2003."

The case was filed on December 13, 1995, and the parties reached to two separate settlement agreements, one with the city and one with the state, on December 2, 1988. The plaintiffs returned to court in January 2001, seeking an order directing the state to comply with specific terms of the state settlement agreement. The court found that the state had acted with insufficient diligence in implementing the information management system, and therefore extended the terms of the agreement in this area and directed that the plaintiffs receive semi-annual reports. The defendants provided a January 2017 report to show that they were continuing to develop, implement, and update their information systems for child welfare needs. A year later, the court ended its supervision of the portions of the settlement that it had retained jurisdiction to enforce.

While not determinative, plaintiffs' tardiness in raising this jurisdictional challenge reinforces defendants' argument that plaintiffs were not prejudiced by recertification in this case. Balancing all of these considerations, we denied plaintiffs' motion to dismiss. Although we hold that recertification was proper in this case, we caution that ""[t]he power to renew the certification should be used carefully to prevent misuse of interlocutory appeals for the purpose or with the effect of harassing an adversary or fostering delay.""
Both cases are inapposite, and neither remotely involves subclasses. In neither case was a class certified by the district court. Rather, in East Texas Motor Freight the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit certified a class, and was reversed by the Supreme Court for doing so.
[JA 1156] On December 2, 1998, the parties presented two settlement agreements for district court approval pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 23 (e): an agreement between the Marisol Class and the City Defendants (the ""City Settlement Agreement""), and a separate agreement between the Marisol Class See also [JA 1357] (Class counsel stating that plaintiffs reviewed ""hundreds of thousands of pages of documents""). and the State Defendants (the ""State Settlement Agreement""). [JA 728, 755] The Settlement Agreements provide no direct, concrete, effective or reasonably certain relief for the Marisol Class members, yet the Agreements bind Class members to a sweeping release and covenants-not-to-sue.
(App Br p. The State Agreement provides a two-year moratorium on class action lawsuits. If the alleged class or system-wide violations in Marisol A. continue to occur after twenty-four months, a new class action can be filed.
There is no dispute that the Joel A. objectors are members of the third subclass of Marisol plaintiffs: children in the custody of ACS. The Settlement Agreements After more than two years of intensive discovery and on the eve of trial in July 1998, the parties informed the district court that they were engaged in settlement negotiations. The trial date was postponed and the parties conducted negotiations for over four months.

INTRODUCTION This is the first report on the progress of the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) in meeting the requirements of the Final Settlement Agreement (FSA), entered in Michelle H., et al v. McMaster and Alford. Approved by the United States District Court on October 4, 2016, the FSA includes requirements governing the care and treatment of the more than 4,000 children in foster care in South Carolina1 and incorporates provisions that had been ordered in the previous year in a Consent Immediate Interim Relief Order (the Interim Order)2. The report has been prepared by court-appointed independent Co-Monitors Paul Vincent and Judith Meltzer, with assistance from monitoring staff Rachel Paletta, Elissa Gelber and Gayle Samuels, and is presented to The Honorable Richard Gergel, U.S. District Court Judge, Parties to the lawsuit (Governor McMaster, DSS and Plaintiffs) and the public.

It was crafted by state leaders and Plaintiffs, who conceived it to include commitments that would guide a multi-year reform effort. The FSA reflects DSS’s agreement to address long-standing problems experienced by children in foster care custody and in the operation of South Carolina’s child welfare system. It includes a broad range of provisions governing: caseworker caseloads; visits between children in foster care and their caseworkers and family members; investigations of allegations of abuse and neglect of children in foster care; appropriate and timely foster care and therapeutic placements; and access to physical and mental health care for children in DSS custody.

INTRODUCTION This is the third report on the progress of the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) in meeting the requirements of the Final Settlement Agreement (FSA) entered in Michelle H., et al v. McMaster and Alford. Approved by the United States District Court on October 4, 2016, the FSA includes requirements governing the care and treatment of the more than 4,500 children in foster care in South Carolina1 and incorporates provisions that had been ordered in the previous year in a Consent Immediate Interim Relief Order (the Interim Order)2. This report has been prepared by court-appointed independent Co-Monitors Paul Vincent and Judith Meltzer, with assistance from monitoring staff Rachel Paletta, Elissa Gelber, Gayle Samuels and Erika Feinman, and is presented to The Honorable Richard Gergel, U.S. District Court Judge, Parties to the lawsuit (Governor McMaster, DSS and Plaintiffs) and the public.
FAMILY VISITATION Children who have been removed from their homes must spend time with family members while in foster care. The FSA includes requirements related to visits between children in foster care and their siblings and parents. DSS performance with respect to sibling visits declined this reporting period.
As a result of this initiative, all children and youth placed into foster care, with few exceptions, are enrolled in First Choice by Select Health of South Carolina, a Managed Care Organization to meet their medical and behavioral health needs. Select Health is required to provide foster care child members “medically necessary” care. Specific core benefits and service requirements are set forth in Section 4 of the DHHS and Select Health MCO contract143.
Eligibility and Covered Services Children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid the day they enter placement and the vast majority of children in foster care are covered by Medicaid managed care through Select Health146. Select Health provides medical and mental health services and DentaQuest provides dental care. Many children enter foster care already enrolled in Medicaid or Medicaid eligible.

Plaintiff also claimed that the Restaurants’ men’s restrooms, seating areas and parking areas were inaccessible and that the entrances to the Pacific Beach Restaurant were inaccessible. This Court adjudicated these claims in its June 17, 2007 summary judgment order.
[Doc No. Plaintiff claimed that Defendant denied him full and equal access 28 to two of its restaurants, one in Encinitas and the other in Pacific Beach. Plaintiff claimed 05cv1660 J (WMc) 1 that he was denied the Chipotle experience because the 44 inch food preparation counters 2 obstructed his view.

There are numerous issues related to SST, the city’s public transportation system, as well as several of the city’s other programs and facilities. Both Mr. Richardson and Mr. Steele have encountered buses without lifts or with broken lifts Mr. Richardson must often wait as long as an hour — while three or four buses pass him by — before a properly equipped, accessible bus arrives at his stop.
For example, some of the bus stops have shelters inside of which patrons of the bus system may shield themselves from the winter wind and cold as they wait. Some of these shelters are inaccessible to persons who use wheelchairs. Mr. Richardson’s case of frostbite was at least partially due to the inaccessibility of a shelter.
They have also been injured by the stigma of Defendant’s discrimination, which has been and continues to be a barrier to the full participation of people with disabilities in the Steamboat Springs community. In addition to the accessibility barriers to Steamboat Springs’ public transportation system, there are several other facilities in Steamboat Springs that are inaccessible to individuals with disabilities, particularly persons who use wheelchairs. For example: a.
The parking lot at Spring Creek Reservoir, a city-owned and -operated park that Mr. Steele frequents, is almost exclusively reserved for persons with disabilities. Steamboat Springs, however, removed a wheelchair-accessible portable restroom from this location, leaving only an inaccessible, standard portable restroom.
b. Mr. Steele has attended the Chariot Races held in the winter at Romick Rodeo Arena, part of the City’s Howelsen Hill Complex. These races are inaccessible to persons who use wheelchairs. There is no disabled parking available for this event.

CITY OF STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Defendant. INTRODUCTION On July 1, 1999, Timothy Richardson and Jonathan Steele (“Individual Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against the City of Steamboat Springs, Colorado (“City”), alleging that the City had discriminated against them on the basis of disability in connection with the provision of transit service and certain other City services, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12149 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehabilitation Act”), 29 U.S.C. § 794. By Order dated April 20, 2000, the United States intervened in Individual Plaintiffs’ action against the City to the extent that it alleged violations of transportation provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.
At the time the City operator requests dispatch of such alternate transportation, the operator shall inform the disabled individual of the expected time of arrival of the accessible vehicle, and when the dispatcher is on duty, the dispatcher shall record the times of the request and the dispatch of alternate transportation. The City shall continue to provide comprehensive training for all bus and van operators, dispatchers, and mechanics. The City shall also provide said training upon hiring of any new operator or mechanic, whether or not said employee previously worked for the City.
The City denies and continues to deny any and all liability to Individual Plaintiffs for any such claims. As part of this Consent Decree, the City agrees to the following: 1. The three, accessible parking spaces on the east side of the rodeo grounds at Howelsen Hill complex shall continue to exist as designated, accessible spaces for the term of this Consent Decree.

The parties settled, with Defendants agreeing not to obstruct wheelchair areas and to pay damages and attorneys' fees and costs.","Defendant Every Dog Has Its Day, Inc. is a Colorado corporation and is a general partner in the partnership of Fey Concerts. Defendant Museum of Outdoor Arts (“MOA”) is the owner of Fiddler’s Green. The eight-acre site was donated to the MOA in 1986.
This action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) because the discriminatory conduct at issue failure to provide appropriate wheelchair and companion seating at Fiddler’s Green is applicable to all members of the class and therefore an injunction requiring such seating is appropriate. In addition, the injunctive relief is the predominant relief sought by the class. This action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) because the many questions of law and fact which are common to class members clearly predominate over individual questions affecting members of the class.
Sharon Brown-Jodoin and Leo Jodoin complained to Fiddler’s Green staff about the seating arrangement, but the Fiddler’s Green staff responded that they could do nothing to solve the problem. On May 30, 1997, Sharon Brown-Jodoin and her husband attended the Tina Turner concert at Fiddler’s Green as a celebration of their wedding anniversary. Upon arriving at the wheelchair seating section at the Tina Turner concert, Sharon Brown-Jodoin and Leo Jodoin discovered that the front section of wheelchair seating was occupied by machinery and persons operating the machinery and, thus, there was no available seating for them in that section.
When purchasing tickets for concerts at Fiddler’s Green, persons with mobility limitations who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids have only one choice of wheelchair seating at a single specified price. This violates the ADA. Defendants provide a range of seating possibilities to non-disabled concert-goers which are unavailable to persons who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids and their companions in violation of the ADA.
On information and belief, none of these boxes is accessible to persons who use wheelchairs in accordance with ADAAG standards. b. Defendants also offer general admission seats to nondisabled customers, which is less expensive than the reserved seats. Persons who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids are not offered seats in this area.
On information and belief, no ADA compliant wheelchair seating currently exists in the general admission area. c. Defendants also offer a “Premier Ticket Program” for nondisabled concert-goers. According to Defendants’ promotional materials, “[t]he same outstanding seats can be yours all season long!
Because Defendants continuously permit the only available wheelchair seating to be blocked at Fiddler’s Green, this ticket program is also unavailable to persons who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids and their companions. d. Defendants offer a “Group Sales Program” for nondisabled concert-goers. According to Defendants’ promotional materials, “[t]hrough Fiddler's special group savings package, your firm or organization can save on regular admission prices!
Defendants Fey Concert Company, Universal Concerts, Inc. and Every Dog Has Its Day, Inc., through promotional brochures, Internet websites, the Ticketmaster seating manuals, and the representations of Ticketmaster ticket agents all advertise and/or claim that Fiddler’s Green provides “wheelchair seating,” and depict the wheelchair seating area as being that area described above in paragraph 33. Ticketmaster, Inc. and the Fiddler’s Green box office are Defendants’ agents with regard to the sales of tickets for concerts at Fiddler’s Green. Defendants Fey Concert Company, Universal Concerts, Inc. and Every Dog Has Its Day, Inc. continue to advertise that they sell tickets for “wheelchair seating” in the reserved seating section.
Nature of litigation.
Plaintiffs filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado as Civil Action No. 97-Z-1586 (the ""Litigation"") alleging both individual and class action claims.

42 U.S.C. § 12132. In commencing this action under the ADA, the United States seeks to end Amtrak’s decades-long failure to make its stations accessible to individuals with disabilities so that they can fully participate in and benefit from Amtrak’s transportation services. See 42 U.S.C. § 12133.
Plaintiff is the United States of America. Defendant Amtrak is a provider of intercity rail transportation service. ADA 11.
P&As and CAPs work to improve the lives of people with disabilities, including by ensuring access and accountability in health care, education, employment, housing, transportation, voting, and within the juvenile and criminal justice systems. The complaint included an NDRN-generated report alleging that Amtrak stations across the country were inaccessible in violation of the ADA. NDRN based its report on more than 100 on-site surveys conducted in the summer of 2013 of Amtrak stations across the country.
The United States alleges Amtrak violated Title II of the ADA by failing to make the existing stations1 for which it is responsible in its intercity rail transportation system readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, per the U.S. Department of Transportation Standards for Accessible Transportation Facilities (“DOT Standards”), 49 C.F.R. §§ 37.9 and 37.43, and 49 C.F.R. Part 37, Appendix A. The United States further alleges this has harmed passengers with disabilities using or seeking to use Amtrak’s services. Amtrak denies these allegations and asserts that it is, and has been, committed to complying with the ADA and to accommodating individuals with disabilities, but it enters into this Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) voluntarily in order to continue in good faith to devote significant resources to improve transportation services to passengers with disabilities as it has for several years, rather than in litigation.
ADA Stations Program (“ADASP”) 10. Amtrak alleges it has expended hundreds of millions of dollars improving access to its trains in a variety of ways. Beginning in 2009, Amtrak implemented the ADA Stations Program (“ADASP”), through which Amtrak plans for the design and construction of ADA-compliant station facilities, including buildings, passenger platforms, and parking.
Absent circumstances reasonably outside of Amtrak’s control, e.g., an extended leave of absence, all Covered Employees will be provided with such training within three years of commencement of training, and approximately every two years thereafter throughout the duration of this Agreement. Settlement Agreement between the United States and National Passenger Railroad Corporation Amtrak 21. Amtrak will provide ADA training to newly hired Covered Employees within 60 days of their start date as a Covered Employee in a relevant position absent circumstances reasonably outside of Amtrak’s control or, if the relevant training for the particular position is already scheduled to occur within 120 days of their start date, then by that date.

40,DR-FL-0004,"On July 22, 2013, attorneys from United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the State of Florida. The DOJ alleged that nearly two hundred children with disabilities were unnecessarily segregated from their communities and the general population by the State, which had placed them in nursing homes. The DOJ sought an injunction requiring the State to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131-12134, which, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of disabled individuals, and mandates that their rehabilitative and medical needs be provided in a manner that enables disabled individuals to be independent and integrated members of the community. In June 2014, the case was consolidated with another pending case, which is in the Clearinghouse as PB-FL-0007.","See infra pp. INVESTIGATION On December 20, 2011, we sent your office a letter providing notice that the Department of Justice (the “Department”) had opened an investigation of the State with respect to the services it provides to children with disabilities under the age of twenty-one, including children who have medically fragile or medically complex conditions. We stated that the focus of our investigation was whether the State’s policies and practices regarding the services it provides these individuals violate federal law, including Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12132, and its implementing regulations, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).
Many of the residents we observed were left in their beds or mobility devices for long periods at a time with limited access to the type of interactions that promote physical, psychological and social development. The educational opportunities available to children and young adults who are placed in these facilities are also quite limited. A large number of children participate in public school districts’ hospital/homebound programs, which serve children who are deemed ineligible to participate in an integrated classroom environment for medical or other reasons.
With the supports provided through these waivers and other Medicaid services, hundreds, and in some states thousands, of families are able to stay united and children and young adults are able to participate in educational, social, and recreational activities in their own communities. The children in Florida’s nursing facilities and their families are no different. The State Violates the ADA by Failing to Serve Qualified Individuals with Disabilities in the Most Integrated Setting Appropriate to their Needs Under the ADA, public entities are required to “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”
For example, as described above, the State has established utilization review processes for certain in-home services. These processes require families of children receiving in-home services to recertify every six months that the services are medically necessary. However, on numerous occasions, the State has reduced or denied the availability of prescribed in-home services at these recertification periods, even where the child’s condition and their families’ ability to provide care had not changed.

Many young adults, who entered nursing facilities as children and grew up in these institutions, remain unnecessarily segregated from their communities.1 As a result of limitations on community-based services and deficient assessment and transition planning processes, the Institutionalized Children have spent their formative years separated from their families and apart from their communities, often very far from home.

41,DR-MI-0003,"In 2005, two organizations that advocates for people with disabilities filed this lawsuit n the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the City of Detroit, claiming that the city had failed to meet federal and Michigan accessibility standards in altering intersections and sidewalks.  In 2006, the parties negotiated a plant to correct the affected intersections and sidewalks. As of 2018, a special master continues to monitor implementation of the agreement. ","PLAINTIFF 7.

Its Board of Directors and staff, is composed of a majority of people with mobility and/or sight disabilities, along with volunteers.

CAUSES OF ACTION FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: CLAIM UNDER TITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT 11. Plaintiff brings this count under Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) for declaratory and injunctive relief, and for damages. Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: CLAIM UNDER THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973 20. Plaintiff brings this claim for declaratory and injunctive relief and for damages. The Rehabilitation Act requires that when a public entity that receives federal funding builds or alters any part of a facility, it shall to the maximum extent possible, be made so that it is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
Plaintiffs demands that these ramps, sidewalks and intersections be brought into compliance as soon as possible. In addition, CCA and MPVA seek an Order that all future resurfacing and alterations in Detroit comply with the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and Michigan law. CAUSES OF ACTION FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: CLAIM UNDER TITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT 27.

43,DR-MS-0001,"A class action lawsuit was filed on July 10, 2012, against the Mississippi Department of Education, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA), alleging that the defendant had failed to execute its responsibilities under IDEA, by not ensuring that the Jackson Public School District provide disabled students with a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment, even after conducting an investigation into the School District and identifying its systemic failure to meet its IDEA obligations. The parties reached a settlement on September 29, 2014 stipulating the implementation of a Program Sustainability Plan for the 2014-2015 school year.

Upon information and belief, MDE submitted JPS's proposed CAP to the technical advisor for review sometime in January or Febmary 2011.

The Mississippi Department of Education bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that local school districts such as JPS comply with the IDEA and for ensuring that all students with disabilities, regardless of the nature or severity of the disability, receive FAPE in the least restrictive environment. Despite this clear federal mandate, the Defendant has utterly failed Plaintiff and similarly situated students with disabilities in JPS. Nearly two years ago, in response to a class-wide state administrative complaint filed by the Plaintiff and a class of similarly situated shldents, MDE documented a host of systemic IDEA violations within JPS that resulted in the denial of FAPE to potentially tbousands of shldents.

This is a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of children with disabilities in the Jackson Public School District (“JPS”) to hold the Mississippi Department of Education (“MDE”) accountable for ensuring that they receive the free appropriate public education they are entitled to receive under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.

The balance of equities strongly favors the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs are a class of students with significant disabilities who attend Jackson Public Schools who have been subjected to multiple disciplinary removals and who have been denied meaningful educational benefit from their IEPs. MDE has documented that for years, class members have been denied the educational and supportive services they need to achieve and have been forced into substandard segregated settings.

44,DR-NY-0009,"On August 3, 2006, plaintiffs, a group of disabled persons receiving public benefits filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the South District of New York against the New York Human Resources Administration alleging that it discriminated against disabled persons by involuntarily segregating them by transferring their public benefits cases from local benefit centers to three hub centers that only serviced people with disabilities. The Court approved a proposed settlement agreement in June of 2015. ","This action involves allegations of discrimination on the basis of disability by the New York City Human Resources Administration (“HRA”) at “hub centers” and Job Centers in New York City operated by HRA. The case arises out of HRA’s WeCARE (“Wellness, Comprehensive Assessment, Rehabilitation and Employment”) program. As WeCARE was originally conceived, public assistance recipients who have a mental or physical impairment had their public assistance cases transferred from their local Job Center to one of three “hub centers” in the Bronx, Brooklyn, or Manhattan.
Plaintiffs also alleged that the procedure HRA adopted for requesting and obtaining an exemption from transfer violated due process of law. Plaintiffs moved for certification of a class of public assistance recipients who have a disability within the meaning of the State Human Rights Law, N.Y Exec. Law § 292(21) (McKinney’s 2005), and who have received or will receive a notice transferring their case to a hub center, and a subclass consisting of all class members who have a disability within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq. 5.
Serv L. § 331(3). The defendant discriminated against plaintiffs on the basis of handicap in violation of N.Y Soc. Serv L. § 331(3) by having assigned them to separate facilities for programs offered by the New York City social services district under Title EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF VIOLATIONS OF THE REGULATIONS OF THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES 228.
Previously, those individuals had been able to report to 29 neighborhood offices. This lawsuit followed in August 2005. Plaintiffs allege violations of the Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (""the ADA""), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 (""the Rehabilitation Act""), the Due Process Clauses of both the U.S. and New York State Constitutions, and various New York State and City civil rights statutes and regulations.
The parties then conducted extensive discovery to identify those class members who had had appointments at hub centers t failed to appear for those appointments and whose cases were closed or suffered sanctions as a result. The parties attempted to negotiate a settlement of monetary claims. In November 2006 t the parties entered into a stipulation in which they agreed that those individuals with currently opened cases would receive monetary payments according to a formula.
To date, the parties have been unable to resolve their remaining differences regarding payments to class members whose cases remain closed. In November 2011, this case was transferred to this Court. Despite the passage of years since the case was filed, a number of issues remained open.
Staff Training a. HRA agrees to develop new ADA training curricula (“ADA Training”) for various levels of staff across the Agency as well as a Disability Evaluation training curricula for Agency and Vendor staff charged with evaluating disability and RA requests. Defendant will provide Plaintiffs’ counsel with draft training materials for their review and comment. Plaintiffs’ counsel will provide any comments within fourteen (14) calendar days.
GENERAL PROVISIONS 148. Defendant agrees that Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable counsel fees and costs as though they are prevailing parties. The Parties agree to attempt to negotiate the amount of such counsel fees and costs.
If they are unable to agree on an amount within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date, Plaintiffs may submit an application for counsel fees and costs to the Court, and Defendant reserves the right to respond to such an application in a manner that is consistent with this paragraph.

Defendant DOE operates the public school system in all five boroughs of the City of New York, providing educational programs and services to well over one million students in 1,866 schools, including public charter schools. Approximately 227,000 of these students receive special education under the IDEA. The DOE public school system is divided into thirty-two community school districts, which provide educational services largely based on geographic criteria.
Upon information and belief, Staten Island District 75 students rarely have a chance to earn the standard diploma that other students in New York City public schools are awarded. The graduation rates for students with disabilities educated by the DOE shows this inequality in education. In 2019, the latest year for which data is publicly available, only 53% of students with disabilities in New York City graduated in four years compared to 83% of high school students without disabilities.

COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Almost forty years after Congress mandated, through passage of the Rehabilitation Act, that institutions in receipt of federal funds could not discriminate on the basis of disability, defendant Free Library of Philadelphia (“Library”) has initiated and subsequently expanded a NOOK e-reading device lending program for older library patrons knowing that this device is completely inaccessible to its blind patrons. The Library has developed this lending program in an effort to “bridge the digital divide” between young and old patrons, but in doing so has needlessly exacerbated the “digital divide” between disabled and non-disabled library patrons.
However, because e-books are not inherently visual, audible, or tactile, they provide individuals with an opportunity to access content through whatever methods are accessible to them. For the first time, there exist commercially available portable e-book readers that allow blind and sighted readers to use the same means of accessing the written word and get at the same content. By choosing to lend inaccessible devices, the Library discriminates against its blind patrons and segregates them needlessly from its programs and activities.
The Library has repeatedly been alerted to the federal requirement to acquire only accessible technology and the need to conform its practices to federal law: a. In July 2009, the American Library Association (“ALA”), of which the Library is a member, passed a resolution “strongly recommend[ing]” that its members ensure that electronic resources comply with federal accessibility guidelines. See Exhibit A. b.
Civil Case No.: 12-cv-2373 FREE LIBRARY OF PHILADELPHIA, NOTICE OF DISMISSAL Plaintiffs, by undersigned counsel, submit this Notice to Dismiss with Prejudice pursuant to FED R. CIV P. 41(a)(2). Plaintiffs and Defendant have entered into a Final Settlement Agreement. See Exhibit 1.
Consistent w ith that mission, the Library is strongly committed to making its programs ava ilabl e to patrons who are bl ind or have other print disabilities. In November, 20 II pursuant to a grant, the Library initiated a pi lot program aimed at prov iding patrons over the age of 50 wi th access toe-reader technology. In addition to offering train ing classes that incl uded access ible dev ices, the Library began lending Nook Simple Touch devices to patrons 50 years of age or over from its Central Parkway location.
The Nook Simple Touch is a mainstream e-reading dev ice manufactured and sold by Barnes Noble. The device is inaccessible to the blind.
Specifically, it lacks text-to-speech output of its content and with the exception of a power button and a ""wake up"" button, all of the Nook's features and settings are operated through a touch screen that provides no audibl e or tactile feedback.
Plaintiffs are blind li brary patrons over the age of 50 who wou ld like to participate in the Library's e-read ing device lending program. Plaintiffs filed suit against the Library in th e United States District Court fo r the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Case Number 2: 12-cv-02373-MSG (the Action), alleging that the Library's lending program violates Section 504 of the Rehabi litation Act of 1973 (""Rehabilitation Act"") and title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""). Plaintiffs contend that th e Rehabilitation Act prohibits a recipient of federal fund s from discriminating against or excluding peopl e with disabi lities from its programs or activities.
While it denies any legal liabi li ty alleged in Pla inti ffs' Complai nt, the Library has been responsive to the concerns raised by Plaintiffs' lawsu it. The Parties share a common goal of creati ng a single, integrated e-book reader lending program that uses only e-book reading dev ices that are accessible to both blind and none! isabled Iibrary patrons.
In the hope of reaching this shared goal in a cooperative manner, the Library and the Plaintiffs agree as fo llows: DEFINITIONS 9.

BOWMAN, Circuit Judge. Thomas and Dianna Bradley bring this suit on behalf of their autistic son to challenge multiple aspects of the educational services provided to him while he was a student in the Williford, Arkansas, school district.
I Thcy claim thc school district, the Arkansas Department of Education (DOE), and state education officials have violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400- IThe Bradleys filed their first suit in 1996 and filed a second suit in 2000. These cases have been consolidated hy the District Court. The suit has been brought both on behalf of their son and as a class action.
Despite this lengthy history and the breadth of the underlying complaint, we are asked in this appeal to address the quite narrow question of whether three state DOE officials-Ray Simon, Marcia Harding, and Mike Crowley (collectively, the state officials)3-are entitled to qualified immunity. A district lRay Simon has been the Director of the Arkansas Department of Education (DOE) since 1997.

The Bradleys requested home schooling based on a recommendation from Dr Hartman. Williford refused to provide the requested schooling. The Bradleys presented an evaluation from a psychologist, Dr. Zurkowski, that David had school phobia and should not attend school.
Williford continued to refuse to provide homebound instruction. In February 1998 the Bradleys sought a due process hearing.
The Court credits the testimony of Dr. Howard Knoff wherein following a review of David's test scores he opined that David made educational progress. Williford provided appropriate training for its personnel in the implementation of the IEP's. Williford provided David personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit him to benefit educationally.
By the time the School District contacted the therapist and arranged for payment and transportation to the therapist's office in Jonesboro (about an hour and a half away from Williford), the implementation of this IEP service was six days late. The School District was directed to provide two hours ofcompensatory occupational therapy. As David's eighth-grade year was drawing to a close in the spring of 1996, David's IEP team met to review and revise the IEP in anticipation ofDavid's ninthgrade year.
In February and March 2004, the District Court held a bench trial on the Bradleys' claims and issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court determined that none of the defendants violated federal law. The Bradleys appeal, raising three issues under the IDEA and one under § 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act. For their first IDEA issue, the Bradleys challenge a fmding by the District Court necessary to the conclusion that the Williford School District did not violate the IDEA in its handling of the education of David Bradley.
These findings are not clearly erroneous. We hold that the District Court properly dismissed all ofthe Bradleys' claims. The judgment is affirmed.

The case settled for a consent decree entered August 15, 2002, which required the defendants to implement a mandatory staff training program, revise its policies, select compliance coordinators, develop systems for reporting harassment and discrimination, allow students to form a gay-straight alliance, and create a community advisory group.  The decree implementation period was 6 months.  ","Plaintiff 11 George Loomis also seeks monetary damages for the discrimination he has suffered. Students experience pervasive, severe, and unwelcome harassment and 13 discrimination at VUSD schools, including but not limited to Golden West High School 14 (“Golden West”), based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation. Students who are gay 15 or who are perceived to be gay are verbally harassed by their classmates, who refer to them in 16 the classrooms and the hallways as “faggots, ” “fags,” “queers,” and “homos.”
As another example, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that a student 20 directed a death threat to a gay student at Golden West. On or about November 2000, 21 Plaintiffs are informed and believe that students at Golden West spray painted “Fag” on a 22 pickup truck driven by another student. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that one gay student at Golden West was 24 attacked on campus by students yelling “fag,” “queer,” and other derogatory terms.
THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT AT VUSD SCHOOLS CREATED AND FOSTERED BY DEFENDANTS CAUSES SUBSTANTIAL INJURY TO GSA NETWORK, ITS MEMBERS, PLAINTIFF GEORGE LOOMIS, AND STUDENTS AND PARENTS. The hostile environment towards gays and lesbians at Golden West 9 discourages students from questioning or confronting their own sexual orientation or forming 10 or joining support groups such as GSAs for fear that doing so could subject them to verbal 11 and physical harassment. GSAs and other support groups have not yet organized in the 12 VUSD due to the fact that students may face retaliatory harassment in the event that they 13 would be discovered as participating in such an organization.
Defendants and other VUSD teachers and administrators not only encourage but also perpetuate this discrimination by actively and intentionally taking part in harassing students perceived to be gay and/or by being deliberately indifferent to the anti-gay harassment occurring on VUSD campuses. VUSD promotes and fosters this hostile environment. Defendants and other VUSD officials do not fund, sponsor, endorse, or promote any organization within the district to provide support to students who are the victims of anti-gay harassment.
The GSA Network primarily fights homophobia and intolerance 18 in schools by empowering gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and ,8. 20 school-based, student-run clubs called IGSAs"". See id., The 21 GSA Network also encourages members to form community-based GSAs 22 made up of students and supportive community members.
VUSD allegedly has a policy designed to deter gay or lesbian 24 students from being open about their sexual orientation and 25 freely associating with one another. See id., ,36.

51,ED-DC-0007,"Princeton sued U.S. Department of Education and OCR in a ""reverse FOIA"" to stop them from releasing documents related to an OCR compliance review to Students for Fair Admissions, Inc., which had submitted a FOIA request and filed a lawsuit against the DOE to compel disclosure. Parties voluntarily dismissed case.","The University does not object to OCR producing documents that OCR itself generated in the course of its compliance review, to the extent OCR generated documents do not incorporate or quote those documents the University is seeking to protect.

U.S. Department of Education, No. 1:16cv-02154-TSC (D.D.C.) (the “FOIA Action”). In that case, the plaintiff is seeking an order directing the Department to produce “all documents concerning the investigation of Princeton University in [OCR] Case Number 02-08-6002,” which includes the Applicant Documents and Information and Admissions Documents and Information.
Accordingly, consistent with FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C), the Applicant Documents and Information containing personally identifiable information must be fully redacted before any disclosure. The Applicant Documents and Information also contain personal information about individual applicants to the University the disclosure of which would violate the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. The University brings this action for permanent injunctive and declaratory relief under the Administrative Procedure Act to set aside the Department’s and OCR’s final decision to disclose the Applicant Documents and Information and Admissions Documents and Information as arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.
This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, because this action arises under the laws of the United States, including the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552; the judicial review provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706; and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202.

On January 22, 2008, OCR began a compliance review of the University’s consideration of race and national origin in the admissions process. The review began after OCR received a complaint against the University alleging that the University had discriminated against the complainant on the basis of race and national origin in the admissions process. The individual complaint and the compliance review were investigated by OCR in tandem in OCR Case Number 02-08-6002.
The University also created and submitted to OCR certain narrative responses to questions posed by OCR concerning its admissions program. Those responses included detailed information about specific applicants and their families. In response to OCR’s document and information requests, the University also voluntarily compiled and produced to OCR information about individual applicants to the University (the “Applicant Documents and Information”).
The documents requested included the Applicant Documents and Information and Admissions Documents and Information.

54,ED-MD-0002,"On May 31, 2018, The National Federation of the Blind filed this lawsuit in the U.C. District Court for the District of Maryland (Northern Division). The plaintiff sued the U.S. Department of Education and the Secretary of Education along with the Acting Assistant Secretary, claiming that the changes to the 2018 OCR Manual violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq., and was contrary to the mission of the OCR. These changes in § 108(t) of the 2018 OCR Manual require mandatory dismissal of complaints if the claim is either part of ""a pattern"" of complaints against multiple recipients, or places an unreasonable burden on OCR's resources. These changes also eliminate the appeal rights of complainants. The parties came to a settlement agreement reopening complaints dismissed under the contested rules of the manual and allowing parties that had their cases dismissed under the rule to petition the Department to reopen their cases. The case is not officially closed until February 2021, when the parties can no longer file for further enforcement.","The NAACP’s members have been and are illegally discriminated against by educational recipients of federal funding. The NAACP and its state and local units have filed complaints with the DOE OCR when they believe the actions (or inaction) of school officials constitute violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For example, in 2016, the NAACP filed a complaint against the City of Richmond Public Schools on behalf of two African American students with disabilities, and all African American students and students with disabilities, based on discriminatory discipline policies and practices.
Then, on March 5, 2018, without providing notice or opportunity to comment, DOE issued a revised manual, the March 2018 Manual, which superseded the 2015 Manual and contained new provisions requiring mandatory dismissal of certain complaints and eliminating the right of complainants to appeal determinations by OCR to the Enforcement Office Director. On May 31, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the instant action asserting that the changes implemented through the March 2018 Manual violated the APA. Originally, Plaintiffs challenged three rule changes: (l) the automatic dismissal of any complaint of illegal discrimination if it is part of ""a pattern"" of complaints by an individual complainant against multiple recipients, contained in section 108(t) of the March 2018 Manual; .
The request was premised, in part, on the fact that since the filing of the initial Complaint, Kenneth L. Marcus had been appointed as Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights and had stated that he intended to revise the March 2018 Manual to delete section 108(t) and establish a new appeals process. On September 28, 2018, and again on November 5, 2018, the parties reported that they were engaged in productive settlement negotiations and requested a stay of all deadlines until November 19,2018 to continue to work to resolve the case. Then, on November 19, 2018, the parties notified the Court that settlement discussions had broken down when Defendants informed Plaintiffs' counsel that they were no longer willing to offer any stipulation or agreement to resolve the matter and instead planned to release a revised OCR Case Processing Manual later that day, which could render Plaintiffs' requests for relief moot.
The next day, Plaintiffs sought leave to file an Amended Complaint and a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction to add allegations that Defendants were also using section 108(k) of the March 2018 Manual to dismiss complaints on the basis that a similar complaint filed by another individual had been previously dismissed pursuant to section 108(t). On November 29,2018, the Court held another case management conference, during which the parties vigorously disputed whether the case was moot in light of the issuance of the November 2018 Manual. The Court granted Plaintiffs leave to file an Amended Complaint and a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and also granted Defendants leave to file a Motion to Dismiss.
Plaintiffs ultimately notified the Court that they did not intend to file a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction after all.
at 190; see also Lyons, 461 U.S. at 101, 109-110 (holding both that the plaintiffs allegations of imminent injury based on past harm was too speculative to confer standing to seek injunctive relief and that a citywide moratorium on police chokeholds did not moot an otherwise valid claim for injunctive relief because the moratorium was not permanent). This is one such case. Defendants argue that the rescission of section 108(t) through the issuance of the November 2018 Manual, along with other actions they have taken to address the complaints dismissed under the challenged provisions of the March 2018 Manual, render this case moot.
CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. The Amended Complaint will be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Any Motion for Leave to Amend the Complaint must be filed within 14 days of the date of this Order.
These interests fall squarely within the zone of interests that the APA rule-making provisions are designed to protect. DOE’s action in adopting the changes in the March 2018 CPM was final. The March 2018 CPM went into effect on March 5, 2018 and was implemented until November 2018.

56,ED-MI-0001,"On November 7, 2006, the people of Michigan approved by majority vote a statewide ballot initiative-Proposal 2-which amended the Michigan Constitution to prohibit discrimination or preferential treatment based on race or gender in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting in the State.  Both Proposal 2 and the University of Michigan's announcement that it would comply triggered litigation.  On November 15, 2012, the en banc Sixth Circuit held that Proposal 2 created a comparative structural burden that undermined the Equal Protection Clause (which the court called the ""political process"" argument).  Accordingly, the court found Proposal 2 unconstitutional.  On March 24, 2013, the Supreme Court granted review of the case.  Argument will be after the Court's summer break.  

On October 15, 2013 the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case.  In an opinion written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, the court reversed the Sixth Circuit.  There were two concurring opinions and a single dissent.  In his opinion Kennedy asserts that this is not a case about resolving the debate about racial preferences, but rather about whether it is constitutional for Michigan to allow its voters to decide the issue.  The court holds that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in this Court’s precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school admissions.   ","On November 8, 2006, one day after the election, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights, and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary, along with other organizations and individuals opposed to Proposal 2 (collectively, the ""plaintiffs""), filed a lawsuit against (1) Jennifer Granholm, the Governor of Michigan, and (2) the Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University and the Board of Governors of Wayne State University (collectively, the ""Universities""), seeking a declaratory judgment that the amendment was invalid and a permanent injunction against its enforcement. They filed the lawsuit in the Southern Division of the Eastern District of Michigan. In their amended complaint, plaintiffs contended that Proposal 2 violates two federal constitutional provisions (the First and Fourteenth Amendments), three federal civil rights statutes (Title VI, Title VII and Title IX) and one presidential order (Executive Order 11246).

In a settlement agreement, the school district agreed to take steps to remedy the discriminatory actions by, among many things, providing coaching, facilities and equipment to both male and female athletic teams on a gender-neutral basis. ",".,-J (2) Chouteau Public Schools does not have a history or continuing practice of program expansion. (3) Chouteau Public Schools has failed to effectively accommodate the interests of the female students. Female students have historically been and continue to be underrepresented in Chouteau Public Schools' interscholastic and other school-sponsored athletic programs.
(4) Female athletes have fewer opportunities to receive coaching because several of Chouteau Public Schools' female teams share the same coach, even though the seasons for the sports overlap. (5) Chouteau Public Schools selects coaches for female athletic teams with less care and attention than for male athletic teams. As a result, the coaches of the female athletic teams often have less expertise than the coaches of the male athletic teams.
(7) The provision of medical and training facilities and services are inequitable in that the male athletes have superior access to these facilities and services, while the female athletes have very limited access to these facilities and services. (8) Chouteau Public Schools consistently provides less publicity for its female athletic teams than for its male athletic teams. The gross imbalance in the treatment of female and male athletes at Chouteau Public Schools, as detailed above, demonstrates Chouteau Public Schools' intentional and conscious failure to comply with Title IX.
WHEREAS, this Agreement represents the Plaintiffs' and Defendant's mutual desire for the District to achieve full compliance with Title IX and its implementing regulations regardless of the parties' divergent views regarding compliance; NOW THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree to settle this matter as set forth below. The School District agrees to take affirmative steps to increase the participation of female students in the District's athletic program. The District shall, by May 20, conduct a sports interest survey for the specific purpose of determining the interest of female students in grades 5 thru 11 in the addition of and participation in volleyball and soccer atthe high school level and volleyball, soccer, and fast and slow pitch softball at the middle school level.
Based on the results of the student interest survey, specific to those sports, and in combination with other factors related to the assessment of interest, the District shall add girls' sports for the 2000-2001 school year if necessary to accommodate girls' interest in school sponsored sports. The District agrees to engage in the active promotion of sports participation opportunities available to girls and active promotion of the dates for try-outs for various sports. The District's addition of new sports shall include the assignment of coaching salaries in a gender neutral fashion.
The District's review of its existing sports program and the extent to which it accommodates girls' interest in sports should be an ongoing process involving the District's continuous monitoring of the opportunities for girls to participate in sports combined with ensuring that sports offered are responsive to girls' interest in sports. The School District agrees to establish a system for accounting for revenues and expenditures for male and female sports. A revenue and expenditure report shall be available from the School District, upon written request, within twenty working days following the closure of the District's fiscal year (June 30) which shall show for each sport the amount expended by the District with respect to the sport.
This obligation may also be satisfied by assigning an individual who is not currently a head coach to a position as head coach for a girls' sport. The District shall, beginning with the 2000-2001 school year, provide off season training opportunities to female athletes that are equivalent to those available to male athletes.
This recognizes that a student's capacity to use the opportunity may be affected by factors such as the student's academic schedule or other sports or activities selected by the student. The School District agrees that it has an obligation to furnish equipment, supplies, and uniforms, for students who participate in school sponsored sports, in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of gender. Plaintiffs agree, with respect to uniforms, equipment, and supplies, to promptly notify the Athletic Director or the Superintendent in writing of any instance where they have formed a belief that equipment, supplies, or uniforms fall short of Title IX requirements.
Likewise, the attention may be based on o District efforts to recognize sports and athletes such as the introduction of athletes at opportune times during football games or other sporting events prominent in the school district, through pep assemblies, through announcements made over a school's intercom system, or through school or school-related publications that publicize school sports or individual athletes. The District agrees to afford female athletes with publicity that, to the best of its effort, is equivalent to the opportunities for publicity available to male athletes. The parties recognize that teams, male or female, may receive more publicity both inside the District and outside the District, based on fan support for a particular sport, achievement in a given year such as advancement to regional or state competition, or based on the extraordinary accomplishments of a particular team or individual athlete.

After eleven years, the parties reached a settlement; however, the final report demonstrates many of the terms of the agreement was not met.","Instead, it developed an IEP based on the MDE that had been conducted before the Commonwealth Court action. After the Luckinbills sought mediation, the school district agreed to provide supplementary aids and services including a word processor, modified testing and instructional materials, class notes, and regular team meetings between special and regular education teachers, staff and Sam's parents. Even after Sam was identified as a student with giftedness and learning disabilities, his teachers failed to provide him with specialized instruction and other supplementary aids and services in the regular class.
The Luckinbills asked that an outside psychologist with a strong understanding of Sam's combination of needs consult with the school district on a monthly basis for the purpose of integrating the psychologist's recommendations into the regular classroom activity. The school district refused. Finally, in August, 1993, the Luckinbills requested a due process hearing on the issue whether Sam was receiving a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.
The revision stated that a written behavior management plan utilizing positive approaches would be developed for Brett; that all staff, including teachers, aide and related service personnel would be trained in the implementation of the plan; that the curriculum would be adapted for Brett; that the classroom aide would be trained to assure meaningful participation for Brett in all classroom activities; and that all school personnel working with Brett would receive training in inclusion, curriculum adaptation, disability awareness, positive approaches and integrated therapies. The school district agreed to request the necessary training from PDE. The Koneskis withdrew the complaint they had filed with PDE after the district requested technical assistance from PDE and PDE referred the school district to the Statewide Support Initiative-Early Childhood specialist in Intermediate Unit 18.
A substantial number of professionals who work in the school systems of Pennsylvania also are members. Education is the primary advocacy concern of ASAP. ASAP founders' first effort was to shape the definition of autism/PDD contained in the 1990 Pennsylvania Special Education Standards, and ASAP's earliest information brochures concerned the needs of children with autism in the special education system.
PDE officials state that they are powerless to enforce corrective actions in response to complaint investigations or monitoring reports. PDE has failed adequately to discharge its responsibility to provide general supervision over programs providing education and related services to students with disabilities in Pennsylvania. Specifically, PDE has failed to discharge its duty to monitor educational programs; to review and approve LEA applications; to manage complaints; to provide an adequate system of due process and procedural safeguards; to provide protection in evaluation procedures; to assure adequate individualized education programs; and to assure placement in the most integrated setting appropriate to the child's needs.
PDE has failed to require, as part of the required multidisciplinary evaluation (MDE) process, a specific listing of recommendations concerning appropriate specially designed instruction and accommodation necessary for participation in a regular classroom. PDE has failed to require adequate individualized education programs for students with disabilities who are, or could be, educated in regular classes with supplementary aids and services. Missing from many IEPs are such essential components as present levels of performance, annual goals and measurable shortterm objectives.
at Provision IV.1(C).) Fourth, PDE agrees to create readily available, informational materials about the types of supplementary aids and services that children with disabilities can receive in a regular education classroom and how parents can seek assistance in obtaining these aids and services for their children. PDE will seek input from the Advisory Panel (see Part II.A below) for this initiative.
at Provision IV.1(D).) Finally, PDE agrees to create materials representing that all children, including those children with disabilities, are welcome in school. These materials will be displayed in school buildings.
Inadequate Length of the Settlement Agreement Two class members opposed the length of the Settlement Agreement, arguing that a five-year time frame is inadequate. The parties, however, have indicated that this duration was a necessary compromise to reach a Settlement Agreement. Additionally, as the parties appropriately point out, “[m]any of the provisions of the settlement, when implemented, will have an impact lasting far longer than the agreement terms and will build the Commonwealth’s capacity for inclusive practices.”

","NEW YORK, NY 10004 T/21 2.549.2600 WWW.ACLU.ORG/LGBT To Whom it May Concern: We write to file a complaint against Gloucester County Public Schools (“GCPS”) on behalf of Gavin Grimm. On December 9, 2014, the Gloucester County Public School Board (the “School Board”) adopted a policy stating that the use of boys’ and girls’ restroom and locker rooms “shall be limited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with sincere gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative private facility.” Gavin, who is a tenth-grade student at Gloucester High School and a transgender boy, had been using the boys’ restroom facilities at school without any complaints from peers, prior to the adoption of this policy.
The policy declared that access to the boys’ and girls’ restrooms would be limited to students of “the corresponding biological genders,” and also declared that students who are unable to use such restrooms because of “gender identity issues” would be relegated to “an alternative appropriate private facility.” As a result of the School Board’s transgender restroom policy, G.G. is currently the only student in his school who must use separate private restrooms.
Procedural History On June 11, 2015, G.G. sued GCSB alleging that its policy violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. JA9-24.

The school’s policy provides: (1) that the girls’ restrooms and locker rooms are designated for use by students who are biologically female; . (2) that the boys’ restrooms and locker rooms are designated for use by students who are biologically male; and (3) that all students, regardless of their sex, are authorized to use the school’s three single- stall unisex restrooms, which the school created to accommodate transgender students. Under this policy, G.G., who is biologically female but who identifies as male, is authorized to use the girls’ restrooms and locker rooms and the unisex restrooms.
The Gloucester County School Board considered the problem and, after two public meetings, adopted a compromise policy, as follows: Whereas the GCPS recognizes that some students question their gender identities, and Whereas the GCPS encourages such students to seek support, advice, and guidance from parents, professionals and other trusted adults, and Whereas the GCPS seeks to provide a safe learning environment for all students and to protect the privacy of all students, therefore It shall be the practice of the GCPS to provide male and female restroom and locker room facilities in its schools, and the use of said facilities shall be limited to the corresponding biological genders, and students with gender identity issues shall be provided an alternative appropriate private facility. Gloucester High School promptly implemented the policy and created three single-stall unisex restrooms for use by all students, regardless of their biological sex or gender identity. In December 2014, G.G.

The School Board also provides three single-stall bathrooms for any student to use regardless of his or her biological sex.
(2) that the boys’ restrooms and locker rooms are designated for use by students who are biologically male; and (3) that all students, regardless of their sex, are authorized to use the school’s three single-stall unisex restrooms, which the school created to accommodate transgender students.
To respect the safety and privacy of all students, the School Board has had a long-standing practice of limiting the use of restroom and locker room facilities to the corresponding biological sex of the students. The School Board also provides three singlestall bathrooms for any student to use regardless of his or her biological sex. Under the School Board’s restroom policy, G.G.

– After complaining to Tyson Foods, Inc. about the posting of a ""Whites Only"" sign on one of Tyson's restrooms at its Ashland, Alabama, facility, two black employees were subjected to adverse personnel actions by Tyson management, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleges in a discrimination lawsuit announced today. The EEOC's suit, EEOC v. Tyson Foods, Inc., CV-05-BE-1704-E (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama), alleges that Tyson's violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating against Henry Adams, Leon Walker, and other black employees, by establishing and maintaining a locked bathroom facility, which on occasion had signs posted on it stating ""Out of Order"" and ""Whites Only"". Keys to the facility were distributed to white employees only.
After Mr. Adams and Mr. Walker complained of the segregated facility, management subjected them to adverse employment actions, including suspensions and disciplinary write-ups.
While the Bathroom door was locked and while the ""Out of Order"" sign hung from the Bathroom door, certain white employees, including at least one supervisor, had keys to the Bathroom door. These white employees used the Bathroom and allowed other white employees to use the Bathroom. The same white employees denied Plaintiff-Intervenors and other African-American employees, including supervisors, use of the Bathroom.
On August 11, 2005, the EEOC initiated this action by filing its Complaint, alleging that Tyson Foods violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §2000e, et seq., (“Title VII”) and the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. §1981a.

Accordingly, the court denies HTB's motion for partial summary adjudication and grants EEOC's cross motion for partial summary adjudication. BACKGROUND On September 29, 2006 the EEOC commenced this action alleging that HTB subjected Charging Parties Yesica Owen, Eliza Navarette, and other similarly situated individuals, to sexual harassment/hostile work environment on the basis of sex, female. (Compl.
The EEOC alleges that HTB engaged in unlawful employment practices since October 2002, in violation of Section 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). The sexual harassment included ""unwanted physical touching and/or sexually charged and/or suggestive speech and/or conduct.""
When asked by Mr. Hoge whether a relatively small conciliation amount such as $500 would have been sufficient to keep the case in the conciliation process, the EEOC did not directly respond but indicated that the matter would be referred to the EEOC's legal department Id.
On September 29, 2006, the EEOC commenced the present action. HTB now moves for partial summary adjudication on the issue of whether the EEOC satisfied its duty to conciliate prior to commencing this action. The EEOC opposes the motion and separately moves for summary adjudication in its favor.

Best Buy operates through a corporate culture of racial and gender 13 stereotypes.
Even when Best Buy does allow African- 9 American temporary workers to become permanent, the Company keeps them as part-time rather 10 than promoting/transferring them to full-time positions. Best Buy generally does not permit its female and minority employees to 12 work on the sales floor. Instead, it segregates them in operations, stock room, cashier, and minor 13 sales positions, denying them assignment to major sales positions, including the Magnolia home 14 theater ""store within a store.""
Because Best Buy senior managers are overwhelmingly white male, they 4 tend to hire, assign to sales positions, and transfer/promote those like themselves-that is, more 5 white males. Best Buy generally does not advertise job openings to the public. When 7 individuals are interviewed for job openings, they often are not informed of specific jobs, but are 8 assigned to positions that senior managers subjectively believe would be a good ""fit,"" based on 9 gender and racial stereotyping and unconscious bias.
Despite Mr. Dixon's 10 sales experience, interest in sales, and sales results in a non-sales position, Best Buy refused to 11 transfer/promote him to a sales floor position where he would have received approximately $2 12 per hour more than he received as a cashier. Best Buy has discriminated against Mr. Dixon on the basis of his race, 120. On or about November 1, 2005, Mr. Dixon filed a charge of discrimination 17 with the EEOC, which was cross-filed with the DFEH Mr. Dixon received a Notice of Right to 18 Sue from the EEOC on or about October 2,2006.

As required by 29 U.S.C. § 626(d), a representative of the class filed a timely charge of age discrimination on July 16, 2004, on behalf of himself and other workers in the protected age group with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) more than 60 days prior to commencement of this action.

Most pertinent to my conclusion is the decision in Register, which is factually similar to this case. There, the defendant had converted its pension plan from a traditional defined benefit plan to a cash balance plan. 477 F.3d at 60.
For example, employees who were over 50 on the date their company went to the cash benefit plan had on average a 91.5 percent reduction in benefits after five years, and still had a 77.0 percent reduction in benefits after 15 years. Over 90 percent of damages were borne by older employees. These finding provide strong evidence that older employees suffered a systematic reduction in benefits as a result of the pension plan transition that defendants implemented.

Most critically, however, this Court’s January 21, 2009 decision did not rely on Morgan. It relied on Ledbetter. This Court found that Ledbetter had distinguished Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385 (1986), on the basis that the perpetuation of the individual decisions about Ms. Ledbetter’s compensation occurred pursuant to a “facially nondiscriminatory and neutrally applied” pay structure, and not a “facially discriminatory pay structure that put[] some employees on a lower scale because of race” as was at issue in Bazemore.
Plaintiffs’ motion to amend concerns my ruling on Plaintiffs’ claim that the “wear away” period for some workers, meaning the time that overall benefits did not grow until the cash balance benefits caught up to and exceeded the “frozen” benefits due under the old formula, violates the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). I granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants based on my conclusion that none of the Plaintiffs had filed a timely charge of discrimination within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory act. Plaintiffs argue that the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, P.L. 111-2, (the “Ledbetter Act”) which was signed into law shortly after my order, modifies the time limit for when a charge of discrimination needs to be filed.

The EEOC claimed that BDC discriminated against the employee in violation of the ADA when it conditioned his employment on the results of a medical exam and subsequently refused to hire him as a night warehouse loader upon learning that he had a disability.

Having satisfied all administrative prerequisites, Plaintiffs now file this Complaint.
Facts 14. Since at least August 5, 2003, Morgan Stanley has systematically denied equal employment opportunities to its female financial advisors and female registered financial advisor trainees. Morgan Stanley has engaged in a pattern and practice of gender discrimination with respect to compensating and promoting women from the positions of financial advisor and/or registered financial advisor trainee to other more prestigious roles or positions such as, for financial advisors, branch/sales management positions, and, for registered financial advisor trainees, the position of financial advisor.

75,EE-DC-0051,"This case was brought by several African-American current or former U.S. Capitol Police Officers against the United States Capitol Police Board. Plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and injunctive relief, alleging that Defendant engaged in a pattern and practice of race discrimination in employment. On October 13, 2016, the court granted defendant's motion to dismiss most of plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider which the court denied, and the court reaffirmed its reasoning on July 30, 2019. The case is ongoing.","Introduction Plaintiffs Sharon Blackmon-Malloy, Dale Veal, Vernier Riggs, Luther Peterson, Duvall Phelps, Larry Ikard, and Frank Adams bring a class complaint on behalf of themselves and all current or retired African American United States Capitol Police Officers. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant has engaged in a pattern and practice of race discrimination in employment. Defendant is the United States Capitol Police Board.
Thus, the Court will construe these statutes as incorporated by the Congressional Accountability Act. 42 U.S.C. § 1301 et. seq. Spavone, a Hispanic Officer, have been subjected to a hostile work environment based on their known associations with African American officers. Because Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as written, does not extend to legislative branch employees, the Congressional Accountability Act provides the exclusive procedure by which current or former legislative branch employees can bring a suit challenging employment discrimination.
Finally, we hold that receipt of written notice of the end of mediation from the Office of Compliance triggered the CAA’s 30 to 90-day period for electing whether to pursue judicial or administrative relief and demonstrated the employee’s completion of counseling and mediation. Accordingly, we remand the cases to the district court. Subchapter IV of the CAA, titled “Administrative and Judicial Dispute Resolution Procedures,” provides that prior to filing a complaint with the Office of Compliance (“Office”) pursuant to section 1405 or in the district court pursuant to section 1408, an employee1 must do three things: First, “to commence a proceeding,” the employee must request counseling within 180 days of the date of the alleged violation of a law made applicable by the CAA Id.
Furthermore, the discipline was typically more severe for Black Officers than that which white Officers received for comparable offenses. Luther Peterson, an African American Officer, was discriminated against on the basis of his race when he was unfairly disciplined. Officer Peterson had been with the U.S. Capitol Police since October 10, 1978.
These common questions include, but are not limited to: a. Whether Defendant subjected the Plaintiffs to a hostile work environment based on their race (African American). Whether Defendant discriminated against certain of the Plaintiffs in promotions and promotional opportunities based on their race (African American).
See, e.g. Parties’ Joint Report in Response to the Court’s March 8, 2010 Order [#275] at 2-3. The parties also previously agreed that certain plaintiffs had not properly exhausted their administrative remedies. Plaintiffs assert that some of those individuals filed declarations in support of their opposition to defendant’s motion to dismiss, and therefore, “it is clear that they are no longer interested in withdrawing from the case.”
The Court Grants the Second Motion to Dismiss. On September 30, 2004, the Court granted the Capitol Police Board’s motion to dismiss. See Blackmon-Malloy v. U.S. Capitol Police Bd., 338 F. Supp.
See Macon Notice of Appeal, ECF No. 185; Adams Notice of Appeal, ECF No. 186. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Affirms in Part, Reverses in Part, and Remands for Further Proceedings. The Court of Appeals issued its decision on July 31, 2009.

at 1 n.1, 4–10. The parties also agreed that sixty plaintiffs did not properly exhaust their administrative remedies and thus should be dismissed from this case, id. at 2–3,5 and that seven more had indicated to counsel their intent to withdraw from the case.
to Amend, ECF No. 398 at 1. The Court agrees with the defendants. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) governs requests for leave to amend a complaint before trial, but after the brief period during which amendment may be filed as a matter of course Fed. R Civ P. 15(a)(2).
Ikard may proceed on his two claims as listed in Appendix II to this Memorandum Opinion Sgt. Ikard’s remaining claims will be DISMISSED. k. John N. Johnson Magistrate Judge Facciola recommends that Officer Johnson’s claim of non-selection following the 2000 sergeant exam should go forward because the parties agreed that his claim was timely, but that his claim for racist words or actions should be dismissed because “there was no demonstration that administrative remedies were exhausted for this claim.”
Only those plaintiffs listed in Appendix II will be allowed to proceed in this action, and they will be permitted to proceed only as to the claims listed in that chart. All other claims will be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Nothing in this Opinion shall constitute a final decision on any pending motion or issue.

The EEOC's suit charged that Bay State Milling Company discriminated against Gary Legore, a qualified applicant, when the hiring manager for the Indiantown, Fla., miller vacancy rejected him for the position because of his age. The hiring manager informed Legore of the company's desire to hire a younger individual for the job.
Employees and applicants are covered by this statute. The EEOC filed suit (Case No. 2:12-cv-14439DLG) in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Fort Pierce Division, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The consent decree settling the lawsuit, approved by the court on December 10, includes mandatory training for the hiring manager, interviewing officials and the company's human resources department, with an emphasis on age-related discriminatory practices and age sensitivity.
Mr. Santoro: The Court: Mr. Rayola: The Court: Ms. Mevers: The Court: Ms. Schwartz: The Court: The settlement agreement will be for both cases combined. The defendant will be paying $150,000 which will include attorneys’ fees and costs. And, in addition, the defendant will be agreeing to a consent decree.

So, first, from the prospective [sic] of the defense, Bay State Milling Company, first, let me ask counsel, Mr. Santoro, is that a fair and accurate summary of the settlement agreement as you understand it?

As noted, an agreement to a consent decree was the only contingency of the $150,000 settlement. The District Court entered the party‐proposed consent decree. [Case No. 12‐14439, ECF No. 70].
The settlement agreement will be for b0th cases combined. The defendant will be paying $150,000 which will include attorneys' fees and costs. And in addition the defendant will be agreeing to a consent decree.

(“Dynamic”), who were victims of such unlawful employment practices.
As alleged with greater specificity below, Sanchez, Rodriguez, Capote, Ruz and a class of current and/or former employees of Dynamic were subjected to disparate treatment based on religion when Dynamic coerced them to adopt Scientology religious views and practices as a condition of continued employment.
Sanchez, Rodriguez, Capote, Ruz and a class of current and/or former employees of Dynamic were also subjected to a hostile work environment based on religion by Dynamic’s unwelcome imposition upon them of Scientology religious views and practices. Dynamic also terminated Sanchez and Rodriguez in retaliation for opposing Dynamic’s unlawful practices. Further, Dynamic failed to accommodate the religious beliefs of Rodriguez.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1.
This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Sections 706(f)(1) and (3) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3), and Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful herein were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division. PARTIES 3.
Scientology is a religion developed by L. Ron Hubbard. Dynamic requires employees to attend courses that involve participating in Scientology religious practices (“Course(s)”). Courses use written materials developed by L. Ron Hubbard.
Class of Individuals 103. Dynamic required other employees to attend the Courses. These present and/or former employees for which EEOC seeks relief were required to attend Courses to keep their jobs.
Dynamic’s sole owner, Nobbe, is a member of the Church of Scientology. Dynamic conditions employment on attendance at mandatory courses that involve participating in Scientology religious practices (“Course(s)”). The Courses are religious in nature as demonstrated by the following: (a) Courses use written materials developed by L. Ron Hubbard, who developed the religion of Scientology; .
The EEOC charged in its suit that Dynamic Medical Services, Inc. (""DMS"") required Norma Rodriguez, Maykel Ruz, RommySanchez, Yanileydis Capote and other employees to spend at least half their work days in courses that involved Scientologyreligious practices, such as screaming at ashtrays or staring at someone for eight hours without moving. The companyalso instructed employees to attend courses at the Church of Scientology. Additionally, the company required Sanchezto undergo an ""audit"" byconnect​ing herself to an ""E-meter,"" which Scientologists believe is a religious artifact, and required her to undergo ""purification"" treatment at the Church of Scientology.
According to the EEOC's suit, employees repeatedlyasked not to attend the courses but were told it was a requirement of the job. In the cases of Rodriguezand Sanchez, when theyrefused to participate in Scientology religious practices and/or did not conform to Scientologyreligious beliefs, theywere terminated.
Such alleged practices violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion-which includes forcing employees to conform to a particular religion. The EEOC filed suit (Case No. 1:13-cv-21666KMW, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida) after first attempting to reach a settlement through its conciliation process.

For the following reasons, the motion to dismiss is denied. On November 10, 2004, the plaintiff, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC""), filed its complaint in this Court alleging that the defendant, Sears, Roebuck and Company (""Sears""), discriminated against John Bava and a class of disabled employees by failing to accommodate their disabilities, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (""ADA""), 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a), and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). The EEOC alleges that Sears discharged Bava, ""an employee with disabilities, rather than accommodating him by extending his leave or by returning him to work in an available position which he could have performed.""

(Compl. The EEOC further alleges that Sears discriminated against a class of disabled employees by unlawfully maintaining an inflexible worker's compensation leave policy, which provides for discharge of employment after a year instead of ""reasonable accommodation of employees with disabilities."" In its motion to dismiss, Sears argues that the complaint fails to allege the essential elements of an ADA claim.

Hendrickson EEOC Regional Attorney (312) 353-8551 FEDERAL COURT SAYS EEOC DISABILITY BIAS LAWSUIT AGAINST SEARS ROEBUCK TO PROCEED Discovery Allowed On Class Claim That Inflexible Leave Policy Failed To Reasonably Accommodate Disabled Employees CHICAGO The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced here today that it has received a decision from Federal District Court in Chicago permitting its class case under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to proceed against Sears, Roebuck Company. According to the EEOC, U.S. District Judge Wayne R. Anderson has denied Sears' motion to dismiss the case which alleges that the giant retailer failed to provide one of its Chicago-area employees, John Bava, with a reasonable accommodation after he was injured while working for Sears. EEOC is also seeking relief on behalf of a class of all Sears employees with disabilities who lost their jobs because of Sears' inflexible application of its one year worker's compensation or medical-disability leave policy.

EEOC contends that Sears violated Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) by terminating Bava and other employees because they spent more than one year on disability leave and without regard to their individual circumstances and return-to-work prospects. In denying Sear's motion to dismiss the case, Judge Anderson wrote, ""Even if the EEOC were required to plead a prima facie case of disability discrimination, we believe [the facts in the Complaint] would survive a [motion to dismiss.]""
We find that the issue of whether defendant's leave policy fails to accommodate its disabled employees is an issue upon which defendants have been given notice and is a claim for which [EEOC is] entitled to discovery."" The EEOC lawsuit was filed November 10, 2004, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and captioned EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck Co., Civil Action No. 04 C 7282. Judge Andersen's decision was dated July 22, 2005, and mailed to the parties.

As discovery progressed various plaintiffs were added and some were dismissed from the case.  Settlement negations concerning the remaining plaintiffs resulted in individual settlement agreements.  The exact terms of these settlements are not available.

(“ADEA”), to redress and enjoin the employment practices of DaimlerChrysler. All of the plaintiffs have filed timely Title VII administrative charges of discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, (“EEOC”).
Plaintiffs and class members have been subjected to a continuous pattern and practice of sex and race discrimination by DaimlerChrysler. DaimlerChrysler’s supervisor’s and managers have created and condoned a work environment that is hostile to women and African-American employees including the plaintiffs.
DaimlerChrysler’s supervisors and managers, and employees with the knowledge of management, have made sexually and racially derogatory, demeaning and discriminatory statements to plaintiffs and other class members. DaimlerChrysler has followed a general practice of discriminating against women and African-Americans with regard to promotion, training, and skills qualification. Women and African-Americans, including the plaintiffs, are expressly and impliedly discouraged from seeking higher paying positions and higher responsibility positions, and are maintained in lower paying subordinate positions, and are denied training and opportunities to demonstrate the qualifications necessary to obtain higher paying jobs and higher responsibility positions, and the opportunity to apply for those jobs and positions.
Plaintiff Diana Chapman has herself experienced or observed discrimination on the basis of her disability, i.e., diabetes. She has been exposed to a discriminatory hostile work environment because of her disability.
Plaintiff Diana Chapman alleges that the defendant DaimlerChrysler Corporation violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in regards to its actions concerning her stated disability. The Defendant failed to accommodate Ms. Chapman’s diabetic condition by refusing to allow her to take ten-minute breaks to perform a blood sugar test and administer any needed medication prior to the Defendant’s own scheduled breaks. On August 27, 1999, Ms. Chapman requested a break to check her blood sugar levels.
Consequently, this created a hostile or abusive work environment for Ms. Chapman because the Defendant has refused to give her another place to check her blood sugar levels except the common bathroom during defendant’s scheduled break periods. Therefore, the Defendant has failed to make an effective and reasonable accommodation for Ms. Chapman’s disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 30. On January 7, 2000, Ms. Chapman filed a Charge of Discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reiterating the above allegations of a continuing nature in that the defendant failed to make a reasonable accommodation for her disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 31.
On October 3, 2000, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a determination on the merits of Ms. Chapman’s Charge of Discrimination. The Commission determined that the evidence obtained in its investigation established reasonable cause to believe that the defendant discriminated against Ms. Chapman because of her disability in that it failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 33. Moreover, on April 30, 2001, Ms. Chapman received a notice of right to sue from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in which this cause of action ensues to redress the violation of her federally protected rights.
DaimlerChrysler has discriminated against plaintiffs and all members of the proposed class with respect to the terms and conditions of employment because of their race and sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. DaimlerChrysler’s policies and practices have produced disparate impact against class members with respect to the terms and conditions of employment.

Venue is proper in the Northern District of Illinois pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b). Defendants’ unlawful conduct took place nationwide, including in this District, and Defendants are licensed to do business and maintain a number of branch offices in this District.
As a result, the recently announced retention bonus procedure disadvantages African Americans and women and disproportionately advantages white males as favored employees whose retention is more important to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch than the retention of African-Americans and women. Merrill Lynch’s long history of systemic discrimination against African American and women is well known. As a result of a hostile corporate culture and policies and practices that steer business opportunities and resources to white men, African Americans and women are disproportionately situated in lower quintiles of production and so earn less than white men.
According to public documents, in 1974, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Merrill Lynch based on its refusal to employ women, African Americans and Latinos as brokers. To resolve the lawsuit, Merrill Lynch agreed to the entry of a Consent Decree (the “O’Bannon Consent Decree”) that required Merrill Lynch to increase its representation of African-American brokers to 6.5%. On information and belief, Merrill Lynch has never met the goals to which it agreed in the O’Bannon Consent Decree.

The plaintiffs ask that a class be certified for two purposes: deciding a common issue, Fed R. Civ P. 23(c)(4)—whether No. 11-3639 the defendant has engaged and is engaging in practices that have a disparate impact (that is, a discriminatory effect, though it need not be intentional) on the members of the class, in violation of federal antidiscrimination law; and providing injunctive relief Fed. R Civ P. 23(b)(2).
ARGUED OCTOBER 24, 2011—DECIDED SEPTEMBER 11, 2012 Before SYKES and TINDER, Circuit Judges, and DEGUILIO, District Judge. SYKES, Circuit Judge. In 2005 a group of brokers at Merrill Lynch sued the firm under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and Title VII raising various claims of racial discrimination and seeking to litigate the claims as a class. Among  The Honorable Jon E. DeGuilio, United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, sitting by designation.
The compensation formula is neutral with respect to race. In 2005 George McReynolds, a black broker, filed a classaction discrimination lawsuit against Merrill Lynch in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois. McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith, Inc., No. 05-cv-6583 (N.D Ill.
Thus, brokers who had already been earning higher compensation for producing more business would be offered larger bonuses to remain with the firm through the acquisition. In response to the retention plan, McReynolds and a group of black brokers filed the present suit, making this case “McReynolds II.” The named plaintiffs in the two cases are substantially similar, though not identical; all the plaintiffs in this case are also plaintiffs in No. 11-1957 McReynolds I, and the same law firm represents them.
By operation of § 703(h), both the Title VII and § 1981 claims require a showing of intentional discrimination, so Iqbal and Feeney provide the proper decisional framework. The complaint alleges in some detail that black brokers at Merrill Lynch have been the victims of discriminatory employment policies and practices and that they receive fewer production credits as a result. But much less is said about the retention program itself.

Klein (See above for address) LEAD ATTORNEY ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED","In 2011, a group of African-American and female financial advisors filed a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and Bank of America. The plaintiffs alleged that Merrill Lynch's practices, including a production-based compensation system, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The district court dismissed the case, holding that the plaintiffs offered nothing more than conclusory allegations of discriminatory intent.","In 2005, a group of black brokers at Merrill Lynch sued the firm under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C.  1981 in the Northern District of Illinois for racial discrimination in violation of Title VII and Title VII. The plaintiffs alleged that Merrill Lynch's retention bonus procedure disadvantages African Americans and women and disproportionately advantages white males as favored employees whose retention is more important to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch than the retention of African-Americans and women. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify the case as a class action. The case was appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Seventh Circuit upheld the district court's dismissal of the case."
87,EE-IN-0131,"In December 2013, the EEOC brought this suit against Bright Petroleum for scrutinizing, disciplining and discharging against its female employee who filed a charge of sex discrimination with the EEOC. The EEOC and Bright Petroleum entered a three-year consent decree on December 12, 2014. ","CIVIL ACTION NO. 4:13-CV-205 COMPLAINT JURY TRIAL DEMAND NATURE OF THE ACTION This is an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to correct unlawful employment practices on the basis of retaliation and to provide appropriate relief to Michelle Bunte. As alleged with greater particularity in paragraphs seven through eleven below, the Commission alleges that Defendant retaliated against Michelle Bunte by subjecting her to unwarranted scrutiny, discipline and termination because she filed a charge of discrimination with the Commission. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1.
This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to 706(f)(1) and (3) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3) (“Title VII”), and Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, New Albany Division. PARTIES 3.
STATEMENT OF CLAIMS 6. More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Michelle Bunte filed a charge with the Commission alleging a violation of Title VII by Defendant Employer. All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.
The Bright Market is a food market and gas station located in Lawrenceburg, Ind. According to the EEOC's lawsuit, The Bright Market retaliated against Deli Manager Michelle Bunte by singling her out for heightened scrutiny after learning that she had filed an EEOC charge and would not drop her charge. The company then disciplined and terminated her.
Taking adverse actions against an employee who complains of discrimination, files an EEOC charge or otherwise exercises her rights under Title VII violates the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The EEOC asserts that the company's actions were intentional and demonstrated a reckless indifference to the worker's federally protected rights. The EEOC filed suit (Case No. 4:13-cv-00205) in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, New Albany Division, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.

The agency is seeking back wages plus interest and compensatory and punitive damages, as well as other relief, including a permanent injunction to prevent the company from engaging in any future retaliation. ""Employers are simply not entitled to punish employees or former employees for complaining about discrimination"" said Laurie A. Young, regional attorney for the EEOC's Indianapolis District Office.
""If they try to do so, they are only making a bad situation worse for themselves."" The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.

88,EE-KS-0026,"On December 19, 2005 a group of former employees of the Boeing Company filed suit in the United States District Court of Kansas against the Boeing Company (Boeing), Spirit Aerosystems Inc. (Spirit), the Onex Corporation (Onex) and Midwestern Aircraft (Midwestern). The plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief as well as class certification, alleging pattern or practice of age discrimination, disparate impact and disparate treatment by the defendants during the layoff and rehire process, in connection with Boeing's sale of its commercial airplane manufacturing facilities to Onex. The plaintiffs brought eight claims, two of which were dismissed during the pleading stage, five were dismissed as the District Court granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor in two separate opinions. The plaintiffs appealed to the 10th Circuit Court, but the 10th Circuit affirmed the lower court's decisions. The remaining claim in the case after the Circuit Court decision was the plaintiffs' ADEA claim of disparate treatment. A number of individual plaintiffs settled with defendants. After the plaintiffs failed to appear at a hearing on a motion to dismiss, Judge Melgran granted the motion. The plaintiffs appealed on February 9, 2015, and the appeal was dismissed on June 16, 2015 for failure to prosecute. The case is closed.","The criteria contained in this docum ent allowed for excessive subjectivity in the decisions made. More importantly, the criteria violated the collective bargaining agreement. However the criteria were in realit y questions that had no real method to measure and instead allowed managers to exercise prejudices and biases in the employment decisions.
The Thiessen opinion did not include the entirety of the actual language of the EEOC charge filed in that case. Since Thiessen was filed in the District of Kansas, this court reviewed the complaint filed in that case. Included as an attachment to the complaint was an EEOC charge that contained an extensive narrative chronicling the allegedly discriminatory policies of the defendant in that case.

307 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir. The plaintiff was employed by Applied Risk Management, Inc. (ARM). Under the terms of her employment, the plaintiff was provided medical benefits that were protected by ERISA.
ARM entered into an agreement with Professional Risk Management and its parent company, MMI Companies, Inc. (PRM/MMI) for the sale of all of ARM’s assets. Under the terms of that agreement, most ARM employees would automatically transfer to PRM/MMI at the time of the sale and would continue to receive benefits under a similar plan.
The project to offer these facilities for sale was known as “Project Lloyd.” The original name of the new company was Mid–Western Aircraft System Inc. However, in July 2005 Mid–Western changed its name to Spirit AeroSystems Inc. Plaintiffs allege that the “common scheme” of discrimination climaxed with major layoffs in May and June of 2005 Doc.

A precondition to being considered for employment with Spirit was that the employee complete a “Consent to Release Personnel Information Form.” Plaintiffs are a number of former Boeing employees who were not offered jobs with Spirit. Plaintiffs allege that Boeing began considering the sale of its commercial division at least by early 2002.
A pattern and practice claim is merely a method of styling a particular claim of discrimination. In this case, plaintiffs allege that it was defendants’ pattern and practice to discriminate on the basis of age by terminating and failing to rehire employees over the age of forty. The termination of employment and failure to rehire are still the discriminatory policies, the discrete acts, causing the alleged harm.
Plaintiff represented by Bob Bailey Individually and on behalf of those similarly situated


Plaintiffs are former Boeing employees who were not hired by Spirit when it purchased Boeing’s BCA Wichita Division assets. Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit alleging that Defendants violated the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1140; § 301 of the Labor Managem ent Relations Act (“LMRA”), 29 U.S.C. § 185; and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29U.S.C. On November 11, 2006, this Court conditionally certified a collective action under theADEA.
However, in the end, Onex agreed to assume Boeing’s pension liabilities as of the close of the sale, so long as Boeing transferred sufficient funds for the pension obligations being transferred. Sometime during the negotiations, Onex formed Mid-Western Aircraft Systems, Inc. (“Mid-Western”). Mid-Western served as the vehicle to purchase the assets of the BCA Wichita Division from Boeing.3 On February 22, 2005, Boeing and Mid-Western signed the Asset Purchase Agreement.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1.
This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706 (f)(1) and (3) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Sections 2003-5(0(1) and (3) and 6.

STATEMENT OF CLAIMS 6. More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Ms. Connie Reed filed a charge with the Commission alleging viol’ations of Title VII by Defendant Employer. All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.

Since at least March 20, 1996, Defendant Employer has engaged in unlawful employment practices at its Jonesboro, Louisiana facility, in violation of Section 703 and 704 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 200e-2 and 2000e-3.
Specifically, Ms. Connie L. Reed began her employment with the Defendant on or about March 20, 1996, as a machine operator. At the onset of her employment at the Defendant’s Jonesboro facility, a mechanic at the facility began to make advances toward Ms. Reed these advances continued for over a year. Said advances included the following unwanted advances: During the summer of 1997, the harasser gave her a cassette of love songs; On September 12, 1997, the harasser told a co-worker that he was going to have sex with Ms. Reed; On September 12, 1997, the harasser told Ms. Reed that he wants to get between Ms. Reed’s legs with his tongue; In late September, 1997, the harasser told Ms. Reed that he loved her; 9.
On October 2, 1997, Ms. Reed could no longer tolerate the Defendant’s indifference to her sexual harassment complaints and felt forced to resign. Specifically, on this date, the Superintendent came to the facility and took no remedial action against the person who was harassing Ms Reed.
Other females stated that the mechanic had made the sexually offensive remarks to them, yet, no corrective action was taken. The Defendant has an anti-harassment policy which is maintained in the main plant in Monroe, LA. However, all of the sexually offensive actions described herein occurred in the Jonesboro facility.
Defendant officials with managerial and/or supervisory authority, who were ""agents"" of Defendant within the meaning of Title V~, were aware, or should have been aware, of the sexual harassment to which Reed and other similarly situated female employees were being subjected, but failed to take prompt, effective, appropriate remedial measures in response. The Defendant did not take appropriate reasonable steps to prevent Reed from being subjected to illegal harassment 15. The unlawful practices of Defendant complained of herein have deprived Reed and other female employees in like or related situations, of equal employment opportunities and have otherwise adversely affected the conditions of their employment, and their status as employees, because of their sex (female).
The unlawful employment practices complained of herein were intentional. Defendant engaged in the unlawful employment practices complained of herein with malice and/or with reckless indifference to Reed’s federally protected rights and those of persons in like or related circumstances.

This suit arises from Tower Loan’s decision to terminate Plaintiff Tristan Broussard because of his sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq. (“Title VII”). In February 2013, Tower Loan extended a job offer to Mr. Broussard to work as a Manager Trainee in its Lake Charles, Louisiana branch.
Title VII makes it unlawful for employers to discriminate against their employees or applicants for employment because of their sex, which includes discrimination based on a person’s gender identity or transgender status; because a person has undergone, is undergoing, or intends to undergo a gender transition; or because a person fails to conform to gender- or gender-based stereotypes. In terminating Mr. Broussard for these reasons, Tower Loan violated Title VII. PARTIES 6.
On August 27, 2013, Mr. Broussard’s counsel at the National Center for Lesbian Rights and Delaney Robb Attorneys at Law LLC filed a charge of discrimination with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC” or “Commission”) on Mr. Broussard’s behalf. The Charge alleged that Mr. Broussard’s termination from Tower Loan constituted unlawful discrimination on the basis of his sex, change of sex, sex stereotypes, and gender identity, in violation of Title VII and the Louisiana Employment Discrimination Law. A true and correct copy of the EEOC charge is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
Tower Loan engaged in unlawful employment practices at its Lake Charles, Louisiana branch, in violation of Section 703(a)(1) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(a)(1), by terminating or constructively terminating Mr. Broussard because of sex. Tower Loan’s decision to terminate Mr. Broussard was based on sex. Tower Loan fired Mr. Broussard because he is a transgender man, because he is undergoing or has undergone a gender transition, and/or because he did not conform to Tower Loan’s gender-based preferences, expectations, or stereotypes that a transgender man should be treated as female and should dress and conduct himself as female.
Meanwhile, Tower filed suit against Broussard in Mississippi state court. Broussard removed Tower’s suit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Upon Broussard’s motion, the federal court transferred Tower’s suit to this Court, which consolidated it with Broussard’s case.
Here, Title VII unambiguously provides for venue in any district court in Louisiana. The alleged discrimination based on sex took place in Tower’s Lake Charles office. (Rec.Doc.
In lieu of binding Fifth Circuit precedent, this Court finds the decisions of these Circuit Courts persuasive. Thus, the Eastern District of Louisiana is a proper venue for Broussard’s suit. Tower’s arguments for dismissal are unavailing.1 B.
The Commission alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. (“Title VII”). The complaint alleged that Defendant terminated the employment of Tristan Broussard (“Broussard”), who is transgender, because of sex, based on perceived nonconformity with gender stereotypes and/or his gender identity. Defendant has not admitted and specifically denies that it engaged in any unlawful employment practices.
The EEOC and Defendant now wish to settle all claims or controversies encompassed by or which could have been brought in this action, without the burden, expense, or delay of further litigation, pursuant to the terms delineated in this Decree.
All of Defendant’s employees, including Branch Managers, Manager-Trainees, and Human Resources personnel, in attendance at the next scheduled Branch Manager and Manager-Trainee meetings, shall participate in EEO training — conducted by a qualified employment law attorney or Human Resources professional with at least five years of experience in employment discrimination and/or EEO issues — of not less than one hour. During the term of this Decree, Defendant will ensure that each employee is trained annually at a minimum with the first training to be held within six (6) months after the entry of the Decree. The training shall include: (a) the types of sex-based employment decisions; .
Defendants shall ensure that the postings are not altered, defaced or covered by any other material. During the term of this Decree, the EEOC may take reasonable measures to ensure compliance with the terms of this Decree. With the exception of paragraphs 1-3 and 9-15 of this Decree, Defendant shall bear the costs associated with administering and implementing the provisions of this Decree.

94,EE-MD-0140,"The case was brought by African American employees of Friedman's, a jewelry store, and sought equitable and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs alleged they had suffered from working in a racially hostile work environment and alleged that Friedman's had engaged in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination in hiring, promotion, compensation, and other terms and privileges of employment. The case was finally settled on February 12, 2009, after Friedman's had entered into bankruptcy two times.  The named plaintiffs and class members received over a million dollars for costs with a portion to cover attorneys' fees.","As a result of Friedman’s continued policies and pattern or practices of intentional discrimination, African Americans are denied hiring, promotions and compensation on terms equal to those afforded to similarly situated white applicants and employees. Numerous Friedman’s employees and applicants, in addition to the plaintiffs herein, have also filed EEOC Charges alleging that Friedman’s discriminated against them and similarly situated African Americans as a class, on the basis of their race. Among these Charging Parties are the following, listed with the dates of their Charges and the locations in which they alleged Friedman’s discriminated against them on the basis of race.

B. Friedman’s Acts Of Discrimination Against The Individual Plaintiffs John O’Bannon 22. Friedman’s denied Plaintiff John O’Bannon employment because of his race. In about May 2000, O’Bannon was recruited for a part-time retail sales position at Friedman’s by an African American Friedman’s store manager, Constance Givens-Jones, whom he met when he made a sales presentation to her.

and h. Whether the Company is liable for punitive damages? The presence of numerous central questions of law that are common to Representative Plaintiffs and to each class member satisfies Rule 23(a)(2)’s legal commonality requirement.

The Company’s well-known reputation for discrimination against African Americans also deters African American employees from applying for jobs, seeking promotions, desirable job assignments, management positions, and other terms and conditions of employment. The Company’s discriminatory treatment of African American employees has created a hostile environment and has been ongoing. These continuing policies and/or patterns or practices of disparate treatment are common to and typical of the claims of all Plaintiffs and class members and satisfy Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirement that the Company has acted or refused to act in a manner generally applicable to the class.

For the reasons stated below, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND On March 6, 2003, Plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit, No. AW-03-623, alleging racial discrimination in employment against Friedman's, Inc. under the Civil Rights Act of 1866. 42 U.S.C. § 1982 (2006).
Plaintiffs, excepting *492 Mitchell, also claim that the discrimination they experienced was part of a company-wide policy or trend of race discrimination that pervaded the company's employment practices and that Friedman's maintained an environment hostile to African-American employees. On September 30, 2004, the proceedings were stayed and the case was administratively closed in order to allow parties to pursue settlement agreements. These negotiations resulted in the settlement of injunctive relief issues in the form of an Interim Partial Settlement Agreement, as well as a ""tentative agreement of the parties on classwide monetary relief,"" which was conditioned on Friedman's obtaining funding for the settlement from Federal and St Paul.

95,EE-MD-0151,"On August 28, 2017, six transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland Maryland contesting the President's ban on transgender service in the U.S. military. Judge Garbis initially granted a motion for a preliminary injunction in September, but this was later stayed in 2019 when the Supreme Court issued a stay of this nationwide injunction in two factually similar cases contesting the ban. 

This case changed dramatically in 2018 when the government altered its policy on transgender service in the military, eliminating an outright ban and instead putting new guidance on transgender men and women entering the service. Judge Russell, reassigned to the case in 2018, dissolved the preliminary injunction, saying that it was only meant to stay a complete ban on transgender service in the military. This also dismissed all claims against the 2017 outright ban as moot, and removed all plaintiffs that were already in the service and not seeking to join. Discovery is ongoing in the case.","28, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle; Stockman v. Trump, No. 17-cv-1799-JGB-KK, filed on Sept. 5, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 52].
This was followed by an August 2017 Memorandum implementing his announcement. Plaintiffs brought suit alleging that the Twitter Announcement and 2017 Memorandum unconstitutionally discriminated against transgender individuals. The district court issued a This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.
Defendants asserted that the 2018 Policy addressed a medical condition, gender dysphoria, rather than transgender status. The district court struck the motion to dissolve the injunction.
Defendants filed this appeal from that order. Proceedings continued in the district court. On April 19, 2018, the district court struck Defendants’ motion for a protective order precluding discovery pending the resolution of Defendants’ appeal.
In addition, Defendants moved to dissolve the December 11, 2017 preliminary injunction on the ground that the 2017 Memorandum had been supplanted by the 2018 Policy. On April 13, 2018, the district court granted in part and denied in part the cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court first determined that the 2018 Policy had not rendered Plaintiffs’ challenges moot.
The district court concluded that on the present record, it “cannot determine whether the DoD’s deliberative process including the timing and thoroughness of its study and the soundness of the medical and other evidence it relied upon is of the type to which Courts typically should defer.” Accordingly, the district court denied “summary judgment as to the level of deference due.” The district court proceeded to hold that, for the same reasons it could not grant summary judgment as to the level of deference, it could not reach the merits of the constitutional violations alleged by Plaintiffs.
The district court also addressed Defendants’ contention that the district court was without jurisdiction to impose injunctive or declaratory relief against the President in his official capacity. The district court granted Defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment with regard to injunctive relief and denied it with regard to declaratory relief. It opined that this was an appropriate instance for declaratory relief.10 The district court did not rule on the merits of Defendants’ motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction, and instead ordered the motion stricken.
Plaintiffs also served Defendants with requests for the production of documents. 11 Defendants filed a motion in the Ninth Circuit to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. A three-judge motions panel of the Ninth Circuit denied the motion, noting that “a stay of the preliminary injunction would upend, rather than preserve, the status quo.”
On January 22, 2019, the Supreme Court granted a stay of the district court’s preliminary injunction “pending disposition of the Government’s appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and disposition of the Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is sought.”
The district court’s striking of Defendants’ motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction is vacated, the preliminary injunction is stayed pending the district court’s reconsideration of that motion, Defendants’ petition for writ of mandamus is granted, the district court’s July 27, 2018 discovery order is vacated, and this case is remanded to the district court.23 Following the Supreme Court’s January 22, 2019 decision, Plaintiffs informed this court that they no longer oppose the remedy of vacatur of the preliminary injunction and remand sought by Defendants. Plaintiffs asked this court to “enter a summary order vacating the preliminary injunction and remanding to the district court for further proceedings.” In response, Defendants urged us to “issue a reasoned decision vacating the district court’s preliminary injunction.”
We have adopted neither of these paths. Our decision remands for the district court to consider the merits of Defendants’ motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction. 23 The parties and amici have raised a number of other issues which are arguably before us, but we decline to reach them in favor of further proceedings in the district court leading to the trial of Plaintiffs’ contentions.

The plaintiffs alleged that the President's ban on transgender individuals serving in military service violated the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Due Process Clauses. On November 21, 2017, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Defendants from taking any action to enforce the policies and directives encompassed in President Trump's August 25, 2017 Memorandum.

The District Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for an extension of time to file a report with the results of its study of transgender military service that reviewed evidence collected while the Open Service Directive was in place and drafted a report.

In 2019, two of the officers reached a partial settlement with Pocomoke City requiring adoption of anti-discrimination policies and procedures by the police department and awarding monetary damages to the officers.

The EEOC argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on this issue because the undisputed facts establish that it made a good faith effort to conciliate Graves’ charge of discrimination Id.
Having reviewed the evidence submitted by the parties, the EEOC’s Motion is DENIED and this case is STAYED for a period of sixty (60) days from the date of this Order.
DISCUSSION I. Facts This case arises from the EEOC’s allegations that UMB discriminated against Graves in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) by refusing to hire him for a Customer Service Representative1 position based on his disability2. (Doc.
In addition, the EEOC is seeking $300,000.00 in compensatory damages, the maximum allowedbythe applicable statutory cap. The Commission also asks [UMB] to hire [Graves] as a Customer Support Sales Agent and to provide ADA training to all of its managers and supervisors. Please understand, however, that Mr. Graves continues to demand $3,000,000 to resolve this case and that [UMB’s] unilateral conciliation with the EEOC would not effect his right to pursue private litigation.
The EEOC filed suit on December 1, 2004.
97, 107 (D.C Conn. In the instant case, the EEOC argues that the undisputed facts establish that, as a matter of law, the EEOC made good faith efforts to conciliate. UMB argues that, in light of UMB’s repeated requests for a face-to-face meeting, the EEOC’s refusal to conduct a face-to-face meeting is evidence of the EEOC’s unreasonableness and lack of good faith.
CONCLUSION The Court finds that the EEOC’s refusal to meet with UMB regarding Graves’ claim and his ability to perform the essential functions of the position for which he applied was not reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, the EEOC’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED and this case is hereby STAYED for a period of sixty (60) days from the entry of this Order. IT IS SO ORDERED.

New York, New York 10017 Tel: (212) 338-9188 Attorneys for Plaintiffs Preliminary Statement Plaintiff now requests Court approval of the settlement of this class action under Fed R. Civ P. 23(e). The class consists of all Hispanic and non-white employees of defendants Restaurant Associates, Inc., and RA Tennis Corp. who worked at the US Open Tennis Tournament in 2003. Notice of the settlement has been sent to each of the 279 members of the class.
Declaration of Laurence B. Jones, 3-4.
Each summer RA hires several hundred persons to staff these facilities for approximately a three-week period. Plaintiff alleges that RA has given the higher-paying concession stand jobs to white employees and that he and all Hispanic and non-white employees are shunted off to lower-paying positions, in violation of the federal, state and City employment non-discrimination statutes. Amended Complaint, 15-16.
As the Court is aware, extensive settlement negotiations took place during 2004-2005 that were supervised by the Court. These negotiations did not result in a settlement. In December of 2005 plaintiff served a motion for class certification on defendant as well as a motion to amend the complaint.
Settlement negotiations resumed in January of 2006 before the full briefing and filing of these motions; plaintiff and an executive of defendant, in addition to their respective counsel, participated in these negotiations. Eventually the negotiations resulted in a settlement which calls for defendant to establish a $90,000 settlement fund to be divided pro rata among non-white employees and employees of non-U.S. national origin who file claims. Counsel fees of $50,000 and an incentive award to the named plaintiff of $7,500 are provided for separately in the settlement agreement, and these payments are not charged against the $90,000 class member fund.

Hundreds of Class members who had suffered racial discrimination were not included in the “Do The Right Thing Award,” and thus, complaints against Kodak by Class members continued to mount. Some Class members filed class-wide Charges of Discrimination with the EEOC. For example, in October 1999, the EEOC’s Buffalo Local Office received multiple Charges of Discrimination against Kodak, alleging, inter alia, that African American employees: 1) received unequal pay; 2) were repeatedly denied promotions; 3) were given lesser job classifications; 4) were given less desirable work assignments; 5) were subjected to a pattern and practice of ongoing harassment and a hostile work environment; and 6) were retaliated against for complaining about these practices to management.

Plaintiffs have filed Charges of Discrimination with the EEOC, and have received notices of their right to sue. Kodak has discriminated against Plaintiffs and the Class with respect to the terms and conditions of employment because of their race, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Kodak’s conduct has been intentional and/or has had disparate impact on Plaintiffs and the Class with respect to the terms and conditions of their employment.

1.9 ""Counsel for Kodak"" or ""Counsel for Defendant"" means the law firms of Nixon Peabody LLP and Morgan, Lewis Bockius LLP. 1.10 The ""Court"" means the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. 1.11 ""Defendant"" and the ""Company"" mean Eastman Kodak Company.
As noted above, Kodak will enhance its existing EOE training to place even greater emphasis on its complaint procedures and every employee's obligation to identify potential violations of the Kodak's EOE policies by utilizing the complaint procedures. 7.6 In addition, Kodak will develop a database or spreadsheet to track all complaints of discrimination at Kodak and the resolution/status of such complaints. This tracking process PDF compression, OCR, web optimization using a watermarked evaluation copy of CVISION PDFCompressor will cover all complaints in the United States of any form of alleged discrimination.
The total amount allocated for this group is $8,297,750.00. In addition, Kodak has agreed to be bound by the seulement for a period of four years, and has agreed, among other things, to the following: Kodak will continue to maintain and enforce its existing non-discrimination and anti-retaliation policies designed to assure equal employment opportunity for its employees. Kodak will continue to enforce its policy of not knowingly maintaining or enacting any policy or practice that has the purpose or effect of unlawfully discriminating against any Settlement Class Member or other African American employee on the basis of race.
The case, Davis, et at y. Eastman Kodak Company, Civil Action No. 6:04-cv-06098, was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York on July 30, 2004, and originates from complaints of racial discrimination filed with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the EEOC) in the late 1990's. The settlement also resolves claims made in a related case, Aiston, et al y. Eastman Kodak Company, Civil Action No. 07-cv-6512, which is also pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. In achieving this settlement, all parties have agreed to completely resolve the issues between them and to dismiss all pending legal actions.
The Settlement Terms: The Settlement Agreement (Docket 313) provides monetary relief for every member of the Class who did not exclude themselves from the Settlement following their receipt of the Notice by returning an opt-out letter to the Claims Administrator. The Agreement provides for the payment of $21,376,500.00 (the “Settlement Fund”). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Fund will be distributed to the 3008 Class Members who did not timely opt-out of participating in the Settlement.
Here, common issues of law and fact predominate over the case. The issues primarily concern Kodak’s policies and practices in the workplace with respect to its African American employees. Plaintiffs’ statistical evidence resulting from Kodak’s own internal [EEOC] study, along with the expert reports of Dr. Madden and Dr. Greenwald, supports their class allegations and presents common issues shared by plaintiffs and Class members.
APPEAL, CLOSED_2010, CONSENT, JWF U.S. DISTRICT COURT U.S. District Court, Western District of New York (Rochester) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE 6:04−cv−06098−JWF",Three African American employees of Kodak filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York.

The parties reached a settlement in October 2013 and the case was dismissed in March 2014 with prejudice.,"On July 30, 2004, African American employees of Eastman Kodak Company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against the company.

The parties reached a settlement agreement. The settlement provided for the payment of $21,376,500.00 (the ""Settlement Fund"") to be distributed to the 3008 Class Members who did not timely opt-out of participating in the settlement. The total amount allocated for this group is $8,297,750.00."
113,EE-NY-0293,"This 2017 lawsuit was brought by three detectives of the NYPD in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs claimed that the City of New York and various agents of the NYPD had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by implementing a secretive policy of refusing to promote deserving African American detectives solely based on race. The parties reached a confidential settlement that was reported to include $700,000 in damages to cover backpay and loss of reputation.","The disproportionately small number of African-American detectives in the higher paying and more prestigious First and Second Grades is a direct result of the secret and standard-less promotions policy that gives high-level NYPD personnel in the Intelligence Division unchecked discretion to hand-pick white candidates for promotion while repeatedly overlooking more qualified African-American detectives. At the time Named Plaintiffs filed their charge with the EEOC, those making the decisions were overwhelmingly white.
There were no African Americans in the senior levels of the Intelligence Division, with none holding a rank above sergeant—that is, no Lieutenants, Captains, Deputy Inspectors, or Chiefs. After investigating the case for five years, the EEOC found that “black detectives do not receive equal treatment in promotion.” Specifically, the EEOC found that Named Plaintiffs “and black detectives in general, received lesser and later opportunities for promotion consistent with their qualifications.”
The City of New York (the “City”) is a municipal corporation existing by virtue of the laws of the State of New York. The City, through the NYPD, maintains a policy and practice of discriminating against African-American detectives in the Intelligence Division. The City is liable for the discrimination Named Plaintiffs and similarly situated African-American detectives suffered.
The Determination stated that a “[d]etailed analysis of the materials made available substantiates the conclusion that the three Charging Parties, and black detectives in general, received lesser and later opportunities for promotion consistent with their qualifications.” The EEOC attempted conciliation thereafter. After conciliation failed, the EEOC referred the complaint to the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which reviewed the matter and determined not to file suit.
On June 26, 2017, DOJ issued a notice stating that Named Plaintiffs had 90 days from receipt of that notice to file suit.
But African-American detectives who have been told for years that they are on the “list” have not been promoted. After the Named Plaintiffs filed with the EEOC, the NYPD began working on a new promotion policy. High-level NYPD employees have admitted that a change to the promotion process is necessary.
McCollum was promised promotions because of his outstanding performance repeatedly. In 2001, Det. McCollum was told that if he continued with his excellent work, he could expect to “retire as a First Grade Detective.”
McCollum never received the promotion, or any explanation for the denial. In October 2006, Det. McCollum was again expressly promised a promotion by a different supervisor, who informed him that a large number of promotions were about to occur and that he was at the “top” of the secret “list” based on his seniority and achievements.
McCollum’s supervisor also advised that detective that he was being put forward against Det. McCollum and that Det. McCollum would receive the promotion, given his superior record and experience.
The Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the other members of the Rule 23 Class. The Named Plaintiffs and all other members of the Rule 23 Class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ conduct in violation of Title VII and state and city human rights laws. The Rule 23 Class members are employed, or were employed, by the NYPD as detectives and were improperly denied promotions.

The complaint alleged that the Intelligence Division's secretive unstructured promotions policy, administered by white supervisors, allowed the all-white supervisors to refuse to promote deserving black detectives.

114,EE-NY-0298,"Current and former Black FDNY employees sued the City of New York alleging racial discrimination in their hiring, promotion, and compensation practices. Plaintiffs sought to represent a class of individuals similarly situated who suffered from FDNY's policies that afforded too much discretion to higher-level individuals and fostered a culture of favoritism that harmed Black candidates for hiring and advancement.  The City filed a motion to dismiss and the Court partially granted the motion, but sustained the plaintiffs' claims related to the hiring and promotion practices with the FDNY. The City moved for partial summary judgment in May 2020, arguing that the retired class representatives could not seek relief. At the same time, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. Both motions were pending as of February 11, 2021.","INTRODUCTION 1. For well over a century, the Fire Department of New York (the “FDNY”) has engaged in a pattern or practice of systemic, continuous, and intentional discrimination against African American emergency medical services (“EMS”) and non-uniformed (“Civilian”) employees and job applicants in hiring, placement, advancement, and compensation decisions. For about 100 years after the Civil War, white men, primarily of Irish and Italian descent, controlled the FDNY at all levels, from upper management to staff.

He is currently employed as a Computer Specialist. He is a representative of the Job Selection Class and the Compensation Class. Plaintiff Arlene Simmons is African American and has worked for the FDNY from 1993 until the present.
Additionally, in 2011, a black female EMS Lieutenant filed a discrimination lawsuit charging that the FDNY repeatedly denied her promotion to the EMS Captain's position. The City also settled that case. While using interviews to block African American advancement in the EMS ranks, FDNY facilitated the advancement of white employees through a policy change in 2010 that has continued thereafter.

17-CV-9447 (JPO) OPINION AND ORDER J. PAUL OETKEN, District Judge: In December 2017, a group of African American employees of the Fire Department of New York (“FDNY”) filed a lawsuit against the City of New York (the “City”), raising claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 and the New York City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”), N.Y.C Admin. Code § 8-101 et seq., and alleging that FDNY discriminates against African Americans in its hiring, promotion, and compensation practices. (Dkt No.
2015), the City argues that Plaintiffs have insufficiently ruled out “non-discriminatory explanations,” id. at 69, for the alleged pay disparities. (Dkt No. 36 at 3.)
She is currently employed as a Principal Administrative Associate. She is a representative of the Employee Class. Plaintiff Jon Watson is African American and has worked as a Civilian for the FDNY from 1999 until the present.
He is currently employed as an Associate Fire Protection Inspector. He is a representative of the Employee Class. Plaintiff Erica Richardson is African American.
She unsuccessfully applied for four Civilian positions with FDNY in 2015 and 2016 – Substance Abuse Counselor, Family Liaison, Community Coordinator, and Academy Administrator – for which she was qualified. She is the representative of the Rejected Applicant Class. The law of the State in which the district court is located determines a party’s amenability to suit.
Plaintiffs have access to publicly available payroll data for the FDNY that shows, among other information, the names of employees, their civil service job positions, and their salaries each year from 2008 through 2016. The information does not, however, contain racial information for the employees. For that reason, Plaintiffs cannot perform agency-wide compensation analyses for all job titles in a job category comparable to the job selection analyses discussed above that show much lower rates of African American employment at FDNY than in other city agencies, especially in higher-paying job categories.

The EEOC’s Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted and SunDance’s Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied.5 I. Factual Background Elizabeth Salsbury, a speech pathologist and an employee of SunDance, was terminated on 1 March 1999 as part of SunDance’s company-wide reduction in force. (McNett Aff.
1992) (discussed infra p. 12) (citation omitted). The EEOC seeks injunctive relief to prohibit SunDance from enforcing its Separation Agreement and to provide reformed agreements to Elizabeth Salisbury and other similarly situated employees. (Docket #1, p. 6-7).
at 431. SunDance asserts that its Separation Agreement is a valid contract between an employee and SunDance. Several cases in the Sixth Circuit and elsewhere have upheld knowing and voluntary waivers of an employee’s discrimination claims.
This Court holds that the provision of the SunDance Separation Agreement conditioning severance payments on an employee agreeing not to file a charge with the EEOC is facially retaliatory in violation of the ADA, ADEA, EPA, and Title VII. The EEOC requested in its prayer for relief a permanent injunction enjoining SunDance from maintaining its Separation Agreement or any agreement which retaliates based on an employee filing a charge with the EEOC. (Docket #1, p. 6).
Corp., No. 04-4178 (6th Cir.)
(Final Brief as Appellee filed June 30, 2005) Background: EEOC filed this case alleging that defendant violated the antiretaliation provisions of the EPA, Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA by requiring employees fired in a reduction in force to waive their rights to file an EEOC charge and to participate in EEOC proceedings as a condition of receiving severance pay. The district court granted EEOC's motion for summary judgment on liability and defendant appealed. Argued: (1) The district court correctly ruled that defendant violated the antiretaliation provisions of the EPA, Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA by conditioning an employment benefit on relinquishing protected statutory rights.
OPINION BOGGS, Chief Judge. Defendant SunDance Rehabilitation Corporation (“SunDance”) appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) on cross-motions for summary judgment. The EEOC sued SunDance under the antiretaliation provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12117(a) and 12203; Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. § 623(d); Equal Pay Act (“EPA”), 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3); and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), alleging that the separation agreement that SunDance offered to discharged employees in exchange for severance pay not otherwise owed to the employees violates those statutory antiretaliation provisions.

Nabisco has a long history of discriminating against African American employees which was not remedied by Kraft when Kraft took over the brand. This class action is brought by two current employees of Kraft who, along with Defendant's other African-American employees, were subjected to Kraft's continuing policies and practices of racial discrimination. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Kraft discriminates against African-American employees by exacting discipline against African-American employees that is dispropOliionate to these employees' alleged offenses, and by disciplining African-Americans more severely than White employees for the same alleged offenses.
In 1999, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Progranls (""OFCCP""), conducted an audit of Nabisco. The audit addressed Nabisco's Affirmative Action Programs, racial diversity, equal pay, and disciplinary measures regarding minority employees, and specifically, African American personnel. At the time ofthe audit, Sondra L. Dean was employed by Nabisco as its Employee Relations Manager.
Upon information and belief, these policies continued after Kraft acquired Nabisco, and continue to this day. Kraft retaliated against African American employees who complained either internally or externally about discriminatory treatment of African-Americans with the Company. This information led Mr. Matthews and Ms. Dean to conclude that significant bias existed against Nabisco's (and later, Kraft's), African American employees with respect to discipline, pay and promotional opportunities.
Plaintiff Davis has filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Pennsylvania Human Relations commission and the EEOC on behalf of a class of African-American workers of the Philadelphia bakery and has received her notice of right to sue, as set forth above. Kraft has discriminated against Plaintiffs and the Class with respect to the terms and conditions of employment because of their race, in violation of Title VII of the civil Rights Acts of 1964,42 U.S.C. § 200e et seq., as amended by the Civil rights Act of 1991. Kraft's conduct has been intentional andlor has had disparate impact on Plaintiffs and the Class with respect to the terms and conditions of their employment.

Honorable Judge Terrence F. McVerry Magistrate Judge Amy Reynolds Hay ELECTRONICALLY FILED PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO VOLUNTARILY DISMISS COUNT II OF PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT Representative Plaintiffs move, pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to voluntarily dismiss Count II of their Complaint, which seeks relief for violations by Defendant Latrobe Specialty Steel (“LSS”) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq., stating as follows: 1. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs have alleged that LSS unlawfully terminated them and others similarly situated, on basis of age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. 2. Plaintiffs have asserted claims for disparate treatment and disparate impact, in Counts I and II, respectively.
Plaintiffs filed a two-count Complaint alleging LSS violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. (""ADEA""). Count I alleged disparate treatment, and count II alleged disparate impact based upon LSS's ""employment practices which discriminate against older workers."" Compl.
This is an age discrimination case. Plaintiffs were terminated from their employment by Defendant Latrobe Specialty Steel Company (“LSS”), for allegedly sending graphic and sexually explicit emails on company time and equipment. Plaintiffs contend that this expressed reason was a pretext insofar as other LSS employees, including senior management personnel, engaged in similar conduct and were not terminated.
In October 2007, during the course of an investigation into a sexual harassment complaint against Magdic, LSS discovered that Appellants, as well as two other employees, Thomas Everett and David Conrad, regularly exchanged emails containing sexually explicit photographs. LSS’s Electronic Communications Policy (“EC Policy”) expressly prohibits employees from sending such materials. As such, LSS executives decided to preliminarily suspend all six employees pending further inquiry.
At the time they were fired, Appellants were all in their late fifties or early sixties. Appellants subsequently filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging that LSS discriminated against them because of their age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. On December 29, 2010, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of LSS, concluding that Appellants had failed to demonstrate that “but for” their ages, LSS would not have terminated their employment. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

On October 4, 2011, the parties participated in a 12-hour mediation with an experienced employment law mediator, Alfred G. Feliu, Esq. Id. The parties reached agreement on the material terms of a settlement, including the monetary amount, at the conclusion of the mediation. The parties then negotiated a formal settlement agreement incorporating all terms, which all parties have signed.

The Plaintiff – the person who brought the lawsuit – sued Driver Solutions for allegedly rejecting his application for an entry-level truck driver position because of his past criminal conviction.
The lawsuit alleges that Driver Solutions’ policy of rejecting applicants with criminal histories has a disparate impact on African American and Latino applicants in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The lawsuit seeks recovery of backpay, attorneys’ fees, and costs, and an injunction preventing Driver Solutions from continuing to enforce its criminal background policy. Driver Solutions denies that it did anything wrong and says that opportunities for hiring and job referral are equally available to all applicants, regardless of applicants’ race, national origin or ethnicity.
Both sides believe they would have prevailed at trial, but there was no trial. Instead, both sides agreed to a settlement. That way they avoid the cost of a trial, the risk of an uncertain outcome at trial, and the risk that Driver Solutions would not have been able to pay a judgment if the Plaintiff had prevailed at trial; nevertheless, the people affected will get compensation.
What does the settlement provide? Driver Solutions has agreed to pay money into a settlement fund that will be divided among the Plaintiff and Class Members who submit a Claim Form and who are determined to be eligible to participate in the settlement. The money in the settlement fund will be divided and paid out to participants in the settlement based on the information that Class Members provide in their Claim Forms.
How will the lawyers be paid? The Plaintiff has entered into a retainer agreement with Class Counsel. Under the agreement, Class Counsel will ask the Court to approve up to one-third of the settlement amount as their attorneys’ fees.
Prior to settling the lawsuit, the parties engaged in motion practice and significant informal and formal discovery. The parties reached a settlement on January 17, 2012, involving monetary relief of $475,000 and injunctive relief. The injunctive relief requires Defendants to modify the criminal background hiring policy that they apply to applicants.

In accordance with a consent decree spanning three years and three months, defendant agrees to pay $100,000 to CP. Defendant will provide 4 hours of anti-discrimination training to the managers and supervisors at the Spokane facility and agrees to impose discipline upon any supervisor or manager who engages in sex discrimination.

133,EE-WI-0033,"In June 2006, the EEOC filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin against the restaurant chain International House of Pancakes (IHOP), its former president, and another company that together with IHOP operated restaurants throughout Illinois and Wisconsin. The EEOC sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e) and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. § 1981a) on behalf of two female employees and similarly situated employees of the Defendants. Specifically, the EEOC alleged that the Defendants engaged in unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex and retaliation, and that they had subjected female employees to a sexually hostile work environment. In 2009, the jury held for the EEOC. In 2012, the parties settled, and the Court approved a Consent Decree/Settlement Agreement (lasting 2 years) that awarded monetary damages to two female claimants and promised injunctive relief. The case closed in 2012. ","This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706(f)(1) and (3) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3) (""Title VIlli) and Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a. The unlawful employment practices alleged were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. PARTIES 3.

At trial, defendants attempted to show that they exercised reasonable care by pointing out that they had adopted a policy against sexual harassment and trained their employees about sexual harassment. The training consisted of showing all employees a “sexual harassment video tape” upon the commencement of their employment. (This tape was not shown to the jury or otherwise offered as evidence.)
See Loughman, 395 F.3d at 407 (finding that “the consistent stream of harassment” at an employer’s restaurant suggests that employer’s anti-harassment policy was “actually not very effective at all”). Gutierrez violated the policy by engaging in sexual harassment. The other assistant manager at the Racine IHOP, Nadia Del Rio, failed to investigate or report Gutierrez’s harassment after Shisler and Powell complained to her.

(4) requiring Flipmeastack to report any complaint of sexual harassment to the EEOC within thirty days and provide a description of the complaint, the investigation that was conducted, and the result of the complaint; . (5) requiring Flipmeastack to post a notice regarding this case at all restaurants under its control; and (6) requiring Flipmeastack to maintain records of its compliance with the injunction and to allow the EEOC access to these records on forty-eight hours’ notice.
Flipmeastack is enjoined from allowing a sexually hostile work environment to exist at any restaurant under its management. Flipmeastack is ordered to create a new sexual harassment training program for all employees under its direct or indirect supervision that emphasizes the responsibility of supervisors to prevent and correct promptly and sexually harassing behavior. Further, Flipmeastack is ordered to post, at all restaurants that it manages, a toll-free number for harassment and discrimination complaints by employees and a written anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policy.
Civil Action No. 06C0715 CONSENT DECREE AND ORDER This action was filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“Commission” or “EEOC”) against defendants Management Hospitality of Racine, Inc., d/b/a International House of Pancakes (“Management Hospitality”), Flipmeastack, Inc. (“Flipmeastack”), and Salauddin Janmohammed (“defendants”), pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, to correct unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex and retaliation, and to provide appropriate relief to Katrina Shaw Shisler (“Shisler”) and a class of similarly situated female employees of defendants Management Hospitality and Flipmeastack who were adversely affected by such practices. EEOC alleged that Shisler and a class of similarly situated female employees were adversely affected by such practices when an assistant manager at defendants’ IHOP restaurant in Racine, Wisconsin subjected them to a sexually hostile working environment based on their gender. In addition, EEOC alleged that Shisler was discharged in retaliation for her refusal to submit to the harassment and her 1 opposition to such unlawful employment practices.
Restaurants which currently receive such services are listed on attached Exhibit B, and Flipmeastack shall advise EEOC in writing if any restaurants are added or deleted from that list during the term of this Consent Decree.
Flipmeastack shall continue to conduct sexual harassment training for all employees at any restaurant at which it provides restaurant management consulting services that emphasizes the responsibility of supervisors to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior. Further, Flipmeastack will post, at all restaurants where it provides management consulting services a toll-free number for harassment and discrimination complaints by the restaurants’ employees and a written anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policy. Flipmeastack shall post the attached Notice informing employees of all restaurants where it provides management consulting services of this Consent Decree and Order in a conspicuous location where such Notice can be easily seen by all employees, pursuant to paragraph 7 below.
The training described in paragraph 2 shall be provided to all new employees at the restaurants serviced by Flipmeastack as part of the hiring process and to all employees once per year in 2012, 2013, and 2014. Flipmeastack shall annually provide the EEOC’s Milwaukee District Office with a list of those trained and the date and description of the training provided. MONETARY RELIEF Defendants agree, within 15 days of entry of this Consent Decree and Order, to pay: $11,000 as damages to Ms. Katrina Shisler; and $4,000 as damages to Ms. Michelle Powell.

In Rosemere, the Ninth Circuit addressed the voluntary cessation doctrine in 17 circumstances closely analogous to the present action.

During the pendency of 5 the action, the OCR concluded its investigation, found no improprieties by the City, and 6 dismissed the complaint.
As a result, Rosemere amended its complaint to add a request for 7 injunctive relief to compel the EPA to process all Rosemere complaints filed within the 8 following five years within the regulatory deadlines. The EPA filed a motion to dismiss Rosemere’s action as moot, which the district 10 court granted. The Ninth Circuit reversed, citing the voluntary cessation exception.

135,EJ-DC-0001,"This 2016 lawsuit was brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff, later joined by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the Yankton Sioux Tribe, and the Oglala Sioux Tribe, sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, alleging that they had violated the NHPA, the CWA, and NEPA by authorizing the construction of a pipeline over tribal land. Dakota Access, LLC later intervened as a defendant. On July 6, 2020, the court ordered the pipeline closed until the Corps could complete an Environmental Impact Statement, expected to take until 2021; on August 5, the D.C. Circuit stayed that decision, and remanded to the district court for further consideration.","For example, in response to the Tribe’s concerns about burial sites at the James River crossing, the Corps verified that cultural resources indeed were present and instructed Dakota Access to move the pipeline to avoid them.

The Corps and Dakota Access then cross-moved for partial summary judgment on those claims as well. See ECF No. 183 (Corps CRST MSJ); ECF No. 185 (DA CRST MSJ).

See Exh. A (Omaha District EA and FONSI). In August of that year, the Corps’ St. Louis District issued its own EA and FONSI, which addressed four crossings in Illinois, three of which spanned less than 700 feet, and one of which crossed a federal flowage easement for approximately 2.5 miles.
Plaintiff Oglala Sioux Tribe initially filed a complaint challenging the Corps’ approval of the DAPL crossing on February 11, 2017, three days after the Corps granted the easement at Lake Oahe to Dakota Access, LLC. (case no. 17-cv-00267) That case was later consolidated with this case which was brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and in which Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe had intervened. The Court granted Dakota Access leave to intervene as Defendant in the Oglala case. On June 14, 2017, this Court decided motions for partial summary judgment as to environmental impact claims brought by plaintiffs Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.
The Corps then changed course, terminated the EIS process, issued the MLA easement at Lake Oahe, and allowed construction of DAPL to begin immediately without further environmental review. The Tribe moved this Court for partial summary judgment on its APA, NEPA, and Treaty claims against the Corps. The Corps and Dakota Access cross-moved for summary judgment.

Plaintiffs sought a declaration under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 that 26 U.S.C. §§107 and 265(a)(6) violated the Establishment Clause by providing preferential tax benefits to ministers of the gospel.  In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn, 131 S.Ct. 1436 (2011), holding that taxpayers lacked standing to bring an Establishment Clause claim on Arizona's tuition tax credit, the parties submitted a joint Stipulation of Dismissal and the case was dismissed without prejudice on June 20, 2011.","The plaintiffs are federal taxpayers who object to the allowance of 20 preferential tax benefits under the Revenue Code, as enacted pursuant to Article I, 21 Section 8 of the United States Constitution. Venue is appropriate in the District Court for the Eastern District of 23 California, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(e). PARTIES 6.
The plaintiff, Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. (""FFRF""), is a non- 26 profit membership organization that advocates for the separation of church and state and 27 educates on matters of non-theism. FFRF has more than 13,900 members, in every state 28 of the United States, including more than 2,200 members in the State of California.
The tax preferences afforded ministers of the gospel constitute a subsidy that results in tangible and direct economic injury to FFRF, and to its members and 4 employees, who cannot claim these benefits. FFRF, a non-profit organization, competes with churches and religious 7 organizations, but the competition is unfair. The tax subsidies available to churches, 8 religious organizations, and ministers of the gospel are not available to FFRF and its employees.
On October 22, 2009, Pastor Michael Rodgers moved to intervene as a defendant in this action. Factual and Procedural Background On October 16, 2009, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. (“FFRF”) and named plaintiffs filed a Complaint in this court seeking a declaration that 26 U.S.C. §§ 107 and 265(a)(6) violate the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution and injunctive relief. (Docket No. Sections 107 and 265(a)(6) provide preferential tax benefits to “ministers of the gospel,” and are administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”). Section 107 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) allows “ministers of the gospel” to exclude their rental allowance or rental value of any home furnished to them as part of their compensation from gross income for income tax purposes.
Plaintiffs allege that all of the above tax provisions violate the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution, which provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” U.S Const. amend I. Plaintiffs further allege that the California Constitution contains a similarly worded Establishment Clause which is violated by the California Revenue and Taxation Code provisions.
Under the same facts, was permissive intervention properly denied on the basis that the proposed Defendants-Intervenors, who have no counter-claims or cross-claims, lacked “independent grounds for jurisdiction”? STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Freedom From Religion Foundation (“FFRF”) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on October 16, 2009. at 97.
STATEMENT OF THE FACTS The material facts are not in dispute. On October 16, 2009 the Freedom From Religion Foundation and several of its individually named members (collectively, “FFRF”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that 26 U.S.C. §§ 107 and 265(a)(6) violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S Constitution.

On November 6, 2015, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the accommodation to the contraceptive services mandate violates the RFRA.

After the case was argued in the Supreme Court on March 23, 2016, the Court issued a per curiam order on May 16, 2016 remanding all seven cases to their respective courts of appeals.

119 (2010), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Pub L No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010) (collectively, the ""Affordable Care Act"" or the ""Act""). The Affordable Care Act established many new requirements for ""group health plan[s],"" broadly defined as ""employee welfare benefit plan[s]"" within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA""), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), that ""provide[] medical care... to employees or their dependents.""

Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed Reg. 16,501 (Mar. The proposed scenarios require an ""independent entity"" to provide coverage for the objectionable services at no cost to the participants.
Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the Free Exercise Clause claim in Count II.25 The Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that “Congress shall make no law... prohibiting the free exercise” of religion. U.S Const. amend I.


The regulations then require group health plan insurers or administrators to offer separate coverage for contraceptive services directly to insured women who want them, and to inform beneficiaries that the objecting employer has no role in facilitating that coverage. Plaintiffs, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington and nonprofits affiliated with the Catholic Church, arrange for group health coverage for their employees and students. Plaintiffs oppose the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds and do not want to provide the requisite contraceptive coverage.
Instead of taking advantage of the accommodation, Plaintiffs filed suit to challenge it as a violation of their religious rights. Plaintiffs’ principal claim arises under RFRA.
They challenged the contraceptive coverage requirement and the accommodation as an unjustified substantial burden on their religious exercise in violation of RFRA and raised a variety of constitutional challenges under the Speech and Religion Clauses of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The district court considered Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction together with the merits, granted the government’s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and denied as moot the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. Reasoning that “[t]he accommodation specifically ensures that provision of contraceptive services is entirely the activity of a third party—namely the issuer—and Priests for Life plays no role in that activity,” the court held that the Priests for Life Plaintiffs failed to show a substantial burden on their religious exercise.
at 1219-22. While this appeal was pending, the Supreme Court vacated Gilardi in view of its decision in Hobby Lobby. 134 S Ct. 2902 (2014).
They contend, moreover, that the Government has less restrictive ways of ensuring that the employees of the religious organizations have access to contraception without making the organizations complicit in the scheme in this way. The plaintiffs in this case have sued under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, known as RFRA. RFRA grants individuals and organizations an exemption from generally applicable federal laws that “substantially burden” their “exercise of religion,” unless the Government demonstrates that the law furthers a “compelling governmental interest” and is the “least restrictive means” of furthering that interest.

140,FA-DC-0005,"In 2012, Tyndale House Publishers, Inc., and its owner filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Michigan against the Federal Government, seekingto enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage.  The plaintiffs contended that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their sincerely held religious beliefs. On July 15, 2015, the District Court granted a permanent injunction for the plaintiffs, preventing the government from enforcing the version of the contraception mandate at issue in Hobby Lobby. ","FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 21. Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. is a Christian publishing com pany that was founded by Kenneth and Margaret Taylor. Tyndale was founded in 1962 to publish, at first, a single book called Living Letters, which was Kenneth Taylor’s modern paraphrase of portions of the New Testament.

Absent relief from this Court, Tyndale is subject to the Mand ate’s requirement of coverage of the above-described items starting in their October 1, 2012 plan. Tyndale and its owners have a sincer e conscientious religious objection to providing coverage for abortifaci ents and related education and counseling in Tyndale’s health insurance plan. Tyndale and its owners cannot in good c onscience violate their religious beliefs by providing coverage for e mergency contraception, IUDs, or counseling or education in furtherance of the sam e, in Tynda le’s health insurance plan, in cluding starting on October 1, 2012.

Tyndale realleges all matters set forth in paragraphs 1–146 and incorporates them herein by reference. Tyndale’s and its owners’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them from providing coverage for abortifacients, including emergency contraception and IUDs and related education and counseling, in Tyndale’s employee health plan. When Tyndale and its owners com ply with their sincerely held biblical principles and Christian beliefs on abortifacients such as emergency contraception and IUDs, they exercise religion within the meaning of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 150.



The Mandate is not the least restrictive means of furthering Defendants’ purported interests. The Mandate chills Tyndale’s and its owners’ religious exercise. The Mandate exposes Tyndale to lawsui ts, substantial fine s, and financial burdens, and pressures Tyndale and its owners by threatening their property and livelihood based on their religious exercise.

To the extent the government argues that Tyndale’s owners are “free” to abandon their Bible publishing enterprise and sell it to a secular com pany that will com ply with the Ma ndate, such expulsion from Bible publishing would be an extreme form of government burden. The Mandate substantially burdens Tyndale’s and its owners’ religious exercise. Not only does the Mandate burden T yndale’s and its owners exercise of religious beliefs, but the burden is substantial.
The Mandate com pels expressive speech. It requires Tyndale to cover “education and counseling” in favor of abortifacients. Education and counseling are, by definition, speech.
For example:  Almost twenty years ago, in 1993, a secular, private school maintained a “Protestant-only” hiring policy based on the school’s founder’s religious beliefs. Based on this policy, the school refused to hire a substitute French language teacher because she was not Protestant. EEOC v. Kamehameha Schs./Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir.
2 The fact that Plaintiffs object to covering some, but not, all methods of contraception does not change the analysis. For example, Plaintiffs object to including intrauterine devices (“IUDs”) and emergency contraception (“EC”) in its employees’ health insurance plans. IUDs are part of a very limited class of what are known as long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, which have the highest effectiveness rate of any method of contraception other than permanent sterilization.
First, there is nothing indirect ab out the Mandate. It orders Tyndale to provide coverage that Tyndale says violat es its religious beliefs. Then it subjects Tyndale to m onetary fines and lawsuits by the Departm ent of Labor forcing it to violate its beliefs.
In particular, the plaintiffs are required to pay for “drugs (e.g., Plan B, ella) or devices (e.g., intrauterine devices) that can cause the demise of an already conceived/fertilized human embryo.” The plaintiffs instituted this action on October 2, 2012. By requiring the plaintiffs to provide for certain contraceptive care, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants have violated their 4 Neither the Foundation, nor any of the trusts, trustees, officers, or directors (with the exception of Mark D.

The Plaintiffs sought to have their insurer omit coverage of such abortion-inducing drugs from Plaintiff Encompass’s insurance plan. The insurer, however, has informed the Plaintiffs that the insurer is required to comply with the HHS Mandate and to include such abortioninducing drugs in Plaintiff Encompass’s group health insurance plan. Plaintiffs have been forced to comply with the HHS Mandate or face the threat of heavy fines and penalties.
Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth above and incorporate them herein by reference. Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them from providing coverage for abortion-inducing drugs and related education and counseling in Plaintiff Encompass’s employee health insurance plan. When Plaintiffs comply with their sincerely held religious biblical beliefs on abortioninducing drugs and related education and counseling, they exercise religion within the meaning of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 103.

The delays or allowances made by Defendants purposely exclude Plaintiffs and others who seek exclusion based upon religious beliefs and provide further evidence of the Defendants animus towards religious groups. The Defendants actions amount to selective enforcement of the Affordable Care Act. 145. The delay further provides evidence that granting of injunctive relief to the Plaintiff’s is necessary to restore the balance of equities and prevent Defendants from utilizing portions of the Affordable Care Act to impose or forward their own religious beliefs on the Plaintiffs and others while excusing enforcement on parties for political or other reasons.
The merits panel left it to the district court to resolve the remaining three preliminary injunction factors. Plaintiffs in that case have filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals has issued a stay of the mandate. Gilardi, Hobby Lobby, and Conestoga all involve legal claims similar to those advanced by plaintiffs in this case against the same federal regulations and the same federal defendants.
Although defendants do not oppose plaintiffs’ motion on RFRA grounds at this time, defendants do not forfeit any legal rights or claims that they may have at a later date. Should this Court grant Plaintiffs’ Unopposed Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, plaintiffs further ask this Court to stay all proceedings in this case pending the resolution of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga at the Supreme Court and Gilardi by the Court of Appeals. Defendants do not oppose this request.

The plaintiffs alleged that the HHS mandate violated their religious beliefs by requiring them to cover abortion-inducing drugs in their health insurance plans. The case was assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss, who granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and stayed the proceedings until the Supreme Court issued a writ of certiorari in Hobby Lobby and Conestoga.","On November 27, 2013, a construction firm in Kentucky filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the federal government.

The court granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction and stayed the proceedings pending the Court of Appeals resolution of a substantially similar dispute. Following the Supreme Court decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the District Court entered a permanent injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, which will allow them to use the contraceptive services mandate accomodation.","Now come Plaintiffs Joseph A.

This is a case about religious freedom. Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father of our country, principal author of the Declaration of Independence, and our third president, when describing the construct of our Constitution proclaimed, ""No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority.""
Plaintiffs Electrolock Incorporated, Stone River Management Co., Dunstone Co.., Joseph A. Williams III, Joseph A. Williams IV., and Mark A. Williams 54. Plaintiffs Electrolock Incorporated, Stone River Management Co., and Dunstone Co. are for-profit companies. All Plaintiffs share a common mission of conducting their business operations with integrity and in compliance with the teachings, mission, and values of the Catholic faith.
Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to protect against this attack. The Affordable Care Act 76. In March 2010, Congress passed, and President Obama signed into law, the ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"" (Pub. 111-148, March 23,2010, 124 Stat.
119) and the ""Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act"" (Pub L. 111-152, March 30, 2010, 124 Stat. 1029) (referred to in this complaint as the ""Affordable Care Act""). The Affordable Care Act regulates the national health insurance nlarket by directly regulating ""group health plans"" and ""health insurance issuers.""
The Mandate exposes Plaintiffs, as individuals and as employers, to substantial fines. Employers with fewer than 50 employees who purchase insurance for their employees from health insurance issuers are subject to the Affordable Care Act. 42 USC § 30000-13 (a)(l),(4). As an employer with less than 50 full-time employees if Plaintiffs provide insurance which conforms to their religious beliefs but not to the Mandate, Plaintiffs face penalties of $100 a day per elnployee.
The Mandate imposes no constraint on HRSA's discretion to grant exemptions to some, all, or none of the organizations meeting the Mandate's definition of ""religious elTIployers."" HHS stated that it based the exemption on comments on the 2010 interim final rule. 76 Fed Reg. 46621.
Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. Plaintiffs' sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from providing coverage for abortifacients, contraceptives, sterilization, and abortion, or related education and counseling.
Plaintiffs' compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise.
Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Mandate is neutral. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Mandate is generally applicable. Defendants have created categorical exemptions and individualized exemptions to the Mandate.

143,FA-IA-0001,"On October 23, 2013, a non-profit organization filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa against the U.S. government. The plaintiff challenged the Affordable Care Act's contraception insurance mandate. The district court granted the preliminary injunction. The Government appealed, but in 2015 the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. The government ultimately conceded that the insurance mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the court enjoined it. ","The plan year for the College employee health insurance coverage begins on June 1 of each year. The College’s employee health plans cover a variety of contraceptive methods that are not abortifacient. However, consistent with its religious commitments, the College’s contract for employee health coverage states that ella and Plan B, which can and sometimes do act after fertilization has occurred, are excluded.
Also, the College switched from a PPO network to an HMO network. Dordt offers an optional health plan to those students who do not have health insurance coverage of their own. The student plan specifically excludes abortions, and does not cover ella or Plan B.
The initial purpose for the University was to train Christians to be more effective lay workers in local churches. The University is an interdenominational, private, Christ-centered university located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. As a Christ-centered university, Cornerstone has a passion for influencing the whole world through the transforming power of the Gospel.
The plans thus cover approximately 591 individuals. Cornerstone offers three medical insurance options for its employees through Priority Health. The first two options are two tiers of a Health by Choice Incentives HMO plan, and the third is a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) with a health savings account.
In October 2013, tier four and tier five co-pays were changed to 20% co-insurance. Cornerstone’s HMO plan specifically excludes post-coital “emergency contraceptives.” Cornerstone has made changes to the HDHP since March of 2010.
The deductibles changed again in October 2013 to $1250 per person and $2500 per family. The University employee health plans cover a variety of contraceptive methods that are not abortifacient. But, consistent with its religious commitments, the University’s contract for employee health coverage states that emergency contraceptives, such as ella and Plan B, and IUDs which can and sometimes do act after fertilization has occurred, are excluded.
Plaintiffs need only fulfill the self-certification requirement and provide the completed self-certification to their issuers/TPAs. They need not provide payments for contraceptive services to their employees. Instead, third parties—plaintiffs’ issuers/TPAs— provide payments for contraceptive services, at no cost to plaintiffs.

They need not provide paym ents for contraceptive services to their employees. Instead, third parties—plaintiffs’ issuers/TPAs— provide payments for contraceptive services, at no cost to plain tiffs.
With the advent of contraceptives, women have been able to plan their reproductive lives and futures, which has been instrumental towards 2 The fact that Plaintiffs object to covering some, but not all, methods of contraception does not change the analysis. For example, Plaintiffs object to including intrauterine devices (“IUDs”) and emergency contraception (“EC”) in their employees’ health insurance plans. See Doc.
Houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under the plan. “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act,” 78 Fed Reg. 39,870, 39,874 (July 2, 2013). In essence, the government is conceding that the Mandate does not advance any compelling interest when applied to employers who employ employees who share their religious convictions – a category that includes the Schools.5 Denying them the exemption is thus arbitrary, capricious, irrational, unjustified, and discriminatory.
They contend that the government is coercing them to violate their religious beliefs by threatening to impose severe monetary penalties unless they either directly provide coverage for objectionable contraceptives through their group health plans or indirectly provide, trigger, and facilitate that objectionable coverage through the accommodation process. As stated above, the district court granted their request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of the contraceptive mandate and the accommodation regulations against them. The government raises arguments for reversal of the district court’s order that are substantially similar to those asserted by the government in Sharpe Holdings.

It does not ask whether the people it serves are Catholic and, therefore, it does not know whether they are Catholic. Catholic Charities does not inquire about the religion of its applicants for employment. As a result, it does not know how many of its employees are Catholic.

Though the Government's position is unclear, it appears that if an entity qualifies as a ""religious employer"" for purposes of the exemption, any affiliated corporation that provides coverage to its employees through the exempt entity's group health plan would also receive the benefit of the exemption.

145,FA-MA-0001,"This case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts on May 16, 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiff claimed that the department's provision of more than a million dollars of public funds to a ministry called ""The Silver Ring Thing"" (SRT) that uses federal abstinence education funding to bring ""unchurched"" students to Jesus Christ constituted an unlawful establishment of religion and a governmental endorsement and preference for religion in general and specific tenets of the ministry in particular. 

The ministry developed a three hour presentation that was meant to occur directly following a mandatory abstinence education assembly in public schools and which, according to the plaintiff, was ""permeated with religion."" 

In a two-year settlement agreement entered on February 22, 2006, the defendants acknowleged that they had terminated the SRT grant effective January 31, 2006.  The agreement provided that defendants would not fund SRT's abstinence eduction as it had been structured and implemented during the fiscal year 2005, that strict requirements would be made before considering funding any future proposals from SRT, and that extensive monitoring of SRT's activities would occur if SRT was given a grant.  
","MAGISTRATE JUDGE ~2 ,.~_., Plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts (""Plaintiff"" or ""ACLU of Massachusetts""), for its complaint in the above-captioned matter, alleges as follows: PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Defendants have provided more than one million dollars of public funds to an organization called the ""Silver Ring Thing"" (or ""SRT"").
The Silver Ring Thing is a ministry that uses abstinence education as a means to bring ""unchurched"" students to Jesus Christ. Federal dollars support the Silver Ring Thing’s religious activities and religious content. Both because the federal funding of the Silver Ring Thing constitutes a direct government grant to a pervasively sectarian institution and because the federal dollars are demonstrably underwriting religious activities and religious content, the funding violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
On information and belief, these examples of religious content in the SRT three- hour event are not exhaustive. Religious Content of SRT’s Twelve-Step Follow-Up Program 50. On information and belief, the Silver Ring Thing’s twelve-step follow-up program, which federal dollars help support, is a highly religious program that promotes Christianity.
The SRT Sexual Abstinence Study Bible (the ""SRT Study Bible"") (see Step 2) promotes religion. In particular, it preaches Christianity. According to the SRT Study Bible, for example: a.

""Plaintiff' is the American Civil Liberties Union ofMassachuselts. Background A.
On May 16, 2005, Plaintiff filed a complaint in US. District Court, District of Massachusetts, alleging that Defendants' funding of Silver Ring Thing (""SRT"") violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Under current regulatory requirements of the Department of Health and Human Services, ""Organizations that receive direct financial assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services under any Department program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of the programs or services funded with direct financial assistance from the Department.""

In Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14 (1st Cir.1999), a local journalist brought a § 1983 claim arising from his arrest in the course of filming officials in the hallway outside a public meeting of a historic district commission. The commissioners had objected to the plaintiff's filming Id. at 18.
After a judge threw out those charges, Glik filed a civil rights suit against the city and the arresting officers in federal court in Boston, aided by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and Boston attorneys Howard Friedman and David Milton. This settlement resolves that case. The settlement follows a landmark ruling last August by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, declaring that the First Amendment protects the right to record police carrying out their duties in a public place, Glik v. Cunniffe 655 F.3d 78 (2011).
The First Circuit's ruling is binding only in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico, but its persuasive reasoning has been cited by courts and lawyers nationwide facing the recurrent issue of police arresting people for filming them.","On February 1, 2010, local journalist Simon Glik filed a civil rights action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Boston Police Department and the City of Boston. Glik claimed that his arrest for filming police officers in a public space violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The district court dismissed the charges against Glik, which included violation of Massachusetts's wiretap statute and two other state-law offenses. On June 8, 2010, the district court heard oral argument on the officers' qualified immunity request. The officers appealed the decision to the First Circuit. The case is now closed.","In 2010, a Boston man filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court against the City of Boston and three Boston police officers. The plaintiff alleged that the officers violated his civil rights under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, M G. 12,  III, by threatening, intimidation, and coercion. The court granted the plaintiff's motion to stay the district court proceedings pending the resolution of the defendants' appeal from the district courts' denial of their motion to dismiss on grounds that included qualified immunity. The case was settled in 2011."
147,FA-MD-0001,"On October 11, 2011, the plaintiff filed a complaint against the Baltimore City Police Department and three unnamed police officers after they allegedly arrested and destroyed recordings he had taken of them arresting his friend. After many years of failed negotiations and discovery disputes, on April 7, 2014, the parties settled the case with terms favorable to the plaintiff.","c Plaintiff Christopher Sharp, for his complaint against the defendants named above, avers on knowledge, information, and belief: NATURE OF THE CASE 1. This is a civil rights action challenging as unconstitutional the Baltimore City Police Department's warrantless arrest and detention ofplaintiffChristopher Sharp, as well as the seizure and destruction of Mr. Sharp's property, premised upon Mr. Sharp's exercise ofhis rights under the federal and Maryland constitutions to document the conduct of City police officers performing their public duties in a public place. In May 2010, while attending the 135th running of the Preakness, plaintiff used his cell-phone camera to video and audio record the arrest and beating of an acquaintance at Pimlico Race Course.
Neither federal nor Maryland law prohibits this activity, yet lawenforcement officers in the State of Maryland-specifically including Baltimore City police officers -routinely threaten to arrest or punish civilians who document police activity, using the Maryland Wrretap Act and related, inapplicable infractions to back up these threats. This case involves just soch a misapplication of the Maryland Wrretap Act by Baltimore City police officers: they unlawfully detained a young man who had used his cell phone to record a public interaction between police and one ofhis friends; demanded that he surrender his cell phone; and deleted all videos from that cell phone, regardless of their content. By destroying these videos -even ifpurporting to act under the Maryland Wrretap Act the officers violated Mr. Sharp's rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and several common-law rights.
Unknown Police Officers Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are police officers employed by the Baltimore City Police Department. They are ""persons"" as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and at all relevant times were acting under color of state Jaw.
At the time of those acts and omissions, these defendants were all employed within Maryland, and thus were performing a character ofwork or service within Maryland. Baltimore.

On November 30, 2011, BPD 2 Although the parties have yet to engage in discovery to test the factual averments in Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Complaint or for Summary Judgment, the United States assumes the truth of Defendants’ factual allegations for the purposes of this Statement of Interest.
The Fourteenth Amendment Prohibits the Seizure and Destruction of Property Without Due Process The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits state and local officials from depriving “any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S Const. amend XIV.
It specifically addresses the circumstances in this case and Baltimore City Police Department’s General Order J-16 (“Video Recording of Police Activity”), but also reflects the United States’ position on the basic elements of a constitutionally adequate policy on individuals’ right to record police activity. Background In his complaint, Mr. Sharp alleged that on May 15, 2010, Baltimore City Police Department (“BPD”) officers seized, searched and deleted the contents of his cell phone after he used it to record officers forcibly arresting his friend Compl. at 9-12, ECF.
Sharp cannot identify the three officers who confiscated his cell phone. His Complaint, which he filed under 42 U.S C. § 1983, names the three officers as Unknown Officers 1–3.
The lawsuit was brought more than two years ago, on behalf of Mr. Sharp, who alleged that Police Department officers deleted personal videos, including many of his young son, from his cell phone after he had used the phone to record Police Department officers arresting a female friend at the 201 0 Preakness. Under the settlement, the Police Department has agreed to institute a new policy that confirms citizens' rights to photograph as well as video- and audio-record police activities in public or wherever citizens have the right to be. In addition, every officer will be trained on the new policy, and the Department will track complaints of misconduct to ensure adequate training for compliance with the new policy.

148,FA-MN-0002,"On September 10, 2008, a non-profit religious organization, Child Evangelism Fellowship of Minnesota, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Minnesota against the Elk River Area School District #728. The plaintiff alleged that the School District's denial of the plaintiff's request to attend school open house events and distribute its literature violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights, including under rights to freedom of speech, equal protection, and free exercise, and against establishment of religion. On February 6, 2009, the District Court (Judge Ann D. Montgomery) granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the defendant from implementing the district's policy that disallowed the plaintiff to distribute literature to students and attend school open house events for the advertisement of its religious program for children. The case then settled; the school district withdrew the policy at issue and paid the plaintiffs' attorneys fees.  On February 24, 2010, the case was dismissed on joint stipulation.  ","The Good News Club is sponsored by CE.P. The Good News Club is open to all boys and girls between the ages of five and twelve, regardless of religious background, or lack of religious belief. There is no charge or fee for attendance.
The District has created a limited public forum. The District has in fact permitted the Boy Scouts and similar organizations to distribute its literature throughout the schools in the District. Good News Clubs address many of the same subjects addressed by Boy Scouts, except these subjects are addressed from a religious, and particularly a Christian, viewpoint.
The Policy and the District's actions substantially burden Plaintiff's sincerely-held religious beliefs. The Policy and the District's actions target religious speech. There is no compelling government interest sufficient to justifY the Policy and the Distr.ict's actions.
The Policy and the District's actions are not narrowly-tailored restrictions on Plaintiff's free exercise of religion, as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The District has failed or refused to accommodate Plaintiff's sincerely-held religious beliefs. As a direct and proximate result of the District's continuing violations of Plaintiff's rights, Plaintiff has in the past and will continue to suffer in the future direct and consequential damages, including but not limited to, the loss of the ability to exercise its constitutional rights.

The District will not use the Policy in any manner whatsoever to infringe on Plaintifl' s Constitutional rights.
For the reasons set forth below, the preliminary injunction is granted and the motion to dismiss is denied.

Verified Compl.
[Docket No. 1] 10, 12, 13. The Good News Club is open to all children between the ages of five and twelve regardless of their religious beliefs. Meetings for the Good News Club are held on elementary school campuses, and the children are taught biblical principles, moral values, character qualities, respect for authority, relationships, character development, and important community issues Id.
[Docket No. 16] at 2. It maintains that CEF or religious viewpoints were not the target of this policy. Rather, in an effort to ensure necessary federal education funds, it “took the only path open to it, namely, closing its forum except to organizations to whom No Child Left Behind says it must grant access.”

Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their sincerely held religious beliefs.  On January 29, 2013, Judge John A.

119 (2010), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Pub L No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029 (2010) (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or the “Act”). The Affordable Care Act established many new requirements for “group health plan[s],” broadly defined as “employee welfare benefit plan[s]” within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), that “provide[] medical care... to employees or their dependents.”
at 41,730. The interim final rules referred to the Affordable Care Act’s statutory language. They indicated that “a group health plan... must provide coverage for all of the following items and services, and may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible) with respect to those items or services:... (iv) With respect to women, to the extent not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, evidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.”

It is unclear whether, if the Archdiocese qualifies as a “religious employer” under the exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate, any affiliated corporation that provides coverage to its employees through the Archdiocese’s group health plan would therefore also receive the benefit of the exemption.
Under these Clauses, the Government may not interfere with a religious organization’s internal decision if that interference would affect the faith and mission of the organization itself. Plaintiffs are religious organizations affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. The Catholic Church views abortion, sterilization, and contraception as intrinsically immoral, and prohibits Catholic organizations from condoning or facilitating those practices.
Given the existing safe harbor, there is no basis for the Court to consider the merits of Plaintiffs’ complaint at this time. Conclusion This Court joins other district courts and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in concluding that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the case currently pending. The challenged regulation is not sufficiently final for review to be ripe because Defendants have announced the regulation will be modified.

Stephen J. Carmody (See above for address) LEAD ATTORNEY ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED Plaintiff Sacred Heart Catholic School E. Kendrick Smith − PHV (See above for address) LEAD ATTORNEY PRO HAC VICE ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED","On May 21, 2012, the Catholic Diocese of Biloxi, Inc. and 29 St. Dominic, a nonprofit Mississippi corporation, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The plaintiffs alleged that HHS's mandate violated the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by requiring Catholic organizations to pay for objectionable contraceptive products and services. The defendants moved the Court to dismiss the case pursuant to FED R. P. 12(b) on grounds that Plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue these claims, and that this dispute was not yet ripe for judicial review. The case was dismissed on May 21, 2012.","On May 21, 2012, Catholic Charities, Catholic Social Services, de l'Epee, Vicksburg Catholic, St. Joseph, Resurrection Catholic, and Sacred Heart Schools filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The plaintiffs challenged the Affordable Care Act's (Obamacare) requirement that religious employers provide certain preventive services to their employees at no cost to the participants. The court granted the Government's motion to dismiss (without prejudice) for lack of ripeness to await the outcome of the ongoing rulemaking process. The case is closed."
152,FA-OK-0001,"In 2012, evangelical Christian business owners filed a RFRA challenge to rules adopted pursuant to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, arguing that the rules infringed on their religious freedom by requiring them to provide coverage for emergency contraception through their group health insurance plan.  In November 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the contraception mandate did not substantially burden the plaintiffs' religious freedom.  

The 10th Circuit granted expedited en banc review, and oral arguments occurred on May 23.  On June 27, 2013, the 10th Circuit reversed the District Court's injunction denial and sent the case back to the District Court, with instructions to consider two prongs of the injunction inquiry and to rule on the plaintiffs' injunction motion.  The next day, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' emergency motion for a temporary injunction pending the full injunction hearing.  The Supreme Court granted cert., and on June 30, 2014, affirmed the 10th Circuit.  The Court said other ways were open to the government to reach its asserted interest of ensuring the availability of contraception coverage. ","Furthermore, the Green family's religious beliefs forbid them from facilitating activities they regard as immoral or harmful. For instance, they refuse to sell shot glasses at Hobby Lobby. They once declined an offer from a liquor store to take over one of their building leases, because they did not want to facilitate alcohol use in the neighborhood around the store.
Hobby Lobby welcomes employees of all faiths or no faith, and seeks to create a positive, familyfriendly environment for its workers. As part of their religious obligations, the Green family also provides excellent health insurance coverage to Hobby Lobby's and Mardel's employees through a selfinsured plan. As in other aspects of the business, the Greens believe it is imperative that their employee benefits are consistent with their religious beliefs.
The Green family's religious beliefs prohibit them from deliberately providing insurance coverage for prescription drugs or devices inconsistent with their faith, in palticular abOition-causing drugs and devices. Hobby Lobby's insurance policies have long explicitly excluded- consistent with their religious beliefs- contraceptive devices that might cause abortions and pregnancy-termination drugs like RU-486. Recently, after learning about the nationally prominent HHS mandate controversy, Hobby Lobby re-examined its insurance policies to ensure they continued to be consistent with its faith.

Although Hobby Lobby and Mardel are for-profit, secular corporations, the Gre en family operates them according to their Christian faith. “As part of their religious obligations” the Green family provides health insurance coverage to Hobby Lobby’s and Mardel’s employees through a self-insured plan. Complaint, 52.
The court is not persuaded that the coverage was due to anything other than a m istake. Upon discovery of the coverage, Hobby Lobby immediately excluded the two drugs, Plan B and Ella, from its prescription drug policy. Defendants do not dispute that the com pany’s policies have otherwise long excluded abortion-inducing drugs.
See Order, Newland v. Sebelius, No. 1:12-cv-01123, Oct. 26, 2012, ECF No. 57. In that case, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, and the government appealed Id. at 1.
The court stayed all district court proceedings “until the Tenth Circuit issues its ruling or until further order of this Court.” at 2.
The applicants simultaneously filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the contraception-coverage requirement, which is scheduled to take effect with respect to the employee insurance plans of Hobby Lobby and Mardel on January 1, 2013. The District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit denied the applicants’ motion for an injunction pending resolution of the appeal. [1] [2] The only source of authority for this Court to issue an injunction is the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a).
In addition, to the extent the individual plaintiffs in this case are involved in the corporate decisionmaking of Hobby Lobby and Mardel, I am not persuaded that the contraceptive-coverage regulation imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of their religion. The contraceptive-coverage regulation requires employers such as Hobby Lobby and Mardel to provide to their employees health insurance coverage for the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive drugs and devices Period. Although the plaintiffs, and in turn Judge Matheson, artfully suggest that compliance with the regulation “would assist others in using particular contraceptives,” Matheson Op.
Asserting claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”) and the Free Exercise Clause, these corporate and individual plaintiffs challenge a federal regulation requiring employers to provide employee health insurance that covers certain contraceptives. The challenged regulation (“the Regulation”) was promulgated under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act and applies to Hobby Lobby and Mardel. The Greens allege that it burdens their religious beliefs to manage their corporations in compliance with the Regulation by providing health insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue.
In separate actions, they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives. In No. 13–356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their company—Conestoga Wood Specialties—a preliminary injunction. Affirming, the Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not “engage in religious exercise” under RFRA or the First Amendment, and that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their personal capacity.

The plaintiffs alleged the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employee and student health plans provide coverage of contraception violated their religious foundings. On November 6, 2015, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the accommodation to the contraceptive services mandate as applied to religious nonprofits violates the RFRA. This case was consolidated with six others. The Supreme Court issued a per curiam order remanding all seven cases to their respective courts of appeals, and ordered that the parties be given time to come to agreement on ensuring contraceptive access without burdening religious freedom. Following revised HHS policies, the District Court permanently enjoined the defendants from forcing religious organizations to provide contraceptive care.

Introduction Presently before the Court are two cases which challenge the application of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). These cases present the Court with the issue of whether the Dioceses of Pittsburgh and Erie, which are exempt from provisions of the ACA requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraceptive products, services, and counseling (“the contraceptive mandate”), are divisible from their nonprofit, religious affiliated/related charitable and educational organizations which, under the current provisions, will be compelled to facilitate/initiate coverage of contraceptive products, services, and counseling, beginning January 1, 2014, in violation of their sincerely-held religious beliefs.1 On October 8, 2013, in the Pittsburgh division of the United States District Court of the Western District of Pennsylvania, Plaintiffs: Most Reverend David A.

156,FA-TX-0006,"On February 1, 2012, Criswell College, an evangelical Protestant college located in Dallas, filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas against the Federal Government seeking to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage. Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their sincerely held religious beliefs. On April 9, 2013, the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because it was not ripe for review.","The next plan year for the College’s employee health insurance plan will start on January 1, 2013, and the following plan year will start on January 1, 2014. Criswell College’s group health plan is not grandfathered under the ACA. Criswell has made changes to its health plan that have caused it to lose any grandfathered status it may have had.
If Criswell were to drop its health insurance to avoid application of the Mandate, it will experience a competitive disadvantage in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and students. The Mandate coerces Criswell College to provide coverage for and otherwise facilitate the provision of Plan B, Ella, other abortifacient drugs, and related counseling in violation of its religious beliefs. Criswell has a sincere religious objection to providing coverage for contraceptives like Plan B because they believe such drugs cause the death of a human embryo.
The Defendants’ Mandate Affects Criswell Today. The Mandate makes it unclear whether Criswell will be able to offer health insurance as a benefit to its employees, and if so, the terms upon which it will be offered. Criswell is considering whether to forgo health insurance completely for its employees if it means having to violate its firmly held beliefs.
Moreover, health insurance is critical to Criswell’s ability to hire qualified faculty and retain such faculty. Health insurance is included in the employment contracts for Criswell’s faculty. Employment contracts are offered in March of each year, and the contracts run from August 1 to July 31 of each year.
Criswell’s sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit it from providing or facilitating coverage for abortion, abortifacients, embryo-harming pharmaceuticals, and related education and counseling, or providing a plan that causes access to the same through its insurance company. When Criswell complies with the Sixth Commandment of the Bible and other sincerely held religious beliefs, it exercises religion within the meaning of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). The Mandate imposes a substantial burden on Criswell’s religious exercise and coerces it to change or violate its religious beliefs.
It does not apply to religious employers that qualify for the Mandate’s extraordinarily narrow religious exemption. It does not apply to the employers to whom the Defendants have given waivers from the Affordable Care Act. 137. Defendants have created categorical exemptions and other exemptions to the Mandate.
Access to abortifacients is not a significant social problem, and compelling Criswell to pay for or otherwise facilitate access to such drugs and devices is hardly the least restrictive means of advancing any interest the government might have.
The Mandate coerces Criswell College to change or violate its religious beliefs. The Mandate chills Criswell’s religious exercise. The Mandate exposes Criswell College to substantial fines and/or financial burdens for its religious exercise.
Therefore, Defendants have taken agency action not in accordance with procedures required by law, and Criswell College is entitled to relief pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). In promulgating the Mandate, Defendants failed to consider the constitutional and statutory implications of the mandate on Criswell College and similar organizations. Defendants’ explanation (and lack thereof) for its decision not to exempt Criswell College and similar religious organizations from the Mandate runs counter to the evidence submitted by religious organizations during the comment period.
While these cases do not bind this Court, the Court finds their reasoning persuasive. The Court Declines to Hold the Case in Abeyance. –Finally, Criswell notes that the District of Columbia Circuit, after finding two similar cases unripe, elected to hold them ORDER – PAGE 13 in abeyance rather than dismissing them.
Nor is there any particular advantage to doing so: if Defendants do not resolve this issue to Criswell’s satisfaction, Criswell may simply refile its case. The Court thus declines to hold the case in abeyance and dismisses it instead.
CONCLUSION The Court concludes that this case is not ripe for judicial consideration. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Criswell’s complaint without prejudice. Signed April 9, 2013.

159,FH-AL-0008,"In November 2011, two undocumented Mexican immigrants and three fair housing groups filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama against the State of Alabama. The plaintiffs alleged that a state statute violated the Fair Housing Act and was preempted by federal immigration law because it required mobile home owners to pay for a government-issued registration while prohibiting undocumented residents from making payments to government officials. Because the law made it illegal to possess a mobile home without registration and because it was illegal for undocumented residents to obtain the registration, the law effectively made such persons homeless.  The District Court (Judge Myron H. Thompson) enjoined the State from enforcing the law. The State appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit rendered it moot because in May 2012 the Alabama legislature amended the statute to exclude mobile home registration.  The District Court dismissed the case in May 2014, upon stipulation of the parties.","Date Filed: 11/18/2011 Date Terminated: 05/08/2014 Jury Demand: None Nature of Suit: 443 Civil Rights: Accommodations Jurisdiction: Federal Question Central Alabama Fair Housing Center represented by Alvaro M.

160,FH-CA-0007,"This case resulted in the largest residential fair lending settlement in U.S. history, with $335 million being paid to compensate African-American and Hispanic borrowers who were allegedly charged more based on their race or national origin. ",": 0-f C' G COMPLAINT l Plaintiff, United States of America, alleges: INTRODUCTION The United States brings this action against Countrywide Financial Corporation, acting through its various divisions and subsidiaries (collectively, ""Countrywide"") for discriminating against more than 200,000 Hispanic and African-American borrowers in its residential mortgage lending. The action to enforce the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (""FHA""), and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f(""ECOA""), is brought to redress the discrimination based on race and national origin that Countrywide engaged in from 2004 to 2008 during the mortgage boom. Countrywide was one of the largest single-family mortgage lenders in the United States, if not the largest, between 2004 and 2008.
For each residential loan that Countrywide retail mortgage loan officers originated, information about each borrower's race and national origin and the amount of overage or shortage paid was available to, and was known by, Countrywide. Countrywide was required to collect, maintain, and report data with respect to certain loan terms and borrower information for residential loans, including the race and national origin of each retail home loan borrower, pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), 12 U.S.C. § 2803. Statistical analyses of data kept by Countrywide on retail loans originated by Countrywide's CMD between January 2004 and December 2008 demonstrate statistically significant) discriminatory pricing disparities in retail loans based on both race (African-American) and national origin (Hispanic).
The settlement provides $335 million in compensation for victims of Countrywide’s discrimination during a period when Countrywide originated millions of residential mortgage loans as one of the nation’s largest single-family mortgage lenders. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, was filed today in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in conjunction with the department’s complaint which alleges that Countrywide discriminated by charging more than 200,000 African-American and Hispanic borrowers higher fees and interest rates than non-Hispanic white borrowers in both its retail and wholesale lending. The complaint alleges that these borrowers were charged higher fees and interest rates because of their race or national origin, and not because of the borrowers’ creditworthiness or other objective criteria related to borrower risk.
In addition, Countrywide gave mortgage brokers discretion to request exceptions to the underwriting guidelines, and Countrywide’s employees had discretion to grant these exceptions. This is the first time that the Justice Department has alleged and obtained relief for borrowers who were steered into loans based on race or national origin, a practice that systematically placed borrowers of color into subprime mortgage loan products while placing non-Hispanic white borrowers with similar creditworthiness in prime loans. By steering borrowers into subprime loans from 2004 to 2007, the complaint alleges, Countrywide harmed those qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers.
Non-applicant spouses who execute a quitclaim deed risk substantial uncertainty and financial loss by losing all their rights and interests in the property securing the loan. In addition, the settlement requires Countrywide to implement policies and practices to prevent discrimination if it returns to the lending business during the next four years. Countrywide currently operates as a subsidiary of Bank of America but does not originate new loans.
Defendants deny all the allegations and claims of a pattern or practice of 7 discrimination in violation of the FHA and the ECOA as set forth in the United States' 8 Complaint. BAC has represented to the United States that BAC and its subsidiaries do not 10 originate and price loans employing policies and procedures that the United States 11 alleges resulted in the discriminatory practices at issue in its Complaint. BAC has 13 organizations which provide education counseling and other assistance to low income 14 and minority borrowers in connection with obtaining credit, loan modifications and 15 other retention activities.

162,FH-CA-0015,"On May 30, 2014, the City of Los Angeles  filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against JP Morgan Chase Bank, under Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Fair Housing Act/Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA). The plaintiff sought damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants lending practices were predatory and intentionally discriminated against minority borrowers, and had a disparate impact on minorities. On August 6, 2015, the plaintiff field an ex parte application to stay the case pending appeal of related action. On September 2, 2015, the case was dismissed as stipulated.

JPMorgan Intentionally Discriminated Against Minority Borrowers in Violation of the Fair Housing Act, as 1. JPMorgan targets minorities for predatory loan terms (and pays its employees more for doing so)..................... 26 2.
In connection with that action, JPMorgan 18 entered into a settlement agreement with the government pursuant to which JPMorgan 19 will: (a) make a cash payment of $753 million into a settlement fund for distribution 20 to qualified borrowers; and (b) provide an additional $1.2 billion to foreclosure 21 prevention actions. In 2012, JPMorgan Chase and four other large mortgage servicers agreed 23 to a global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of 24 Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the 25 state attorneys general. The settlement relates to unethical mortgage origination and 26 servicing activities similar to the activities alleged herein.
CW4 observed that JPMorgan denied minority borrowers loan 13 modifications in large percentages in the City of Los Angeles because many who were 14 in foreclosure under old stated-income mortgages were unable to get approved under 15 the Bank’s new document-based income guidelines. JPMorgan engages in other abusive lending practices. The CW statements further demonstrate that the Bank increased the 18 costliness of non-conventional loans at the expense of minority borrowers.
Los Angeles has suffered financial injuries as a direct result of JPMorgan’s pattern or practice of reverse redlining and the resulting disproportionately high rate of foreclosure on JPMorgan loans to African-Americans and Latinos in minority neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Los Angeles seeks redress for these injuries. The City does not seek redress in this action for injuries resulting from foreclosures on mortgages originated by lenders other than JPMorgan.

The City is an “aggrieved person” as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 3602(i) and 19 has suffered damages as a result of JPMorgan’s conduct. The City’s damages include lost tax revenues and the need to provide 21 increased municipal services. The loss of tax revenues at specific foreclosure sites and 22 at closely neighboring properties in predominantly minority neighborhoods of the City 23 was a foreseeable consequence that was fairly traceable to JPMorgan’s discriminatory 24 lending.

In connection with that action, JPMorgan 8 entered into a settlement agreement with the government pursuant to which JPMorgan 9 will: (a) make a cash payment of $753 million into a settlement fund for distribution 10 to qualified borrowers; and (b) provide an additional $1.2 billion to foreclosure 11 prevention actions. In 2012, JPMorgan Chase and four other large mortgage servicers agreed 13 to a global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of 14 Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the 15 state attorneys general. The settlement relates to unethical mortgage origination and 16 servicing activities similar to the activities alleged herein.

164,FH-MA-0002,"On February 1, 2008, minority homeowners on behalf of similarly situated minority homeowners filed a class-action complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against H&R Block Inc., H&R Block Bank and its wholly-owned subsidiary,under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691, et seq. (""ECOA"") and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants maintained a pattern or practice that had a discriminatory impact on minority applicants in their home financing policies and practices. On August 21, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation to dismiss the case with prejudice. ","As a result of the Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy, the Defendants have collected more in finance charges from minority borrowers than from similarly situated white persons, for reasons unrelated to credit risk. The Defendants’ Discretionary Pricing Policy violates the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 97. Plaintiffs and prospective class members are aggrieved persons as defined in ECOA by virtue of having been subject to the Defendants’ discriminatory, Discretionary Pricing Policy.
Plaintiffs respond that various tolling doctrines, including the continuing violations doctrine, the discovery rule and fraudulent concealment by defendants, apply to preserve claims based on conduct extending beyond the two-year period. Plaintiffs, seven minority homeowners, filed their complaint in February 2008. All of the plaintiffs except two, Cecil Barrett, Jr. and Cynthia Barrett (“the Barretts”), first entered into loan agreements with Option One after February 2006, within the statute of 6 I note that the complaint also contains a bare allegation that “[d]ue to H&R Block’s policies as to where to place its offices and how to market its products, minority borrowers were more likely than white borrowers to apply for credit from H&R Block through its sub-prime subsidiary Option One, or from an Option One authorized broker.”
Now pending before the court is Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. Plaintiffs are African-American homeowners who bring suit on behalf of themselves and similarly situated homeowners against H&R Block, Inc. (“H&R Block”), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, San Canyon Corp., f/k/a Option One Mortgage Corporation (“Option One”) and Ada Services Corporation, f/k/a H&R Block Mortgage Corporation (“H&R Block Mortgage”) (collectively, “Option One” or “Defendants”).2 The gravamen of Plaintiffs’ complaint is that H&R Block and Option One violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f (“ECOA”), and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (“FHA”),3 by giving its authorized brokers discretion to impose additional charges to the borrower’s wholesale mortgage loans unrelated to a borrower’s creditworthiness, a policy that had a disparate impact on African-American borrowers in that it resulted in their being charged higher rates than similarly situated whites.4 Plaintiffs now move to certify a class of “[a]ll African-American borrowers who obtained a mortgage loan from one of the Defendants between January 1, 2001 and the [d]ate of [j]udgment” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). See Docket 74, Pl.’s Mem.
Plaintiffs allege that “by design,” the Discretionary Pricing Policy “caused persons with identical or similar credit scores to pay different amounts for the cost of credit.” Although facially neutral, the policy had an adverse effect on African-Americans in that they paid higher discretionary charges on their home loans than did similarly situated white borrowers. Plaintiffs bring these claims under a disparate impact theory, challenging “practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.”
Conclusion Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification (Docket 72) is ALLOWED, subject to limitation by time. A class of “[a]ll African-American borrowers who obtained a mortgage loan from one of the Defendants” is hereby certified. March 21, 2011 DATE /s/Rya W. Zobel RYA W. ZOBEL UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
Background The factual background of this case is detailed in the certification order. Briefly, plaintiffs are a number of African-American individuals who obtained home mortgage loans from Option One through mortgage brokers. They allege that defendants’ loan pricing policy violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f (“ECOA”), and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (“FHA”), by giving authorized brokers the discretion to impose additional charges unrelated to a borrower’s creditworthiness.
Plaintiffs claim this policy had a disparate impact on African-American borrowers by resulting in higher mortgage rates for African-American borrowers than similarly situated white borrowers. According to plaintiffs, Option One’s loan pricing consisted of a fixed and ap discretionary component.

CASE NO. 8:08-cv-489 Judge Warren K. Urbom Magistrate Judge Cheryl R. Zwart CONSENT ORDER I. Factual and Procedural Background The United States initiated this action on October 29, 2008, against The Latvian Tower Condominium Association, Inc. (""LTCA"") and its president, Karl Tegtmeyer.

In its complaint, the United States alleges that Defendants violated the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq. (""the Act"" or ""the FHA""), on the basis of familial status with respect to the sale of Unit 722 the Latvian Tower Condominiums in Omaha, Nebraska. The United States alleges that the Defendants violated the FHA by adopting and enforcing a Master Deed and By-Laws that prohibited children under the age of sixteen (16) from occupying or residing in a condominium unit in Latvian Towers. The United States further alleges that the conduct of Defendants constitutes a refusal to allow the sale of or negotiations for the sale of, or otherwise making unavailable, a dw elling because of familial status, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); the making, printing, or publishing of statements with respect to the sale of a dwelling that indicate a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on familial status, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(c); and representation that, because of familial status, a dwelling is not available for inspection or sale when such dwelling is in fact so available, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(d).
The provisions of this Consent Order shall apply to all Defendants, their employees, agents, successors, and all persons acting in active concert or participation with them.

166,FH-NJ-0003,"An association of residents of a New Jersey neighborhood filled a lawsuit claiming that the defendants' redevelopment plan for the Gardens neighborhood represented a violation of the Fair Housing Act and the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants' redevelopment plan, which razed numerous homes in a minority neighborhood, was discriminatory.  The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's pretrial decision in favor of the town to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reversed, and found that the plaintiffs were entitled to a trial.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the question whether disparate impact claims were available under the Fair Housing Act.  About two weeks prior to the scheduled argument, the parties settled; the city will construct 44 new homes, 20 for current residents in exchange for allowing redevelopment.  Seven households that elected to relocate will be compensated.  ","Many residents are low-income. Some had been homeless in the past. They are fearful that they will not be able to afford the new units that were being planned for construction and that they will not be able to find other housing in the area they could afford.

BACKGROUND Since the filing of plaintiffs’ complaint, this case has involved several hearings, the filing of numerous motions and a second amended complaint, and the issuance of two Opinions. At issue is the redevelopment of the Mount Holly Gardens neighborhood (the “Gardens”) in Mount Holly, New Jersey.

After carefully considering the matter, we discern no error in the District Court’s decision and will thus affirm that ruling.","This case involves the redevelopment of the Mount Holly Gardens neighborhood (the ""Gardens"") in Mount Holly, New Jersey. Plaintiffs are low-income, African-American, Hispanic and ""white"" being replaced in large part with new, much higher-priced market rate homes. Plaintiffs argued that the Township's actions deprive Residents of just compensation by driving down the value of their homes and failing to adequately plan or prepare for replacement housing realistically affordable to current and displaced residents and failed to provide adequate relocation assistance that would enable displaced residents to purchase replacement housing.","This case involves the redevelopment of the Mount Holly Gardens neighborhood (the “Gardens) in Mount Holly, New Jersey. Plaintiffs are low-income, African-American, Hispanic and ‘white’ residents of the Gardens, who object to the plan because they are being forcibly removed from their homes, which are being replaced with new, much higher-priced market rate homes. The District Court saw no evidence of intentional discrimination. The Third Circuit reversed the District Court’s grant of summary judgment to the Third Circuit and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for further proceedings."
167,FH-NY-0008,"Low-income minority individuals in need of affordable housing filed a lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against the Town of Smithtown, complaining that  Smithtown operated its voucher program with a residency preference that discriminated on the basis of race, color, and national origin. The court entered an order and final judgment approving the parties' settlement agreement under which the Town of Smithtown agreed to implement an anti-discrimination educational program, to affirmatively market the Section 8 Program to minority persons, to inform the public of its non-discriminatory policies, to maintain and preserve records for purposes of recordkeeping and reporting, and to pay $925,000 to the plaintiffs. This settlement remains in effect until 2019. 

","By this housing discrimination action, Plaintiffs seek redress for ongoing exclusionary housing policies and practices by Defendant Town of Smithtown (the ""Town"" or ""Smithtown"" or ""Defendant""). This action challenges Defendant's ongoing discriminatory acts and long-standing practice of unlawfully restricting the ability of Black and Hispanic individuals (""minority individuals"" or ""minorities"") to obtain federally funded Section 8 rental assistance in Smithtown, New York. By making housing opportunities ""unavailable"" to minority individuals because of race, color, and national origin and other illegal and discriminatory acts, Defendant has violated Plaintiffs' rights under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.; the Civil Rights Act of 1866,42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1982; the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983; the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq. II.
Smithtown operates its Section 8 program to intentionally prevent minorities from receiving Section 8 vouchers. Smithtown's Affirmative Marketing Plan states that it will reopen its Section 8 waitlist only ""when there are fewer than 100 applicants on the waitlist."" In July 2006, there were at least 300 applicants remaining on Smithtown's Section 8 waitlist.
In derogation of its affirmative fair housing obligations, Smithtown decided to reopen the waitlist in July 2006, when the proportion of White, non-Hispanic individuals on the waitlist was dropping and the number of minorities receiving vouchers was increasing, to prevent other minorities on the waitlist from receiving Section 8 vouchers. In derogation of its affirmative fair housing obligations, Smithtown has limited the advertisement of the reopening of its Section 8 program to a narrow set of publications less likely to be read by potential minority applicants. In derogation of its affirmative fair housing obligations, Smithtown discouraged minorities from applying to its Section 8 program through its public representations that applicants were required to live or work in Smithtown to be eligible for the program.

The settlement came after the United States had filed its opposition to GFI’s motion to dismiss the case and the court had stated it was “skeptical” of GFI’s argument that federal law allows lenders to price loans in a way that produces such disparate impacts on minority borrowers. The settlement, which was entered by the court, was filed in federal court in Manhattan, where GFI is headquartered. “The Justice Department will not hesitate to litigate against lenders to enforce federal fair lending laws where the ev idence warrants and to obtain compensation for borrowers who were v ictims of unlawful lending practices,” said Thomas E.

In New York State, more than 50% of the 25,060 inmates released in 2009 were African-American and over 25% were Latino.9 Yet the State’s general population is only 15.9% African-American and 17.6% Latino. Of the nearly 600,000 inmates released by the New York State Department of Correction from 1985 to 2009, over half were African-American and nearly one-third were Latino.10 77. Most of those released from New York State prisons – nearly two-thirds since 1985 – go to New York City to live.11 In 2011, New York City’s own Department of Correction released 88,000 people from its disproportionately African-American and Latino inmate population.12 The reentering population in New York City is therefore very large as well as disproportionately minority.

On July 3, 2019, the court granted summary judgment to the defendants.","On July 3, 2019, The Fortune Society filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Sandcastle Towers Housing Development Fund Corporation, Sarasota Gold LLC, E M Associates LLC, and Weissman Realty Group LLC. The suit alleged that the defendants engaged in a pattern or practice of illegal discrimination on the basis of race and color at The Sand Castle, a multi-building apartment complex they own and manage in Queens, New York. The defendants' policy of automatically excluding any person with a record of a criminal conviction from renting or living in an apartment at the complex is consistent with a policy of limiting the number of new minority tenants in the building. The plaintiff sought injunctive, monetary, and declarative relief. The court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing."
172,FH-NY-0025,"On May 12, 2005, individual New York residents and the New York ACORN local chapter filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Easter District of New York. The plaintiffs sued Nassau County and the Village of Garden City under the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with discriminatory zoning practices; to order Garden City to approve a proposed zoning that would allow for affordable housing; and to order the defendants to take all actions necessary to assure that the Social Service Site be redeveloped to maximize the availability of affordable and integrated housing. 

On February 15, 2012, Judge Arthur D. Spatt granted defendant County's motion for summary judgment dismissing all claims against it. 

On April 22, 2014, Judge Spatt issued a final order for the plaintiffs and ordered Defendant Garden City to take a number of steps to prevent discrimination and to increase access to affordable housing. After Judge Spatt's order, both parties appealed the decision. The Second Circuit affirmed in part and remanded in part. The case is back in the lower courts on remand. On remand, Judge Spatt found that the plaintiffs had met their burden at trial in demonstrating that the Garden City’s proffered reasons for its chosen zoning change could have been met by another practice, such as R-M zoning, that had a less discriminatory effect. Magistrate Judge Arlene R. Lindsay thereafter awarded plaintiffs $5,255,108.94 in attorneys fees and costs from Garden City. On March 15, 2019, Judge Spatt signed the parties’ stipulation of discontinuance with prejudice, except without prejudice as to the court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of interpretation or enforcement of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement required the County to pay $5,400,000 to the plaintiffs to be used for the purpose of furthering and promoting mixed-income affordable housing; $120,000 to NYCC to be used for activities related to fair and affordable housing; and $400,000 to plaintiffs’ counsel for attorneys’ fees.

INTRODUCTION This Consent Order (Order) is submitted jointly by the parties for the approval of and entry by the Court simultaneously with the filing of the United States' Complaint in this action. This Order resolves the claims of the United States that Nixon State Bank (""Nixon"" or ""the bank"") has engaged in a pattern or practice of lending discrimination on the basis of national origin in the pricing of unsecured consumer loans in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f.
Under the provisions of the Order, Nixon agrees to develop and establish uniform pricing policies and procedures designed to ensure that the prices it charges for the loans covered by this Order, including the portion of the price that reflects the discretion of the loan officer or any company employee, are set in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with the requirements of ECOA. Nixon also will compensate its Hispanic borrowers of unsecured consumer loans. There has been no factual finding or adjudication with respect to any matter alleged by the United States.
Information as to each applicant's national origin was available and known to the bank's loan officers, who personally handled each loan transaction at one of Nixon's three branch offices. The Complaint alleges that prior to 2010, Nixon did not properly instruct its loan officers regarding their obligation to treat prospective customers without regard to national origin, and the bank has failed to supervise or monitor the performance of its loan officers effectively to ensure compliance with fair lending laws. The Complaint alleges that prior to 2010, Nixon's policy or practice of giving its employees broad subjective discretion in handling every aspect of the unsecured consumer loan transaction is not justified by business necessity or legitimate business interests III.
This prohibition includes, but is not limited to: the adoption, performance, or implementation of any policy, practice, or act that results in national origin discrimination in the charging of loan prices, including the portion of the loan price that reflects the discretion of the loan officer or any other company employee, to those who borrow money for loans covered by this Order. This Order requires the bank to take actions to remedy its alleged discrimination. Nixon retains the discretion to take any additional actions that it believes are appropriate to achieve the goals of this Order B.
Equal Credit Opportunity Training Program 14. Within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date of this Order, Nixon will provide equal credit opportunity training to its management officials, loan officers, and any other employees or agents who participate in the origination of the bank's loans covered by this Order. During this training, Nixon will provide to each participant: (a) access to a copy of this Order and the loan policies adopted pursuant to it; and (b) training on the terms of this Order, the loan policies adopted pursuant to it, the requirements of ECOA, and his or her responsibilities under each.
The content of this training program will be approved in advance by the United States. Nixon will bear all costs associated with the training G. Satisfaction of the United States' Claims for Monetary Relief 17.
A second report will be filed on the first anniversary of this Order. Thereafter, Nixon will submit a report annually for the term of the Order describing the actions taken in compliance with the provisions of the Order. The report will include an objective assessment of the extent to which each quantifiable obligation was met, an explanation of why any particular component fell short of meeting the goal for that year, and any recommendations for additional actions to achieve the goals of this Order.

176,FH-WI-0003,"On September 26, 2013, the United States of America filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Wisconsin against Southport Bank, under the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

On October 11, 2013, the District Court (Judge Joseph Peter Stadtmueller) entered a consent order between the parties.  The defendant did not admit to any pattern or practice of discrimination.

The order terminates after three years if the defendant has complied during that time period.","COMPLAINT Case No. 13-C-1086 Plaintiff, United States of America, alleges: INTRODUCTION 1. The United States brings this action against Southport Bank of Kenosha, Wisconsin (“Southport” or “the bank”) for discriminating against African-American and Hispanic borrowers in its residential mortgage lending. The action to enforce the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (“FHA”) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691-1691f (“ECOA”) is brought to remedy the discrimination based on race and national origin that Southport engaged in from 2007 to 2008 in its wholesale mortgage lending program.
In 2007 and 2008, Southport charged hundreds of African-American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers higher fees than non-Hispanic white (“white”) borrowers, not as a result of their creditworthiness or other objective criteria related to borrower risk, but because of their race and national origin.
It was Southport’s business practice to allow its mortgage brokers to vary their fees and thus alter the price set based on a borrower’s objective credit-related factors.
1 In September 2008, the bank began to wind down its mortgage lending activities and after November of that year made virtually no new home mortgage loans. On December 31, 2008, Southport closed ComCor. The bank does not currently originate mortgage loans.
Southport was required to collect, maintain, and report data with respect to certain loan terms and borrower information for residential loans, including the race and national origin of each wholesale residential loan borrower, pursuant to HMDA, 12 U.S.C. § 2803. In 2007, Southport’s African-American home mortgage customers were charged total broker fees that, on average, were 43 basis points higher for home purchase loans and 134 basis points higher for refinance loans as a percentage of the loan amount than the total broker fees charged to white customers. In 2008, the average disparities were 119 and 116 basis points, respectively.
INTRODUCTION This Consent Order (Order) is submitted jointly by the parties for the approval of and entry by the Co urt simultaneously with the filing of the United States' Complaint in this action. This Order resolves the claims of the United States that Southport Bank (""Southport"" or ""the bank"") has engaged in a pattern or practice of lending discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f, by allowing its wholesale mortgage brokers to c harge African-American and Hispanic borrowers higher broker fees for residential real estate-related loans than non-Hispanic white (""white"") borrowers. There has been no factual finding or adjudication with respect to any matter alleged by the U nited States.
Based on i ts own i nvestigation, the United Stat es contends that between 2007 and 2008,1 Southport charged hundreds of African-American and Hispanic wholesale borrowers higher fees on both purchase and refinance home mortgage loans2 than white borrowers not based on their creditworthiness or other objective criter ia related to borrower risk, but because of their race or national origin. The Complaint alleges that it was Southport's business practice to allow its mortgage brokers who generated loan applications for the bank to vary their fees and thus alter the price set based on a borrower's objective credit-related factors.

The lawsuit alleged that the bank discriminated against African-American and Hispanic borrowers in its residential mortgage lending program.

The terms of the consent order were not disclosed.","The U.S. Department of Justice brought this action against Southport Bank of Kenosha, Wisconsin.

On the same day, the parties also entered into a consent decree that required Southbury to provide better programming, disciplinary procedures, medical care, recordkeeping, and increase staffing. After some problems with compliance and placing the state in contempt, the Court assigned a special master to monitor Southbury. After making significant progress, on March 25, 2006, the court ended judicial oversight, but retained jurisdiction over the consent decree and remedial plan.

They also allege that the Act violates employers' rights to due process by denying them an opportunity to challenge the federal determination of the work-authorization status of their employees before sanctions are imposed. The district court held that the law was not preempted. The main argument on appeal is that the law is expressly preempted by the federal immigration law provision preempting state regulation ""other than through licensing and similar laws.""
The matter proceeded to hearing, and the district court dismissed the Arizona Attorney General for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, because he lacks the authority to bring enforcement actions. The court ruled in favor of the remaining defendants on the merits. It held that the Act is not expressly preempted by IRCA because the Act is a licensing law within the meaning of the savings clause.
The employer would then have the opportunity to present evidence. The district court agreed. The district court persuasively reasoned that requiring the state or county to obtain a federal determination of an employee's work status before bringing proceedings may be intended to protect employees from direct investigation by the state.

Procedural Background.

They alleged, among other things, that the Act was expressly and impliedly preempted by IRCA.
The district court held the Act not preempted. With respect to express preemption, it acknowledged that the penalties imposed by the Act are “sanctions” within the meaning of IRCA’s preemption provision Pet App.

78a-80a. The district court also found that the verification statute did not conflict with federal law. It noted that IIRIRA prohibited only the Attorney General (now the Secretary of DHS) from requiring the use of E-Verify and that without more, this prohibition does not “raise an inference that Congress intended to prevent the states from mandating use of the system in their licensing laws.”

See §11– 1051(B) (West 2012). The United States District Court for the District of Arizona issued a preliminary injunction preventing the four provisions at issue from taking effect. 703 F. Supp.
It was improper, however, to enjoin §2(B) before the state courts had an opportunity to construe it and without some showing that enforcement of the provision in fact conflicts with federal immigration law and its objectives. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The plaintiff, represented by organizations such as the ACLU and the National Immigration Law Center along with private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the recently enacted S.B. 1070 was a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Specifically, the plaintiff contends that S.B. 1070 conflicts with federal law and procedures and that local law enforcement agencies are ill equipped to deal with the complexities of immigration law.

The district court granted a preliminary injunction in February 2012, which the defendants appealed.  In a related case, Arizona v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down most of S.B. 1070.  The plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction against the remaining provisions of S.B. 1070 and while the parties were going through discovery disputes, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on March 17, 2015.

WHITING Filed March 4, 2013 Before: Raymond C. Fisher, Richard C. Tallman and Consuelo M. Callahan, Circuit Judges. Opinion by Judge Fisher SUMMARY* Civil Rights The panel affirmed the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of two provisions in Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070, which make it unlawful for a motor vehicle occupant to hire or attempt to hire a person for work at another location from a stopped car that impedes traffic, or for a person to be hired in such a manner. The panel held that the district court correctly determined that, though Arizona has a significant government interest in promoting traffic safety, the day labor provisions failed the requirement set forth in Central Hudson Gas Electric Corp v. Public Service Commission of New York, 447 U.S. 557, 566 (1980), that restrictions on commercial speech be no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.
Laws § 1. In May 2010, the plaintiffs filed suit in the District of Arizona seeking a declaration that S.B. 1070 is unconstitutional in its entirety.
The defendants are various county officials as well as the state of Arizona and Arizona Governor Janice Brewer, who intervened as defendants. In June 2010, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the day labor provisions violate the First Amendment.

The district court granted a PI mandating that defendants must maintain conditions of confinement adequate for the detainees' physical needs and provide detainees with mats and blankets after 12 hours. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the PI order. In 2018 the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of defendants' obligation to provide raised beds for detainees held for any period requiring sleep; the district court denied this motion. After a 7-day trial in January 2020, the district court held that these extended confinement conditions violated the Constitution and issued an order enjoining the defendants from holding detainees for longer than 48 unless they provided conditions of confinement that meet basic human needs. This permanent injunction was ordered and has been in effect since April 2020.","Every year, Border Patrol confines tens of thousands 3 of the men, women, and children it apprehends in its Tucson Sector holding cells.

For each facility, produce a list of video surveillance being conducted and maintained in holding cells and all fixtures contained therein, including the bathroom, and any other areas in the CBP facility used for or accessed by detainees (examples being areas were initial intake and medical screening is conducted).

185,IM-AZ-0026,"Following his arrest and confinement at the Coconino County Detention Facility (CCDF), plaintiff challenged the prolonged detention of inmates at CCDF triggered by detainer requests from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE).

 and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. He sought class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief for all CCDF detainees subject to this prolonged detention policy despite their eligibility for pretrial release.

Plaintiff has moved for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, seeking to enjoin the 2017 Coconino Jail Policy as 18 unconstitutional. ARGUMENT This Court should hold that a locality’s cooperation with ICE—either through ICE 22 detainers and arrest warrants or through housing an alien on behalf of ICE after ICE effects 23 an arrest pursuant to the IGSA—is lawful under federal and Arizona law and the state and federal constitutions insofar as it complies with ICE policy.
The Court should therefore 26 deny Plaintiff’s request for preliminary relief and dismiss this case. To start, Plaintiff has no basis for challenging the County’s cooperation with ICE.
Even assuming Plaintiff’s challenge is justiciable, his claims fail. Plaintiff 14 challenges the County’s cooperation with ICE detainers pursuant to the County’s 2017 15 policy. The INA provides that state and local officers may “cooperate with the [Secretary] in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in 18 the United States.”

CONCLUSION Coconino County’s cooperation with federal immigration detainers, as well as 3 housing ICE detainees under the IGSA, is permitted by federal law.

In 9 contrast, FISA provides “clear and convincing evidence that Congress intended to deny 10 the district court’s jurisdiction to review and enjoin the Board’s ongoing administrative 11 12 proceedings.” The Court reversed the decision by the Fifth Circuit and held that it 13 did not have jurisdiction to consider MCorp’s challenge Id. at 44-45.
The panel held that the plain text of section 102(a) of IIRIRA granted DHS authority to construct the border barrier projects, and that grant of authority was not limited by section 102(b) of IIRIRA. The panel concluded that the district court correctly granted DHS summary judgment on the ultra vires claims. The panel further held that the environmental claims were precluded by the Secretary’s waiver of the National Environmental Policy Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, and the APA.
§ 102(c)(1). This appeal stems from a challenge by California and multiple environmental groups to the agency’s authority to expedite construction of border barriers near San Diego and Calexico, California, and the Secretary’s August and September 2017 waivers of applicable environmental laws. As a threshold matter, we have jurisdiction to consider the “predicate legal question” of whether IIRIRA authorizes the contested projects.
The “environmental claims” alleged that in planning and building the border barrier projects, DHS violated environmental laws.5 Finally, the “constitutional claims” alleged that the waivers violated the U.S. Constitution.

“Our clients include U.S. citizens and refugees (now stranded in Vienna) who long to be reunited as families and free from the risk of deportation back to Iran, where they would be at an even greater risk of persecution than before for having sought refuge in the U.S. as a religious minority,” said Latham & Watkins partner Belinda Lee.

But that is not what this case is about. The narrow 16 issue presented in this case is whether the content of Notices of Ineligibility issued by the 17 Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) denying the applications of approximately 87 Iranian 18 refugees failed to comply with the Lautenberg Amendment and other applicable law. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ claims are suitable for class 20 resolution, and GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
The Court also GRANTS 21 Plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment, finding that the Notices of Ineligibility denying 22 Plaintiffs’ refugee applications “as a matter of discretion” violate the Lautenberg Amendment and 23 the Accardi doctrine. As discussed below, the Court sets aside the February 2018 Notices of 24 Ineligibility pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 706(2).
The Court agrees that an alien has “no 12 constitutional right of entry into the country,” but the non-citizen Plaintiffs do not seek entry or 13 review of a discretionary decision denying entry. The case pertains only to whether DHS 14 complied with the law in issuing the Notices of Ineligibility to Plaintiffs. The lines that DHS 15 attempts to draw with respect to U.S. citizens and aliens, and even among the group of U.S. 16 citizens based on their familial relationship to the refugee applicants, are misplaced for the same 17 reasons that the Court rejects the nonreviewability arguments below.
Likewise, Plaintiffs argue that alternative avenues exist to set aside the unlawful Notices 27 under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Mandamus Act. Id. At the outset, DHS concedes that there is no genuine issue of material fact for purposes of United States District Court Northern District of California 1 summary judgment. See Opposition to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (“SJ Opp’n”) at 6, 2 ECF 71 (emphasis original).

Accordingly, there is no disagreement among the parties or the 2 Court that the refugee denials themselves are unreviewable, and § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is inapposite.
at 1, ECF 143. The Government 16 requests the Court stay the case until funding is restored. The Government believes its attorneys 17 are barred from working, even on a voluntary basis, because this case does not involve “the safety 18 of human life or the protection of property” necessary to warrant providing voluntary services.

The court granted the plaintiffs' request for declaratory and injunctive relief and ordered the defendants to provide quarterly reports on their compliance with the FOIA.","Demand: $0 Information Act Cause: 05:552 Freedom of Information Act
Relief INTRODUCTION 1.
Plaintiffs are three immigration attorneys and two noncitizens who filed Freedom 3 of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests for individual immigration case files, also known as Alien 4 Registration Files or A-Files. These A-File FOIA requests are pending with Defendants U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 6 7 (“ICE”), both component agencies within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). 8 Defendants have failed to make determinations within the statutory timeframe mandated by the 9 FOIA statute.
Plaintiff Pao Lopa resides in University Place, Washington. He currently has an 9 A-File FOIA request filed with USCIS that has been pending for over seven months. Plaintiff Maribel Carandang resides in Freemont, California.
Those requests have been pending with ICE for more than 30 23 business days. Plaintiff Pao Lopa filed a FOIA request for his A-file with USCIS. USCIS 25 received the request on November 14, 2018 and issued a receipt number for his FOIA request, 26 NRC2018168972, on November 14, 2018.
Although Plaintiff Lopa’s A-File FOIA request has been pending with USCIS for more 2 than seven months, he has not received the requested information. Plaintiff Maribel Carandang filed a FOIA request for her A-File with USCIS. 4 Plaintiff Caradang was previously in removal proceedings, and an immigration judge granted her 5 relief from deportation.
Id.2 12 II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND On June 16, 2019, plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit, claiming that defendants’ 14 pattern or practice of failing to meet the statutory deadline with respect to A-File FOIA requests 15 violates FOIA Compl. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief that defendants’ failure to 16 make timely determinations on plaintiffs’ and proposed classes’ A-File FOIA requests violates 17 FOIA, and nationwide injunction requiring defendants to make timely determinations.
A comprehensive remedy is needed and 28 is long overdue. United States District Court Northern District of California In light of the undisputed history of defendants’ failure to meet FOIA statutory deadlines, I 2 GRANT summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs. I GRANT declaratory relief that defendants 3 have violated the FOIA by failing to make timely determinations on plaintiffs’ A-File FOIA 4 requests within the mandated statutory time frames and that defendants have engaged in a pattern 5 or practice of violating FOIA’s statutory deadlines when responding to requests for A-Files.
Defendants primarily cite D.C. Circuit law to argue that plaintiffs must clear an 22 “extraordinarily high bar to succeed on a pattern or practice claim under FOIA” because they are 23 required to show repeated delays that are “unexplained” or “unjustified,” and the repeated delays 24 here do not meet that threshold because defendants face an increasing FOIA workload. Cross 26 3 After remand from the Ninth Circuit, the parties entered into a settlement agreement in 1992, “in which INS agreed to implement expedited processing of a FOIA request where the requester demonstrates that an individual’s life or personal safety would be jeopardized or that substantial due process rights of the requester would be impaired by the failure to process a request immediately.” Hajro, 811 F.3d at 1093.
Using other agencies’ failures to meet mandatory FOIA deadlines as comparators is, at best, 10 irrelevant. This case concerns USCIS’s violation of the FOIA statute and the impact it is having 11 on class members. The significant negative consequence to plaintiffs in immigration proceedings 12 caused by defendants’ delay is hardly reasonable and it is not excusable, particularly given that 13 Congress has set clear statutory deadlines.

194,IM-CA-0165,"This lawsuit was filed in response to a July 6, 2020 ICE directive that would effectively force out of the country many international students studying remotely during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The University of California filed suit claiming that the directive was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and an order vacating and setting aside the policy. They also sought declarative relief and attorney's fees.

In a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, the plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance and as a result, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs in this case continued to monitor the alterations ICE made to its website between July and September and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on October 6, 2020.","or as soon thereafter as counsel may be heard, at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, located at 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California 94102, or such other location assigned by the Court, Plaintiff The Regents of the University of California (“The Regents”) will, and hereby does, move for a temporary restraining order against Defendants United States Department of Homeland Security, Acting Secretary of Department of Homeland Security Chad F. Wolf, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Matthew Albence (“Defendants”), pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b). The Regents seeks a temporary restraining order to enjoin Defendants from implementing the July 6, 2020 memorandum (“the Directive”) issued by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (“SEVP”), a division of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). The Directive announced a reversal of prior ICE policy regarding the status of international students holding F-1 nonimmigrant student visas during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This arbitrary, capricious, and procedurally defective agency action now forces The Regents to confront an untenable choice: to put its international students in immediate jeopardy of having to abandon their studies and leave the country or take steps to retain them by increasing the number of in-person courses offered for Fall 2020, thereby increasing the risk that its students, faculty, and staff will be exposed to the virus. The Regents therefore seeks a temporary restraining order to enjoin Defendants from implementing the Directive. That Directive is not only unjust and unwise, but it violates the Administrative Procedure Act’s (“APA”) prohibition against agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”
Because the Directive is a legislative rule, DHS was required to abide by the full panoply of APA procedures, including providing notice and an opportunity for public comment. It failed to do so. Under the APA, courts must set aside agency action that is taken without observance of procedures required by law.

In March 2020, faced with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, The Regents moved swiftly to transition the University’s ten campuses to remote teaching to protect the health and safety of their students and faculty, while continuing to meet its core mission of providing a world-class education. Also recognizing the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, defendant United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), an agency within defendant the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), issued an exemption to a preexisting regulation that required international students on F-1 visas to attend classes in person if they wished to remain in this country. ICE’s March 13, 2020 Guidance (the “March 13 Guidance”) provided critical assurances that international students could maintain their F-1 visa status while attending classes on-line “for the duration of the [COVID-19] emergency.”
The Regents therefore seeks a preliminary injunction order to enjoin Defendants from implementing the Directive.

Absent sufficient notice and comment, the Census Hureau is 8 prohibited from implementing the Memorandum' s unconstitutional policy of excluding 9 undocumented immigrants from the enumeration used for apportionment and superseding the 10 Residence Rule' s requirement to count all persons- including undocumented immigrants- ""at 11 the U S. residence where they live and sleep most of the time.""

THE ADMINISTRATION’S UNLAWFUL ATTEMPT TO ADD A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO THE 2020 CENSUS 31. The Memorandum at issue in this action is directly related to Defendants’ earlier 12 efforts to exclude immigrants from the census count by adding a question to the 2020 Census 13 questionnaire on citizenship status.
On March 26, 2018, setting aside decades of practice, Secretary Ross and the 15 Department of Commerce announced that a question on citizenship status would be added to the 16 2020 Census. The Secretary claimed that the decision was due to a request from the Department 17 of Justice for the purpose of obtaining data to enforce the Voting Rights Act.2 33. Lawsuits to vacate and enjoin the Secretary’s decision were filed by numerous 19 plaintiffs in three district courts (including a suit in this Court by Plaintiffs in this case).
8 the Census Bureau, in a final agency action, to implement the Memorandum’s policy of excluding 9 undocumented immigrants from the enumeration used for apportionment, in violation of these 89. Among the violations is Defendants’ failure to observe the Administrative Procedure 12 Act’s notice-and-comment rulemaking requirement before dispensing with the Census Bureau’s 13 long-established Residence Rule. Absent sufficient notice and comment, the Census Bureau is 14 prohibited from implementing the Memorandum’s unconstitutional policy of excluding 15 undocumented immigrants from the enumeration used for apportionment and superseding the 16 Residence Rule’s requirement to count all persons—including undocumented immigrants—“at 17 the U.S. residence where they live and sleep most of the time.”

Ogawa Plaza,","The City of Los Angeles, City of Long Beach, and City of Oakland, and Los Angeles Unified School District 25 (LAUSD) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of California. The plaintiffs allege that the President's decision to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment 18 base following the 2020 Census violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the Constitution, and the Constitution's separation of powers principles. The Plaintiffs are seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants and all those acting in concert with them from excluding undocumented immigrants and taking any action to implement that policy.","On March 26, 2018, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that a question on citizenship status would be added to the 2020 Census. The League of Women Voters, the City of Los Angeles, and the State of California sued the Census Bureau, the Department of Commerce, and Secretary Ross in three district courts in California. The plaintiffs alleged that the Bureau's policy of excluding undocumented immigrants from the enumeration used for apportionment is not in accordance with the President's 27 authority under the Census Act, and it is contrary to the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act.

197,IM-CO-0011,"The Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center (CREEC) filed this suit against DHS and ICE under FOIA, seeking information regarding substandard and abusive conditions of confinement against individuals detained at two immigration detention facilities. As of March 25, 2021, a settlement has been reached as to the evidence, but litigation continues for the plaintiff's attorney's fees and costs.","NATURE OF THE CASE 1. In this action, brought pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, et seq., Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to effect the release by the Defendants of agency records that Plaintiff has requested from the Defendants pursuant to FOIA. Plaintiff, Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center (“CREEC”), is a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Colorado that is dedicated to protecting and defending the civil rights of individuals and educating the public concerning civil rights issues.

With few exceptions, these individuals are confined in county jails or private facilities that are operated by public or private entities pursuant to contracts with the Defendants. In recent years, there has developed significant public interest and controversy over the conditions of confinement of immigrant detainees placed into custody by the Defendants. Defendants’ network includes the Adelanto Detention Facility (“ADF”) located in or near the city of Adelanto, California.

CREEC seeks the requested agency records in order to inform public debate regarding conditions of confinement at ADF and ECDC, and accountability and oversight measures that may be needed to address substandard conditions of confinement. Defendants have failed to comply with the statutory deadline for responding to CREEC’s requests pursuant to FOIA. Defendants should not be permitted to ignore FOIA’s requirements.

PARTIES 12. CREEC is a non-profit organization that provides legal assistance, advocacy, and public education concerning actions, practices, and policies that abridge or threaten the civil rights of individuals in the United States. CREEC has formed an internal immigration detainee task force charged with investigating suspected substandard conditions of confinement of noncitizens who have become immigration detainees pursuant to authority exercised by Defendants and, where warranted and appropriate, to consider litigation to vindicate the rights of such individuals.

CREEC’s work that is the subject of this action has been undertaken by its immigration detainee task force. Disclosure of the requested records will shed light on Defendants and their subcontractors’ operations and activities related to the confinement of immigration detainees.

The CREEC representative redialed and reselected the same option but was again connected to a full voicemail box where she could not leave a message. Also on September 7, 2017, CREEC’s representative called the ICE Office of Diversity and Civil Liberties and spoke to a female employee. That individual was unable to assist in obtaining an Acknowledgement Letter for CREEC’s request, but did provide contact information for one Mark Bittner of the ICE FOIA office as an individual who could do so.

And even if ICE determines that all of the agency documents CREEC has requested are somehow exempt, ICE is required to inform CREEC of that determination. Defendants have violated 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A) by failing to timely respond to CREEC’s Requests Nos.

2018-ICFO-03033 and 2017-ICFO-45386. As a result, Defendants may not charge CREEC any retrieval fees, duplication charges, or review fees as a condition of providing the requested records. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(viii).

199,IM-DC-0022,"On Jan. 6, 2015, Central American immigrant mothers and children filed a class action lawsuit against DHS and ICE, challenging their ""No-Release Policy"" in making custody determinations for asylum-seeking families. On Feb. 20, 2015, the Court granted a preliminary injunction. Defendants ended the policy in May 2015. This case is now administratively closed. If the defendants reinstate a policy of considering deterrence in determining whether to detain a family, they must notify the court and the plaintiffs may move to administratively reopen the case. Since June 2015, there has been no additional activity in the case.","have been found to have a credible fear of persecution and have been referred for removal proceedings before an IJ to pursue their asylum claims. Pursuant to the No-Release Policy, DHS has detained W.M.C., C.M.A.C., and G.A.P.C. without an individualized determination of flight risk or danger to the community.
As a result, DHS has denied release to nearly every family that is detained at a family detention facility and has passed a credible fear interview—regardless of individual flight risk or community danger. DHS agents and attorneys have informed attorneys for detained families that the agency has adopted a blanket No-Release Policy for these detained families. The DHS officers have explained that their refusal to consider these families for release based on an individualized determination of flight risk or community danger is dictated by agency policy.

”4 During December 2014, DHS phased-out its use of Artesia as a family detention center and began transferring some detained families from Artesia to the Karnes facility. It also began detaining some families at the Dilley facility. DHS has begun expanding the Berks facility and intends to double its capacity.
filed a motion to proceed anonymously and lodged their original complaint in this action. At that time they were detained by DHS pursuant to its No-Release Policy. On January 5, 2015, an immigration judge ordered that R.I.L.R, J.L.S., and K.L.S.


On January 6, 2015, the bond was paid and R.I.L.R, J.L.S., and K.L.S. were released. They will reside with R.I.L.R.’s mother in Texas while they continue with their asylum proceedings.

informed the asylum officer of J.A.R.’s condition, but DHS has not provided J.A.R. with any medical treatment for this condition. While in detention, J.A.R.
Chasing liberty, Plaintiffs turned to the courts.
They filed suit on January 6, 2015, naming the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and two ICE officials as Defendants. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs’ detention resulted from an unlawful policy that DHS adopted in June 2014 in response to the immigration spike. Pursuant to that policy, Plaintiffs claim, DHS is detaining Central American mothers and children with the aim of deterring potential future immigrants.
According to Plaintiffs, such detention violates the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and applicable DHS regulations. They now seek a preliminary injunction to prevent DHS from applying this policy until a final determination has been reached on the merits of this action. Finding that the circumstances here merit that extraordinary form of relief, the Court will grant Plaintiffs’ Motion I.
See Brané Decl., 12, 22-23; Hines Decl., 13-15. They claim that this policy led to ICE’s denial of release in each of their cases. On January 6, 2015, Plaintiffs brought a class-action suit in this Court, alleging, inter alia, that the No-Release Policy violates the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.
They further claim that the policy is contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious, and thus constitutes illegal agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act.
Finally, on February 20, 2015, a federal district court in Washington, D.C. enjoined ICE from invoking general deterrence in custody determinations where an individual from Central America in a family residential center is found to have a credible fear of removal. ICE has complied with that injunction, but has moved for reconsideration of the Court’s ruling. Notwithstanding that, ICE has presently determined that it will discontinue invoking general deterrence as a factor in custody determinations in all cases involving families.
At that conference, the Court raised the possibility of administratively closing this case in light of the May 13, 2015, policy announcement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that it would no longer invoke general deterrence as a factor in custody decisions involving families. The parties subsequently conferred and submitted a joint proposal for moving forward. Based on agreement of the parties, the Court hereby ORDERS that: 1.

Civil Action No.: 1:17-cv-00708 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF Introduction 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA” or “the Act”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, seeking unlawfully withheld agency records relating to actions taken by Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) to revoke, suspend, or terminate participation in the Global Entry System (“GES” or “Global Entry”) for certain Arab and Muslim U.S. Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (“LPRs”) without any legal justification.
Global Entry is a CBP trusted traveler program that allows expedited security clearance and admission for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival in the United States.
This pattern corresponded with the unexplained, heightened scrutiny—and in many cases, abusive questioning by CBP officials—directed at Arab and Muslim travelers in the wake of the new administration’s Muslim travel bans.
In early March 2017, ADC filed FOIA requests with CBP seeking records maintained by the agency in relation to Global Entry revocations, suspensions, terminations, confirmations, and policy practices. Specifically, ADC sought: a. All agency records relating to each revocation, suspension, or termination of Global Entry System (GES) participation from November 9, 2016 to the date of the agency’s response to this request; b.
CBP has failed to disclose the requested agency records within the time period specified by Congress or offer any meaningful estimate of when these records will become available. Accordingly, ADC seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under the Act to compel DHS to search for and produce the records requested. Jurisdiction and Venue 11.
Jurisdiction lies to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202. Venue is proper under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) because ADC brings this action in the District of Columbia. Parties 12.
No legal basis exists for CBP’s failure to adequately search for and promptly disclose responsive agency records in accordance with the timing and other requirements of the Act. 24.
CBP’s failure to make timely, reasonable efforts to search for responsive agency records, and its wrongful withholding of agency records sought in connection with ADC’s requests violates the FOIA. CBP’s wrongful withholding of the agency records sought in connection with ADC’s requests violates the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(3)(A) and 552(a)(3)(C).
All previous paragraphs are incorporated as though fully set forth herein. CBP violated the FOIA by constructively denying ADC’s expedited processing request. ADC is an organization primarily involved in the dissemination of information.
30.There is an urgent need to inform the public of CBP’s documented actions in suspending, revoking, or terminating Global Entry approvals for Arab and Muslim travellers. ADC properly sought expedited processing of both FOIA requests. CBP has failed to process either request within ten (10) business days.
JOINT STATUS REPORT Pursuant to the Court’s Minute Order dated February 15, 2019, Plaintiff American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) submit the following joint status report. The parties have resolved their differences as to CBP’s search for and production of non-exempt, responsive records subject to the FOIA. The only remaining issue for the parties to discuss is possible attorneys’ fees under the FOIA.
Counsel for Plaintiff intends to provide counsel for Defendant a proposed fee petition no later than March 6, 2019.

Plaintiff’s underlying FOIA requests seek information concerning the extent to which Defendants cooperate with armed private militia groups along the United States-Mexico border. Plaintiff alleges as follows: PARTIES 1.
As part of this mission, Plaintiff seeks to inform public understanding of operations and activities of the government by gathering and disseminating information that is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of Executive Branch operations and activities. Plaintiff regularly requests information pursuant to FOIA. Consistent with its regular practice, Plaintiff intends to give the public access to documents obtained via these FOIA requests on its website, www.protectdemocracy.org, and to provide information about and analysis of those documents as appropriate.
The Administration’s border enforcement plans – and the increasingly prominent role of militia groups on the border – raise concerns about the extent to which the Administration intends to rely, whether formally or informally, on militia groups and other nongovernmental actors to implement its immigration policy. Consistent with its mission, The Protect Democracy Project submitted FOIA requests to DHS and CBP seeking information about the role of unaffiliated border enforcement groups in the Trump Administration’s immigration policy.
Specifically, and as described in further detail below, The Protect Democracy Project is requesting information regarding the Administration’s policies and practices relating to interactions with nongovernmental border enforcement groups, and the extent to which the federal government is relying on these groups to assist with implementing its immigration policy. Defendants have failed to process these requests in the manner required by FOIA, and have failed to respond to the requests within the deadline mandated by FOIA. A tabular summary of the current status of each request is attached as Appendix A.

202,IM-DC-0055,"On August 23, 2018, Muslim Advocates filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the United States Department of Justice [DOJ] and United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE]. The complaint alleged violations of the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA], 5 U.S.C. § 552(a). Muslim Advocates had requested information from both defendants regarding Operation Janus, where the DOJ reviewed the files of naturalized citizens and began intensive denaturalization efforts. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case moved to settlement negotiations; an agreement on all FOIA issues was reached on January 13, 2020, but negotiations over attorneys fees are ongoing as of June 2020.","Muslim Advocates is a not-for-profit legal advocacy and educational organization.
On January 11, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA Request (the “Request”) for materials related to denaturalization efforts by the federal government, including but not limited to “Operation Janus,” a joint initiative between DOJ and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), where federal agencies reviewed the files of naturalized citizens for the purpose of identifying misrepresentations in their naturalization applications that could render American citizens eligible for denaturalization. The Request was sent to the DOJ’s National Security Division (“NSD”), DOJ’s Civil Division (“Civil Division”), DHS, and DHS’s component agency, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). See Ex A.
Defendant ICE has outright refused to process either Muslim Advocates’ initial Request or the Second ICE Request and has likewise failed to respond to any appeals. To date, neither of the Defendants have produced a single document in response to Plaintiff’s FOIA requests. The interests at stake in government transparency on the issue of denaturalization could not be more important.
NSD issued a final determination on Muslim Advocates’ request on July 6, 2018. Muslim Advocates is currently in discussions with USCIS regarding the production of responsive documents. 2 See, e.g., Adiel Kaplan, Miami grandma targeted as U.S. takes aim at naturalized immigrants with prior offenses, MIAMI HERALD (July 9, 2018); Masha Gessen, In America, Naturalized Citizens No Longer Have an Assumption of Permanence, THE NEW YORKER (June 18, 2018).

Plaintiff brings this action to compel Defendants to immediately process and release to Plaintiff all responsive records that they have unlawfully withheld. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 5.
The Civil Division litigates cases related to immigration enforcement on behalf of the United States, including prosecuting denaturalization lawsuits. DOJ has possession of and control over the documents and information requested by Plaintiff. Defendant Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and an “agency” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).
A. PLAINTIFF’S FOIA REQUESTS 21. Plaintiff submitted the Request to NSD, the Civil Division, DHS, and USCIS on January 11, 2018. See Ex.
See Ex B. The letter denied expedited processing. It also found that Muslim Advocates is a member of the news media and reserved decision on the grant of a full fee waiver until after it processed the request.
Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(iii)(I), the Civil Division invoked a 10-day extension beyond the typical 20-day statutory limit to respond to Plaintiff’s Request.
Defendant DOJ’s withholding of responsive documents will continue to cause Plaintiff irreparable injury. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of the Freedom of Information Act 5 U.S.C. § 552(a) Against ICE 56. Defendant ICE has violated 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6) by inappropriately refusing to process Plaintiff’s proper requests and by failing to make a determination on Plaintiff’s appeal within 20 days.
Enter judgment that Defendants DOJ – Civil Division and ICE’s failure to timely adjudicate Plaintiff’s administrative appeals violates FOIA; B. Enter judgment that Defendants’ unlawful withholding of the records requested violates FOIA; C.

For the reasons above, in order to contain the unchecked spread of the COVID-19 virus, we must relocate as many people as possible out of institutional settings.

For the reasons stated herein, the Court will provisionally certify a class and grant the motion for a preliminary injunction. BACKGROUND The issues in this case overlap with a related case before this Court, Nio v. United States Department of Homeland Security. See Nio v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 17-cv0998, 2017 WL 3917006 (D.D.C Sept.
That case involves MAVNI enlistees who have already received a completed Form N-426, but have brought similar challenges to DOD’s recent change in its N-426 policy. In addition, the Nio plaintiffs are challenging the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) and USCIS’s decision to put their naturalization applications on hold pending DOD’s completion of the enhanced security screening (“DHS/USCIS Security Screening Requirement”) it now requires for MAVNI enlistees prior to initial entry training (“IET”) or active-duty service. The parties concede that filings in both the instant suit and Nio bear on the preliminary injunction inquiry before the Court, and thus, the Court may rely on records in both cases I.

at 114.) PROCEDURAL HISTORY Plaintiffs filed a complaint on September 1, 2017, challenging DOD’s refusal to complete their N-426 Forms and certify their honorable service in the Selected Reserve as unlawfully imposing an “active-duty” requirement in violation of § 1440. 8 U.S.C. § 1440(a) (non-citizen is eligible for citizenship if he “has served honorably as a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve or in an active-duty status” (emphasis added)).
On October 25, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and issued an order (amended on October 27, 2017) enjoining Defendants from enforcing aspects of the New DoD N-426 Policy and requiring Defendants to use their “best efforts” to complete and provide to Plaintiffs and the class N-426 certifications within two business days of receipt. The Court also provisionally certified the class. As of the date of this Amended Complaint, Defendants were not in compliance with the preliminary injunction.
And, in sworn testimony on that same day, DoD admitted that the DoD’s August N-426 Policy (1) withholds, for an indefinite period of time, N-426 certifications, and (2) was a response to DoD concerns that Army officials “prematurely” certified N-426s in the past. Plaintiffs commenced this litigation on September 1, 2017, following the implementation of DoD’s August N-426 Policy. The complaint challenged, among other things, Defendants’ withholding of N-426s from Plaintiffs and other Selected Reservists who were serving honorably in the Selected Reserve but had not yet served in an active duty capacity.
Due Process Clause The Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person shall be... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S Const. amend V. Plaintiffs claim that DOD’s October 13th Guidance “violates their Due Process rights by denying or impairing their statutory right to seek naturalization.”
As the Court has reminded the parties in this action and in the related Nio action, filing multiple motions after every individualized disagreement in the case is the most judicially inefficient way to move towards resolution.

Date Filed: 09/01/2017 Jury Demand: None Nature of Suit: 890 Other Statutory Actions Jurisdiction: U.S. Government Defendant :17-cv-01833-ESH","On October 27, 2017, a class action was brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Defense and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on behalf of non-citizen soldiers who served honorably during wartime. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were refusing to certify their naturalization application eligibility as required by law, leaving these soldiers to languish in immigration limbo, notwithstanding their ongoing military service to this Nation. The court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining aspects of the defendants' policy on August 23, 2017. The parties agreed that, given DOD’s position that service in an active-duty status was required for certification of honorable service on an N-426, there was no need for the court to issue an injunction.","On September 1, 2017, a group of non-citizens who served in the Selected Reserve filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Defense (DOD) and Secretary James Mattis. The plaintiffs claimed that the military’s refusal to issue them N-426 forms is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution's Due Process Clause. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief, provisionally certified a class, and granted a preliminary injunction. The case overlaps with a similar case before the Court in Nio v. United States Department of Homeland Security (Nio) in which the plaintiffs are challenging the DHS's implementation of the enhanced security screening requirements."
207,IM-DC-0080,"Non-citizen soldiers in the U.S. military brought this lawsuit in May 2017, challenging policies of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense that unlawfully delayed their naturalization applications. The court certified a class and granted a preliminary injunction against the agencies on October 27, 2017. On May 22, 2019, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that the agencies’ policy of delaying naturalization applications was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The court issued a permanent injunction on August 20, 2020, and retained jurisdiction to enforce the injunction.","COMPLAINT 1. Plaintiffs are enlisted non-citizen United States Army soldiers who are serving honorably in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve (“Selected Reserve”). Defendants are depriving Plaintiffs of their lawful opportunity and right to become naturalized United States citizens.

Among other actions, DoD improperly instructed DHS and its component agency, Defendant United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), to place Plaintiffs’ naturalization applications on “hold” pending the successful completion of specialized background investigations done by the military for DoD purposes (and not required by the laws governing naturalization). DHS and USCIS acquiesced and unlawfully placed Plaintiffs’ naturalization applications on “hold” pending completion of these military background investigations. There is no lawful basis for DoD’s instruction and interference, nor is there any legal basis for DHS and USCIS to permit or acquiesce in such interference or to impose the “hold.”
JURISDICTION 11. This action arises under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (“INA”) and the U.S Constitution. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. VENUE 12.
500 Group 3 MAVNIs have received command endorsement [i.e., N-426 “honorable service” certifications] and applied for naturalization based on having “performed creditable service” in the form of two weekend drills. These citizenship applications are under review by [USCIS].  Action: The heightened risk associated with Groups 1/2, and the application of resources needed to mitigate that risk, render it infeasible to continue to process [Group 3] MAVNIs.
The MAVNI program provides an expedited path to citizenship to foreign nationals who are legally present in the United States, possess critical foreignlanguage or medical skills, and serve honorably during designated periods of hostilities. The question before the Court is whether the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and its sub-agency U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) acted lawfully when they instituted a policy on July 7, 2017, declining to naturalize MAVNI applicants until the applicant has been determined suitable for service by the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) and the U.S Army. Because USCIS’s purported reasons for waiting for these military suitability adjudications do not comport with the evidence before the Court, it concludes that the challenged portion of USCIS’s policy is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (“APA”).
21, 2018 (ECF No. 227) (“Pls.’ Opp’n Reply”) (reproducing an excerpt of a DOD document referring to the CI Review report).) The Sept. 30 Memo provides that, after the DOD investigatory phase is complete, and before shipping to Basic Training, the soldier must still await a determination by his or her service (e.g., the Army) that he or she is suitable for military service.

(See Compl., May 24, 2017 (ECF No. Plaintiffs initially alleged that USCIS and DOD were unlawfully delaying the processing of MAVNI naturalization applications due to improper interference in the process by DOD. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction, asking the Court to enjoin DOD from interfering and USCIS from delaying the processing of MAVNI naturalization applications.

United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 (1988). That is, at minimum, the case here.

Additionally, the government has failed to take into account the harm to the public interest in continuing its current practice of housing unaccompanied non-citizen minors in hotels while they await expulsion from the United States under the Title 42 Process—a practice that would end if an injunction issued requiring Plaintiff and the putative class to be excepted from expulsion from the United States under the Title 42 Process.

This case concerns the Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to abrogate the refugee protections codified in the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., through agency rulemaking. The Refugee Act of 1980 amended the INA to establish the contemporary asylum system in the United States.
170 See id. in the INA. Rather, it was introduced in 2000 through amended regulations, which provide that an applicant who “could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of [his or her] country of nationality” does not have a well-founded fear of persecution, if “under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.
Over the last 40 years, Human Rights First has helped tens of thousands of individuals who came to the United States fleeing persecution, torture, and threats of death. In 2019, over 97 percent of Human Rights First’s clients were granted relief. Assisting non-citizens with asylum applications is a vital component of Human Rights First’s organizational mission and accounts for much of the services Human Rights First provides.
Defendant William Barr is the Attorney General of the United States (“Attorney General”). He directs the DOJ. He is sued in his official capacity.7 21.
NATURE OF ACTION 23. This is an action arising under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and the United States Constitution. Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the final Rule entitled “Procedures for Asylum and Withholding of Removal; Credible Fear and Reasonable Fear Review,” 85 Fed Reg. 80,274 (Dec.
11, 2020) is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and beyond the authority of the Attorney General and the Acting Secretary to promulgate under the INA, the APA, and our Constitution.
The Agencies received over 87,000 comments with many of these comments highlighting first that 30 days was an insufficient period of time to comment fully on the proposed Rule, given its breadth and scope. On December 11, 2020, Defendants published the final version of the Rule. In response to comments, the Agencies made only five minor adjustments to the text of their proposed regulations; they did not remove any provisions or change them in any real substantive way.30 56.
The Rule also violates 8 U.S.C. § 1181, which explicitly lists the categories of noncitizens who will be denied admission to the United States without a hearing.

211,IM-IN-0002,"On May 25, 2011, three foreign residents of Indiana filed a class action lawsuit against the cities of Indianapolis and Franklin and the counties of Marion and Johnson, seeking to enjoin enforcement of Indiana's Senate Enrolled Act 590, which would allow local law enforcement officers to make warrantless arrests of people who were subject to a removal order issued by an immigration court or a detainer or notice of action issued by the Department of Homeland Security, or who had been indicted or convicted of an aggravated felony, and would make the use of consular identification cards for identification within the state a civil infraction punishable by fine.  On March 28, 2013, the District Court (Judge Barker) ruled in favor of plaintiffs, granting their motion for summary judgment, and permanently enjoining defendants from enforcing Sections 18 and 20 of SEA 590.

In entering a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, this Court previously reached all issues presented by this case.

Factual Background On May 25, 2011, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the recently enacted Senate Enrolled Act 590 (SEA 590), which was adopted by the Indiana General Assembly and originally scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2011. Plaintiffs specifically challenged Section 201 of SEA 590, which added sections (a)(11) through (a)(13) to Indiana Code § 35-33-1-1(1).
Defendant seek to depose two agents from the Office of Immigration and Custom Enforcement (“ICE”) and seek a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of DHS. Defendants also seek responses to their Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests to DHS and the United States Department of State. The Court will address each item below.

As would-be suitors these three legislators lack the power to substitute themselves for the Office of the Attorney General in order to pursue their own strategic litigation preferences. The Complaint in this class action challenges the constitutionality of Section 18 (currently codified at Indiana Code § 34-28-8.2) and Section 20 (currently codified at Indiana Code § 35-33-1(1)(a)(11)-(13)) of the 2011 Senate Enrolled Act (“SEA”) 590.1 On June 24, 2011, our court entered a preliminary injunction in favor of Plaintiffs enjoining Defendants from enforcing Sections 18 and 20 until further order of the Court.
On November 20, 2011, Plaintiffs filed their motion for summary judgment and supporting memorandum. On December 21, 2011, Defendant City of Indianapolis filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. After discovery, on April 9, 2012, the Office of the (Indiana) Attorney General, representing the Marion and Johnson County Prosecutors (“the State Defendants”), filed its response opposing Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.
After careful review of the parties’ submissions, documentary evidence, and applicable legal authorities, we GRANT Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to the State Defendants and hereby PERMANENTLY ENJOIN enforcement of Sections 18 and 20 of SEA 590.

The plaintiff alleged that her unexpected arrest and detainment without notice or a hearing violated her due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). In April 2018, nine more plaintiffs were added, and they sought class certification, which was approved on May 17, 2019. On June 27, the district court instructed the defendants to begin providing monthly reports to class counsel regarding class members.

On April 16, the parties filed a joint status report that altered the terms of release for the class member and the court lifted the stay on the class member's removal by ICE. ICE imposed conditions of supervision pursuant to the parties' agreement. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on November 18, 2020.

The plaintiffs alleged that the Presidential Memorandum titled “Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census” is unconstitutional and that any compliance violates §§ 706(2) of the APA because it is contrary to constitutional power, right, privilege, or immunity and in excess of statutory jurisdiction and authority, and without observance of procedure required by law. The case has been approved for a three-judge court and is awaiting the defendants' answer.","The fourth sentence of the Constitution, Article I, Section 2, as amended by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, makes clear that congressional representatives are to be apportioned among the states according to their respective numbers, “counting the whole number of persons in each State.” U.S Const.

Undocumented immigrants are now and have always been persons as a matter of fact, law, and basic human decency. Plaintiffs are membership-based, non-profit organizations that serve immigrants of color across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. They seek immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to ameliorate the immense harm provoked by the July 21 Memorandum.
The July 21 Memorandum is also motivated by a racially discriminatory scheme to reduce the political representation of communities of color and increase the overrepresentation of white voters. By complying with the July 21 Memorandum and producing population tabulations excluding undocumented individuals for congressional apportionment, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Director Steven Dillingham, the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce (together, the “Agency Defendants”) will deny immigrants of color, foreign-born residents, undocumented residents, and non- citizens the political representation and census-linked federal funding to which they are entitled, on the basis of their race and national origin. The Court should enjoin compliance with the July 21 Memorandum as violative of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) for multiple reasons.
First, the July 21 Memorandum instructs the Secretary of Commerce to perform an unconstitutional task contrary to law: to exclude undocumented immigrants from the congressional apportionment base, in violation of Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, as amended by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Centro Presente has hundreds of members, many of whom are Latinx and are immigrants or members of mixed-status families. A considerable percentage of Centro Presente’s members and the individuals and families it serves are undocumented immigrants. Centro Presente is based in East Boston, a majority-minority neighborhood that has a larger Latinx and immigrant population than Boston, Massachusetts or the United States as a whole.
Case No. 20-11421-DPW MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ APPLICATION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A THREE-JUDGE COURT By accompanying Application, Plaintiffs Haitian-Americans United, Inc., Brazilian Worker Center, Chelsea Collaborative, Inc., and Centro Presente request the appointment of a three-judge court to adjudicate this action, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a). In this action, Plaintiffs are challenging a Memorandum issued by President Donald J. Trump on July 21, 2020, titled “Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census” (the “Memorandum”) on a variety of grounds, including that it purports to exclude undocumented immigrants from the basis for congressional apportionment in violation of the U.S Constitution. Section 2284(a) requires the appointment of a three-judge court in actions challenging “the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts,” as this action plainly does. Indeed, in recent weeks the United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York and for the District of Columbia issued orders granting applications for the appointment of threejudge courts in separate cases asserting claims that are substantially similar to those that Plaintiffs have asserted here.
Like the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the Common Cause and New York v. Trump cases, Plaintiffs’ claims in this action require adjudication by a three-judge court, and their Application for the appointment of such a court should be granted. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs have brought this action to enjoin and restrain Defendants from carrying out their unlawful plan, set forth in the Memorandum, to exclude undocumented immigrants from the congressional apportionment base for the first time in our nation’s history. The actions contemplated and ordered in the Memorandum are in violation of the Constitution, which states that “[r]epresentatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state,” and excluding only “Indians not taxed.”

The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Court 105.6.","On January 24, 2018, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Haitian Women for Haitian Refugees (HWHR) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and former DHS Secretary Elaine C.

Accordingly, Defendants are submitting this supplementary memorandum on October 26, 2007, as this Court ordered. this case. Accordingly this memorandum is organized by subject area, rather than by deponent.
BACKGROUND Plaintiffs filed their original Petition in this matter in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (“Circuit Court”) on March 14, 2007.

The Petition challenged Ordinance No. 1721 (the Landlord Ordinance) and Ordinance No. 1722 (the Employer Ordinance).1 1 Ordinances Nos.
(Second Amended Complaint 45.) It further alleges that there was no good cause for failing to provide the required notice. It alleges, therefore, that, pursuant to Mo R Stat.
The City repealed the Ordinance before the case went to trial and the Circuit Court dismissed the lawsuit. Plaintiff sought attorney’s fees and a declaration that the passage of the zoning ordinance violated the Open Meetings Law. The Supreme Court held that the repeal of the zoning ordinance could not abolish Plaintiff’s right to pursue a violation of the Open Meetings Law and to have the question of whether the Law was “purposely” violated determined.
The law was repealed and replaced by new legislation. The Declaratory Judgment action concerning the old billboard law was moot. There was not an actual controversy.
Ordinances No. 1708 and 1715 are moot. There was no violation of the Open Meetings Law. Attorney’s fees cannot be awarded and collected under the Declaratory Judgment Act against a political subdivision.
I, 49. On this basis, the circuit court concluded that the case was not moot. However, in its findings in support of its judgment, to void the Ordinances at issue in Reynolds, the circuit court held that Ordinance No. 1708, the original employment provision, was invalid because it conflicted with Missouri Revised Statute § 79.470.9 Pls.

The district court1 granted judgment in favor of the City, denied Appellants' motion and dismissed Appellants' Second Amended Complaint with prejudice.

Debevoise Plimpton LLP (“D&P”)1 and the Rutgers Constitutional Litigation Clinic (the “Clinic,” collectively, the “Movants”), attorneys for Jama, bring this application for an order granting certain attorney’s fees and expenses, related to the RFRA claims, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. BACKGROUND This was an action brought by nine plaintiffs (the “Plaintiffs”) against Esmor Correctional Services, Inc. (“Esmor”), John Lima (“Lima”), and others. The checkered history of this case is described in detail in the numerous opinions issued since its inception in 19972.
The district court ultimately awarded nominal damages of $1 and attorney’s fees Id. A divided panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed the award of fees, holding that the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties, and were thus ineligible for fees under § 1988. The Supreme Court affirmed in a 5-4 decision, but on different grounds.
at 122. The district court awarded an attorney’s fee, and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. The court of appeals distinguished the facts of the case at bar from those in Farrar by applying Justice O’Connor’s factors: Here, although plaintiffs’ victory was de minimis as to the extent of relief, the district court appropriately exercised its discretion to award fees, as the determination that the municipality violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights represented a significant legal conclusion serving an important public purpose.
The jury awarded $1 in total for both of these claims. The district court denied fees under § 1988, and the plaintiff appealed. Defendants argued that fees were inappropriate since, inter alia, the only significant damages were awarded on the pendent state assault claim Id.
at 84. The court accordingly remanded the matter for further consideration. The second reason given in Milwe for permitting fees, namely consideration of the fee-eligible claim only, should be read with caution in light of Farrar and our discussion above.
GARTH, Circuit Judge, dissenting: Let me recount the fundamental issues presented on this appeal—in effect: “let’s review the bidding.” The complaint filed by Jama sought $250,000 in statutory damages for violations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”); it also sought a total of nearly $5 million for all damages including general negligence damages, punitive damages, and RFRA. RFRA provides that, if a violation is found, not only may damages be awarded but reasonable attorney’s fees may be assessed.

According to the police commissioner, most of the individuals arrested were purported illegal immigrant workers with no criminal records. ICE admitted that it arrested at least one person who was a U.S citizen. The cavalier attitude of ICE and total disregard for the rights of the occupants of the homes being raided are reflected in a comment attributed to Defendant Smith, the special agent in charge of the raids.
We don’t need warrants to make arrests. These are illegal immigrants.” (See Exhibit 11.)
The complaint alleges that the individual defendants violated their rights under both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. PROCEDURAL HISTORY Plaintiffs filed this action on September 20, 2007.

The Fourth Amendment provides that “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S Const. amend IV.
Conversely, in DeShawn E v. Safir, 156 F.3d 340 (2d Cir. 1998), the Court of Appeals concluded that Lyons did not preclude the plaintiffs from seeking equitable relief against the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”). Under New York law, after a juvenile was arrested, he could be released and issued an “appearance ticket” that directed him to return to family court for a preliminary conference with probation services to determine whether delinquency proceedings should be initiated Id.
A class of juveniles who had been interrogated by the Squad was certified, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief Id. The district court denied a motion by the plaintiffs for a preliminary injunction, and granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment Id. at 344.
The Court of Appeals found that the plaintiffs and their parents had standing to seek injunctive relief. The Court of Appeals distinguished Lyons (and Curtis): [I]n Lyons, there was no proof of a pattern of illegality as the police had discretion to decide if they were going to apply a choke hold and there was no formal policy which sanctioned the application of the choke hold.
at 213. The plaintiff sued the county, alleging that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment, and sought, among other relief, a permanent injunction prohibiting blanket strip searches and body cavity inspections of an individual “absent a reasonable suspicion that such individual is concealing weapons or other contraband.”
at 214. Without addressing standing, the district court granted the injunction. On appeal, the Court of Appeals found that, although he had standing to seek monetary and declarative relief, the plaintiff lacked standing to seek injunctive relief because he “failed to demonstrate a likelihood of future harm.”
Wal-Mart, 131 S Ct. at 2550. The three named plaintiffs claimed that Wal-Mart discriminated against them based on their gender. They did not allege that Wal-Mart “has any express corporate policy against the advancement of women,” but instead claimed that the local managers’ broad discretion over employment decisions “is exercised disproportionately in favor of men, leading to an unlawful disparate impact on female employees.”
an important task of this Court is to test these assertions against the current record. As in Wal-Mart! the critical question before this Court is whether the named plaintiffs have sufficient commonality with the class they propose to represent to support certification.

UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the ruling of the district court is AFFIRMED.
In 2009, the Town of Oyster Bay passed an ordinance prohibiting day laborers standing near a public right-of-way from stopping or attempting to stop vehicles to solicit work, and drivers frompicking up such laborers. On May 18, 2010, two organizations of day laborers sued the Town and its Supervisor (together, “the Town”) in the district court, seeking to enjoin the town from enforcing the ordinance on the ground that the ordinance violated their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection of the laws. They immediately moved, on free-speech grounds only, for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) that would bar enforcement “until the hearing on [their]motion for preliminary injunction.”
Accordingly, the district court cancelled the scheduled hearings and entered a prelim inary injunction as stipulated by the parties on June 1. The Town then appealed. We have no jurisdiction to review the TRO, absent special circumstances not present here.
This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3–4). Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) in that Plaintiffs’ claims arise in the Eastern District of New York.

BACKGROUND The plaintiffs, two organizations that advocate on behalf of immigrant workers and day laborers, commenced this lawsuit on May 17, 2010, alleging that the Town of Oyster Bay Ordinance prohibiting day laborers, standing near a public right-of-way, from stopping or attempting to stop vehicles to solicit work, and drivers from picking up such laborers, violated their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection of the laws. The plaintiffs simultaneously moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction on free speech grounds. The following day, the district court entered a TRO based on the limited information before it.
On consent, the court entered the preliminary injunction as stipulated by the parties. The Town then appealed to the Second Circuit. Although the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision, the Second Circuit emphasized that the district court retained the power to reconsider its order granting the preliminary injunction or to leave the preliminary injunction in place and proceed to trial.

225,IM-NY-0055,"Sixteen states filed this lawsuit against the federal government on September 6, 2017 in response to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memorandum issued on Sept. 5 ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The states sought to enjoin the federal government from carrying out portions of the DHS memorandum and from using information about DACA grantees gathered in their applications to enforce immigration policy. While the district court granted in part the government’s motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction. On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that DHS's decision to rescind DACA was subject to judicial review under the APA and that the rescission was unlawful. Shortly thereafter, the Acting DHS Secretary issued a memorandum suspending DACA while DHS reviewed it. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that the Acting Secretary lacked the authority to issue the memorandum because he had not been lawfully appointed to his position. The district court agreed. Accordingly, the court vacated the memorandum and ordered DHS to resume processing DACA applications. This case is ongoing.

In February 2020, a Second Circuit panel reversed the district court's order granting partial summary judgment, vacated the mandate and injunction, and remanded the case to the district court, concluding that the Attorney General was statutorily authorized to impose the challenged conditions and that the imposition of these conditions was not arbitrary and capricious. The plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment is currently pending before the district court.  ","DOJ subsequently sought to achieve a similar goal by imposing three immigrationrelated conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds.15 On July 25, 2017, DOJ announced that it would impose these conditions and provided a one-page “Backgrounder” and a press release, neither of which explained how or why DOJ decided to impose these immigration-related conditions, how the conditions would advance the interests of the Byrne JAG program, or what alternatives DOJ 14 County of Santa Clara v. Trump, 267 F. Supp. had considered. On August 24, 2017, one day before State applications for FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds were due, DOJ published a sample final award document containing the three immigrationrelated conditions and stated that identical conditions would be imposed on other applicants.
Related Litigation The new conditions on Byrne JAG funding have generated litigation throughout the country. In Chicago, a district court in the Northern District of Illinois issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the Notice and Access Conditions. City of Chicago v. Sessions, 264 F. Supp.

On appeal from a judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Edgardo Ramos, Judge), which (1) mandates that defendants release withheld 2017 Byrne Program Criminal Justice Assistance funds to plaintiffs, and (2) enjoins defendants from imposing certain immigration‐related conditions on such grants, defendants argue that the district court erred in holding that the challenged conditions violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the United States Constitution.
At its core, this appeal presents questions of statutory construction. In proceedings below, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Edgardo Ramos, Judge) determined that the Attorney General was not statutorily authorized to impose the challenged conditions and, therefore, enjoined their application.

In response to these DOJ actions, the plaintiff States and City filed the instant related actions, challenging, inter alia, the Certification, Notice, and Access Conditions for 2017 Byrne grants as violative of both the APA and the Constitution. The Award of Summary Judgment to Plaintiffs On the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted partial judgment to plaintiffs, enjoining the enforcement of the challenged conditions as to them and mandating the release of 2017 Byrne grant funds to plaintiffs. In so ruling, the district court held that the challenged conditions violated the APA in two respects: (1) the Attorney General lacked the statutory authority to impose the conditions, see New York v. Dep’t of Justice, 343 F. Supp.

Appeal of Agency Decision Jurisdiction: U.S. Government Defendant Plaintiff",This case was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the City of Manhattan. The plaintiffs alleged that the conditions imposed by the DOJ on the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program (Byrne Program) violated the Constitution and the Constitution's Anticommandeering Doctrine. The district court granted summary judgment to the States on Count IV. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.,"On July 25, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Edgardo Ramos) issued a judgment enjoining the Department of Justice's (DOJ) imposition of three immigration-related conditions on FY 2017 Byrne JAG funding. The plaintiff states and cities challenged the conditions on the grounds that the conditions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the United States Constitution. The district court held that the Attorney General lacked the statutory authority to impose the conditions and enjoined their application. On appeal, the District Court vacated the district court's judgment and remanded the case to the District Attorney's Office for further proceedings."
227,IM-NY-0079,"In July 2020, several immigration advocacy and nonprofit organizations filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs claimed that by excluding “undocumented immigrants from: (a) the tabulation of the total population of the states; (b) the calculation and statement of the whole number of persons in each state; and (c) the calculation and statement of the apportionment of the House of Representatives among the states” the federal government were violating the Enumeration and Apportionment clauses of the United States Constitution, Equal Protection under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Separation of Powers, the Census Act, and. In August 2020, this case was consolidated with State of New York v. Trump. For additional information, on this case, please see State of New York v. Trump.","COMPLAINT 1. This action challenges President Trump’s lawless attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the “persons” who must be counted in the Census for purposes of apportioning congressional seats to states. This xenophobic effort to deny the basic humanity of undocumented immigrants violates Article I’s mandate to count all “persons” in the Census, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s requirement that “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State....” (emphasis added).
It has offices in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. CASA is the largest membership-based immigrants’ rights organization in the mid-Atlantic region, with more than 90,000 members. CASA’s mission is to create a more just society by increasing the power of and improving the quality of life in low-income immigrant communities.
Lower courts have similarly recognized that the Constitution requires that all people be included in the population totals used for Congressional apportionment, regardless of citizenship status. As a three-judge panel of the District Court for the District of Columbia explained: The language of the Constitution is not ambiguous. It requires the counting of the “whole number of persons” for apportionment purposes, and while illegal aliens were not a component of the population at the time the Constitution was adopted, they are clearly “persons.”
B. Defendants’ First Attempt to Exclude Noncitizens from the Census: The Citizenship Question Litigation 113. This is not the first effort by Defendants to exclude noncitizens from the 2020 Census. Most notably, following the Secretary’s March 2018 announcement that a citizenship question would be included on the Census, numerous plaintiffs, including Plaintiffs here, filed suit to block the question.
Barred from including a citizenship question on the 2020 Census, Defendants have now contrived a new scheme to identify and directly exclude undocumented immigrants from the Actual Enumeration required for apportionment. On July 21, 2020, Defendant Trump issued a presidential memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce entitled, “Memorandum on Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census. The Memorandum wrongly asserts that “[t]he Constitution does not specifically define which persons must be included in the apportionment base,” that “persons in each state” has been interpreted to mean “inhabitants,” that the scope of the term “inhabitants” requires “the exercise of judgment,” and that the President purportedly has discretion to exercise that judgment to exclude entire categories of persons who reside in the United States.
The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that the federal government not deny people the equal protection of its laws and prohibits the federal government from discriminating against individuals in the United States on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, and citizenship. U.S Const. amend V.

228,IM-OK-0003,"On February 1, 2008, national, state and local chambers of commerce and other nonprofit organizations advocating for their members' business interests filed a lawsuit against the State of Oklahoma, claiming that Sections 7 and 9 of the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act, which impose tax penalties on businesses that don't check the work eligibility of all of their employees in a federal database and allow discharged employees to bring discrimination suits against their employers for employing unauthorized workers, were preempted by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act.
The Court granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on June 4, 2008, and on appeal to the Tenth Circuit the injunction was upheld except for as to the verification requirement. On remand to the District Court, the case was stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Whiting, which Supreme Court later held that an Arizona law requiring employers to use E-Verify was not preempted by federal law. Pursuant to this decision, the district court entered in a judgment on December 19th, 2012, holding that Oklahoma can require persons to contract with the State to use the employment authorization system. However, the provision creating a cause of action for discrimination against employers who terminate an authorized employee while retaining an unauthorized employee and the provision requiring businesses to verify individual independent contractors’ authorization status and creating a withholding for work performed by individual independent contractors, were both struck down.

In support of this Motion to Dismiss, Defendants would show this Court the following: PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS Plaintiffs’ (varies Chamber of Commerce and business associations) have filed their Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against several State officials, all named only in their “official capacities.” Plaintiffs seek this Court’ s assistance to enjoin two sections of the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007 (“H.B. 1904"" or “the Act”) from being implemented.
That Amendment prohibits the national government from exercising non-delegated powers that will infringe on the lawmaking autonomy of the states; it provides that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” U.S Const. amend X.
Furthermore, federal law sets the m etes and bounds of appropriate prohibi- tions and sanctions on em ployers. It fo rbids an em ployer from hiring an alien knowing he is unauthorized to work, or without complying with the I-9 Form proc- ess. 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(1)(A), (B).
In Geier, for instance, a federal motor ve hicle safety standard “d eliberately provided … manufacturer[s] with a range of choices among different passive restraint devices” to install, and did so for a variety of policy r easons: “a mix of devices would help develop data on com parative effectiveness, would allow the indust ry time to overcome the safety problem s and the hi gh production costs associated with airbags, and would facilitate th e development of alternativ e, cheaper, and safer pas- 25 Indeed, such Balkanization already has begun. Ill inois has passed a law forbidding employers from using Basic Pilot. A 416-17.
Plaintiffs, various chambers of commerce and trade associations (“plaintiffs” or the “Chambers”), challenged Sections 7(B), 7(C), and 9 of the Act. They claimed that all three sections were expressly and impliedly preempted by federal law and moved for a preliminary injunction to bar Oklahoma’s Governor, Attorney General, Human Rights Commission, and Tax Commission (collectively “defendants” or “Oklahoma”) from enforcing the challenged provisions. Defendants opposed a preliminary injunction and moved to dismiss.
Oklahoma argued that the Chambers lacked standing, that certain defendants were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment, and that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, deprived the district court of jurisdiction to enjoin Section 9. The district court denied the motions to dismiss and granted the preliminary injunction. All defendants, save the Governor, appeal.
Aqueduct Sewer Auth v. Metcalf Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147 (1993), and under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) to review the grant of a preliminary injunction. The panel dismisses in part, reverses in part, and affirms in part. I This case requires us to consider the interplay between the federal employment verification regime and that of the Oklahoma Act.
We begin by outlining these potentially-conflicting systems.
C Plaintiffs are various national, state, and local chambers of commerce and trade associations that represent businesses in Oklahoma. The Chambers filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging that Sections 7(B), 7(C), and 9 of the Oklahoma Act were expressly and impliedly preempted by federal law and thus unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. See U.S Const art.
This is problematic because it implies that the presence of an express preemption provision precludes the possibility of implied preemption. But that is emphatically not the case. Geier, 529 U.S. at 869 (“We now conclude that the saving clause (like the express pre-emption provision) does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles.”).
VI For the reasons stated, we DISMISS the Attorney General from the case insofar as he is named as a defendant in the challenges to Sections 7(C) and 9. The district court’s grant of summary judgment against the enforcement of Section 7(B) is REVERSED. In all other respects, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

Cercone) denied the habeas petition as moot, dismissed the action, and denied the motion for class certification because ICE had assumed custody of both petitioners.","Preliminary Statement Attorneys Donald Driscoll and Evalynn Welling on behalf of Wilmer Urbina and Rutilo Romero-Ramirez, parent of Omar Romero-Villegas, a minor, and on behalf of Omar RomeroVillejas in his own right and all others similarly situated petition this Court for a Writ of Habeas Corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Wilmer Urbina, Omar Romero-Villegas and others have been detained in the Allegheny County Jail without due process nor any other lawful authority. In support thereof the following is stated: II.
Jurisdiction and Venue 1. This Court has jurisdiction and may issue relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (habeas corpus), 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (civil rights). Venue is proper in the Western District of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 because Wilmer Urbina, Omar Romero-Villegas and others on whose behalf this matter is brought are in custody at the Allegheny County Jail in Pennsylvania.
Parties 3. Petitioner Wilmer Urbina is an adult individual who is presently detained in the Allegheny County Jail. Petitioner Rutilo Romero-Ramirez is an adult individual and the father of Omar Romero-Villegas, who is 17 years old and is presently detained in the Allegheny County Jail.
This action is brought, as in Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) and (3), on behalf of a class consisting of all who are or will be detained in the Allegheny County Jail without being provided due process and based solely on an immigration detainer which does not authorize their detention. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.
There are questions of law or fact common to the class, specifically whether an immigration detainer authorizes the Respondent Warden to detain members of the class indefinitely and without due process. The claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the class. Each have been detained pursuant to the same alleged authority.
The representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Their counsel is experienced in class actions raising civil rights claims. Adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the interests of the class who are not parties or substantially impair their ability to protect their interests.
Factual Allegations 14.
Wilmer Urbina was arrested following a traffic stop in Wilkinsburg, Pa. on April 3, 2008. At the request of the charging police officer his preliminary hearing was continued from April 10, 2008 until June 26, 2008 and upon the initiation of the Magisterial District Judge from June 26, 2008 until July 3, 2008.
Omar Romero-Villegas was arrested after leaving his place of employment in Ross Township Pa. on June 11, 2008.
All criminal charges against Omar Romero-Villegas were withdrawn on or before June 27, 2008. Petitioners and others have been continuously confined in the Allegheny County Jail due to detainers placed on them by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. At most these detainers provide that those subject to them be held for no more than 48 hours from the time state authorized custody has ended.
Petitioners Urbina and Romero-Villegas and others similarly situated are entitled to immediate release VI. Causes of Action Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 21.
Order Respondent to show cause why the writ of habeas corpus should not be granted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2243; c. Grant the writ of habeas corpus and order the immediate release from custody of Mr. Urbina and Mr. Romero-Villegas and all others similarly situated on the grounds that their detention is not authorized by statute and violates due process; d.

at 240. The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court of the United States. Though the issue of standing was not raised before the Supreme Court, the Court stated in a footnote: Appellants have taken an oath to support the United States Constitution.
Accordingly, the Court finds that Mississippi has failed to allege an injury-in-fact sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirements of standing. The state of Mississippi’s claims are therefore DISMISSED without prejudice to refiling.

The State of Mississippi alleges that the deferred action has caused additional aliens to remain in the state and, thus, causes the state to spend money on providing social services. The district court dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We conclude that neither the Agents nor the State of Mississippi has demonstrated the concrete and particularized injury required to give them standing to maintain this suit.
Ultimately, the district court determined that the Agents had not pursued their remedies under the Civil Service Reform Act, and, thus, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over these claims. The court dismissed the remainder of the Agents’ claims. This appeal followed.
We agree. The district court agreed with DHS and held that the violation of one’s oath alone is not a sufficient injury in fact to support standing. Citing to Finch v.

Upon information and belief, workers of non-Indian descent and United States citizen employees were neither required nor allowed to live in and/or pay for accommodations in Defendant Signal’s labor camps. Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to skills testing and re-testing, on the- job discipline, layoffs, periods without work, lack of safety precautions, unfavorable job Complaint assignments, evaluation processes, and other adverse employment actions to which non-Indian and U.S. citizen workers were not similarly subjected.
Within a few days of Plaintiffs’ and other Indian H-2B workers’ arrival at its labor camps in late 2006 and early 2007, Signal personnel had conducted meetings at the labor camps between Plaintiffs and representatives from specific banks. In Orange, these meetings were with representatives from Capital One Bank. In Pascagoula, these meetings were with representatives from M&M Bank.

Plaintiffs reasonably perceived their work environment to be hostile, abusive, and discriminatory on the basis of their race, national origin, and/or alienage. Defendant Signal’s hostile, abusive, and discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs and others similarly situated was unwelcome. Defendant Signal knowingly, willfully, maliciously, intentionally, and without justification acted to deprive Plaintiffs of their rights.

232,IM-TX-0043,"On October 26, 2015, sixteen undocumented immigrants formerly detained in Dallas County, Texas, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued Dallas County and the Dallas County Sheriff under 42 USC §1983 for violations of the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought damages and an injunction preventing the defendants from detaining the plaintiffs solely based on a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an immigration hold, or an immigration detainer. Over time, the case was consolidated with two other lawsuits with identical claims. The state of Texas also intervened as a defendant. The district court initially granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but allowed the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint. The court then dismissed the plaintiffs' due process claims, allowing them to move forward only with their Fourth Amendment claims. By October 18, 2018, only one plaintiff was still represented by counsel and pursuing a claim (26 had dismissed their claims with prejudice, and 18 had fallen out of contact with counsel and were designated as pro se; their claims were later dismissed). That plaintiff reached a private settlement with the defendants and the court ordered entry of the final judgment on December 4, 2018. The plaintiff was to be paid $9,500. The case is closed.","Plaintiffs were held by Dallas County in detention. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) requested that Dallas County detain each Plaintiff for up to 48 hours after the time that each Plaintiff otherwise would have been released to facilitate ICE’s arrest of that Plaintiff.
Instead, Dallas County will maintain custody for transfer to ICE. Dallas County’s practices are widely known. As a result, attempting to post bond is known as a futile exercise for those with immigration holds, because it will not result in immediate release.

The immigration hold resulted in pretrial detention due to Dallas County’s practice of refusing immediate release on bond to individuals with immigration holds Mr. Torres Cabrera remained in Dallas County custody until around August 2015. xiv. The 363d District Court in Dallas County granted Moises Vega Costilla’s Motion for New Trial in April 2015. The 363d District Court in Dallas County granted Moises Vega Costilla’s Motion for New Trial in April 2015. An immigration hold was placed on Mr. Vega Costilla.
I The facts in this case are largely undisputed.1 Plaintiffs are former detainees2 of the Dallas County jail. They allege that, while they were being held in detention by defendant Dallas County in connection with state criminal charges, they were the subjects of federal immigration detainers (U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) Form I-247), issued by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), a component of DHS. The detainers requested that Dallas County detain them for up to 48 hours after the time they otherwise would have been released, in order to facilitate their arrest by ICE.3 According to plaintiffs’ complaints, Dallas County detained plaintiffs for varying periods of time after they [m]aintain custody of the subject for a period NOT TO EXCEED 48 HOURS, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, beyond the time when the subject would have otherwise been released from your custody to allow DHS to take custody of the subject.
A The Fourth Amendment provides that “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons... against unreasonable... seizures, shall not be violated[.]” U.S Const. amend IV.

PARTIES 1. Plaintiffs were detained by Dallas County. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) issued detainers requesting that Dallas County facilitate ICE’s arrest of each Plaintiff, generally by (i) detaining each Plaintiff for up to 48 hours after the time that each Plaintiff otherwise would have been released, or (ii) notifying ICE when Dallas County intended to release each Plaintiff.

28 U.S.C. § 1331. Dallas County is located in this District. Dallas County regularly conducts business in Texas and this district.

Between January 2014 and September 2015, Texas law enforcement agencies refused only 146 detainers.5 Ex. U (Andy East, U.S. Citizen Jailed in Immigration Status Mistake, Texas Tribune, Feb.

But for Dallas County’s practices of refusing immediate release on bond for any detainee with an immigration hold, Ms. Jarquin Jimenez could have and would have secured a bond to ensure pretrial release. Dallas County’s practice of refusing immediate release on bond to individu- als with immigration holds resulted in pretrial detention. If Dallas County had allowed Ms. Jarquin Jimenez to pay bail on her original purported criminal offense, Dallas County should have released Ms. Jarquin Jimenez, as Dallas County had no other basis to believe that Ms. Jarquin Jimenez had committed or was committing a criminal offense.

233,IM-TX-0046,"This suit challenges Texas's ""Sanctuary City"" legislation, Senate Bill 4 (SB4), which requires local Texas law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration officials and punishes them if they do not. Unlike the <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=46"">other suits in this special collection</a>, this suit does not challenge President Trump's ""Sanctuary City"" Executive Order. This case was quickly consolidated with the two other before Judge Orlando L. Garcia; please refer to <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15825"">El Cenizo v. Texas</a> for further information and updates.  This case was administratively closed on Oct. 24, 2017 in light of the consolidation.","As it has done for hundreds of years, El Paso will protect its heritage, identity and adherence to constitutional values such as equality and justice — and will do so with everything that it has. It is for these reasons and more, that El Paso files this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. TOPEF is an education organization based in San Antonio, Houston and Dallas.
More than half of TOPEF’s employees and the people they serve identify as Latino; many are from immigrant, mixed-status families.
This action raises federal questions under the United States Constitution, particularly Article 1, and the First, Fourth, Fourteenth Amendments. In addition, this court has jurisdiction over these constitutional claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346.
El Paso also has adopted policies, which may violate SB 4’s unconstitutional mandates. Specifically, the El Paso County Attorney’s office has adopted a policy that prohibits its investigators from making inquiries into the citizenship or residency status for the purpose of determining whether an individual has violated civil immigration law or for the purpose of enforcing those laws. The threat of this enforcement is real and actual, as proven by the State of Texas’ suit against several opponents of SB 4 filed recently in a federal court in Austin.
Given the budgetary uncertainty created by SB 4, its imminent enforcement, and the Attorney General and Governor’s threats against the opponents of SB 4, El Paso County has pre-enforcement standing to bring this action and is currently injured by SB 4’s unconstitutional mandates. Plaintiff, Richard Wiles, is the Sheriff of El Paso County. He is a judicial officer imbued with judicial discretion derived from the Texas Constitution.
Plaintiff, the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund (TOPEF), is an education organization with a focus working class neighborhoods in the cities of San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas, TOPEF works to improve the lives of low-income and working class Texas families through education, civil engagement and community organizing.
TOPEF is incorporated in Texas. TOPEF must expend resources to educate its employees and service community concerning SB 4. TOPEF has members in many counties in Texas, including Bexar, and Harris Counties.
He is sued in his official capacity. Defendant Steve McCraw is the Director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). He is responsible for the policies and practices of the DPS officers and their enforcement of federal immigration laws.
The agents searched the car without probable cause or consent.
The students were questioned about their national origin and immigration status.
These children and their coach were stopped solely because of their Hispanic descent.
The subsequent lawsuit found that the agents violated the civil rights of the students and their coach. This case and many others have typified the relationship between immigration enforcement and Mexican Americans in Texas, and in El Paso County specifically. This unequal enforcement is based on racial classification or national origin animus.
Although the term “endorse” is not defined in statute, its common definitions include verbal expression and public statements regarding policy proposals. The State of Texas has sued several public officials and a non-profit organization, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), seemingly based on their public statements that SB 4 is unconstitutional. MALDEF is not a policy maker nor has any governmental control of any policy or procedure that would be implicated by SB 4’s mandates or prohibitions.

On September 22, 2016, Mi! :,rrant Justice organized a protest at the ICE facility at St. 7 Albans, Vermont in response to Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas's arrest. Migrant Justice also secured a 8 letter from Senator Sanders to support Plaintiff Alcudia Gamas's release from detention on bond.
ICE identified Migrant I6 Justice's protest in St. Albans as an ""ICE Significant Incident."" ICE Selectively Revealed that It Was Surveilling Migrant Justice in Order to Intimidate and Chill Its Activities. In addition to the arrests, ICE selectively revealed information that it was surveilling Migrant Justice in order to intimidate and chill Plaintiffs' protected activities.

Migrant Justice's members have identified four core areas of organizational focus: dignified 23 work and quality housing, freedom of movement and access to transportation, freedom from 24 discrimination, and access to healthcare. In the course of its advocacy, Migrant Justice has loudly and publicly criticized U.S. 26 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (""ICE""). ICE has retaliated, and continues to retaliate, by 27 disrupting Plaintiffs' advocacy and infringing upon their First Amendment rights.
11 Vermont DMVDefendant 20. Defendant Wanda Minoli is the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Motor 13 Vehicles. In this capacity, she is charged with enforcing and administering the regulations governing 14 the DMV, the governmental agency responsible for registering and inspecting automobiles and other 15 motor vehicles as well as licensing drivers in Vermont.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Migrant Justice and Its Members Engage in Protected Speech, Win Changes that Improve the Lives of Migrants, and Criticize ICE and the DMV. Migrant Justice fights for the rights of the approximately 1,500 migrant farm workers in Vermont. These workers typically work sixty to eighty hours per week, endure extreme isolation, 23 24 and are systemically excluded from many worker and housing rights protections.
The legislation explicitly directed the Criminal Justice Training Council to I ""consult[] with stakeholders, including the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, the Vermont 2 Human Rights Commission, and Migrant Justice."" In February 2015, Migrant Justice assisted a member, Lorenzo Alcudia Gamas, to file 4 a complaint with the Vermont Human Rights Commission against the Grand Isle County Sheriffs 5 Department. A deputy had stopped a car driven by a Migrant Justice volunteer in which Alcudia 6 Gamas rode in the passenger seat, on his way to a community meeting as a representative of Migrant 7 Justice.
The deputy issued the Caucasian driver a warning for speeding but turned Alcudia 9 Gamas over to U.S. Border Patrol. The Vermont Human Rights Commission concluded that there 10 were reasonable grounds to believe that the Sheriffs Department had discriminated against Alcudia 11 Gamas on the basis of his national origin and race. In April 2016, the Sheriffs Department settled 12 with Alcudia Gamas and the Human Rights Commission for nearly $30,000.
Also on June 19, 2017, a delegation of Migrant Justice members and allies protested at 27 the ICE office in St. Albans, Vermont. Migrant Justice members demanded that ICE explain why it had arrested individuals with no criminal records. During the protest, ICE agents recognized and identified several members by name.

5 Defendants assert that discovery should not proceed until such time as the Court 6 has ruled on Defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants have moved to dismiss on the 7 ground that there are no agency decisions subject to review under the Administrative 8 Procedure Act (“APA”).

Of the three challenges to 10 E0-3, Doe is the first-filed action. Viewed broadly, the chronology factor weighs against 11 transfer.
The Emami plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claims are virtually unchanged from their previous 14 versions, and the Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion on either claim. The mandamus claim is dismissed. The claim focuses on defendants’ alleged “fail[ure] to 16 develop meaningful guidance,” Dkt No. 75 (Emami) 336, an allegation that plaintiffs have now 17 retracted.
The summary judgment motion is 19 denied without prejudice. In the Emami case, defendants’ motion to dismiss is denied for plaintiffs’ APA claim, but 21 granted for plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection claims, and the 22 mandamus claim. Defendants’ summary judgment motion is denied without prejudice.

The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including 15 two (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated 16 and the practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment 17 strip and/or visual body cavity search at SOLANO COUNTY Jails without defendants first having, 18 and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband 19 or weapons. In addition, the class also includes all those persons who were subjected to pre- 20 arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches in the presence of persons who were not 21 participating in said searches (Group Strip Searches). In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of 23 the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.
Although a revised policy was issued on November 20, 2003, that revision erroneously 4 included a provision that specified that all persons going into housing would be strip searched even 5 though it was the explicit policy of S olano County not to strip search persons merely because they 6 were to be housed and custodial staf f had been tr ained not to strip search persons merely because 7 they were to be housed unless there was reasonable suspicion for a strip search. A corrected version of the strip search policy was issued in March 2007. While persons arrested and held at the So lano County Jail m ay have, on occasion, bee n 10 strip searched in violation of the defendants’ st rip search policy, those is olated instances were 11 unauthorized, in violation of policy, and inadvertent.
The Settlement is approved; b. The Complaint is dismissed; c. The claims of Plaintiffs MI CHAEL TODD, JAMES Y K. DAVIS, DEANGELA HARRIS, CARMEN HARRIS ROBINSON, BRADL EY WOLFE and those listed in Exhibit A hereto are dismissed with prejudice.

For example, Plaintiff COLE could not wheel himself to Elmwood’s large yard 3 because the path of travel was too uneven and the pavement was broken in places, requiring him 4 to ask a fellow inmate to push him.
For example, the front wheel of Plaintiff WILLIAMS’ 17 wheelchair was damaged while he was being pushed to a medical appointment when he was 18 pushed into an area with cracked pavement and his wheel was bent from colliding with the 19 uneven section. The Elmwood Women’s Facility is also not accessible.

246,JC-CA-0133,"In 2018, female prisoners at the Santa Rita Jail filed this class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants’ policy of keeping the lights on for 24 hours and other conduct that disrupt the inmates’ sleep violated their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by denying the basic human right to sleep and serving as a cruel and unusual punishment. As of July 2020, settlement negotiations are in progress.","In addition, although the schedule theoretically permits a sleep duration of up to five and a half hours; on a regular basis, and with great 13 frequency, sheriff deputies routinely disrupt prisoners’ limited sleep duration, often hourly, through their 14 activities and conduct including repeatedly shining bright white flashlights into prisoners’ eyes; banging 15 keys and flashlights on metal doors; forcing prisoners to wake up and acknowledge the presence of 16 sheriff deputies; turning on and leaving on overhead lights; yelling and shouting; creating loud noises; 17 operating machines; making announcements over the public address system; and having prisoner 18 activities including medical appointments and medication distribution at 3 a.m. 4. Prisoners at the Santa Rita Jail suffer from chronic deprivation of sleep and disturbance of 19 sleep. This ongoing, daily sleep deprivation and disturbance has created significant negative impacts on 20 prisoners’ abilities to function at many levels.
As a 4 result of this significant sleep deprivation and disruption, prisoners suffer disciplinary and punitive 5 consequences with ensuing additional deprivations including loss of telephone and visiting privileges, 6 loss of the ability to purchase commissary and placement into solitary confinement, the added social and 7 sensory isolation of solitary confinement compounds the cognitive, functional and psychiatric 8 impairments already existing due to sleep disruption and deprivation. This civil rights class action lawsuit seeks to end this long-standing unconstitutional practice at both Alameda County Jail facilities.

PLAINTIFFS 19. Plaintiff, TIKISHA UPSHAW, TYREKA STEWART and ANDREA HERNANDEZ are 21 pretrial detainees housed at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, California, in Alameda County and under the authority of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. Plaintiff UPSHAW and HERNANDEZ are currently incarcerated in what ACSO names 23 “administrative segregation” which is essentially solitary confinement.
Pregnant women are housed amongst all the other prisoners. There is no separate facility for pregnant women. Pregnant women are subject to the same schedules and same housing conditions as all 16 prisoners.
All prisoners in the Jails are subject to Defendants policies and procedures regarding sleep 17 19 practices. The jail is required to conduct pregnancy tests if requested or if the prisoner exhibits 21 symptoms of pregnancy. The Pregnant Prisoner Sub-Class members are identifiable using records 22 maintained in the ordinary course of business by Defendants.

No. 19. The request for an injunction is granted in part. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Upshaw is housed in the Santa Rita Jail facility, where she has been in detention 24 for over 26 months as she waits for her trial Dkt No. 19-4 9.
The merits determination here is made in the context of plaintiffs’ status as state pretrial 17 detainees. The parties focused almost entirely on the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and 18 unusual punishment for those convicted of an offense, but plaintiffs are not in jail after a trial and 19 conviction.

247,JC-CA-0137,"On November 11, 2019 prisoners at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, California filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, the California Forensic Medical Group and Aramark Correctional Services under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, 1983, and 1988. The plaintiffs claimed that defendants acted in violation of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that Santa Rita’s unsanitary confinement conditions, wrongful denials of attorney visits, failure to provide medical care, and retaliation against inmates for speaking out and filing grievances violated these constitutional rights. The case is ongoing.","14 PARTIES 15 Plaintiffs 16 12. Plaintiffs are all former or current prisoners incarcerated at the Santa Rita Jail. All 17 Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of male imprisoned at the Santa Rita Jail at any time since 18 November 12, 2017, two years prior to the date of filing of the Original Complaint in this action.
In addition, joinder is impracticable because, upon information and belief, many members 16 of the class are not aware of the fact that their constitutional rights were violated and that they 17 have the right to seek redress in court. Many members of the class are without the means to retain 18 an attorney to represent them in a civil rights lawsuit. There is no appropriate avenue for the 19 protection of the class members’ constitutional rights other than a class action.
In the 18 minimum-security housing units, each cell has 2 toilets, one urinal and one shower, which all 30 19 inmates share. The jail does not provide soap in the bathrooms. Inmates are required to clean 20 their own housing and bathrooms.
19 However, the holding cells and the booking/intake facilities are routinely filthy, rendering the 20 showers unavailable, and unusable, and certainly not suitable for assisting in cleaning people to 21 avoid the spread of contagion. These problems are exacerbated by the jail’s policy of not providing soap for inmates in the 23 bathrooms. Although there is a “free” toiletry kit given out to all newly booked inmates and for 24 indigent inmates, the products are of limited quantity so that it is inadequate for maintaining 25 personal hygiene beyond one or two uses.
Even with “clean” laundry, the “clean” clothing is frequently not very clean, having been 6 improperly laundered. This is due to the insufficient washing machines at the jail. Jail laundry 7 workers, in order to meet their work loads, have to overstuff the washing machines, which results 8 in insufficient water and soap, and laundry which is not properly laundered.
During this period, ACSO also entered into contracts with private, for-profit companies to 9 provide basic and crucial services to SRJ inmates. ACSO’s Contract with For Profit CFMG (also known as Wellpoint, Inc.) 11 52. ACSO contracts with Defendant CFMG to provide all health care services of any type 12 needed by any inmate at SRJ.
Commercial 20 clean-up crews normally come in the early morning, before a commercial kitchen opens. In 2017, the women prisoners at Santa Rita Jail filed a class action lawsuit against the jail 22 for similar issues. For a period of time, women prisoners, who work the graveyard shift at the 23 kitchen, were organized into cleaning crews, and crews were assigned to clean the various parts of 24 the jail.

Instead, on a 15 frequent basis, visitors many who have traveled long distances, are denied visits, often with little 16 notice. Santa Rita Jail and defendant ACSO have implemented a video visit procedure. However, 18 the equipment frequently malfunctions, and more important, defendant ACSO and sheriff deputies 19 frequently take actions to deny and prevent inmates from participating video visits because prior to 20 the video visits, they will force inmates into lockdown.
These deputies then proceeded to question Plaintiff Garrett about the incident with 5 Technician Kaiser, asserting that there had been no sex harassment, that the statement “Suck My 6 Dick” was a common, ordinary statement, and that Plaintiff Garrett had not felt “sexually 7 threatened.” They asked him to withdraw his complaint. These deputies stated, “We have to 8 protect our own.”

248,JC-CA-0142,"On January 4, 2018, six women prisoners filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging systematic, misogynistic mistreatment of women prisoners at the Alameda County Jail in Santa Rita, California.  The plaintiffs sued Alameda County and the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for violations of their rights under the U.S. Constitution and state law.  On April 12, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.  The plaintiffs elaborated on the allegations in the original complaint of the mistreatment against pregnant women prisoners and discrimination against women prisoners in general.  The second amended complaint also added additional causes of action under California state law and identified additional named defendants beyond the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office and individuals employed therein, including the California Forensic Medical Group, retained to provide medical services to prisoners and Aramark Correctional Services, a for-profit food services provider at the Jail.

The plaintiffs requested that the court certify a plaintiff class of women prisoners and the subclass of pregnant women prisoners, and that the court issue emergency remedy, by decree, to ensure that the women prisoners receive the medical care and other accommodations they needed to be safe while in custody at the Alameda County Jail.  Finally, in addition to the injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages requested in the original complaint, the plaintiffs requested that the court affirmatively direct the defendants to fully comply with all state statutes and regulations regarding medical treatment, nutrition, activities, and personal hygiene for women prisoners.  

The parties began engaging in settlement negotiations and entered an agreement in principle on May 14, 2018.  On May 7, 2019, one named plaintiff moved to relate the case to Gonzalez v. Ahern.  Though opposed by the defendants, on May 15, 2020, the court related this case to Gonzalez v. Ahern.

Plaintiffs are women in the custody and control of defendants. The first three named plaintiffs are pregnant. None of them have received an appropriate plan of care.
Instead of medical care, complaints of feeling ill are treated with solitary confinement, strip searches and cavity searches. Pregnant prisoners are told that their illness is due to drug abuse. The provision of food is at such odds with human needs, that breakfast is served between 3:30 am, and 4:30 a.m. and missing breakfast results in a 19 hour fast, which is detrimental to the nutrition needs of fetuses and pregnant women.
Recently, one woman who complained of cramps and pain, was 14 placed into solitary confinement per Santa Rita’s standard routine of meting out punishment and abuse onto pregnant prisoner. This woman was forced to deliver her baby, alone, in solitary confinement. Defendants’ abuse and mistreatment of women prisoners is part and parcel of the discrimination and unequal treatment meted out to women prisoners as compared to male prisoners.

The district court granted class certification and partially granted a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which mandated more social distancing, providing for more PPE, and improved sanitation policies. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, and applied in both the district court and the Ninth Circuit to stay the case in the lower court until the appeals court had ruled. Both denied these applications, however the Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court saying that the defendants could try to modify the injunction if there were any changed circumstances. Defendants did so, but the district court denied any modifications once again. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which likewise rejected the defendants' motion.

COVID‐19 has proven to be extremely contagious: it is airborne and survives on surfaces for days.2 To limit the spread of this potentially fatal disease, the governor of California—along with leaders around the globe—ordered residents to stay home, avoid non‐essential contacts, and to keep six feet away from others wherever possible. At least 369 inmates at the Orange County Jail (“Jail”) have been infected with COVID‐ 19. 3 COVID‐19 is particularly dangerous in jails and prisons, where inmates are often unable to practice the recommended social distancing, lack access to basic hygienic necessities, and are regularly exposed to correctional officers and staff who move in and out of the Jail.

Jail violated their Constitutional rights by detaining them beyond their release dates and conducting blanket strip searches. In 2014, after summary judgment rulings and a jury trial in 2013, the parties settled the case and D.C. agreed to pay the plaintiffs $6.2 million. ","The Court certified an “Overdetention Class” and a “Strip Search Class” representing both types of claimants, which overlapped a great deal, and denied motions by the District to dismiss and for summary judgment. The parties reached a settlement of that case in August of 2005, which the Court approved in January, 2006. The problem in Bynum, as alleged by plaintiffs in that case and this one, was that “court releases,” inmates who were entitled to release after a court appearance, were typically taken from court to the Central Detention Facility (“D.C. Jail”) or the Correctional Treatment Facility (“CTF”) to await the administrative processing of their release, often called “out-processing.
A review of the background of the case, the governing law, the parties’ arguments, and the Court’s reasoning in resolving those arguments follows I. BACKGROUND This case involves overdetentions and strip searches at the District of Columbia’s jails. The District’s Department of Corrections has custody over thousands of prisoners serving time for various offenses, with jail sentences of varying lengths.
In addition to this “overdetention” class, this Court in Bynum certified an overlapping “strip search” class. T he District moved for summary judgment, the Court denied that motion, and shortly thereafter the parties settled the case. The class members in Bynum were unable to get through the DOC’s release process on the day that their releases were ordered, were held by the DOC past midnight, and overdetained.

Opinion MEMORANDUM OPINION (RESOLVING PARTIES’ MOTIONS IN LIMINE ROYCE C. LAMBERTH, Chief Judge. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY This case concerns the District of Columbia Department of Corrections’ (“DOC”) practice of overdetaining and strip searching its inmates. The plaintiffs, former inmates subject to overdetentions and strip searches, filed a class action against the District of Columbia (“District”) over six years ago.
District of Columbia, Civil No. 02–956(RCL). The Bynum case dealt with a virtually identical issue—the class plaintiffs claimed that the District’s DOC had a practice of overdetaining and strip searching inmates. See Compl., May 16, 2002, ECF No. 1, 02–cv–956.
That class definition includes both liability and all damages. The District will pay up to $2.9 million to SCMs as detailed below. All funds not distributed to SCMs will revert to the District of Columbia General Fund.
Once the contract is finalized, this clause is no longer conditional. The District will pay up to $75,000 for a group of three third-party reviewers to review all claims made by SCMs. The parties will both solicit applications for third-party reviewers from among persons with expertise who are not former employees of the D.C. Department of Corrections.
The purpose of this notice is to inform you about a proposed settlement in the Barnes lawsuit. The settlement may affect the rights of certain people who were incarcerated in facilities operated by the District of Columbia’s Department of Corrections. The settlement is not final.
What is this lawsuit about? The Barnes lawsuit was brought in 2005 by a group of former inmates who believed that the District of Columbia’s Department of Corrections kept them incarcerated past the time they were supposed to be released, or subjected them to a strip search after they had been to court and were entitled to release because of the court appearance. The people who initially brought the lawsuit, called the “named plaintiffs,” are Carl A. Barnes, Dernard Hawkins, David Peterson, Toney James Malloy, Maurice Williams, and Razina Jones.
The District is the “Defendant” here, the party being sued. The plaintiffs and the defendant have written down their agreement in a document called a “Settlement Agreement.” Although, on the judge preliminarily approved the agreement, the settlement is NOT FINAL.
Although Defendant denies that it has committed any wrongdoing, it believes that further litigation would be protracted, expensive, and contrary to its best interests. Thus, the Parties entered into settlement negotiations which resulted in the settlement. The Honorable Royce C. Lamberth has determined on a preliminary basis that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate and in the best interests of the Class.","In 2006, former inmates of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections (DOC) filed a class action lawsuit against the District in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The plaintiffs alleged that the District's practice of overdetaining and strip searching its inmates violated their constitutional rights. The District agreed to pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and costs, and to provide notice to the class members regarding the district's declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was settled in February 2009.","On May 16, 2002, former inmates of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections (D.C.

The Court noted that the County strip searched prisoners only after they had intermingled with other prisoners and had outside access to attorneys and others. The Court upheld the constitutionality of the blanket strip search policy. The Court held that, in circumstances like those presented here, where pretrial detainees, including those charged with minor, nonviolent offenses, are kept in a detention center’s general population prior to arraignment, and are thereafter put in a position where exposure to the general public presents a very real danger of contraband being passed to a detainee, a policy of strip searching the detainees upon their return from the courthouse and prior to their being placed back in the general population of the detention center is both justified and reasonable.
1983) (same). The United States District Court for the District of Columbia has upheld the policy requiring a reasonable suspicion to strip search detainees. Citing various authorities, the Court has said “ ‘strip searches are violative of the Fourth Amendment when applied to all arrestees, Stewart v. Lubbock County, Texas, 767 F.2d 152 (5th Cir.

3 Plaintiffs moved to amend their Complaint to add a claim that the non-private setting in which the female arrestees were made to drop, squat and cough—in a female search room in front of other female arrestees—was an unreasonable time, place, and/or manner in which to conduct the searches under the Fourth Amendment.

District of Columbia, 584 F. Supp. Following class certification, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the District. Believing that the Superior Court Marshal is a federal official who acted at all times under color of federal law, and that the District therefore had no choice but to turn pre-presentment arrestees over to the Marshal, the court concluded that the District could not be held liable for any unconstitutional acts of the Marshal Id.

252,JC-DC-0014,"D.C. jail denies accommodation to plaintiff while they were incarcerated. As a result, the plaintiff could not participate in the court-ordered rehabilitation services offered by the jail. The D.C. jail later placed the plaintiff in voluntary solitary confinement without communicating to him that his solitary confinement was voluntary. The court found in favor of the plaintiff on summary judgment and a subsequent jury trail awarded him $70,000 in damages. ","Defendant District of Columbia intentionally discriminated against Mr. Pierce on the basis of his disability by denying him adequate and effective means to communicate with individuals both inside the jail and by telephone with individuals outside the jail. The defendant also retaliated against him for seeking accommodation to which he was entitled Mr. Pierce seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and other appropriate relief. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 2.
Defendant District of Columbia is a municipal corporation and the local government of Washington, DC. The Department of Corrections (“DOC”) is an agency of the District of Columbia, the functions of which include overseeing the operation of the Correctional Treatment Facility. FACTS 6.
On information and belief, Mr. Pierce was placed at the Correctional Treatment Facility rather than the D.C. Jail because DOC believed that the Correctional Treatment Facility provided those services and had better accommodations for deaf prisoners. The Correctional Treatment Facility is a medium security facility in the District of Columbia that incarcerates male and female inmates. In 1997, the Corrections Corporation of America (“CCA”), a private prison company, entered into a 20-year contract with the District of Columbia to operate, maintain and manage the Correctional Treatment Facility as an annex to the D.C Jail.
CCA is required to provide for all aspects of incarceration, including, but not limited to, staffing, medical and mental health care, religious services, and vocational, therapeutic and substance abuse programming. The District of Columbia is required to provide reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. 10. The Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”
Inadequate Access to Telecommunications 31. The Correctional Treatment Facility provides inmates access to a bank of telephones so that they can communicate with family, friends and other individuals in the outside world. On information and belief, hearing inmates have access to these telephones on a first come, first served basis, seven days a week between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. 32.
In the outside world he uses a videophone to communicate via telephone using ASL. The Correctional Treatment Facility provides teletypewriter (“TTY”) devices to deaf and hard of hearing inmates. A TTY is an outmoded electronic device that enables people with hearing and speech disabilities to communicate via telephone.
Claim III: Retaliation in Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act (42 U.S.C. § 12203; 29 U.S.C. § 794a(2)) 51. Defendant’s retaliation against Mr. Pierce for asserting his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act violated his rights under those Acts. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, plaintiff requests that this Court: (a) DECLARE that the actions of Defendant District of Columbia, as alleged herein, violated William Pierce’s rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act; .
Holdings: The District Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, J. held that: prison had affirmative duty to evaluate newly incarcerated deaf inmate’s accommodation requirements, and its failure to do so denied inmate benefits under Rehabilitation Act and ADA; but even if prison’s obligation arose only after it received a request for accommodation, inmate specifically requested an ASL interpreter; prison was deliberately indifferent to deaf inmate’s need for accommodation, as would support award of compensatory damages; but genuine issue of material fact precluded summary judgment on retaliation claim. Plaintiff’s motion granted in part, and defendant’s motion denied. Attorneys and Law Firms *253 James Elmer Rocap, III, Damon J. Kalt, Nina Shishir Thanawala, Steptoe Johnson LLP, Frederick V. Mulhauser, Jennifer A. Wedekind, Arthur B. Spitzer, American Civil Liberties Union of the Nation’s Capital, Washington, DC, for Plaintiff.
First of all, this Court’s decision is well within the scope of the issues that were presented in the pleadings and cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff’s complaint brings claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”) that are based on Defendant’s alleged failure to provide accommodations to Plaintiff—who is profoundly deaf—in accordance with the requirements of those statutes. (See Compl., ECF No. 1, 1, 9, 15, 49, 50.)
At summary judgment, Plaintiff repeatedly argued that Defendant had an “affirmative” obligation to provide accommodations for Plaintiff under the ADA and the RA. (See Pl.’s Mem.","The ACLU filed this lawsuit against the D.C. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of an inmate who was denied meaningful access to prison services and intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his disability in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The inmate claimed that he was placed in solitary confinement because prison employees were responding to his repeated requests for an interpreter and the complaints he had made about the prison’s failure to provide accommodations. The court found that the inmate had not requested an interpreter for his initial disciplinary proceeding, his subsequent request was sufficient to put the MDOC “on notice” of his claim that he could not fully participate in future proceedings without an interpreter, and thus the M DOC could not be heard to contend that the request was limited in scope Id. at 858. (See Pl.’s Stmt. at 11, ECF No. 95-1 for further details on this case)","On November 2, 2012, a deaf inmate of the D.C. Correctional Treatment Facility filed a lawsuit against the District of Columbia Department of Corrections (DOC) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The inmate claimed that the DOC violated his rights by denying him adequate and effective means to communicate with individuals both inside the jail and by telephone with individuals outside the jail. The defendant also retaliated against him for seeking accommodation to which he was entitled. The court granted summary judgment in part, and denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the retaliation claim."

254,JC-GA-0016,"In 1999, inmates at the Foster County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia, who had tested positive for HIV, filed this class action lawsuit against county officials.  The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Center for Human Rights, brought the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  In 2000, the parties reached a settlement agreement that required improved medical care and reduced overcrowding.  ","The Correctional Healthcare Solutions medical staff at the Jail, however, continuously failed to carry out the prescribed treatment plans of the Grady specialists, thereby endangering the lives and health of HIV-positive inmates. On March 1, 1999, Grady Hospital ceased providing treatment to HIV-positive inmates confined at the Fulton County Jail. As a result, the medical staff at the Jail, which had already failed miserably to follow the regimens prescribed by the Grady infectious disease clinic, is now solely responsible for examining HIV-positive inmates and planning and carrying out their treatment regimens.
Defendant Fulton County, Georgia (“the County”), is the governmental unit responsible under state law for properly maintaining, operating, and funding the Jail. As such, the County has a duty to provide medical care to inmates in the care and custody of the Jail. The Fulton County Commission and its members Mike Kenn, Karen Webster, Tom Lowe, Bob Fulton, Emma I.

The named plaintiffs in this case are six inmates currently at the Fulton County Jail (“the Jail”) who are HIV-positive and whose lives are threatened by the denial of minimal medical care to which they are entitled. Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or “HIV”, is a retrovirus identified as the cause of Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome, or “AIDS”.
B. Fulton County and Correctional Healthcare Solutions, Inc., fail to provide HIV-positive inmates at the Fulton County Jail with minimally adequate medical treatment and interfere with treatment already prescribed. Fulton County (“the County”) has chosen to provide medical care, including HIV- related care, to inmates at the Jail by contracting with Correctional Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (“CHS”), a private correctional medical care company. In every aspect of the medical care delivered at the Jail, the Fulton County and CHS defendants have failed disastrously to meet the minimum medical requirements previously outlined.

The experiences of plaintiffs Michael Driver and Terry Clayton are representative of experiences of numerous detainees.

Introduction 1. This case seeks money damages for a class of individuals who were incarcerated in the Marion County correctional system for unreasonable periods of time as a result of the Marion County Sheriff’s practice of instituting a 72 hour release time period and employing unreasonable release procedures and processes. Jurisdiction and Venue 2.
Terry Clayton 32. In December 2014 Terry Clayton was a pretrial detainee in the Marion County Jail awaiting trial. On Wednesday, December 10, 2014, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Mr. Clayton’s jury returned a non-guilty verdict in his favor.
According to Mr. Driver, it was “common knowledge among the inmate population... that the Sheriff took up to seventy-two (72) hours or even longer to release prisoners.” Mr. Clayton was a pretrial detainee at the Jail from May 28, 2014 to December 10, 2014.

ROVNER, Circuit Judge. The plaintiffs in this case brought a class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the policies and practices of the Marion County Sheriff’s Depart- No. 16-4239 ment and the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County (collectively referred to as the “Sheriff”) caused them to be detained in the Marion County Jail awaiting release for an unreasonably long period of time, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought to certify five subclasses in that action, and the district court granted certification as to two of those subclasses, but denied it as to the remaining three.
We granted permission for the interlocutory appeal pursuant to Rule 23(f), and now proceed to the appeal on the merits. We hold that the district court erred in its decision denying class certification and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings. In order to certify a class, “‘a district court must find that each requirement of Rule 23(a) (numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation) is satisfied as well as one subsection of Rule 23(b).’” Harper v. Sheriff of Cook County, 581 F.3d 511, 513 (7th Cir.
The class sought by the plaintiffs consisted of all individuals who, from December 19, 2012 to the present, were victims of the computer issues spawned by OMS. The district court denied certification of the subclass because it held that the class was not “identifiable.” The court noted that the class description must be sufficiently definite to allow ascertainment of the class members Dist.

In the weeks before this lawsuit was filed in the district court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, on April 29, 2005, the jail's population reached a high of 276 prisoners, many of whom were forced to sleep on the floor.  Many of the inmates were awaiting transfer to the Kentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC), which was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.  The KDOC addressed overcrowding at the jail by simply reducing the required floor space for each prisoner from 50 to 40 square feet. This lawsuit, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by attorney Robert B.

Campbell County and Buckler have entered into an agreement with Boone County that will allow the Detention Center to lodge up to thirty inmates in Boone County’s new jail. The agreement provides that Campbell County will have priority over other counties in considering requests to transfer inmates to the Boone County Jail.

'ItO f. F~':>IOt< :\L CORPORA lJO~ Document 52-6 Filed 09/05/2007 Legal Notice United States District Court for the District of New Jersey NOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND HEARING If You Entered the Camden County Correction Facility from April 8, 2003 to April 27, 2005 And Were Strip Searched, Then Your Rights Could Be Affected By A Proposed Class Action Settlement. The United States District Court for the District ofNew Jersey authorized this notice. It is not from a lawyer.

You are not being sued.

This is a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging that corrections officers employed at the Camden County Correctional Facility engaged in the practice of illegally strip searching all individuals charged with non-indictable or minor offenses upon their entry into the Camden County Correctional Facility from April 8, 2003 until April 27, 2005.

The proposed settlement does not include individuals who were charged with indictable offenses at the time of their admission to the Camden County Correctional Facility, or who were not strip searched when they entered the Correctional Facility. The Proposed Settlement also addresses the alleged practice of Camden County in unlawfully detaining many members of the settlement class after they posted bail in the City of Camden. One benefit of the settlement to class members is that each class member will be entitled to an equal share of a $7.5 million settlement fund, after payment of administrative costs, incentive awards to the representative plaintiffs, and attorneys' fees.

This package explains the lawsuit, the settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are available, who is eligible for them and how to get them. The Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Camden Vicinage, United States District Judge Joseph Rodriguez presiding. The case is called Hicks v. County of Camden, Index No. 05-CV-1857 (JHR).

The Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendants. Instead, both sides agreed to a settlement. That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people affected will get compensation.

WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE? Defendants have agreed to pay $7,500,000 to resolve this litigation. That money will be used to: I) compensate Class Members who have been illegally strip searched; 2) pay for notifying Class Members and administering the settlement; 3) pay incentive awards to the named Plaintiffs, Laverne Hicks and Michael Velez; and 4) pay attorneys' fees and expenses.

If you meet the criteria explained below, you can share in this settlement.

The settlement also provides additional payments for individuals arrested in the City of Camden, New Jersey, on minor charges and detained by the Camden County Department of Corrections for more than twelve hours. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey authorized this notice. The Court will have a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement so that the benefits may be paid.

What's This About? The lawsuit claimed that Defendant Camden County and its Corrections Officers had an unlawful practice of strip searching everyone who was admitted into the Camden County Correctional Facility. The lawsuit also claimed that Camden County was unlawfully detaining individuals who posted bail after they were arrested in the City of Camden.

Defendants deny they did anything wrong.

Based on data received from Camden County, Class Counsel estimates the class size here to be 24,000 individuals. Individuals who were admitted to the Camden County Correctional Facility on more than one occasion will only be allowed to file one claim against the settlement fund. When considering the claims rates achieved in similar settlements, Class Counsel estimates that each member of the settlement class that files a claim will receive between $750 and $1,250 as a settlement payment.

263,JC-NY-0034,"This case was brought by a woman who was arested, subjected to excessive force and a strip/cavity search all on the basis of a false complaint filed by a family member. A jury awarded her $19,645 in compensatory damages and $5,000,000 in punitive damages. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the punitive damages award as not available against municipalities, and reduced the compensatory damages award because Plaintiff had been offered slightly more as settlement.","United States District Court, S.D.

Jane Does 1 and 2 then ordered Ms. Ciraolo, who was naked, to squat and cough, which she did. They thereby subjected her to a body cavity search. 41: At no time between her arrest, and her release the next day, did any of the defendants inform Ms. Ciraolo of her Miranda rights or of what she had been arrested for.
On March 19, 1997, Ms. Ciraolo and her counsel made their third appearance in Criminal Court. The Court dismissed the complaint against Ms. Ciraolo. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Defendant Morgillo and Municipal Defendants and Defendant Fontanella --False Arrest) 47.
No probable cause existed for defendant Fontanella’s commencement of a criminal proceeding against plaintiff. The proceeding terminated in plaintiff’s favor. Upon information and belief, defendant Fontanella acted with actual malice towards Ms. Ciraolo.
In doing so, the court told the jury to consider whether compensatory damages would be adequate to punish the City and to deter future unlawful conduct. The jury found in favor of the defendants on Ciraolo's claims of unlawful arrest, excessive force, and battery. It concluded, however, that the City had acted in wanton disregard of Ciraolo's rights when she was strip-searched, and awarded her $5,000,000 in punitive damages, as well as $19,645 in compensatory damages.
In Newport, a musical concert promoter, Fact Concerts, Inc., brought suit against the City of Newport, Rhode 239 Island, under § 1983 for a violation of its First Amendment rights.

Shortly before the festival, Fact Concerts hired the group Blood, Sweat and Tears to replace an act that had dropped out.
at 253, 101 S.Ct. The Supreme Court reversed the award of punitive damages. See id.
Indeed, the case before us shows especially vividly the possible utility of such socially compensatory damages. Here, the City of New York adopted a strip-search policy that it knew or clearly should have known was unconstitutional. Counsel for the City estimated at trial that about 65,000 people arrested for misdemeanors had been subjected to strip searches under the policy.
Although the charges against her were later dismissed, Plaintiff was traumatized by the experience and subsequently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Plaintiff brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against New York City, the NYPD, and the individual officers involved in her case, claiming that she had been falsely arrested, that the police had employed excessive force, and that the strip search violated her Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. Plaintiff also alleged a state law claim of battery.

The City’s blanket strip search policy is clearly unreasonable under the standards enunciated in Bell.3 As an initial mater, this issue has already been addressed by the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In Newkirk, Senior Judge Van Antwerpren assessed the constitutionality of strip search policies at the Schuylkill County Prison. The detainees in question were post-arraignment detainees who were subjected to strip searches upon admission to a local jail because they could not, or would not, make bail.

She was strip-searched before being placed into detention. She argued that PPS’s policy of strip-searching all pretrial detainees upon admission was unconstitutional. The complaint named the City, the PPS, the Prisons Commissioner, members of the Prisons’ Board of Trustees and three of the prison’s Deputy Commissioners as defendants.
The parties also stipulated to a discovery and briefing schedule with respect to class certification. The Court denied both parties’ summary judgment motions without prejudice and held that the parties would have the opportunity to renew their motions after the issue of class certification was resolved. In response to the City’s argument that the search of Ms. Boone was reasonable based upon her criminal history, the plaintiff amended the complaint to add class representative George Byrd Mr. Byrd was charged with driving under the influence when admitted to the prison.
At the hearing, the City informed the Court that it was preparing procedures for the use of equipment that would be used in lieu of strip-searching. In view of the City’s proposed change in policy, the Court referred the matter to Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Hey for settlement. Negotiations began in July of 2007.
In Bell, a federal shortterm custodial facility had a policy to strip-search all pretrial detainees after a contact visit with an outside visitor. The Court found that, under the circumstances, the strip-searches conducted under the policy were not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. See id.

267,JC-PA-0032,"Plaintiff, a county jail inmate who suffered scarring and isolation from multiple MRSA infections was successful in obtaining a settlement against county defendants for their alleged failure to implement appropriate quarantine protocols and correct medical care, and for maintaining unsanitary conditions at the jail.","Date Filed: 01/22/2009 Date Terminated: 03/18/2010 Jury Demand: Defendant Nature of Suit: 555 Prison Condition Jurisdiction: Federal Question ANTHONY FERNANDEZ
COMPLAINT Plaintiff, Anthony Fernandez, by counsel, Gerald J. Williams, Esquire, Williams Cuker Berezofsky, brings this suit to recover for violations of his federal and state civil rights, as follows: PARTIES 1. Plaintiff, Anthony Fernandez, is a current inmate at the Northampton County Prison (hereinafter, ""NCP"") in Easton, Northampton County, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; he was incarcerated at NCP on or about December 31, 2006 and remains there at the present time. While incarcerated at NCP, Mr. Fernandez has been and is completely dependent upon Defendants for his care and well-being.
FACTUAL ALLEGAnONS ON THE MERITS 10. Northampton County Prison (""NCP"") has a history of inhumane conditions and recklessly indifferent administration and staffing. As a result, the prison has become a breeding ground for disease.
Some showers had pipes coming out of the walls, missing tiles and feces on the walls. The shower water was dirty. Many showers had no hot water, did not work properly and had too many inmates using them at one time (i.e. seven [7] to thirteen [13] inmates used a six [6] man shower all at the same time).
When inmates pressed the issue of wanting to shower, they faced being written up and taken to lock down (the ""Hole"") by the guards or commanding officer. Many inmates were afraid to use the toilets because of the unsanitary conditions. Many toilets leaked.
Due to overcrowding, thirty (30) inmates at a time, sleeping on the floor in plastic ""boats"", were housed in the ""Gym"" with access to only one (1) toilet and two (2) showers, and eight (8) inmates were in one (1) cell with one (1) toilet and one (1) small sink.
As a result of Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff suffered the embarrassment, immense pain, bumps and scarring associated with contracting multiple cases of MRSA. Plaintiff was subjected to the unsanitary conditions ofthe prison and its medical unit, including but not limited to defendants' failures to provide sufficient antibacterial soap for plaintiffs personal use, preventing him from properly cleaning himself to prevent contracting diseases such as MRSA. The prison medical staff, including defendants, knew and/or reasonably should have known that Plaintiff was at risk of contracting a staph infection, but they were deliberately indifferent to this risk, failing to protect Plaintiff by housing him with a MRSA positive inmate, Mr. Rios and/or allowing Plaintiff to determine the location of proper isolation i.e., ""The Hole"" rather than assure that he was isolated and treated in a properly sanitized cell that would provide for a safe environment both for Plaintiff to heal and to prevent him from developing future MRSA outbreaks.

The PrimeCare Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of failing and/or refusing to generate, maintain, and/or preserve accurate medical records.
Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of failing and/or refusing to provide adequate and necessary medical treatment to inmates. Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of failing to adequately treat inmates who require medical care. Defendants have acted with deliberate indifference toward Plaintiff s medical needs and well-being, in that they knew of the substantial risk of serious harm to Plaintiff and they ignored that risk.
This deprivation of rights was the plainly obvious consequence of the County's failure to adequately and properly investigate and scrutinize the backgrounds of administrators and medical providers. It was the policy, practice and/or custom of Northampton County to inadequately and improperly investigate complaints regarding constitutional violations at the Prison (including complaints concerning inadequate medical care and inhumane prison conditions), and such violations were instead tolerated by the County. It was the policy, practice and/or custom of Northampton County to inadequately supervise and train its administrators and medical providers, including those identified herein, thereby failing to adequately discourage further constitutional violations on the part of these officials.

Defendant’s case fits this description. On March 23, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that correctional and detention facilities “present[] unique challenges for control of COVID-19 transmission among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and visitors.”
Civil Action No. TDC-20-0780 MEMORANDUM OPINION Petitioners Mauricio Coreas and Angel Guzman Cedillo (“Guzman Cedillo”), currently in immigration detention, have filed this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 against Respondents Donna Bounds, Warden of the Worcester County Detention Center in Snow Hill, Maryland; Jack Kavanaugh, Director of the Howard County Detention Center in Jessup, Maryland; Janean Ohin, the Acting Baltimore Field Office Director for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); Matthew T. Albence, Deputy Director and Senior Official performing the duties of the Director of ICE; and ICE. Pending before the Court is Petitioners’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), seeking their immediate release in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Motion is fully briefed, and the Court held a video hearing on the Motion on April 2, 2020.
Yet, the current conditions of confinement fail to protect Petitioners and pretrial detainees from the increased risk of COVID19. Defendants have not implemented social distancing practices at ACJ. See supra § pp.
Allegheny County is a home rule county organize and existing under the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Allegheny County operates the Allegheny County Jail. Orlando Harper is the Warden of the Allegheny County Jail.
Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction on April 9, 2020, asking this Court to, inter alia, require that Defendants instituting policies and reasonable accommodations, consistent with the CDC’s public health guidelines to protect people incarcerated at the Allegheny County Jail from COVID-19. After numerous discussions, the parties have reached an agreement on the policies and reasonable accommodations that the Allegheny County Jail will follow to protect people from COVID-19. Accordingly, the parties are jointly submitting a proposed consent order that, if approved by the Court, will resolve the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.
Because the Defendants are being directed, and have agreed, to implement the Policy as described in paragraph 2 above, this Order therefore resolves the Plaintiffs’ claim for preliminary injunctive relief with respect to their request that the Court order the Defendants to institute policies to protect the Plaintiffs from COVID-19 that are informed by guidelines from the CDC and other public health organizations. This Order, however, does not resolve the Plaintiffs’ claims that the Defendants violated their rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 7.

The plaintiff has not yet filed a motion to certify class.,"Plaintiff John Doe is a citizen of the State of Tennessee and a resident ofDavidson County, Tennessee. He is a former inmate who was housed in the Defendant's facility in Davidson County. Plaintiff wishes to use the pseudonym ""John Doe"" because he fears retaliation.
CoreCivic's registered agent for process in the State of Tennessee is C T Corporation System, 800 S. Gay St., Suite 2021, Rnoxville, TN 37929-9710. The Defendant owns and operates the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility, housing prisoners sentenced to confinement in the Tennessee Department of Correction. As such, CCA performs a public function traditionally reserved to the state and is therefore subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7.
This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claims pursuant to 28 10. All of the claims alleged herein arose in the Middle District of Tennessee, and Venue is therefore proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. ALLEGATIONS OF FACT 11.
The Defendant refused to provide access to doctors and necessary medicine to treat the scabies infestation of the inmate population, during which time the infestation spread and the Plaintiff class's condition worsened. In the Winter and Spring of 2017, there was a scabies outbreak in the Defendant's 1,300bed jail facility in Nashville, Tennessee. The outbreak spread through various facilities in and around Nashville, Tennessee, which infested inmates, detainees, and those likely to come in contact with them, including court staff in Davidson County.
Numerous inmates developed a visible red rash on their bodies consistent with scabies infestation. They frequently complained about their condition, filing numerous sick calls and grievances, all of which were ignored by the Defendant. Several inmates in Plaintiffs bunk area played cards with inmate C.M., who had the rash on his hands.
He complained generally about the screening procedure, including the reason he was not given a TB test. The Defendant stated that Plaintiff would be provided with a TB test, which never happened. The Defendant falsely informed Plaintiff that the rash was caused by contact dermatitis, a reaction to the water, or ""something in the laundry.""
Because Plaintiffs initial request for medical attention was ignored, he filed a sick call request in November of 2016.
He complained that the itching would not stop. Because the Defendant refused to address the Plaintiffs medical needs. Plaintiff asked a friend to download the ""WebMD"" Internet page describing scabies.
Plaintiff began working as a tmstee in December of 2016. His job was to assist with the maintenance of and repairs to the Defendant's facility. In furtherance of his work, Plaintiff moved around the pods for both the male and female populations.
He observed individuals in every pod who had symptoms of the scabies rash and were openly complaining about a scabies infestation. Plaintiff was concerned about the Defendant's failure to provide medical treatment. He feared that he would spread it to other areas of the prison.
The employee informed Plaintiff that, because the building belonged to Metro and CoreCivic only leased the premises, they only needed to perform the bare minimum repairs in order to temporarily fix a problem. The employee explained that the Defendant did not want to spend money on the repairs. Like Plaintiff, inmate D.B.
Inmate J.N. is housed at the Defendant's facility. He frequently complained about the rash over his body.
His mother informed the Defendant that her son's rash appeared to be scabies, which the Defendant denied. In response to his requests for medical attention and complaints, the Defendant threatened J.N. instead of providing treatment.
Because he was unable to sleep and constantly suffered from the itching, J.N.
These officials had knowledge of the Plaintiffs' asserted serious needs, or were aware of the circumstances clearly indicating the existence of such needs, or subjectively perceived a risk of harm, but then disregarded it by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. The Defendant refused to provide Plaintiff with his prescription medication. The Defendant retaliated against other inmates, including inmate J.N., for requesting medical treatment.
By virtue of the special relationship of the state-imposed custodial setting, the Defendant was under an affirmative obligation to spend its resources to protect Plaintiff and members of the class from harm. The Defendant had exclusive control over the movement and placement of inmates in its custody. The Defendant knowingly and intentionally transferred infested inmates into the crowded cells of healthy inmates, placing them in close proximity to a dangerous contagion.

272,JC-TX-0023,"A deaf prisoner of the El Paso County jails sued the County in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas for their failure to accommodate his disability. He was held for eleven days without access to an attorney or an interpreter, in violation of the Americans With disabilities Act ans Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. A private settlement was reached in July 2012 which, according to reports, required installation of videophones in the County jails.  We have no further information about this case.","No. EP-11-CV-0389 PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT Plaintiff Jose Luis Rodriguez complains of Defendant County of El Paso for its failure to reasonably accommodate his disability and, in support thereof, states as follows: STATEMENT OF CLAIMS 1. Plaintiff Jose Luis Rodriguez, a deaf man, files this petition against Defendant County of El Paso because it failed and refused to reasonably accommodate him by not making its services accessible to individuals with hearing disabilities. These failures constitute discrimination against him and those like him in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §12131 et seq. (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. §794 (“Section 504”), and Chapter 121 of the Texas Human Resources Code, TEX HUM RES.
CODE §121.001, et seq. (“Chapter 121”). Mr. Rodriguez seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, actual damages, attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, and costs as redress from Defendant County of El Paso for their unlawful discrimination based on his disability. Almost twenty years after the passage of the ADA, Defendant discriminates against people with disabilities by failing to provide access to its services, programs, and activities.
Before being detained, Mr. Rodriguez made three or four emergency requests for an interpreter on paper. The officers ignored his requests. The officers did not present any papers to Mr. Rodriguez or to Mr. Chavez, and they did not write down Mr. Rodriguez’ Miranda rights.
When it was Mr. Rodriguez’ turn for an interview, Mr. Rodriguez asked again for an interpreter. His requests were ignored. He then asked if the officers could remove his handcuffs, so that he would have an easier time communicating with them by writing notes.
Defendant’s conduct limited Mr. Rodriguez’ ability to arrange for his release and assert his rights in the criminal process initiated against him. El Paso County is therefore in violation of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Chapter 121 for failure to reasonably accommodate Mr. Rodriguez. CAUSES OF ACTION I.
Nonetheless, she did not provide him with reasonable accommodations during his arraignment and subjected him to discrimination in the provision of services, programs, and activities on the basis of his disability. Defendant did not provide Mr. Rodriguez with reasonable accommodations at either the Downtown Detention Facility or Annex Jail and subjected him to discrimination in the provision of its services, programs, and activities on the basis of his disability. The officers ignored his requests for an interpreter, preferring instead to communicate by passing short notes that did not allow Mr. Rodriguez to understand the terms of his arrest and detention.
El Paso County’s refusal to make accommodations for hearing-impaired individuals denies Plaintiff and others the opportunity to communicate because of their disability.
Therefore, El Paso County discriminates against Plaintiff as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 12132. As a result of Defendant’s intentional discrimination, Plaintiff suffered compensatory damages. For these reasons, Plaintiff is entitled to relief under the ADA II.
§ 121.003(d)(2)-(3). Defendant failed to provide auxiliary aids and services necessary to accommodate Mr. Rodriguez’ disabilities. For the reasons described above, Defendant failed to make reasonable accommodations for Mr Rodriguez.
By denying Mr. Rodriguez access to the services of the sheriff’s department, detention facilities, and the courts in the same manner as non-disabled persons, the Defendant violated his rights pursuant to Chapter 121.
Unless injunctive relief is granted, Mr. Rodriguez and similarly situated individuals with disabilities may continue to experience unlawful discrimination because of Defendant El Paso County’s failure and refusal to comply with Section 504, the ADA, and Chapter 121.
Defendant fails to make its facilities accessible to individuals with hearing impairments. By choosing not to comply with federal and state accessibility laws, the Defendant has willfully discriminated against Plaintiff. Defendant’s denial of Plaintiff’s rights has prevented Plaintiff from accessing the services at El Paso County court hearings, the Downtown Detention Facility, and at the Annex Jail.

274,JI-FL-0008,"Three minors represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Florida Justice Institute, Inc., and Florida Legal Services, filed suit on September 4, 2019 in the Northern District of Florida against the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). Plaintiffs sought class action certification to represent children subject to solitary confinement in DJJ-run detention centers. The defendant's summary judgment motion on the merits was denied on December 6, 2019, and the case is in ongoing mediation talks.","Subjecting children to solitary confinement and depriving them of even minimal meaningful social interaction can cause trauma, depression, and anxiety, increase the risk of suicide and self-harm, and permanently interfere with children’s development. Despite these well-known risks of serious harm, the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) isolates thousands of children in solitary confinement every year. The risk of harm for children begins immediately when they are isolated in solitary confinement.
The named Plaintiffs, and the class they seek to represent, are, or will be, subject to solitary confinement, in one of the 21 DJJ-operated secure detention centers (Secure Detention) throughout the state. They bring this action to address the violations of their rights. DJJ, through policy and practice, subjects children to solitary confinement, often the same child repeatedly, without any time limit, to manage their behavior as a first response to any situation.
Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the class they seek to represent (hereafter collectively “Plaintiffs”), bring this action to redress the violations of their civil, statutory, and constitutional rights by Defendants while acting under color of state law. Plaintiffs challenge Defendants’ statewide policy and practice of using solitary confinement in Secure Detention where children are isolated from others in a locked cell with no meaningful social interaction, environmental stimulation, outdoor recreation, schooling, or property.
Without judicial intervention, these children will continue to suffer from the physical and psychological harm from solitary confinement. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring Defendants to cease the challenged unlawful policies and practices. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 9.

Hawai’i, Civil No. (D. Haw) (referred to herein as the “litigation” or the “lawsuit”). This litigation concerned conditions of confinement at the Hawai’i Youth Correctional Facility (“HYCF”) in Kailua, Hawai’i, and was brought pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (“Section 14141”). (B) From October 5, 2004 to October 8, 2004, the United States toured HYCF with a consultant in the field of juvenile justice.
(E) In order to resolve all claims in the litigation, including the protection from harm, access to medical and mental health care, and special education claims, the parties have entered into this Agreement, which, if complied with by State of Hawai’i (“State”) officials within the time frames specified below, will result in the lawsuit remaining dismissed and the filing of a joint stipulation for final dismissal with prejudice. (F) The terms of this Agreement shall apply to HYCF. If the State closes HYCF and transfers youth to a state-run facility substantially similar to HYCF or, without closing HYCF transfers all girls or 20 or more youth to another state-run facility which provides services substantially similar to HYCF, the applicable and relevant terms of this Agreement will also apply to the new state-run facility.
The Agreement may also end earlier than three years from the Effective Date of the Agreement if the State has substantially complied with each of the provisions of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance for at least two years. If the DOJ agrees that the State has maintained such compliance, the parties shall file a joint stipulation to dismiss with prejudice. If DOJ does not agree that the State has maintained such compliance, the burden shall be on the State to demonstrate this level of compliance.

The Eighth Circuit overturned the District Court's ruling, holding that the search of the named plaintiff did not violate the Fourth Amendment. On remand, the parties reached a monetary settlement before having to relitigate the case.","For the reasons stated below, the Motion to Compel is granted, subject to a protective order, on the condition that Plaintiff first obtain release of the records from the Circuit COllrt of Minnehaha County. BACKGROUND Plaintiff alleges that her civil rights were violated at the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center (JDC). According to the Complaint, Plaintiff and three ofher minor friends were taken into custody on August 8, 1999, after Sioux Falls policemen found them out after the city's 11 :00 p.m. curfew for children under the age of eighteen.
CONCLUSION As a result ofthe above rulings, four classes will be certified by the Court. There will be two classes involving minors who were strip searched, one for injunctive reliefand one for compensatory and punitive damages. Minors who were strip searched and were charged with the four minor offenses as defined in the Court's prior certification order, which includes petty theft, liquor violations, being a runaway and curfew violations, will be members of the classes if they were charged from November 1, 1997 to a date in the future to be set by the Court.
The four teenagers were taken to the JDC where they were questioned about their religious beliefs and practices, individually ordered into a bathroom, and strip searched. The IDC had a policy ofconducting visual strip searches ofall minors regardless ofthe type ofoffense they were arrested for or whether there was reason to believe that the minors had weapons or contraband. The JDC also had a policy of questioning juvenile detainees about their religious beliefs fu'1d practices.
The class period began on November I, 1997, as to minor offenses and on April 16,1999, as to non-felony offenses. The strip search of the Plaintiff was conducted on August 9, 1999. Although the Court has not yet set the ending date for the class period, the Court has been advised that the strip search policy was changed as of December 31, 2003.

The plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment on their Fourth Amendment claim, arguing that the undisputed facts established that the policy of strip-searching all juveniles without individualized suspicion was a violation of clearly established constitutional law. The district court denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The court concluded that the JDe's written search policy in effect in August 1999 was unconstitutional and that the subsequent changes to the policy did not cure the constitutional defects.

Myers Division. The case was filed in May 2004 and challenges the constitutional adequacy of the mental health treatment and sex offender treatment provided at the Florida Civil Commitment Center. In August 2005, the Court certified two subclasses: (1) residents of the FCCC who (a) have been civilly committed to custody pursuant to §394.917, Fla.

The lawyers for Plaintiffs and Defendant Sheldon have agreed to settle this lawsuit. DCF has been making changes at FCCC since the lawsuit was filed in 2004.
Both Pl aintiffs and Defendant filed pre-trial motions seeking to limit or exclude certain areas of expert testimony. The parties report that in early June 2009 they began discussions to resolve this case. These discussions included several detailed conference calls, an extensive in-person meeting, and written exchanges.
The motion included a letter of commitment from Defendant Sheldon and the proposed final action plan. The Court granted the motion, removed the case from the trial calendar, and gave the parties 60 days to file a motion seeking approval of a settlement. (Doc.

The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants failed to provide adequate and meaningful health treatment to the plaintiffs and those similarly situated and the treatment and care that was given was punitive and Constitutionally inadequate.  In 2005, Judge Leinenweber granted the plaintiffs’ demand for declaratory relief concerning the previous Special or Secure Management Status (“SMS”) used at the Joliet Treatment and Detention Facility (the “TDF”) stating that it was unconstitutional; however all of the plaintiffs’ remaining claims were denied including the claim of inadequate treatment.","This complaint asserts a civil rights action pursuant to Title 42 of the United States Code, § 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief to redress violations of the United States Constitution in connection with the complete and utter failure of the Defendants or those acting under their control or direction to provide adequate and meaningful mental health treatment to the named Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated that have been involuntarily detained by the Illinois Department of Human Services (""DHS"") pursuant to the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 ILCS 207/1 et al. (the ""SVP Act""). The avowed purposed of the SVP Act is to provide mental health treatment and care to individuals in the custody of DHS in the least restrictive manner consistent with the person's needs and in accordance with the court's commitment order.


Defendants erect one arbitrary barrier after another to prevent Plaintiffs from progressing to the point where the SVP program will recommend their release, including requiring participants in the program to confess to crimes which they did not commit. The Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated are being held in conditions that are more restrictive than the conditions under which the Plaintiffs were confined when they were incarcerated as criminals prior to their civil commitment under the Act.

INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs, JEFFERY HARGETT, KIM OVERLIN, JIMMIE SMITH and LOREN WALKER, have been civilly committed to the custody of the Illinois Department of Human Services (""DHS"") pursuant to the Illinois Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 ILCS A). Plaintiffs claim that they have ""never received adequate treatment or treatment that might yield a realistic chance for [their] release.""
Plaintiffs also request a permanent injunction against Defendants compelling them to implement a plan correcting the alleged constitutional deficiencies in the current program. Defendants now move to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. DISCUSSION Standard *2 In ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court must construe all well-pleaded allegations of the complaint as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.
i\NSWER: Defendants deny the allegations of paragraph 26. The Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated are being held in conditions that are more restrictive than the conditions under which the Plaintiffs were confined when they were incarcerated as criminals prior to their civil commitment under the i\ct. These conditions are unrelated to the security or treatment needs of the SVP population and are purely punitive in nature.
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER LEINENWEBER, J.
INTRODUCTION *1 The Plaintiffs, individuals who have been civilly committed under the Illinois Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 ILCS 207/1et seq. (the “SVP Act”), brought this suit on behalf of themselves and a class of all other similarly situated individuals challenging the conditions of confinement and quality of treatment at the Joliet Treatment and Detention Facility (the “TDF”). The Defendants are the Director of the Illinois Department of Human Services and various officials at the TDF. Under the SVP Act, an individual who has been convicted (or found not guilty by reason of insanity) of a sexually violent offense may be detained indefinitely at the TDF if he is found to suffer from a “mental disorder that makes it substantially probable that [he] will engage in acts of sexual violence.

Plaintiffs' Status Defendants voluntarily modified their practices and procedures at the facilities in question before the bench trial. Thereafter, the Court entered judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims except one, and awarded solely declaratory relief on the remaining claim. The Court's judgment did not require modification of Defendants' behavior, nor did it materially alter the legal relationship between the parties.
The parties need not incur any additional costs or time briefing this matter. Defendants' Motion is granted insofar as the Court finds that Plaintiffs are not a ""prevailing party"" for purposes of fees. Defendants' and Plaintiffs' motions for Bill of Costs are denied.

The district court found that the Commonwealth violated provisions of the federal Medicaid Act by failing to provide home-based services to thousands of children across the state. In 2007, the district court approved a remedial plan intended to restructure the children’s mental health system by incorporating intensive home-based services, including behavioral health screenings, assessments, case management, crisis intervention and in-home therapeutic supports. It also appointed a monitor to oversee implementation and compliance. The parties agreed to extend the monitor’s appointment several times, with the final extension expiring on December 31, 2018.

MassHealth will continue its practice of not requiring a primary care visit or EPSDT screening as a prerequisite for an eligible child to receive MassHealth behavioral health services. MassHealth-eligible children and eligible family members can be referred or can self-refer for Medicaid services at any time by another agency, including other EOHHS agencies, state agencies, public schools, community health centers, hospitals and community mental health providers.
(Dkt No. After a hearing on the issue, Defendant agreed to provide the services at issue to the entire Plaintiff class. Defendant, noting that no court-ordered relief issued following the hearing, now argues that the dispute “was not calculated to, and did not, lead to any tangible betterment” for the Plaintiff class.
First, the remedial order in this case arose from an explicit finding of a violation of federal law, anchored on evidence presented in a multi-week trial, and never appealed. This case does not involve a consent decree. The court found that Defendants failed to comply with the “reasonable promptness” provision of the Medicaid statute in providing EPSDT services.
When, following issuance of a consent decree, the compliance rate stalled at roughly 87%, United States District Judge Robert E. Keeton held the defendant Commissioner in contempt and imposed a fine of $100 per applicant for delays above thirty days and another $100 for each sixty-day period thereafter. The defendants appealed, and the First Circuit affirmed, holding that the defendants had failed to demonstrate substantial compliance with the decree. The court observed that “no particular percentage of compliance can be a safe-harbor figure,” adding that “‘substantiality’ must depend on the circumstances of each case, including the nature of the interest at stake and the degree to which noncompliance affects that interest.”
See Rosie D v. Romney, 410 F. Supp. The court sought filings from the parties as to appropriate remedial orders. In 2007, the district court issued a final judgment, in the form of an injunction, largely adopting the Commonwealth's proposed remedial plan.
We do not decide whether the Plaintiffs are prevented on remand from moving, under the Rules, for the district court to incorporate a timeliness standard for the provision of ICC services into the Judgment. The denial by the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings. No costs are awarded.

The case is ongoing.","They illustrate the urgency of our findings. Thousands of Mississippi residents with mental illness or developmental disabilities are institutionalized. While confined in these institutions, they are segregated from non-disabled persons and lead lives of limited choice or independence.
Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597. We conclude that the State of Mississippi fails to provide services to qualified individuals with disabilities, including mental illness and developmental disabilities, in the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs, in violation of the ADA. This has led to the needless and prolonged institutionalization of adults and children with disabilities who could be served in more integrated settings in the community with adequate services and supports.
Every day, hundreds of adults with mental illness are unnecessarily and illegally segregated in Mississippi's state-run psychiatric hospitals or are at serious risk of entering these institutions. They enter and remain in these isolating institutions because the State of Mississippi (""the State"") has failed to provide them sufficient community-based mental health services.

Rather, as plaintiff notes, her disability is Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
Preliminary Statement Plaintiff has sued Defendants Hunter College of the City of New York (“Hunter”), Jennifer Raab and Eija Ayvarainen (collectively “Defendants”) under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (“FHA”), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA” or “Title II”), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehab Act” or § 504) for illegally evicting her from dormitory housing because of her disability. Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief under all three statutes and money damages under the Rehab Act. The Rehab Act, enacted pursuant to Congress’ Article I Spending Power, explicitly states that States which accept federal funds waive their Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity in suits for money damages.
LaPorta v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 163 F. Supp. Plaintiff also argues that the College’s suicide policy has a disparate impact on people with mental illnesses. Plaintiff fails to state a claim under a disparate impact theory, because she has not alleged that this policy disproportionately affects dormitory residents who have a mental illness.
The Eleventh 17 Amendment provides in pertinent part that “[t]he judicial power 18 of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any 19 suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of 20 the United States by Ccitizens of another Sstate.” U.S. Const. 21 amend XI.

She was offered dormitory housing at all of the colleges and scholarships at all of the SUNY colleges. Hunter College accepted Ms. Doe into its Honors Program. Hunter College does not offer dormitory housing to all of its students.
In a telephone conference with the Court on September 7, 2004, Plaintiff renewed her motion for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order. By order dated September 10, 2004, the Court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the parties to submit memoranda addressing the need for a preliminary injunction. On or about November 2004, attorneys for Plaintiff inquired about the procedure for Plaintiff Doe to reapply for dormitory residence for the Fall Semester.
Unlike students that do not have a disability or a record of disability, or are not regarded as having a disability, Doe is subject to eviction upon two weeks notice for failure to comply with these conditions. Although the imposition of these conditions constitutes further discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehab Act, in order to obtain readmission to the dormitory, Plaintiff signed the agreement on January 28, 2005.
Plaintiff Doe was allowed to move back into the Dormitory on January 29th, 2005. The parties agreed that by signing the agreement, Doe did not waive any rights under the Fair Housing Act, the Rehabilitation Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act. 54. Since January 29, 2005, although Ms. Doe has been in the dormitory and has complied with the conditions, she continues to suffer negative effects from her previous eviction.

The plaintiff alleged that the Transportation Security Administration violated the Freedom of Information Act for wrongfully withholding its records about electronic device searches. The TSA ultimately provided a letter stating it does not conduct device searches, and the ACLU agreed to dismiss the case. ","16 COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CASE NO.__________________ INTRODUCTION 1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. §552, 3 to enforce the public’s right to information about the federal government’s searches of electronic 4 devices at airports. Government agencies routinely search travelers’ phones, computers, tablets 5 and other devices, which hold within them vast quantities of information—photographs, emails, 6 text and audio messages, address books—that reveal intimate and deeply personal details of an 7 individual’s life.
But the federal government’s policies on 16 searching electronic devices of domestic air passengers remains shrouded in secrecy. Over two months ago, on December 20, 2017, Plaintiff American Civil Liberties 18 Union of Northern California (“ACLU-NC”), a non-profit civil rights organization, submitted 19 two FOIA requests to Defendant Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) seeking 20 records about policies, procedures, and protocols regarding the search of airplane passengers’ 21 electronic devices; training of relevant personnel related to the search or examination of 22 electronic devices; and equipment used to search, examine, or extract data from electronic 23 devices. Since that time, TSA has provided ACLU-NC with no records.
Each year, the number of searches by CBP has grown: from 5,000 20 searches in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, to 25,000 searches in FY 2016, to 30,000 searches in FY 14. CBP and ICE have published policies regarding their authority to search and seize 23 electronic devices at the border, including airports. CBP requires passengers to provide their 24 devices unlocked or the password or PIN so that an officer can view data contained on the 25 device.
14, 2017, http://nyti.ms/2lj2AE9. CBP claims the authority to conduct warrantless searches of electronic devices at 4 international border crossings without probable cause to support the search. That practice is 5 being challenged by the national ACLU, of which Plaintiff ACLU-NC is an affiliate, as violating 6 the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution.
See Alasaad v. Duke, No. 1:17-cv-117307 DJC (D Mass. filed Sep. Alongside CBP, TSA has also been reported as heightening its screening 9 procedures of domestic passengers’ electronic devices.

This search result is consistent with the facts that screening personnel are required and expected to follow TSA’s security screening procedures, TSA does not search electronic devices for the purpose of examining or extracting electronic content that may be contained on the device, and screening personnel are not provided with any equipment to do so.

Bush in January 2009, and to the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI).  in October 2013, the district court ruled that NSPD 54 is not an agency record at all because it originated with the President or the NSC, and contained clear limits on its use and further dissemination.

The NSA transmitted a letter to EPIC dated October 26, 2009 and signed by Pamela N. Phillips, Chief of the FOIA/PA Office (""NSA Letter 4""). NSA Letter 4 stated that EPIC's FOIA Request had been ""further processed under the provisions of the FOIA.""

Civil Action No. 10-0196 (BAH) MEMORANDUM OPINION Pending before the Court is the partial motion to dismiss by the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and the National Security Council (“NSC”) two of the four claims in the Complaint. These claims stem from a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request that the plaintiff, Electronic Privacy Information Center (“EPIC”), filed with the NSA seeking information related to the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, a multi-agency federal initiative to ensure the security of the nation’s online infrastructure. In this case, the NSA referred part of the plaintiff’s FOIA request to the NSC since a responsive document in the NSA’s possession had originated with the NSC.

The Oregon Natural Desert Association (“ONDA”) argued that this cut-off regulation violated FOIA Id. The district court agreed and awarded attorney’s fees to ONDA Id. On appeal, the agency argued that it should not be liable for ONDA’s attorney’s fees regarding this claim because the claim should have been brought under the APA, not FOIA Id.
National Security Agency, Defendant. Civil Action No. 10–196 (BAH) October 21, 2013 Synopsis Background: Plaintiff brought suit under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), claiming that the National Security Agency (NSA) had wrongfully withheld records that were responsive to FOIA request. The NSA asserted “national security” and other FOIA exemption, and parties cross-moved for summary judgment.

The parties have focused their attention on whether the withholding of records responsive to the plaintiff’s request under exemptions to the FOIA was proper, but such exemptions are irrelevant if the records requested are not “agency records” within the meaning of the FOIA. See
The plaintiff is correct, however, that the defendant improperly narrowed its search for responsive records to the second portion of the plaintiff’s FOIA requests to only those records distributed to the NSA, rather than to all agencies charged with implementing the CNCI. Consequently, the defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part and the plaintiff’s Cross–Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The defendant shall review its search to determine if any records found in that search are responsive to the plaintiff’s FOIA request, conforming its interpretation of that request to the instructions of this Court.
In district court, plaintiff EPIC sought to compel disclosure of NSPD 54 and two related documents under the Freedom of Information Act. The district court ruled that NSPD 54 was not an “agency record” subject to the FOIA. Regarding the two related documents, the court upheld the government’s redactions under Exemptions 1 and 3.
The parties respectfully request that the Court do so. Finally, the parties ask that the case be remanded to the district court. On remand, plaintiff intends to argue that it is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees.

In December 2005, plaintiffs American Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (collectively, “the ACLU”) and the National Security Archive Fund, Inc. (the “Archive”) filed FOIA requests seeking the release of records related to the NSA’s secret surveillance program to intercept, without prior judicial authorization, the telephone and Internet communications of people inside the United States (“the Program”). Jurisdiction and Venue This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action and personal jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(4)(B) and 552(a)(6)(C)(i).
The ACLU requested any DOJ “legal reviews of the program and its legal rationale,” any DOJ audit of the program, and any other records on the constitutionality, legality, and/or propriety of the NSA’s warrantless domestic spying. The ACLU requested expedited processing of its request. The ACLU had grounds for expedited processing because the information sought relates to “a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government’s integrity which affect public confidence,” 28 C.F.R. § 16.5(d)(1)(iv), and because there is “[a]n urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity” by organizations “primarily engaged in disseminating information,” 28 CFR § 16.5(d)(1)(ii).
On December 22, 2005, the Archive filed a FOIA request seeking information about the Program. It filed a FOIA request with the Office of Information and Privacy and the Office of Legal Counsel seeking copies of “[a]ll memoranda, legal opinions, directives or instructions from the Attorney General, Assistant Attorney General, or the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), issued between September 11, 2001, and December 21, 2005, regarding the government’s legal authority for surveillance activity, wiretapping, eavesdropping, and other signals intelligence operations directed at communications to or from U.S citizens. Please include all documents discussing the President’s surveillance authority under the September 2001 congressional use of force resolution as well as the President’s independent ability to authorize signals intelligence activities.”
The letter responded to the ACLU’s request on behalf of the Offices of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General. The letter stated that the Director of Public Affairs decided that the ACLU’s request for expedited processing should be granted. It stated that the request “is being processed at this time,” but provided no information regarding when processing will be completed.

The Defense Department has been detaining Petitioner, a U.S. citizen, since on or around September 14, 2017, after Syrian forces transferred him to U.S custody. See Betsy Woodruff Spencer Ackerman, U.S. Military: American Fighting for ISIS ‘Surrenders’, Daily Beast (Sept.

See Rasul v. Bush, 215 F. Supp. over the case. See Jerome Stevens Pharm., Inc v. Food Drug Admin., 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C Cir.
Both the First Amendment and the common law demand this result. FACTUAL BACKGROUND In May 2018, the D.C. Circuit affirmed this Court’s ruling that the government could not forcibly transfer Petitioner into the custody of a foreign country. See Doe v. Mattis, 288 F. Supp.
Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit Judge HENDERSON. SRINIVASAN, Circuit Judge: This case involves a United States citizen who has been detained by the United States military in Iraq for several months. He seeks release from military custody in a habeas corpus action brought under the pseudonym John Doe.
The government gave the district court the requisite notice of its intent to transfer Doe to that country. The court then enjoined the government from effecting the transfer. In the court’s view, the government had failed to demonstrate the necessary legal authority (specifically, a statute or treaty) for the transfer.
Since September 2014, the United States has pursued a counterterrorism strategy against ISIL, and is an active member of a 75-country coalition working to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria. In October 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, acting on Doe’s behalf, petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition asserts that the military’s existing authority to engage in armed conflict does not extend to ISIL, that the military thus lacks legal authority to detain an alleged member of ISIL, and that, as a result, the government must either prosecute Doe in an Article III court or release him.
In addition to those legal arguments, Doe contends as a factual matter that he is not an ISIL combatant. The district court determined that the ACLU had standing to bring the action on Doe’s behalf. The court ordered the government to give the ACLU access to Doe to ascertain whether he wanted to continue the action Am.
Civil Liberties Union Found v. Mattis, 286 F. Supp. On January 23, the district court granted Doe’s request in part. The court entered a preliminary injunction requiring the government to provide 72 hours’ notice before transferring Doe to any other country.
17, 2018), ECF No. 80. Doe moved for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order to block the proposed transfer. On April 19, 2018, the district court granted the preliminary injunction, barring the government “from transferring [Doe] from U.S.
And for the same reasons it gave when it entered the notice injunction, the court concluded that Doe would be irreparably injured absent an injunction and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed in his favor. The government appealed the second injunction to this court. It then moved for consolidation of the two appeals and expedited treatment, both of which we granted.
Munaf, 553 U.S. at 704. The petitioners in Munaf had “voluntarily traveled” to Iraq, id. at 681, 683, and the petitioner in Wilson, an Army specialist, was stationed in Japan, 354 U.S. at 525-26.
The government emphasized the “limited institutional capabilities of courts in matters of military decision-making in connection with an ongoing conflict.” The Court disagreed with the government. Because “due process demands some system for a citizendetainee to refute his classification,” the Court explained, “the proposed ‘some evidence’ standard [was] inadequate.”
at 8, 15. The Supreme Court vacated this Court’s decision and the preliminary injunction itself. Munaf, 553 U.S. at 705.

The Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit after the federal government removed the individual Plaintiff's name from the Specially Designated Terror List.","Pursuant to the designation, all of Salah’s assets were blocked indefinitely, without a warrant, probable cause of criminal activity, or a hearing. Salah was provided no notice of the charges, no evidence upon which the designation was based, and no opportunity to respond to the charges and evidence. Absent advance approval from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Salah is prohibited from purchasing virtually anything, including food, clothing, and lodging, and it is a crime for any United States citizen, permanent resident, entity organized under U.S. law, or any other person in the United States or its territories to engage in virtually any transaction with Salah, including providing him with food, shelter, clothing, or many medical services―even if they are provided free of charge.
Salah may not work for a living, spend money, or give or accept any donations absent advance approval by OFAC. The restrictions are so onerous that they are practically impossible to comply with.
Salah seeks a declaration that these actions violate the Constitution and federal statutes, and an injunction against their enforcement and ordering his removal from the list of “Specially Designated Terrorists.” AFSC and ADC seek a declaration that the restrictions on their speech violate their First Amendment rights, and the First Amendment rights of ADC’s members, and an injunction against their enforcement as applied to their intended activities.

Plaintiff Muhammad Salah is a citizen and resident of the United States and the State of Illinois. Plaintiff American Friends Service Committee is a national Quaker organization that includes people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace, and humanitarian service. Its headquarters are in Philadelphia, PA, and it has a branch office in Chicago, Illinois.
It sues on behalf of itself and its members, who include residents of Chicago, Illinois. Defendant United States Department of the Treasury is an agency of the United States. Defendant Timothy Geithner is the Secretary of the Treasury, and is authorized by Exec.
Order 12947 to designate persons and entities as “Specially Designated Terrorists.”
Defendants did so without seeking a warrant or any other judicial authorization, and without establishing probable cause. Defendants provided Salah no prior notice regarding its action. The first anyone in his family learned of defendants’ actions was when Salah’s wife was unable to withdraw funds from their bank account and the local bank, not the defendants, informed her of the freeze on assets.
Because the previous license was more than a decade old, contained an expired due date of July 1998, and might be viewed by any prospective employer or bank with skepticism, counsel for Salah in July 2009 requested from OFAC confirmation that SDT-005 remained in effect, or a new license. On September 22, 2009, OFAC revoked Salah’s previous license, SDT-005, and issued a new license, SDT-110. (Exhibit E).
In support thereof, Plaintiffs state: 1. This case was filed on September 5, 2012. On November 5, 2012, the United States gover nment removed Plaintiff Salah’s nam e from the S pecially Designated Nationals List, and accordingly, the governm entally imposed restrictions on his activities upon which the Complaint is based no longer exist.
Defendants not having answere d, Plaintiffs may voluntarily dismiss the case without prejudice. WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs give this notice, dismissing the case without prejudice. Matthew J.

300,NS-IL-0002,"In 2012, the government initiated criminal prosecution of Adel Daoud in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. The government charged Daoud with attempting to damage and destroy a building by means of explosion. In 2013, the government added the charge of soliciting a crime of violence, murder for hire, and witness tampering. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit addressed the tension between the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the evidentiary investigation required by the test laid out in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), for determining the legality of a warrant. The Seventh Circuit reversed the order on June 16, 2014; the defendant appealed the decision to the Supreme Court but cert was denied on February 23, 2015. The underlying criminal case continues.","2 The plaintiffs in the Clapper case were various attorneys and human rights, labor, legal, and media organizations who brought an action for a declaration that § 1881a was unconstitutional and sought an injunction against § 1881aauthorized surveillance. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the plaintiff’s lawsuit for lack of Article III standing. sections that set forth FISA’s notice requirements for electronic surveillance and physical searches, respectfully.
If the government identifies and obtains any additional relevant statements of defendant, as contemplated by Rule 16, it will produce them consistent with its discovery obligations, or will address them promptly with the Court. As such, the defendant’s request should be denied as moot. See, e.g., United States v. Edmond, No. 11 CR 378, 2011 WL 6010261, at *1 (N.D.
This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because, pursuant to FISA, the district court’s ruling constitutes a final order subject to immediate appeal. The district court ordered disclosure of classified FISA application materials based on Section 106 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. § 1806. That section provides that “decisions under [50 U.S.C. § 1806]... granting disclosure of applications, orders, or other materials relating to a surveillance 1 Citations to the Original Electronic Record and Supplemental Record on appeal are designated as “R.” followed by the district court document number.

A court may deviate from this procedure only in the rare case in which the legality of the FISA collection cannot be adjudicated without disclosing portions of the FISA materials to the defense. This is not that case. The district court found that it was “capable” of assessing the legality of the FISA collection ex parte and in camera, and that is what the court should have done.
CONCLUSION For the reasons discussed above, the United States respectfully asks this Court to reverse the district court’s order compelling disclosure to defense counsel of classified FISA applications, orders, and related materials.

The ACLU’s request sought records regarding DOJ’s policy on giving notice to criminal defendants and others against whom it intends to use evidence derived from warrantless surveillance.
The ACLU challenged both the adequacy of the search and the applicability of Exemption 5 to the withheld documents, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on these two issues.
The ACLU’s motion is denied in part to the extent that it seeks summary judgment on the inadequacy of the remaining aspects of the scope and conduct of DOJ’s search. On the issue of whether Exemption 5 applies to the withheld documents, for the reasons explained below, the Court grants the government’s motion for summary judgment. Because the Court could not make a de novo determination of Exemption 5’s applicability to the withheld documents based on the government’s Vaughn submissions, the Court ordered DOJ to produce the documents for in camera review.1 After reviewing the documents in camera, the Court agrees with DOJ that all five may be withheld under Exemption 5.
To the extent that the ACLU’s motion challenges other aspects of DOJ’s search, it is DENIED IN PART. The government’s motion for summary judgment based on the applicability of Exemption 5 to the documents listed in the government’s Vaughn index is GRANTED. The ACLU’s cross-motion on that issue is DENIED.

The parties agreed to pay the ACLU for attorney's fees and costs consensually, as soon as reasonably possible after the dismissal of the case, and for any future costs in connection with any future application to enforce the terms of the settlement.","On November 17, 2016, the ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the National Security Agency (NSA), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) seeking the release of records related to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in the United States. On December 11, 2016, Judge Berman entered an order requiring the defendants to search for and produce documents responsive to the FOIA request and to pay the plaintiffs' attorney's fees and litigation costs reasonably incurred in this case."

This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (“FOIA”), to obtain an order for the production of agency records from Defendant in response to three FOIA requests properly made by Plaintiffs. In the aftermath of September 11, Defendant U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) played a key role in establishing new counterterrorism legal policies.
The policies, which dealt with such subjects as the detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects and the expanded use of surveillance, are of significant public interest because they attempt to balance national security with the protection of civil liberties and compliance with the law.
U.S. Government Defendant Plaintiff The New York Times Company represented by Ian MacDougall The New York Times Company 620 Eighth Avenue, 18th Floor New York, NY 10018 (202)-714-3777 Email: ian.macdougall@nytimes.com TERMINATED: 10/10/2017
PARTIES 4. Plaintiff The New York Times Company publishes The New York Times newspaper and www.nytimes.com.
The New York Times Company is headquartered in this judicial district at 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York. Plaintiff Charlie Savage is a reporter for The New York Times and an employee of The New York Times Company. Defendant U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) is an agency of the federal government that has possession and control of the records that Plaintiffs seek.
DOJ acknowledged the Task Force Request on January 15, 2016. Also on January 15, 2016, DOJ informed Plaintiffs that DOJ was engaged in litigation with the International Counsel Bureau (“ICB”) over FOIA requests submitted by ICB (the “ICB Litigation”) and that the reports at issue in Plaintiffs’ Task Force Request were responsive to the FOIA requests in the ICB Litigation (Int’l Counsel Bureau v. U.S. Dep’t of Def. et al., 13-cv-01591 (JDB) (D.D.C.
A representative for DOJ’s FOIA Office told Plaintiffs that, as a result, he thought DOJ would be able to respond to the Task Force Request by the end of January 2016. In February 2016, ICB voluntarily dismissed its claims against DOJ. On August 8, 2016, DOJ informed Plaintiffs that its Office of Information Policy was still processing the Task Force Request.
DOJ has no lawful basis for declining to release the records requested by Plaintiffs under FOIA. DOJ’s failure to issue a determination in response to the request within the time set by law violated FOIA. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order compelling DOJ to produce the documents sought by the Task Force Request.

Defendant DOJ is subject to FOIA and must therefore release in response to a FOIA request any disclosable records in its possession at the time of the request and provide a lawful reason for withholding any materials as to which it is claiming an exemption. DOJ failed to decide the Bates and FBI ODNI Request and the Bates and FBI DOJ Request within the twenty business days required by FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A). Accordingly, Plaintiffs are deemed to have exhausted their administrative remedies under FOIA.
No federal agency informed the Task Force that it believed that it was necessary or appropriate to national security to use any interrogation practice or technique not listed in the Army Field Manual or currently used by law enforcement. ill particular, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) informed the Task Force that it did not seek to use the enhanced interrogation techniques it had developed after September 11, 2001, to question high­ value detainees. The President has also announced that the United States would no longer use those techniques.
The SA provides that ""[i]n the event the United States Forces detain or arrest persons as authorized by this Agreement or Iraqi law, such persons must be handed over to competent Iraqi authorities within 24 hours from the time of their detention or arrest."" With regard to detainees who were being held by U.S. Forces on the date the SA entered into force, January 1, 2009, the SA provides: ""Competent Iraqi authorities shall issue arrest warrants for [such] persons who are wanted by them.
To do otherwise would restrict ""intelligence activities that are otherwise entirely consistent with U.S. law and policy.

This is a Bivens action brought pursuant Bivens v Six Unknown Federal Agents against Federal Defendants for violation of Plaintiffs' Constitutional First, Fourth and Fifth Amendment Rights. Plaintiffs seek money damages of $1.

Defendant Eric H. Holder is the Attorney General of the United States. Attorney General Holder has ultimate authority over the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (""FBI"") and is responsible for overseeing the FBI participation in National Security and BMTP and can be served at: 555 Fourth St. NW Washington, DC 20530.

INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND FACTS 7. This is an action for monetary relief as a result of the Government's illegal and unconstitutional use of an electronic surveillance program in violation of the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the U.S Constitution.

In addition, this lawsuit challenges and the Plaintiffs sue the Government's expansive acquisition of Plaintiffs' telephone records under Sec 215 of the Patriot Act, 50 USC 1860 and the legality of a secret and illegal scheme to intercept and analyze vast quantities of communications. The NSA's surveillance program is an internal Government computer system used to manage domestic and foreign intelligence collected from electronic service providers. Government officials have indicated this program has been in place for seven years and that it collects records of all communications companies including Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint.

Intrusive and illegal surveillance has directly impacted each Plaintiff The revelation that the Government has been carrying on widespread interception of cellphone communications has impaired Plaintiffs' ability to communicate out of fear their confidential, private, and often privileged communications are being and will be overheard by the surveillance program. The program involves two searches, the bulk collection of metadata and the analysis of that data through querying process.
The Plaintiffs as cellphone subscribers have had their cellphone metadata collected for last seven years and stored for the last five and it will continue to be collected barring judicial or legislative intervention. Plaintiffs' Complaint states a claim that the mass call-tracking program is unlawful under the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendment. Telephony metadata reveals personal details and relationships that most people customarily and justifiably regard as private.

The electronic telephone data the government collects on an ongoing basis is an intangible thing. Independently, the mass call detail records collection program violates the First Amendment. First Amendment rights of freedom of association are burdened when the government seeks to collect the identities of the participants in an expressive association and the fact of communications among them.

The most famous case embracing it is a Supreme Court Case from the Civil Rights era called NAACP v Alabama. In that case the Supreme Court held that it would violate the First Amendment for the NAACP to have to turn over its membership lists in litigation. The right stems from the simple fact that the First Amendment protects the freedom to associate and express political views as a group.

THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT 1. This is a suit for violation of Plaintiffs' Constitutional First, Fourth and Fifth Amendment Rights.
The revelation that the Government has been carrying on widespread interception of cellphone communications has impaired Plaintiffs' ability to communicate out of fear their confidential, private, and often privileged communications are being and will be overheard by the surveillance program. The program involves two searches, the collection of metadata and the analysis of that data through querying process. Plaintiffs as subscribers have had their celiphone metadata collected for last 7 years and stored for the last 5 and it will continue to be collected barring judicial/legislative intervention.
As a direct and proximate result of the intentional and willful actions of the defendants, plaintiffs ask judgment be entered against Defendants each and every one of them. Defendant Clapper authorized the blunt mass meta data collection policy. Each Defendant is directly responsible for the collection of plaintiffs phone records without a warrant or probable cause *and* each defendant is responsible for the policy revealed by Edward Snowden, now over one year since 6-5-13 when the policy was publicly revealed, which has and is chilling and curtailing plaintiffs Fourth Amendment Violation 23.
Defendants may refile a Motion to Dismiss upon the lifting of the Court’s stay. Finally, IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the case be ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSED. Plaintiffs may move to reopen the case at the end of six (6) months in order to file a Status Report with the Court.

Holder, Jr.","On November 2, 2013, a group of Texas citizens filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs alleged that the government's electronic surveillance program violated their First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment rights. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case. The case is now moot.

305,NS-UT-0002,"In 2017, an American Citizen who is a cleric at a mosque in Salt Lake City filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. The plaintiff alleged that his placement on the FBI’s “terrorist watchlist” violated his Fifth Amendment Rights, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Constitution’s non-delegation doctrine. In 2018, the District Court granted the government’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Tenth Circuit affirmed in 2019. ","Plaintiff Yusuf Awadir Abdi is a United States Citizen and a Muslim residing in Salt Lake County, Utah. Defendant Andrew McCabe is the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”). Defendant McCabe is responsible for the nominations of Plaintiff and other similarly situated American citizens to the federal terror watch list.

Defendant McCabe is being sued in his official capacity, only. Defendant Christopher M. Piehota is the Director of the Terrorist Screening Center (“TSC”). Defendant Piehota was appointed in April, 2013.
This action seeks declaratory relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § § 2201-02, Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and pursuant to the general, legal, and equitable powers of this Court. A substantial part of the unlawful acts alleged herein were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Venue is proper under 42 U.S.C. § 1391(e) as to all Defendants because Defendants are officers or employees of agencies of the United States sued in their official capacities and because this judicial district is where Plaintiff resides and where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred.

At a March 10, 2010 Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing, Russel E. Travers, Deputy Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, stated that “[t]he entire federal government is leaning very far forward on putting people on list,” and that the watch list is “getting bigger, and it will get even bigger.” The federal terror watch list disproportionately targets American Muslims. Almost all publicly known instances of Americans being placed on the watch list regard Muslims or persons who could be mistaken for Muslims.

Defendant Christopher Wray is the Director of the Terrorist Screening Center (“TSC”). Defendant Wray was appointed on August 2, 2017.
Civil Action No. 1 :16-cv-375 (AJT/JFA) CHRISTOPHER M. PIEHOTA, et al., Defendants. MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Plaintiffs are twenty-five United States citizens who claim they are included in the Government's Terrorism Screening Database, referred to colloquially as the Government's terrorist watch list (the ""TSDB"" or ""Watch List""). They allege this status subjects them to additional screening when traveling by air or entering the country at a land border or port, and can impact other rights, such as the ability to buy a gun, to work in certain parts of an airport, or to obtain the necessary license to transport hazardous materials.
Therefore, Plaintiffs have standing to assert their claims.4 B. Count 1: Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Claim The Due Process Clause guarantees that ""[n]o person shall be... deprived oflife, liberty, or property, without due process oflaw."" U.S Const. amend V.


Abdi seeks declarative and injunctive relief. The district court dismissed Abdi’s complaint with prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM.
But a “purpose and hope” is not a mandate.4 For these reasons, Abdi has failed to allege that he was actually deprived of any right conferred by state or federal law because of his status on the Selectee List. Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of Abdi’s procedural due process claim. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Abdi’s complaint with prejudice.

The parties settled via a confidential settlement agreement. ","SSCI Report 9. Defendants Devise a Torture Program for the CIA. Defendants Mitchell and Jessen laid the foundations for the CIA’s use of torture in or around December 2001 when, at the request of the Agency, they collaborated in reviewing a document known as the “Manchester Manual.”
Defendants designed, developed, and implemented a program intended to inflict physical pain and mental suffering on Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs were tortured and cruelly treated as a consequence of their inclusion in that program. Defendants also experimented on Plaintiffs without their consent by attempting to induce in them a state of “learned helplessness” to break their wills by torturing and cruelly-treating them, and by monitoring, recalibrating, and refining their mistreatment based on their assessment of Plaintiffs’ and other prisoners’ physical and psychological reactions to torture and cruel treatment.
In Reply (ECF No. 29), Defendants rely heavily on the District Court opinion from 20 the Eastern District of Virginia, Al Shimari v. CACI Premier Technology, 119 F.Supp.3d 21 434 (E.D.Va. 2015), where the court dismissed the action based on the political question 22 doctrine. Although the parties agree Al Shimari is relevant, and Plaintiffs cite the Fourth 23 Circuit opinion, as discussed infra, in regard to ATS jurisdiction, the District Court’s 24 opinion is not controlling authority.
Plaintiffs have further alleged that the Defendants engaged in torture, and 4 substantively state a claim under the ATS. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for lack of 5 jurisdiction and failure to state a claim under the ATS is DENIED. Capacity of Obaid Ullah Defendants contend that capacity to sue is determined by state law, and under 8 Washington law, a personal representative must be appointed by a court.

Defendants, Carnival Corporation (""Carnival"") and Fathom Travel Ltd., Corporation, (""Fathom"") (hereinafter collectively referred to as ""Defendants"") are refusing to allow Cuban-born persons to board its Fathom cruise line to Cuba, the first American cruise line to cruise to Cuba in over 50 years. Cuban law currently prohibits Cuban Nationals from traveling to or from Cuba by ship, including cruise lines and ferries.
This case presents a model situation for class treatment. Defendants' conduct including its refusal to allow any Cuban-born on the Fathom cruise line to Cuba is uniform among all passengers. The application of Florida federal law to a shared course of conduct will determine liability for members of the putative class as a whole, ensuring that the rights of thousands of individuals are vindicated through the efficiency of a single trial.
PARTIES, JURISDICTION VENUE 6. During the Class Period, Plaintiff Amparo Sanchez resided in, and continues to reside in, the Southern District of Florida. During the Class Period, Plaintiff Francisco Marty resided in, and continues to reside in, the Southern District of Florida.
Francisco Marty is a United States Army Veteran and a frequent passenger on Carnival cruise lines.

Cathom.org/cuba-faq/ (last visited Apr. Carnival and Fathom have adopted a policy to support Cuba's boycott of Cubanborn individuals from traveling to and from Cuba by ship. As a result of Defendants' discriminatory practices, Plaintiffs and the Class have been denied the full enjoyment of Defendants' place of public accommodation while being discriminated on the ground of national origin.
The proposed Class IS so numerous that joinder of all members would be 5 impracticable. Defendants sell (or refuse to sell) thousands of cruise line reservations nationwide. The individual Class members are ascertainable, as the names and addresses of all class members can be identified in the business records maintained by Defendants.
Whether Defendants' cruise line b. Whether Defendants have a policy of refusing Cuban-born individuals reservations on the Fathom cruise line on the ground of national origin; c. Whether Defendants' policy violates Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a; and d.
Individual suits would not be cost effective or economically maintainable as individual actions; and f. The action is manageable as a class action. Requirements of Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(2) 37.
COUNT I VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 2000A (TITLE II OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964) (On behalf of the Nationwide Class) Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate paragraphs 1 38 above as if fully set forth herein and further allege as follows: 39. This is a claim for an injunction for violations of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000a- § 2000a-6(b). 42 U.S.C. § 2000a, et seq., prohibits discrimination and segregation in places of accommodation. Section 2000a(a) states: ""All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.""
Each Plaintiff and Class member was denied the right to contract for those services with Defendants and, thus, were denied those benefits and enjoyments. Plaintiffs and Class members were denied access to a place of accommodationDefendants' cruise ships, on the basis of discriminatory acts by Defendants. Similarly situated persons who are not members of the protected class received full benefits or enjoyment, or were treated better.

309,PA-NC-0006,"After the DOJ indicates that it believes a North Carolina law limiting transgender individuals access to bathrooms violates federal law, president Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate and the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives bring suit in federal court asking the Eastern District Court of North Carolina to declare that the law doesn't violate the laws cited by the DOJ and to declare that the DOJ action is illegal and unconstitutional. ","They were bluntly ordered to repudiate the Act within five calendar days—that is, by today—or else face enforcement actions that would drastically impact North Carolina, including the potentially catastrophic elimination of more than two billion dollars in federal funding. Instead of meekly complying, plaintiffs—the leaders of both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly—have filed this declaratory judgment action. A declaratory judgment is urgently needed for two basic reasons.
The UNC Determination Letter “determined” that UNC was in violation of Title VII and VAWA, for the same reasons as those outlined in the McCrory and Perry Determination Letters. In addition, the UNC Determination Letter “determined” that UNC was in violation of Title IX because of UNC’s compliance with the Act. 42. Finally, the UNC Determination Letter ordered UNC President Margaret Spellings to “advise” the Department “no later than close of business on May 9, 2016” whether UNC has “remedied these violations to comply fully with Title IX and VAWA, as well as its obligations as an employer under Title VII, including by... advising the public, including UNC students, employees, and third parties that, in accordance with federal law, individuals are permitted to access UNC restrooms and other facilities consistent with their gender identity.”

Subsequent Litigation The Act has been met both with ire and praise. On March 28, 2016, one of the groups expressing displeasure, the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. See Carcaño v. McCrory, 1:16-CV-236-TDS-JEP (M.D.N.C.
In reaction to that guidance, the United States Department of Education 2 For example, they allege that § 1 of the Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates against homosexuals on the basis of sexual orientation; §§ 2 and 3 of the Act violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by preempting local non-discrimination ordinances; and that the Act as a whole violates the substantive aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause by violating their fundamental rights to privacy and to refuse unwanted medical treatment. (“USDOE”) requested information for the purpose of determining whether the university system, a recipient of federal funds, was in compliance with Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act (the “VAWA”), 42 U.S.C. § 13701 through § 14040. Previously, the USDOE had interpreted Title IX and its associated regulations with the purpose of including transgender individuals within the statute’s reach, at least with respect to bathroom access.
All three letters are to the same effect: § 1 of the Act violates federal law. The letter directed to Governor McCrory concludes that § 1 of the Act violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq, on its face. The letter to Secretary Perry likewise concludes that § 1 of the Act facially violates both Title VII and the VAWA.

310,PB-AL-0006,"In June 2014, a same-sex couple who had been lawfully married outside the State of Alabama filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against the State of Alabama. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that Alabama's refusal to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples validly entered into outside of the State violated the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Subsequent to the Obergefell decision in June 2015 by the Supreme Court, Judge R. David Proctor dismissed this case without prejudice in October 2015, and costs were to be taxed against the defendants. The plaintiffs’ appealed to the Eleventh Circuit in January 2016, but in February 2017, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court’s ruling that there was no judicially sanctioned change in the relationship of the parties that would justify an award of attorney’s fees. Parties submitted informal notice that counsel no longer sought to pursue costs in this case in May 2017, and there has been no further action in this case. ","COMPLAINT 1. Plaintiffs are a same-sex couple who were lawfully married outside the State of Alabama. They sue to challenge the constitutionality of Section 36.03 of the Alabama Constitution and Ala.

She is sued in her official capacity only. Hugh B. McCall is the Director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. His office is in Montgomery County, Alabama.
It is “a far-reaching legal acknowledgement of the intimate relationship between two people....” Windsor, 133 S Ct. at 2692. This is as true for same-sex couples as it is for different-sex couples. Same-sex married couples such as Plaintiffs are similarly situated to different-sex married couples in all of the characteristics relevant to the recognition of their legal marriages.
Because Plaintiffs have elected not to submit an itemized fee summary at this time, whether they are the prevailing party in this litigation is the only question before the court. Plaintiffs filed this case on June 10, 2014.

They brought this action to challenge the constitutionality of Section 36.03 of the Alabama Constitution and Ala. Code § 30-1-19 (the “Alabama Marriage Prohibitions”) which prohibit the State of Alabama from recognizing the marriages of same sex couples entered into in other jurisdictions.
1206 (S.D Ala. In light of Obergefell, on July 21, 2015, Defendants moved to dismiss this case as moot. (Doc.
On October 8, 2015, the parties filed a Joint Status Report indicating that Defendants had effectuated all of the specific injunctive relief Plaintiffs sought in this case.
Therefore, because no live case or controversy remained, the court dismissed this case without prejudice.
After careful review, and with the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that there was no such judicially sanctioned change and affirm the district court’s ruling. Background The Aaron-Brushes were married in Massachusetts in 2012. Despite the legality of their marriage under Massachusetts law, Alabama refused to recognize the marriage and its appurtenant rights, including the rights to file tax returns jointly and to obtain driver’s licenses that reflected their marriage, because Alabama banned same-sex marriage under its state constitution and statutory code.
Code § 30-1-19.
The couple sued the defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the refusal to recognize their marriage violated their rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The couple requested relief in the form of a declaratory judgment that Alabama’s same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional and permanent injunctions directing the defendants to recognize marriages validly entered into outside of Alabama and preventing the defendants from enforcing the state’s marriage ban.
When the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Obergefell, the parties jointly asked the district court for an extension of time to file dispositive motions. The district court granted the motion. When the Supreme Court in Obergefell recognized the right of same-sex couples to marry and the obligation of states to recognize these marriages, the parties filed a joint motion to set a briefing schedule, which stated: “The parties are now in agreement that the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges... conclusively resolves the legal issues in this case and that no further briefing on the merits is necessary.”
The parties asked the court for a new briefing schedule pursuant to which they could address these remaining disagreements. In response to the motion, the district court held a status conference. The court opened the conference by asking, “Do we all agree that [Obergefell] is now the law of the land?”
The defendants thereafter filed a notice in conformance with the district court’s directive.
The Aaron-Brushes responded to the notice by requesting that the district court issue a declaratory judgment and permanent injunctions as sought in their complaint. The defendants moved to dismiss the action as moot. The district court denied the Aaron-Brushes’ request and granted the defendants’ motion.
The Aaron-Brushes did not appeal the mootness order; rather, they moved for attorney’s fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b), which permits a “prevailing party” (other than the United States) in § 1983 litigation to recover a reasonable attorney’s fee. The district court denied the motion for attorney’s fees, concluding that the Aaron-Brushes were not prevailing parties. This is the Aaron-Brushes’ appeal of the denial of an attorney’s fee award.

312,PB-CA-0012,"In March and November of 2003, two separate cases (Clayworth v. Bonta and Cal. Med. Assoc. v. Bonta) were filed by Medicaid service providers and recipients seeking to enjoin California from reducing its disbursement rate to Medicaid providers by 5%. The cases were both filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, and the Court found that the issues in the cases were substantially similar and therefore chose to relate them, assigning them to the same Judge. The Judge at the District Court granted a preliminary injunction preventing California from implementing the rate reduction, finding that to do so would violate the federally guaranteed right to equal access to quality medical services for Medicaid beneficiaries. The Defendant appealed, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that their was no cause of action that would allow Medicaid providers or recipients to challenge a State's compliance with the equal access provisions of Medicaid. The cases were later dismissed.","Plaintiff AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION (“AHF”) is a California nonprofit corporation. It is the largest private provider of AIDS medical care in California. AHF operates licensed community clinics and pharmacies in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Alameda, and San Francisco counties, and provides direct medical and pharmacy services to approximately 6,000 Californians with HIV/AIDS.
The PPA is also a clearinghouse for information regarding the practice of pharmacy within the State of California. PPA’s members are providers under California’s Medi-Cal program. A significant number of pharmacies operated by PPA’s members will be adversely affected by the threatened rate reduction and may be forced to close if the 5% Medi-Cal rate reduction is implemented.
In January 1987, the Department proposed a 10% decrease in Medi-Cal rates for physicians (except maternity care services), pharmacists, dentists and most other Medi-Cal providers that would be effective for services provided on or after February 1, 1987 through June 30, 1987. This decrease was enjoined as a result of a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of California by plaintiff California Medical Association and other provider and beneficiary groups and individuals. California Medical Association.
et al., v. Kizer, Docket No. Civ S 87-0182 LKK. This case resulted in a Consent Decree, dated October 24, 1989, which permanently enjoined the Department from imposing a 10% reduction in reimbursement rates to physicians and other Medi-Cal providers. With the 1987 proposed change enjoined, the 1985 rate changes were, for 15 years, the only changes that the Department made to all of the non-institutional Medi-Cal rates in an “across-the-board” fashion.
In most California counties, the Department contracts with a private insurance company, Delta Dental, to administer the provision of dental services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries. The dental Medi-Cal program is known as “Denti-Cal.” 49. As with other non-institutional rates, dental rates were reduced in 1982.
DECLARATORY RELIEF 76. An actual and justiciable controversy exists between Plaintiffs and the Defendant regarding the validity of the five percent rate reduction in Medi-Cal payment rates for non-institutional services that is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2004. Plaintiffs contend that the rate reduction is invalid and unlawful in violation of federal law, federal regulations, State law and the State Plan, while the Defendant contends that the rate reduction is valid in all respects.

The State argues that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the preliminary injunction because the Providers have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits, or irreparable harm, or that the balance of equities and the public interest warrant an injunction. We vacate the preliminary injunction and remand. BACKGROUND The Providers are trade associations representing, among other facilities, intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded and for the developmentally disabled, and free standing pediatric subacute facilities.
The Providers filed suit in federal district court on April 30, 2011. They alleged that the State’s implementation of Welfare and Institutions Code § 14105.191(f), which limited reimbursement rates under California’s Medicaid program, violated federal law.
On March 28, 2011, the district court lifted the stay. The court then granted the motion for a preliminary injunction. It concluded that it was likely that the Providers would succeed on the merits of their 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim that the State had unlawfully failed to obtain federal approval of the SPA effected by section 14105.191(f) prior to implementing it.

It is the third-largest school district in the nation with over 600 public schools, serving approximately 360,000 K-12 students in the 2019-2020 school year.
The Governor made clear he considered the amount of CARES Act funding CMSD would receive in making cuts in state support, but that CARES Act funding cannot be relied upon under the Rule. The result is a gap in funding for students and teachers in public schools who are in dire need.

315,PB-DC-0009,"In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (“Obamacare”) that expanded Medicare coverage to include additional groups of beneficiaries. Arkansas approved a work requirement in Medicaid as a requirement for health coverage in its amendments on March 5, 2018.

On August 14, 2018, three individuals filed a suit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as administrators involved in implementing the Arkansas Works Amendments (AMA) in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the SSA and the Constitution in approving the AWA in March 2018. All three plaintiffs were beneficiaries of Medicaid who lost or risked losing medical coverage due to changes in the AWA. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the AWA and attorney fees. 

On March 27, 2019, the court held that the AWA work requirement does not advance the purpose of the SSA. The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and vacated the approval for Arkansas’s program. On April 10, 2019, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 

On February 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment vacating the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas Works Amendments. The court emphasized that providing healthcare coverage is the primary purpose of Medicaid. The defendants' alternative objectives of better health outcomes, financial independence, and transition to commercial coverage, on the other hand, were not consistent with Medicaid. The court found the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas program to be arbitrary and capricious due to the failure to consider whether the program would result in loss of coverage, an important aspect of the approval analysis.","JURISDICTION AND VENUE 9. This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Social Security Act, and the United States Constitution. The Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1361, and 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 to 705.

Russell Cook is 26 and also lives in Little Rock. He is currently homeless. While he has spent time working as a landscaper, he is not presently employed and has minimal job prospects.
These are three of the ten Arkansans who come to this Court seeking to undo the work requirements the state added in 2018 to its Medicaid program. They sued the Secretary of Health and Human Services in August 2018, arguing that the federal government’s approval of the state’s new requirements violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution. Plaintiffs’ suit does not offer an issue of first impression.
Yet a separate question remains: what is the proper remedy? In Stewart I, the Court vacated the approval and remanded to the Secretary. Here, however, the Government argues that vacatur is improper both because, unlike Kentucky, AWA is already active and halting it would be quite disruptive, and because any error is easily fixed, just as it has been for Kentucky.
See AR 1274. The program became known as Arkansas Works in January 2017. That month featured another significant change in the political landscape, as the Trump administration took over from President Obama.
at 243. It therefore vacated the Secretary’s approval and remanded the matter to the agency for further consideration Id. at 273.
HHS has since reopened the comment period and subsequently reapproved Kentucky’s project, offering additional explanation for why the project advances the objectives of the Medicaid Act. The parties have now come back to the Court and filed cross-motions for summary judgment in that case.
The Court issues a separate Opinion today resolving those motions, which it will refer to as Stewart II. Procedural History Several Arkansas residents filed this lawsuit in August 2018. They assert that the Secretary’s approval of the Arkansas Works Amendments was arbitrary and capricious, in excess of his statutory authority, and in violation of the Take Care Clause of the Constitution.
Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge SENTELLE. SENTELLE, Senior Circuit Judge: Residents of Kentucky and Arkansas brought this action against the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They contend that the Secretary acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when he approved Medicaid demonstration requests for Kentucky and Arkansas.
The District Court for the District of Columbia held that the Secretary did act in an arbitrary and capricious manner because he failed to analyze whether the demonstrations would promote the primary objective of Medicaid—to furnish medical assistance. After oral argument, Kentucky terminated the challenged demonstration project and moved for voluntary dismissal. We granted the unopposed motion.
The only question remaining before us is whether the Secretary’s authorization of Arkansas’s demonstration is lawful. Because the Secretary’s approval of the plan was arbitrary and capricious, we affirm the judgment of the district court. Background Originally, Medicaid provided health care coverage for four categories of people: the disabled, the blind, the elderly, and needy families with dependent children.
at 3, 12. He also approved Arkansas’s decision to terminate the employer-sponsored coverage premium assistance program Id. at 3.
at 181.
The district court entered final judgment on April 4, 2019, and the Secretary filed a notice of appeal on April 10, 2019. This case was originally a consolidated appeal from the district court’s judgment in both the Arkansas and Kentucky cases. The district court twice vacated the Secretary’s approval of Kentucky’s demonstration for the same failure to address whether Kentucky’s program would promote the key objective of Medicaid.

District Court for the District of Columbia held that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had violated Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) when it promulgated a new rule requiring health care providers to provide gender-affirming care coverage. The plaintiffs filed this suit against HHS on behalf of a group of individuals who were denied health care coverage because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and a stay of enforcement of the new rule.

State Farm. The case was brought by the L.A. LGBT Center on behalf of the California LGBT Community Center and the California Gay and Lesbian Center.

319,PB-FL-0004,"On January 15, 2008, a group of Medicaid-eligible adults with disabilities that were confined to a nursing-home facility filed a class action in U.S. District Court against Florida's Health Care Administration and Department of Elder Affairs. The plaintiffs claimed that the state discriminated against them by failing to offer services that would enable them to live in a community setting. After a bench trial, the court entered judgment for one of the named plaintiffs and decertified the class that he had previously approved. In part because of recent legislation that greatly improved the state's efficiency at moving eligible persons from nursing homes to community living, the court determined that the conditions allowing for the class no longer existed.","42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i) (incorporating42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a}(1 )-(5), (17), (21 )).

42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i) (incorporating 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(1)-(5), (17), (21)). “Mandatory” services include services in a skilled nursing facility. States must also cover home health services for “any individual who, under the state plan, is entitled to nursing facility services.”
This conduct, allege plaintiffs, violates the anti-discrimination provision contained in the public services portion (Title II) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and regulations that require that “a public entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities,” 28 C.F.R. 35.130(d).

CASE NO. 4:08cv26-RH/WCS ELIZABETH DUDEK et al., Defendants. ORDER DIRECTING THE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFF GRIFFIN, DISMISSING THE OTHER NAMED PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS AS MOOT, AND DECERTIFYING THE CLASS Seven named plaintiffs filed this case in 2008, asserting that the State of Florida was unnecessarily requiring Medicaid beneficiaries to enter or remain in nursing homes in order to receive care they could and should have received in the community. The plaintiffs asserted that this violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. Under Olmstead v. L.C.
I certified a class and entered a preliminary injunction in favor of one named plaintiff, Clayton Griffin. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction.
An unrelated legislative development—a virtually limitless appropriation for transitioning Medicaid beneficiaries from nursing homes into the community—led to substantial changes in the state’s Medicaid program. At the parties’ request, I stayed the litigation for a year, while the state implemented the changes and the plaintiffs evaluated their effect on the plaintiffs’ claims. The plaintiffs were not satisfied, and the litigation resumed.
Following a bench trial, I now make permanent the injunction in Mr. Griffin’s favor, dismiss as moot the claims of the other named plaintiffs, and decertify the class, on the ground that it is no longer true—as it was when the class was certified—that the case meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b). I When they filed this lawsuit, the named plaintiffs all were Medicaid beneficiaries living in nursing homes who wished to move back into the community. They sued the Secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration and the Secretary of the Florida Department of Elder Affairs, in their official capacities.
In order to do that, Mr. Griffin needed four hours of personal-attendant care per day, isolated emergency personal-attendant care, and the same outside medical care that would be covered if Mr. Griffin remained in a nursing home. The state refused to provide these services. On June 14, 2008, Mr. Griffin moved out of the nursing home and began living by himself in an apartment complex, despite the state’s refusal to pay for the needed services.
A First, AHCA enlisted other agencies in the process. One was the Florida Department of Children and Families. DCF was responsible for assessing candidates for a waiver that targeted patients with traumatic brain injuries or spinal cord injuries.
Any other claim of Mr. Griffin is dismissed. The claims of the other named plaintiffs are dismissed as moot. The class is decertified.
The clerk must enter judgment in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.

BARKETT, Circuit Judge: Honorable James Randal Hall, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Georgia, sitting by designation. The Secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families (“State”) appeals from the district court’s order enjoining the State of Florida from requiring Luis W. Lebron to submit to a suspicionless drug test pursuant to Section 414.0652 of the Florida Statutes, as a condition for receipt of government-provided monetary assistance for which he was otherwise qualified. Lebron is an honorably discharged veteran of the United States Navy, college student, single unmarried father and sole caretaker of his young child.
Lebron met all of the program’s eligibility requirements, but DCF ultimately denied his application because Lebron refused to submit to Florida’s newly-enacted, mandatory drug testing, which is a final condition of eligibility for TANF benefits in Florida. Florida’s mandatory drug-testing requirement for all TANF applicants was enacted in May 2011.
Lebron signed the release, completed the application process and was found eligible for TANF benefits. However, he did not submit to the drug test, but instead filed this lawsuit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of Florida’s mandatory suspicionless drug testing as a violation of his and all other TANF applicants’ Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The district court granted a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the drug testing statute against Lebron and the State agreed to discontinue its drug testing regime as to all TANF applicants until this litigation is fully resolved.
Standard of Review Although we review the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion, underlying questions of law are reviewed de novo, and the district court’s factual determinations cannot be disturbed unless clearly erroneous, see United States v. Alabama, 691 F.3d 1269, 1281 (11th Cir.
Discussion The Fourth Amendment protects the rights of individuals “to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” U.S Const. amend IV.
See Fla Stat. Luis Lebron sued the Secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families (the “State”), claiming that the statute violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. After we affirmed the entry of a preliminary injunction barring the application of the statute against Lebron, the State halted the drug-testing program.
Without the test, however, the Department deemed him ineligible to receive TANF assistance and denied his application on August 25, 2011. On behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated persons, Lebron commenced this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida on September 6, 2011, against the Secretary of DCF in his official capacity. Lebron sought a declaration that requiring suspicionless drug testing for TANF eligibility under § 414.0652 violated the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.
In total, the Department restored TANF Temporary Cash Assistance to approximately 1,727 families. The Secretary appealed the preliminary injunction, and a panel of this Court affirmed. Lebron I, 710 F.3d 1202.
Skinner, 489 U.S. at 617 (“Because it is clear that the collection and testing of urine intrudes upon expectations of privacy that society has long recognized as reasonable,... these intrusions must be deemed searches under the Fourth Amendment.”). The question is whether mandatory, suspicionless drug testing of all TANF applicants amounts to a reasonable search. While the Constitution generally prohibits government searches conducted without individualized suspicion, the Supreme Court has recognized exceptions in certain well-defined circumstances, including when the government has “special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement.”

321,PB-FL-0008,"Plaintiffs were a lesbian couple who filed a complaint on July 20, 2004 challenging the Federal Defense of Marriage Act, as well as Florida's implementation of the statute, as violating the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and sought declaratory relief.  On January 19, 2005, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida held that DOMA falls within Congress' power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the right to same-sex marriage is not a fundamental right under the Constitution, and that DOMA passes the rational basis review test and does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

Both Defendants AKE and ASHCROFT have offices for the conduct of official business in Hillsborough County, Florida: also a substantial part of the events or omissions giving raise to the claim occurred in the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division.
In spite of the foregoing, the United States' and Florida's statutory codes as detailed later, do not permit marriages of lesbian and gay couples. It is this selective denial of marriage equality to this disfavored group that has led to this action. PLAINTIFFS 9.
Plaintiffs do not have another living wife or husband; they are not first cousins or any nearer of kin to each other; and neither is incapable for want of legal age or sufficient understanding. They consent freely to marry each other; but for the fact that they are same-sex couples, the United States and the State of Florida would recognize their marnage. The Plaintiffs want to live with the confidence that, if one of them unexpectedly dies or becomes disabled or sick, the other will have all of the protections that marriage in Florida affords.
These Plaintiffs need the benefits of marriage to protect themselves from economic hardship and discrimination. Plaintiffs have been legally married in the State of Massachusetts and now hold a valid marriage license from that State. They have personally presented that marriage license to a Deputy Clerk of the Hillsborough Circuit Court Clerk's Office, asking for recognition and acceptance of the valid and legal Massachusetts marriage license.

322,PB-FL-0010,"Plaintiffs were individuals with quadriplegia who did not receive adequate in-home care services via Florida Medicaid and who were on the waitlist for the state's spinal cord injury waiver services. After arguing that this was a violation of the ADA and Section 504, the plaintiffs received a preliminary injunction in 2010 and the state initiated waiver services soon after.

However, that motion was denied without prejudice due to a pending motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs Cruz and De La Torre then filed the present action in the Middle District of Florida, and subsequently the case was transferred to this Court (DE 10). Findings of Fact8 Since the facts in this case must be viewed in the context of the regulatory framework of the Medicaid Act and Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”), it is useful to describe those provisions at the outset.
National Screen Service Corp., 441 F.2d 560, 561 (5th Cir. The parties disagree as to the nature of the relief sought. Plaintiffs contend that because they seek to prohibit unlawful discrimination, the injunctive relief they seek is prohibitive in nature and does not seek to change the status quo.
They claimed that the State’s failure to place them in a community based program, with the ultimate goal of integrating them into the mainstream of society, violated Title II of the ADA. The District Court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the mentally disabled plaintiffs, holding that the State had violated the ADA, and rejected the State’s defense that inadequate funding, rather than discrimination, was the reason for retaining the plaintiffs in an institution.
The District Court also rejected the State’s defense that, since the State was already using all available funds to provide services to other persons with disabilities, requiring immediate transfers would “fundamentally alter” the State’s activities. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court, but remanded for a reassessment of the State’s cost based defense. The Eleventh Circuit held that the District Court erred in absolutely ruling out lack of funding as a defense, stating that the State could prevail on this theory if it could prove that requiring it to provide community based integrated services to the plaintiffs would cost so much that, given the demands of the State’s mental health budget, it would fundamentally alter the services provided by the State.
Following Olmstead, District Courts in both the Middle District of Florida and the Northern District of Florida have granted preliminary injunctive relief in circumstances almost identical to those presented here. In Haddad, supra., the Court in the Middle District of Florida entered a preliminary injunction which required Florida to provide the quadraplegic plaintiff with services under the TBI/SCI waiver program. Plaintiff Haddad, like Plaintiffs in the case at bar, was a quadriplegic who had applied to receive Medicaid services under Florida’s TBI/SCI Waiver program, and was placed on a waiting list.
Plaintiffs have shown a clear likelihood of success on the merits. Plaintiffs are qualified persons with disabilities eligible to receive communitybased services from the TBI/SCI waiver program. Without these services Plaintiffs are at risk of undue institutionalization prohibited by the ADA.

Nature of Suit: 446 Civil Rights: Americans with Disabilities − Other Jurisdiction: Federal Question","In 2009, a group of individuals with mental disabilities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities (DBHDD) alleging discrimination under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the state's SOURCE program for people with mental illnesses and developmental disabilities. The plaintiffs were found eligible for SOURCE services and found to meet the institutional level of care necessary for the program, but later were found ineligible due to the change in eligibility for the SOURCE programs. The ADA's ""integration mandate"" requires persons with disabilities to be served in the community when the state determines that community-based treatment is appropriate. In doing so, the Supreme Court held that unnecessary institutionalization of people with disabilities is a form of discrimination under the ADA. The parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the case.","On February 22, 2010, a group of individuals with mental disabilities filed this lawsuit against the State of Georgia in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.

Two of the Plaintiffs settled and some of the Medicare, as well as the Fifth an Fourteenth Amendment Allegations were dismissed on summary Judgment, however, the District Court found for the Defendants on the remaining allegations.

(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 19). GAPP has a policy m anual. The GAPP manual is updated every four months.

In Riley, the plaintiffs sought to certify a subclass of those wrongly denied an available waiver slot in Alabama’s Ho me and Community Based Waiver program. The plaintiffs presented evidence that over 1,600 people were on the waiting list for the program. The court, however, found that the plaintiffs had not established the numerosity requirement.
Whether the Defendant Provides for a Nurse to Travel to Doctor Appointments The Defendant argues that the Plainti ffs have not dem onstrated that the Defendant fails to provide a nurse to travelwith the Plaintiffs to doctor appointments. The Defendant contends GAPP policy allows for a request for a nurse to accompany a GAPP member to a medical visit using non-emergency transportation. (See Def.’s Mot.
at 22). Accordingly, the Plaintiffs have not shown tha t the boilerplate language in the Defendant’s written notices violated their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Plaintiffs also argue that th e Defendant makes arbitrary and capricious decisions about the Plaintiffs’ Medicaid c overage because it uses crit eria s uch as stability and the confidence of a caregiver wehn determining whether to extend private duty nursing hours.
Hours may be reduced on an evaluation of the current medical plan of treatment (physician orders); updated physician sum maries; provider agency documented current assessments and nursing care… the GAPP Manual states it is “ the expectation that the prim ary caregiver(s) will becom e competent to assume some responsibility for the care of the child.” The letter noted that thisCourt had required theDepartment to provide skilled nursing care at specific levels for a three month period following a surgical procedure. The letter stated that: based on the GHP evaluation, your child’s skilled nursing hours are going to be reduced from 84 to 77 hours a week for one month and then from 77 hours a week to 70 hours a week for two m onths effective 30 days from the date of this letter.
The Dep artment has not shown that the reductions in the skilled nursing hours provided to the Plaintiffs were based on medical necessity rather than an arbitrary and capricious reduction of hours. The Plaintiffs have also met their bur den to show that the Defendant has discriminated against them in violation of the Am ericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). Under th e ADA, a public entity m ay not discrim inate against qualified individuals based on a disability.

327,PB-MD-0004,"On March 28, 2018, the NAACP and Prince George’s County, Maryland filed a claim against the U.S. Census Bureau and President Donald Trump for neglecting their constitutional duty to administer a fair and accurate census of the US population. The plaintiffs alleged that underfunding and the flawed design of the 2020 Census might lead to undercounts of the US population in violation of the Enumeration Clause and to the detriment of minority populations, as the census count is tied to both public funding and governmental representation. The plaintiffs requested an injunction to require the US to develop a plan to ensure a fair and accurate count. The court dismissed the claim for injunctive relief as unripe because census preparations were ongoing, but allowed the claim on underfunding to continue. The court also allowed the plaintiffs to add two claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. On April 16, 2020, the court granted the government’s motion to dismiss; the case is closed. ","Plaintiff Prince George’s County is a majority African American county in southeastern Maryland. Prince George’s County has been repeatedly undercounted in past censuses.

Plaintiff Prince George's County Maryland NAACP Branch Jeremy M Creelan (See above for address) PRO HAC VICE ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED
For that reason, we begin by reviewing the proceedings below in some detail. The plaintiffs filed this suit in March 2018, initially asserting multiple violations of the Enumeration Clause but no claims under the APA. At the time of this initial filing, and at the time of the plaintiffs' first amended complaint in June 2018, the Census Bureau lacked a permanent director and a deputy director, and openly was cancelling pre-Census activities based on the lack of appropriations from Congress.
The plaintiffs averred that this undercount disproportionately would impact African Americans and other ""hard-to-count"" communities, thereby diminishing the political representation and the amount of federal funding that these communities would receive. The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for failure to state a claim and for lack of justiciability. The district court addressed the defendants' motion by memorandum opinion in January 2019.
The defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss, seeking dismissal of the APA claims, as well as the remaining Enumeration Clause claim that was based on underfunding. The district court granted the defendants' motion in its entirety. The district court dismissed the plaintiffs' underfunding claim, holding that the claim had been rendered moot by recent Congressional appropriations, and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the adequacy of those appropriations.
Therefore, the court concluded that the APA claims failed on the additional ground that the actions the plaintiffs sought to compel were not ""required by law,"" a precondition for claims brought under Section 706(1). Accordingly, the court granted the defendants' motion and dismissed the Complaint. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in dismissing the APA claims on jurisdictional grounds, and in dismissing the Enumeration Clause claims as unripe.
Instead, we merely reaffirm and apply the longstanding jurisdictional requirements that must be satisfied when proceeding under the APA. Because we conclude that these requirements have not been met here, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the APA claims for lack of jurisdiction. We turn now to consider the district court's decision dismissing as unripe the plaintiffs' Enumeration Clause challenge.
In response, the defendants do not defend the district court's ripeness analysis but maintain that the district court ultimately reached the correct result by dismissing the Enumeration Clause claims. We agree with the plaintiffs that the district court erred in its ripeness analysis. First, we hold that the plaintiffs' claims are ""fit"" for review.

The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs alleged that DHHS had violated Title II of the ADA and other federal laws. The Plaintiffs alleged that the State had failed to accommodate Plaintiffs' disabilities and to provide medically necessary treatment in the most integrated setting possible, instead forcing them into nursing homes where they were functionally segregated from the outside world. In August, 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint reframing the case as a class action on behalf of all similarly situated Maine residents. The parties began settlement discussions shortly thereafter. On May 2, 2012, the Court (Judge Nancy Torresen) approved the settlement. The settlement agreement required the State to establish a Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW) program, which would provide a limited number of qualifying class-members the opportunity to live in community-based settings.

The Defendant 23. Defendant Brenda Harvey is the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) for the State of Maine. Her principal place of business is in the City of Augusta, County of Kennebec, in the State of Maine.
See Chapter II, Section 50 at http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/rules/10/ch101.htm. The Defendant currently provides services in community-based settings to permit some individuals with mental retardation, autism, and other disabilities to live in the community. These individuals have functional limitations that are similar to those of the Named Plaintiffs.
The Named Plaintiffs and members of the putative class re-allege the foregoing paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. The Defendant has failed to provide the Named Plaintiffs and members of the putative class with medically necessary services with reasonable promptness. These services include, inter alia, specialized services while confined to the nursing facility and long-term care services and supports sufficient to permit them to live in the community.
Because Eric and the other named Plaintiffs have been and continue to be irreparably harmed by the state’s failure to comply with the active treatment mandate, they seek a preliminary injunction to assure that they receive necessary services to prevent further regression and loss of abilities. The three named Plaintiffs in this case are young men with diagnoses of Cerebral Palsy who are confined to nursing facilities due to the Defendant’s failure to provide them with adequate services that if provided could enable them to live in the community. Each Plaintiff has the right under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 to appropriate services in the least restrictive setting; however, until such services are made available to them, they have no choice but to live in nursing facilities.
42 C.F.R. §§ 483.120(a)(2), 483.440(a). The Defendant has failed to provide these services. Because the lack of these services is causing Plaintiffs irreparable harm, as they regress, lose skills, and are denied the chance to develop new ones, Plaintiffs request a preliminary injunction that requires Defendant to comply with the Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) requirements of the Nursing Home Reform Amendments (NHRA) and to provide these important services with “reasonable promptness” in compliance with federal Medicaid law.3 3 See Counts V, VI and VII of Plaintiffs’ First Amended Class Action Complaint.

Order).) Judgement was entered dismissing this case with prejudice with the court retaining jurisdiction only to decide the attorney fee question. (Filing 179.)
COLLOTON, Circuit Judge.
The appellants, a group of developmentally disabled Nebraska residents, filed an action in the district court1 against several Nebraska state agencies and officials, alleging violations of federal law. The case was settled, and the central question on appeal is whether each of the plaintiffs was a “prevailing party” in the action, such that the plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys’ fees. The district court held that they were not prevailing parties and denied their application for fees.
We affirm.
The gravamen of their complaint was that the State unlawfully provided inadequate funding for developmental-disability services, thereby raising the risk that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated would be placed in institutional (as opposed to “less restrictive” residential or community) settings. In February 2008, the parties advised the district court that they had reached an oral settlement agreement. The district court gave the parties thirty days to reduce their agreement to writing and to file a joint stipulation for dismissal.
Unable to meet that deadline, the parties moved for an extension of time, and the court granted an additional thirty days, until April 2, 2008, to make the necessary filing.
The court warned, however, that “no further extensions will be granted, and that in the event of noncompliance with [the new deadline], this action may be dismissed without further notice.” The parties executed a written settlement agreement on March 31, 2008. As part of the settlement, the State agreed to convene “workgroups” to study issues relating to the State’s system of providing services to the developmentally disabled.
The State also agreed to implement new procedures for handling requests for such services. For their part, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their claims with prejudice, provided that the district court retained jurisdiction to decide the issue of attorneys’ fees. On April 2, 2008, the parties timely filed a joint motion and stipulation for “approval” of the settlement.
Both parties certified that they did, and the court granted their motion, subject to the above understanding. The court then dismissed the entirety of the case with prejudice, except for the issue of attorneys’ fees, which it retained jurisdiction to resolve. The plaintiffs applied for attorneys’ fees under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12205; the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794a(b); and the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b).
The district court denied the plaintiffs’ application on the ground that they were not prevailing parties, and thus not eligible for fees under those statutes.
This appeal followed. The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in denying their application for attorneys’ fees. They contend that they “prevailed” in the underlying action, because the settlement they reached with the State provided some of the relief that they sought.
Indeed, the Court noted, “federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual settlement will often be lacking unless the terms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal.” The plaintiffs here reached a settlement agreement with the State. The district court did not make any determination as to whether the settlement agreement was “good or bad or fair or unfair.”","On June 26, 2006, a group of developmentally disabled adults (Plaintiffs) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska against the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services Finance and Support. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and other federal and state law provisions by denying them home and community-based Medicaid-funded services. The defendants moved to dismiss the case, but the plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal. The district court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, and the case was closed.","In 2007, a group of developmentally disabled Nebraska residents filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska against several state agencies and officials, alleging violations of federal law.

Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.

Specifically, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust the procedures provided by the DOJ to investigate, and possibly resolve, complaints of unlawful discrimination based on disability.

They argue that it is unlawful under federal law for the State to confine them in the more restrictive environment of a prison, where they cannot get the mental-health and substanceabuse treatment they need, instead of a MICA program where that treatment is available.

In Arroyo Gonzalez v. Rosse/la Nevares, 305 F. Supp. 2018), the District of Puerto Rico was confronted with the same constitutional challenges to Puerto Rico's birth certificate policy as Plaintiffs raise in this case. Like Ohio, Puerto Rico's policy categorically prohibited transgender persons from correcting their birth certificates to accurately reflect the person's sex based on their gender identity as opposed to their sex assigned at birth.
69, 71.2 For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and DENIES Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. I. BACKGROUND3 Plaintiffs are four transgender individuals born in Ohio who have been denied the ability to change the sex marker on their birth certificates to reflect their gender identities. The Ohio Revised Code permits a person to correct a birth record that, among other things, “has not been properly or accurately recorded.”

Defendants, the Attorney General of Ohio, the Director of the Ohio Department of Health, and the Secretary of the State Medical Board of Ohio (collectively “the State”) appeal the district court’s order granting plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”). The plaintiffs are a collection of reproductive healthcare clinics and physicians providing abortion care (“the Providers”). The State moves to stay the TRO pending its appeal and asks that we treat its motion both as a stay motion and as a brief on the merit of its appeal.
On March 20, 2020, and March 21, 2020, the Providers received letters from the State warning them that if they did not immediately stop performing non-essential or elective surgical abortions in compliance with the Director’s Order, the Department of Health would take appropriate measures. The Providers sought a TRO, which the district court granted, in part, on March 30, 2020. As both parties acknowledge, we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction in this matter.
A prompt ruling by the district court on the Providers’ motion for a preliminary injunction may shed further light on this issue.
Accordingly, the Providers’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED. The State’s motion for a stay is DENIED as moot. BUSH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.

In 2004, before the Oregon Constitution was amended to prohibit state recognition of marriage for same-sex couples, Basic Rights worked with the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners and its legal counsel to assess the constitutionality of Oregon’s marriage statute. The County’s counsel and the State’s legislative counsel both concluded that Oregon’s marriage statute was unconstitutional and the County began to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. When the State Registrar refused to register the licenses, Basic Rights’ affiliate entity Basic Rights Oregon (“BRO”), along with the American Civil Liberties Union and nine same-sex couples, filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage violates Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution.

In addition, Basic Rights participated with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries to convene various state agencies to re-write forms and state websites.

Every day, adults with mental disabilities are unnecessarily and illegally segregated in South Carolina’s G. Werber Bryan Psychiatric Hospital (“Bryan” or “Bryan Hospital”). These adults remain in this isolating institution because Defendants have failed to develop sufficient community-based mental health services.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 7. This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, et seq. and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq. 8.

As of this filing, no changes to discharge policies have been publicized by the Defendants. The CMHC is responsible for screening individuals at Bryan to see if they are ready for discharge, and for assisting with planning for their discharge and setting up aftercare appointments at the CMHC.
Defendants have a Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) with some CRCFs. The Defendants’ MOA requires the CRCF to comply with criteria set by SCDMH in exchange for an agreement to provide mental health services for the residents of the CRCF. Except on rare occasions, Bryan Hospital will discharge patients only to those CRCFs with MOAs.

Schreier) declared that South Dakota's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and enjoined the state from enforcing this ban or declining to issue a marriage license because the applicants are of the same gender. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment. The motion to vacate the stay was granted by the District Court on September 9, 2015. This case is now closed.","South Dakota passed Amendment C despite the fact that in 1996 the South Dakota legislature had already banned same-sex maniage by enacting changes to Title 25 of its Codified Laws. These changes intended as a response to court decisions indicating that Hawaii might allow same-sex couples to marry included language that prohibited marriage of same-sex couples and voided same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions. By way of example, Title 25 of South Dakota Codified Law provides: (a) Marriage is a personal relation, between a man and a woman, arising out of a civil contract to which the consent of the parties capable of making it is necessary.
Named Plaintiffs Nancy and Jennie Rosenbrahn and Named Plaintiffs Clay Schweitzer and Jeremy Coller are individuals living in the State of South Dakota. They are loving and committed same-sex couples who wished to marry while living in South Dakota and applied for marriage licenses in South Dakota but were denied on the basis of their same-sex parfirerships. As a result, both couples were forced to travel hundreds of miles, across State lines, and to another time zone in order for other States to confer upon them the dignity and respect that is deserved by all loving and commifted couples under the law.

Defendants have all been named as defendants in their official capacities due to their roles in enforcing South Dakota’s same-sex marriage ban.

Synopsis Background: Same-sex couples brought action against various South Dakota officials, alleging that prohibition of same-sex marriage and refusal to recognize valid outof-state same-sex marriages violated equal protection and due process. The United States District Court for the District of South Dakota, Karen E.

State officials appealed. The Court of Appeals held that Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision did not render the action moot. Affirmed.
Opinion PER CURIAM. Plaintiffs are six same-sex couples seeking to marry in South Dakota or to have their marriage in another state recognized in South Dakota. They also seek state benefits incident to marriage.
The district court1 granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, finding laws denying them the right to marry (in Article 21, § 9 of the South Dakota Constitution and South Dakota Codified Laws §§ 25–1–1, 25–1–38) violate the U.S. Constitution’s guarantees of due process and equal protection.

The plaintiffs alleged that the Affordable Care Act's regulation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex (which included gender identity and termination of pregnancy) violated the Administrative Procedure Act, Religious Freedom Restoration Act and constitutional rights. In October 2016, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of this regulation, which was granted on December 31, 2016. Defendants' motion to stay the preliminary injunction was denied in January 2017. In May 2017, the defendants filed a motion for voluntary remand and stay, arguing that HHS should be given the opportunity to reconsider the regulation at issue in this case, which would conserve the resources of both parties and the court. In July 2017, Judge O’Connor declined to remand the case, but imposed a stay of all proceedings while HHS reconsidered the regulation. He clarified that the December 31, 2016 preliminary injunction order would be unaffected by the stay and would remain in full force and effect throughout the stay. In December 2018, the stay was lifted, and the parties resumed litigating the case. In September 2019, Judge O'Connor vacated the rule's challenged provisions.

Franciscan strives to provide top-quality care to its patients. Its facilities have earned designations as Centers of Excellence, Five-Star Awards, and top state and national rankings.

Approximately 15,000 of these employees are eligible for health insurance benefits from Franciscan. Franciscan has a health benefits plan that is administered by a third party administrator. In accordance with Franciscan’s religious beliefs, Franciscan’s employee health benefit plan specifically excludes coverage for: • any “[t]reatment, drugs, medicines, services, and supplies related to gender transition”; • Sterilizations; • Abortions.

The Rule also prohibits discrimination on the basis of “termination of pregnancy.” Franciscan performs surgical procedures for women who have miscarried a baby, such as dilation and curettage procedures. However, Franciscan would be unwilling to offer the same service if the goal of the procedure was to terminate a pregnancy.
Of those employees, approximately 60 are physicians and 15 are advanced practice providers. Specialty Physicians offers the same type of insurance to its employees as Franciscan. Thus, Specialty Physicians will face the same penalties as Franciscan for exercising its religious beliefs regarding its insurance policy under the Regulation.

discrimination is ambiguous because it fails to explicitly address transgender individuals and the Rule simply fills the statutory gap, implementing Section 1557. The precise question at issue in this case is: What constitutes Title IX sex discrimination? The text of Section 1557 is neither silent nor ambiguous as to its interpretation of sex discrimination.

In Chaloux, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin county officials from garnishing their governmental benefits pursuant to state garnishment proceedings.

BACKGROUND *2 1. This action was filed on August 15, 1988. It challenges certain policies and practices of the defendant officials of the Connecticut Department of Correction which pertain to education concerning the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”), counselling prior and subsequent to testing for HIV-infection, medical and mental health care provided to inmates with HIV-infection, and protections for the confidentiality of the identities of inmates with HIV–infection.
A notation that the review took place along with a listing of any recommendations resulting from the review shall be entered in the inmate’s medical and mental health files. The DOC has permitted some HIV-infected inmates to participate in HIV support groups in certain facilities. The decision whether and to what extent to permit inmates to participate in such groups depends upon several factors, including the number of inmates requesting participation, the size of the facility, the space limitations of the facility, classification status of the inmate, security concerns of the facility, availability of staff to monitor the meetings, frequency of the meetings, behavior of inmates at the meetings, etc.
STAFF EDUCATION. The Department of Correction will provide to all of its employees a minimum of one hour of training annually on HIV-related subjects. This training will be provided by health services personnel or by others (teachers, counselors, training officers, etc.)
INTRODUCTION 1. This is a consolidated class action commenced in 1980 by individual pro se plaintiffs who were incarcerated at the Connecticut Correctional Institution at Sozaers (""Somers""). in July 1986, the class was certified as all present and future inmates confined at the Connecticut Correctional Institution at Somers.

An amended Motion for Class Certification was granted in October 1991. First as individual complaints and then as a consolidated matter, this action has been pending in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut since 1980, alleging overcrowding and unconstitutional conditions of confinement at Somers. Defendants have denied the allegations.
Compromise Nature of Settlement. This Settlement Agreement embodies a compromise of the issues involved in this case. Its provisions are not to be construed as a concession by the defendants that the operation of this correctional facility at a population level greater than 1436 or above a medium security level constitutes a constitutional violation, nor as a concession by the plaintiffs that the operation of this correctional facility at a population level of 1436 or a medium security level cannot constitute a constitutional violation.

348,PC-DC-0003,"In 1986, the prisoners at the Occoquan Facilites of the District of Columbia's Lorton Correctional Complex filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the District of Columbia government officials' overcrowding of the facility violated their Eighth Amendment rights. The court held that the defendants had violated the constitution, and required that the prison minimize its population. The case closed in 2003. ","Plaintiffs1 claims also arise directly under the Fifth and Eighth Amendments._ The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331 and 28 U.S.C. §1343(a)(3). Venue in the District Court for the District of Columbia is proper. Defendants Marion S. Barry and James E. Palmer reside in the District of Columbia and each of the claims for relief arose in this district.
The medical team is understaffed, particularly after 4 p.m. when there is one physician's assistant for all of Occoquan and after midnight there is no coverage at all. The medical services at Occoquan III are particularly inadequate. There is no medical staffing after 4 p.m. or on weekends.
829 *829 STARR, Circuit Judge: This case ushers us into the sensitive and difficult arena of prison-conditions litigation. In the wake of a prison riot, a number of inmates at the District of Columbia's facilities in Occoquan, Virginia, brought suit in federal district court, challenging their conditions of confinement as violative of the Eighth Amendment. The District Court sustained the challenge and entered a remedy imposing a population cap on the Occoquan facilities.
For the reasons that follow, we are constrained to conclude that the District Court's analysis as to liability and its conclusions with respect to remedy failed to comport with governing Supreme Court precedent.

I A Seventeen inmates of Occoquan filed this class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1982), alleging that conditions at the prison violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The inmates promptly sought class certification and a preliminary injunction imposing a limit on the number of prisoners who could be housed at Occoquan. Nine days later, the District Court heard arguments and, at day's end, granted plaintiffs' motions for class certification and preliminary injunction.
The District failed to take remedial action, and the inmate population continued to swell.... In September, the District court found that the District had deliberately failed to obey its orders concerning overcrowding at the Jail and held the District in civil contempt. See Campbell v. McGruder, C.A No. 1462-71 (D.D.C Sept.
Among the improvements, over 1300 new fire retardant mattresses had been ordered, window screens had been installed on all dormitory windows theretofore lacking them, and medical staff had been increased from one to three full-time physicians.
The District also reported that it had implemented a number of new procedures. The prison had in place (1) new general housekeeping procedures to ensure sanitary conditions; . (2) a routine fire inspection schedule; .
OPINION JUNE L. GREEN, District Judge. Plaintiffs, inmates confined at the District of Columbia's Occoquan Facility of the Lorton Correctional Complex, brought this action claiming violations of their eighth amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that an excessive inmate population; deficiencies in environmental health and safety; food services; fire safety; medical and dental services; and mental health care, alone or in combination, violate the eighth amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
As a remedy, the Court imposed an institution population cap of 1,281 and subjected each of the nineteen housing units within the Occoquan Facility to individual population caps. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded, finding that the population cap was too broad a remedy. Inmates of Occoquan v. Barry, 844 F.2d 828, 844 (D.C.Cir.1988).

The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, contending that an excessive inmate population, deficiencies in environmental health and safety, food services, fire safety; medical and dental services; and mental health care, alone or in combination, violated the eighth amendment's ban against cruel punishment. In 1986, the District Court entered a population cap on each of the nineteen housing units within the OcCoquan facility and imposed a population limit on the total number of prisoners to no more than 1,281 by June 1, 1987.

The District Court granted class certification and a preliminary injunction imposing a limit on the number of prisoners who could be housed at the facility.

350,PC-DE-0008,"Four overdetained former Delaware prisoners, represented by private counsel, filed this § 1983 action against the Delaware Department of Corrections (DDOC) and Central Offender Records (COR). The plaintiffs claimed that inadequate staff, training, discipline, and hours of operation, along with a host of other policies, caused dysfunction and frequent over-detention. The plaintiffs brought suit individually and as a class on behalf of all those incarcerated in a DDOC facility as of October 1, 2008 or later who were not or will not be released within 12 hours of the expiration of their sentence or the forwarding of a court order for release. In 2015, the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment because the plaintiffs' failed to demonstrate that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the overdetention problem. On appeal, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the defendants. The case is now closed.","THE WELL KNOWN OVER-DETENTION PROBLEM 62. The Defendants have known since at least 2008 that the DDOC has a practice of over-detaining detainees and inmates past their release dates. A Wilmington News Journal written by Sean O'Sullivan on reported outrage by all four Delaware gubernatorial candidates over the fact that 29 inmates had mistakenly been released in the past year and a half because of DOC errors.

The DOC this week also released the amount the State paid to an inmate who claimed in a Federal civil lawsuit that he was improperly held for 5 years past his release date. Jerome K. Hamilton received $125,000.00 in September, 2007 to settle his case. Defendants Danberg, Escherich, and McBride have long known that DDOC employees working with release records in COR and elsewhere at DDOC are instructed not to respond to any inquiries by inmates.

As a result, an inmate who believes he has been illegally over-detained because of a misinterpretation of his sentence, or a delay in processing his release, has no ability to obtain information concerning the problem from COR. Thus such inmates are denied access to the Courts. The Defendants are aware that the Court will not grant an over- detained or illegally incarcerated inmate relief unless they provide the Court the information, which DDOC refuses to provide directly to inmates.

Plaintiffs are aware of two other pending cases in this court, which address, in part, defendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of the members of the Over-detention Class. The first case is Nancy Dinote v. Carl C. Danberg, eta!., C.A. No.: 12-377-GMS, which in addition to a claim that Ms. Dinote was over-detained for nearly a day, also contains a claim involving equal protection and allegations of serious physical injury. The second case, Errol Springer v. Carl C. Danberg, eta!, C.A. No.: 12-392-GMS includes a claim that false testimony by a probation officer was initially responsible for plaintiffs illegal incarceration in addition to claims that dysfunction in COR contributed to his over-detention of two years and eleven months.

On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, similarly finding that no violation of the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments. ","Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia (January 6, 2019) Before ROSENBAUM, BRANCH, and TJOFLAT, Circuit Judges. BRANCH, Circuit Judge: After being sexually assaulted by a fellow inmate at Rodgers State Prison, Darius Green brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, against Georgia Department of Corrections (“GDC”) employees Warden Bradley Hooks, Deputy Warden of Security John Brown, and Lieutenant Torie Grubbs (collectively, “the prison officials”). First, Green asserted that the prison officials were deliberately indifferent to the risk of harm against Green, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.

Second, under a theory of supervisory liability, Green alleged that the prison officials proximately caused Green’s injuries.1 The prison officials filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that they did not violate the Constitution and that they were nevertheless immune from suit because they are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the prison officials, finding that no constitutional violation had occurred. The district court also dismissed Green’s supervisory liability claims.
Alternatively, the district court found that the prison officials were entitled to qualified immunity.
Green appealed.
After careful review of the record and with the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the prison officials.
1 Green also initially brought a conspiracy claim against Lieutenant Grubbs, but later abandoned it.
This investigation began almost immediately (mere hours after the assault occurred), and Green’s interview with an Internal Affairs Investigator took place at 12:30 p.m. on September 22, 2012. The investigation substantiated Green’s allegations of sexual assault. Warden Hooks then referred the investigation to the GDC Internal Affairs Investigation unit, and a full investigation was conducted.
Green also sued other prison employees in Green v. Calhoun (“Green II”). The two cases were consolidated. Following discovery and by stipulation, certain defendants (including all Green II defendants) and other claims (including the conspiracy claim against Lieutenant Grubbs) were dismissed.
Two claims against Warden Hooks, Deputy Warden Brown, and Lieutenant Grubbs survived dismissal: (1) Defendants violated Green’s Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and (2) Defendants are liable under the theory of supervisory liability.12 The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Warden Hooks, Deputy Warden Brown, and Lieutenant Grubbs, holding that the Defendants did not violate any constitutional rights. The court also found that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Green’s supervisory-liability claims similarly failed because Defendants did not violate Green’s constitutional rights.
Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and whether they are liable under the theory of supervisory liability. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the prison officials. III.
The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of “cruel and unusual punishments.” U.S Const. amend VIII.

No. 4:03-cv-40522-JEG-CFB ORDER GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR DEFENDANTS Plaintiffs, now represented by counsel, bring this case under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Defendants wrongfully disciplined them for their involvement in Church of the New Song (CONS).
They seek declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages. This case was stayed on February 22, 2005, pending the outcome of Wycoff v. Brewer, No. 4:05-cv-00068 (S.D. Iowa) (recaptioned Smith v. Ault).
On April 2, 2009, the Honorable Robert W. Pratt entered an order in Smith v. Ault, granting prison officials relief from previous injunctions that allowed inmate members of CONS to exercise their religion equally with other religions and that allowed CONS inmate-ministers to visit segregated CONS inmates. In light of the ruling in Smith v. Ault, this Court lifted the stay, and Defendants moved for summary judgment. Plaintiffs did not file a resistance, and the Court, on its own motion, extended the time for Plaintiffs to resist the motion.
SUMMARY OF MATERIAL FACTS The following facts are undisputed or taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are inmates who, during the time relevant to the complaint, were incarcerated at the Iowa State Penitentiary (ISP) in Fort Madison, Iowa. They are Jacob Voshell, Jeff Winters, Burt Smith, Louie Jales, Scott Fleming, David Baber, Joseph Ewig, Bryan Keller, Wayne Quillen, Jr., Michael Joslin, Clayton Gregory, Richard Whitney, Thomas Keith, James Hall, and Kristopher Johnson.
The ruling in Smith v. Ault was not appealed. Plaintiffs in the instant case were disciplined for violating prison rules against gang activity. They allege Defendants’ acts were really in retaliation for their exercise of CONS beliefs.
The punishments imposed included loss of good time or earned time, and none of the disciplinary decisions have been overturned. None of the Plaintiffs filed prison grievances that alleged the Defendant prison officials retaliated against them for exercising their religious rights. None of the Plaintiffs sustained physical injuries as a result of the allegations they raise in the complaint.
(3) Defendants did not file disciplinary reports against Plaintiffs in retaliation for protected activity; . (4) thirteen of the Plaintiffs’ requests for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot because those inmates are no longer at the prison; . (5) Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994); and (6) Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.
Judgment shall be entered in favor of Defendants. This case is dismissed. IT IS SO ORDERED.

","The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, for example, has concluded that the use of solitary confinement for punitive purposes can never be justified, given the disproportionate magnitude of suffering it imposes. Furthermore, the UN Special Rapporteur has held that more than 15 days in solitary confinement amounts to torturous, cruel, and unusual punishment. For this reason, the UN Special Rapporteur recommends that such sentences be abolished in all cases, even where isolation is determined to be absolutely necessary for protecting the safety of prisoners and staff.

Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ complaint adequately alleges deliberate indifference on Baldwin’s part. As such, the Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to dismiss. Due Process In raising a procedural due process claim, an inmate must show that “(1) he has a liberty or property interest that the state has interfered with; and (2) the procedures he was afforded upon that deprivation were constitutionally deficient.”
Such conditions state a claim for an “atypical and significant hardship” at this stage of the case. Further, Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that Defendant failed to provide them with their due process protections.

BACKGROUND Plaintiffs are Muslim inmates housed in the CMU of the FCI. [Dkts.
No. 2:09-cv-215 JMS-WGH Second Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Introduction 1. Plaintiffs John Lindh, Brian Carr, and A li Asad Chandia are Muslim prisoners confined to the Comm unications Management Unit (“CMU”) at the Federa l Correction Institution in Terre Haute, Indiana. The majority of the prisoners in the unit are Muslim.
The defendant’s prohibition on congregate worship imposes a substantial burden on plaintiffs’ exercise of religion and neither furthers a compelling governmental interest nor represents the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. It theref ore violates the Relig ious Freedom Restoration Act (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1. Appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief is requested.
Parties 6. John Lindh, Brian Carr, and Ali Asad Chandia are adult persons currently confined in the CMU at the Federal Correctional Institution in Terre Haute, Indiana. The Warden of the Fede ral Correctional Institution, Terre Haute, Indiana, is sued pursuant to Rule 17(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and is the duly appointed Warden of the Institution.
One of the four orthodox schools of Islamic jurisprudence holds that group prayer is mandatory and not merely preferred. All plaintiffs are Sunni Muslims who believe that group daily prayer is a religious requirement. Therefore, whenever p ossible, Muslims will p ray together during th e five daily prayers.
107 at 11]. In June 2009, following the issuance of the Warden’s memorandum, two Muslim CMU prisoners, Enaam Arnaout and Randall Royer, filed suit against the Warden alleging that the Warden’s policy on group prayer violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. A year later, Mr. Lindh joined Mr. Arnaout in filing an Amended Complaint against the Warden.
In sum, Mr. Lindh has demonstrated that his rights under RFRA are violated by the CMU’s total ban on daily group prayer, and the Warden has failed to establish either that the ban is justified by a compelling interest or that it is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental interest Mr. Lindh is therefore entitled to appropriate relief. What Relief Should B e Granted to Mr. Lindh Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act? RFRA provides that a “person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim... in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.”
[Dkt. The new policy no longer allows prisoners to meet together in a common room three times a day to pray, but rather permits inmate group prayer “only in their assigned cell with a second inmate so long as one of the inmates is assigned to the cell and it does not interfere with the safe, secure, and orderly running of the institution.”

In 2016 one of the prisoners tried to reopen the case since prison officials were violating the settlement agreement, but the judge refused to reopen the case.","From 2003 to June 30, 2007, UMCHP provided medical and mental health services to prisoners in DOC facilities.1 This matter is now before the Court on DLC’s motion to compel production of documents by UMCHP, which has asserted that the documents are protected by the psychotherapist-patient privilege.2 For the following reasons, DLC’s motion is ALLOWED in part and DENIED in part, as set forth below. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND DLC commenced this case on March 8, 2007. (Docket No. 1).
at p. 2). On March 4, 2009, the District Court stayed the case while DLC and the DOC pursued settlement negotiations. On March 22, 2009, the District Court denied DLC’s motion to compel documents without prejudice.
DLC had also provided UMCHP with a release from the executor for the estate of another inmate that expired prior to the production of documents. UMCHP argued that the release is therefore not valid. DLC maintained that the release had not expired at the time it was provided to UMCHP and therefore is valid.
Without conceding any infirmity in their claims or defenses, the parties have engaged III extensive and arms length settlement negotiations to resolve the claims raised by this action. Plaintiff and Defendants have reached an agreement for settling this litigation. The parties believe that this agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to protect the interests of all parties.
MEMORANDUM AND ORDER WOLF, D.J. INTRODUCTION This case was brought in March, 2007, following reports of a number of suicides by mentally ill prisoners in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Correction (the ""Department""), including many held in segregated confinement. Plaintiff Disability Law Center (the ""DLC"") represents all Massachusetts prisoners with mental illnesses.
The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.
In November, 2007, in the context of the Department's independent initiatives to improve conditions for mentally ill inmates in correctional facilities, the parties began attempting to settle this case. In 2008, they asked the court to conduct a settlement conference. This court has long believed that the settlement of cases involving the constitutionality of the conduct of public officials is important in our democracy.
The parties' initial two-year effort to negotiate a settlement was frustrated by a fiscal crisis that constrained the Department's ability to agree to certain reforms.
However, they eventually resumed settlement discussions. In December, 2011, the parties informed the court that they had agreed to a comprehensive Settlement Agreement (the ""Agreement""). The Agreement, however, does not become effective unless the court approves it and agrees to retain jurisdiction over the case.
These reforms were based on recommendations made by the Department's expert consultant on prison suicide prevention, Dr. Lindsay M. Hayes. The parties began attempting to settle this case in November, 2007. In 2008, they asked the court to try to mediate a settlement.
Expressing its previously described confidence that such constitutional cases are best resolved by the agreement of the parties themselves, the court accepted the parties' invitation to mediate their settlement discussions.4 However, as also discussed earlier, the court urged the parties to reach an agreement that would not unnecessarily involve the court in prison administration and would only require judicial action as a last resort.
This involved, among other things, visits by DLC and its experts to several Department facilities, and interviews with more than 100 inmates. The parties eventually privately resumed their settlement discussions. On December 12, 2011, after years of discovery, litigation, and negotiations, the parties reported that they had reached a settlement and requested the court's approval of their Agreement.
Except in certain circumstances, the Agreement prohibits the placement of inmates with serious mental illness in Departmental Disciplinary Units, a form of segregation, and limits the use of other forms of segregation of inmates with serious mental illness.
However, the Agreement makes no provision for such fees. Moreover, the Agreement obligates the plaintiff to pay the expense of the monitoring required by the Agreement. In addition, three of the entities that will be receiving counsel fees DLC, Prisoners' Legal Services, and the Center for Public Representation – are public interest organizations that will use the payments that they receive in service of their missions.
C.A No. 07-10463-MLW MEMORANDUM AND ORDER WOLF, D.J. On May 20, 2015, plaintiff Disability Law Center (the ""DLC""), and defendants, Massachusetts Department of Correction and certain DOC officials (together, the ""DOC""), stipulated to the dismissal of this action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41 (a) (1) (A) (ii), pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by the court on April 12, 2012. See Docket No. 265; Disability Law Center v. Massachusetts Department of Correction, 960 F. Supp.
In essence, as this case was not a class action, Aldrich was not a party to it. Moreover, as requested by the parties, this case was dismissed in 2015. Therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to grant the requested relief even to a party.

360,PC-MA-0046,"In November 2015, plaintiff inmates with hearing disabilities sued the Massachusetts Department of Correction and the Massachusetts Partnership for Correctional Healthcare under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Constitution of the United States. After mediation, the parties settled in 2019. Enforcement of the settlement remains in effect for a period of three years.","INTRODUCTION 1. This is a class action lawsuit based on the willful and deliberate refusal of the Defendants to comply with federal laws protecting the rights of Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Correction (“DOC”). The Defendants named in this case have failed to comply with federal law, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq., the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1 et seq., and the Constitution of the United States.
STATEMENT OF FACTS 25. For more than ten years, deaf and hard of hearing prisoners, including Plaintiffs, have been seeking accommodations from the DOC. These prisoners’ continuing efforts, assisted by advocates and attorneys at Prisoners’ Legal Services (“PLS”), have included direct correspondence with DOC administrators, grievances, and Requests for Reasonable Accommodation of Special Needs filed per DOC policy (103 DOC 207).
The only telecommunications method currently available for deaf prisoners in the DOC are telecommunications devices for the deaf (“TDDs”), and even these are provided only on a limited basis in select facilities. TDDs are electronic devices for text communication via a telephone line to enable people with hearing and speech disabilities to communicate by phone. TDDs are also called teletypewriters (“TTYs”).
”3 The FCC further acknowledges that some facilities have installed videophones and other forms of TRS, often as a result of litigation based on federal statutes, but strongly encourages facilities to make the necessary changes voluntarily without further litigation.4 49. Deaf individuals in DOC custody have repeatedly requested videophone access, but have been denied this access. Plaintiff Briggs and his advocates in the community have been pursuing this issue with DOC officials for well over five years.
a) Interpreters for Access to Medical Services 83.
The DOC and MPCH are responsible for the medical care of all individuals incarcerated in DOC facilities. Deaf and hard of hearing individuals who rely on ASL require sign language interpreters to communicate accurately and effectively with medical staff. Others who rely on lip-reading require oral interpreters or other auxiliary devices.
Absent proper accommodations, prisoners are denied the ability to defend themselves and may be punished without complete understanding of the disciplinary sanctions the hearing officer renders, which may include a period of solitary confinement. At least three of the Plaintiffs have received disciplinary tickets as a result of being unable to hear count or other announcements due to their hearing disabilities; interpreters were not provided during the resulting disciplinary proceedings. In addition, some of the Plaintiffs have been placed in solitary confinement following the receipt of disciplinary tickets, but have not been afforded interpreters prior to the imposition of such a harsh punishment.
Other administrative proceedings in which individuals in DOC custody commonly participate relate to classification – the process by which prisoners are assigned to particular facilities – and parole – the process by which prisoners can be granted early release under the supervision of the Parole Board.
OPINION AND ORDER June 29, 2016 O’TOOLE, D.J. The plaintiffs contend that the Massachusetts Department of Correction (“DOC”), its officers, and its contracted provider of healthcare services, Massachusetts Partnership for Correctional Healthcare, fail to adequately accommodate the needs of deaf and hard of hearing inmates in the DOC’s custody, in violation of a number of statutory and constitutional rights. The plaintiffs have moved to certify a class of all present and future DOC inmates with hearing impairments.
That motion was fully briefed and the Court heard argument on the issues presented.
This Agreement may not be relied upon as precedent in any future claim XIX. ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s claim to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. If such negotiations are unsuccessful, Plaintiffs’ Counsel reserve all rights to seek reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, including fees and costs associated with those claims resolved by this Agreement, and DOC reserves all rights to oppose any such petition for fees and costs.
No other statement, promise, or agreement, either written or oral, made by any Party or agents of any Party this is not contained in this written Agreement, will be enforceable. This Agreement is the result of an arm’s-length negotiation. Since all Parties contributed substantially, materially, and cooperatively in drafting this Agreement, it shall not be more strictly construed against one Party than as against any other D.

The defendant argues that this was somehow something new that at long last justified approval of an ophthalmology consult after four years of denials. This is hogwash. First, Mr. Cobbs had been effectively blind in his left eye since at least early 2006.
Plaintiff-Appellee Dallas Cobbs brought a civil rights action against Pramstaller under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Pramstaller violated his Eighth Amendment rights by delaying cataract-removal surgery on his left eye for four years.
We reverse the district court’s decision. I. Cobbs is an inmate in the custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections (“MDOC”). In July 2004, doctors diagnosed Cobbs with cataracts in both of his eyes.
Notwithstanding these recommendations, prison officials, including Pramstaller, withheld approval of the surgery. In November 2007, Cobbs brought this lawsuit seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. During this period, Pramstaller served as Chief Medical Officer of the Michigan Department of Corrections.
period, Cobbs continued to file various health care requests and grievances complaining about his condition, to no avail. In October 2007, Cobbs filed this lawsuit. Pramstaller unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment on Cobbs’s claims against him, contending that his only involvement with the denial of Cobbs’s medical requests was attendance at the two Medical Committee meetings at which the Medical Committee denied Cobbs’s requests for surgery.

*1 Plaintiffs, Lamont Heard, William Johnson, Jamero Moses, and Anthony Nelson are prisoners incarcerated with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC). Plaintiffs allege that they are Muslims and participate in the fast from dawn until sunset each day during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Plaintiffs have sued Defendants alleging that, during the 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts, they were not provided the 2,900 calories of food per day required by MDOC policy.

In support of his contention, Heard relies on Ellis v. Vadlamudi, 568 F. Supp. In Siggers, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated his First Amendment rights by improperly rejecting his incoming mail on several occasions. The Sixth Circuit held that the plaintiff’s filing of a single September 16, 2006 grievance was insufficient to exhaust claims relating to several previous mail rejections that occurred many months before the grievance was filed and that the grievance was also insufficient to exhaust mail rejections that occurred after the plaintiff filed the grievance.
Plaintiffs Lamont Bernard Heard, William M. Johnson, Jamero T. Moses, and Anthony Lee Nelson, Muslim prisoners proceeding pro se, filed this civil rights action alleging, in part, that the defendants violated their First and Eighth Amendment rights by depriving them of adequate nutrition during their 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts by serving them a total of 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint or for summary judgment. A magistrate judge recommended granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, reasoning, in part, that the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims were barred by qualified immunity because there was no clearly established federal law that entitled the plaintiffs to the 2,900 calories a day allegedly mandated by MDOC policy.
The district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion, concluding that the plaintiffs could only obtain adequate nutrition by violating their religious beliefs. It thus reinstated the plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims. The defendants filed this interlocutory appeal, arguing that they are entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim, that the district court defined the constitutional issue too generally, and that there is no clearly established law dictating the number of calories that a prisoner must have per day during a thirty-day period.
Plaintiffs Heard, Johnson, Moses, and Nelson (herein known as “Plaintiffs”) are Muslim and members of the protected class; the Nation of Islam Prison Reform Ministry. The Plaintiffs sincerely held beliefs are found in the Holy Qur’an, the divine scriptures of the Muslims. One of the tenets of Plaintiffs sincerely held beliefs mandates that they fast during the daylight hours of the Arabic Lunar month of Ramadan.
Defendants placed a substantial burden on the practice of the religious beliefs of the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs exhausted their administrative remedies. Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity, see Welch v. Spaulding, Case No. 14cv-2050, --Fed.Appx.","In 2012, a Muslim prisoner in the custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, alleging that the MDOC failed to provide adequate nutrition to Muslim prisoners observing Ramadan.

And what is MDOC's involvement in that 13 kind of cycle of treatment from the medical all the 14 way up through the psychiatric care that you've 15 described? Notification. So anytime an inmate has attempted 18 autocastration, MDOC is notified of that?
What is it? It's portions of the contract between 19 Corizon Health and Missouri Department of 20 Corrections. And is this portion of that contract, is 22 this also portions generated by Corizon?
What is your understanding? We are the health care vendor for the 24 Missouri Department of Corrections.

366,PC-MS-0007,"In 2013, prisoners in the East Mississippi Correctional Facility (EMCF) filed a class-action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Mississippi Department of Corrections, claiming that EMCF violated the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the inhumane living conditions at EMCF, a prison for the mentally ill, harmed inmates. In 2015, the court granted class certification. After engaging in discovery and a bench trial, the parties attempted to settle. After the parties submitted their supplemental expert reports, the parties attempted to settle. However, on January 24, 2019, the parties notified the court that the parties were unable to settle and that future settlement conferences would not be productive. As of March 25, 2019, the case is ongoing.","INTRODUCTION 1. This is a class action filed on behalf of prisoners confined at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility (EMCF) near Meridian, Mississippi. EMCF was designed as the facility intended to provide treatment for Mississippi's seriously mentally ill prisoners in a safe, humane, and therapeutic environment.
DEFENDANTS 22. Defendant CHRISTOPHER EPPS is Commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. By statute, MDOC is ""vested with the exclusive responsibility for management and control of the correctional system, and all properties belonging thereto, subject only to the limitations of this chapter, and shall be responsible for the management of affairs of the correctional system and for the proper care, treatment, feeding, clothing and management of the offenders confined therein.""

Correctional health expert Madeleine LaMarre visited EMCF in January 2011 to evaluate medical care pursuant to the Order of Dismissal in Presley v Epps. At the time, medical care was provided by GEO. In nearly every aspect of care assessed, she found gross deficiencies Ms. LaMarre found care by the on-site physician to be so poor that she recommended that he be ""immediately removed from the facility and replaced..."" 115 Ms. LaMarre also found inadequate levels of staffing as well as maJor deficiencies in medical record-keeping.20 116.
The ultrasound technician noticed an abnormality and was so concerned that he called the prison to see if Mr. Neihaus could see a doctor right away. Prison officials refused. Anxious and in pain, over the next three weeks, Mr. Neihaus repeatedly asked prison officials to show him the results.
James Kendrick 182. James Kendrick is held in long-term solitary confinement. On Thursday March 21, 2013, he noticed a pimple on his arm.
For example, in September 2012, Plaintiff McAbee submitted an ARP seeking proper care for his HIV infection and hypertension Mr. McAbee already had another ARP pending at that time Mr. McAbee was told that he would have to withdraw the ARP seeking medical care because the staff member responsible for processing ARPs told him that there was a policy that he could only submit one ARP at a time. No such policy exists in the Mississippi Department of Corrections. However, Mr. McAbee, believing what he was told by staff, withdrew one of the ARPs but had no means of determining which one he withdrew.
To address this problem, up-grades were made to the computer system that electronically monitors the cell doors/locks, and policies were implemented by which cell doors are manually tested by guards when prisoners are returned to their cells. In addition to changes being made with respect to the physical conditions and security at the facility, changes were also made with respect to the provision of medical and mental care. For example, as of February of 2018, the medical area was expanded to include more space/beds and personnel to treat medical emergencies.
In 2012, several individuals, who were later designated by Plaintiffs as experts in this case, toured the facility and reviewed prison records. Based on the then-existing conditions, Plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit alleging that the conditions under which they were being confined violated their Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Through their lawsuit, Plaintiffs seek to correct the alleged constitutional violations by way of injunctive relief.
After the MDOC learned of the bribery/kickback scheme, it rescinded the contract with Health Assurance, LLC, and entered a new contract with Centurion of Mississippi (“Centurion”) to provide healthcarerelated services at EMCF. Centurion began providing both medical and mental health care services at the prison in July of 2015. The allegations in the Complaint are divided into several categories, the first of which is “Solitary Confinement”.
Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291, 1304 (5th Cir. Here, Plaintiffs claim that the length of time some prisoners are held in solitary confinement violates their Eighth Amendment rights. On this issue, several Plaintiffs testified that they had been held in solitary confinement/isolation for extended periods of time.
The pretrial phase of this litigation was long based on the multiple requests for extensions of time that were granted to each side during the discovery and pre-trial stages of this case, and the multiple complex matters that were raised and needed to be resolved by the Court for the case to proceed. As the case neared trial, the Court encouraged the parties to explore settlement possibilities. The attorneys met on multiple occasions with the magistrate judge to try to settle the case without success.

368,PC-NJ-0015,"This was a prison medical care case filed in 2002 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking damages and an injunction against contract medical care providers and New Jersey corrections officials.  The plaintiffs that the New Jersey prison system was failing to treat them for Hepatitis C.  By the time the court adjudicated the class action issue, in May 2008, the New Jersey Department of Corrections had adopted major changes in how prisoners with HCV were treated; it updated its procedures to match those of the federal Bureau of Prisons, and ""backscreened"" all the prisoners willing to be screened for the virus.  Given that the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs was this same set of reforms, Judge Hillman denied the request for injunctive relief as moot.  As to two individual class members who had HCV, the court held there was sufficient evidence in the record to go to trial on their constitutional claims (though not on their Americans with Disabilities Act claims), and denied the state's motion for summary judgment.  In October 2009, the case settled for money damages.  (However, it seems from some papers filed by one of the plaintiffs that he may never actually have received  his money.  But when he sought the assistance of the court in enforcing the settlement against his lawyer, Judge Hillman ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction, and directed him to file a collection action in state court.  )","virus (“HCV”) while Plaintiffs were incarcerated in New Jersey State prisons in deliberate indifference to their serious medical needs in violation of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S Constitution. They also brought claims for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.A. § 12131, et seq. (“ADA”).3 This Opinion addresses the following outstanding motions: Motion to Certify Class (together with Motion for Leave to File an Overlength Brief Nunc Pro Tunc in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification); Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs’ Claim for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief; Motion for Summary Judgment as to Claims by Royal and Lacey, and as to Plaintiffs’ ADA Claims (together with Motion to Seal Certain Documents in Support of Motions for Summary Judgment); and Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendant George Hayman.
III. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on October 16, 2002. On July 25, 2003, an Amended Complaint was filed, and on August 27, 2003, a Second Amended Complaint was filed which is the current version.4 In their Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants knowingly exposed Plaintiffs to HCV while Plaintiffs were incarcerated in New Jersey State prisons.
As a result, Plaintiffs argue that inmates who have HCV have had their condition remain undiagnosed and untreated, and have exposed other inmates to the virus. The parties agree that HCV is a serious medical condition. See Ellis v. Mohenis Services Inc., No. 96-6307, 1998 WL 564478, at *3 n.2 (E.D.Pa Aug.
DISCUSSION This Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over cases that are moot and, therefore, we first address the issue of whether Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief is justiciable if Defendants have adopted current Federal Bureau of Prison (“FBOP”) guidelines for the management of HCV, and if all NJDOC inmates have been “back-screened.” For the reasons explained below, Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief is denied as moot. A. MOOTNESS In examining whether this case should be dismissed on grounds of mootness, we must determine whether Plaintiffs had a live controversy when they filed suit, and if so, whether the relief provided by Defendants during the pendency of this litigation rendered the injunctive relief requested moot.6 6 In a class action context, special rules regarding mootness apply.
Thus, based on the evidence provided, the Court finds that Defendants are following the FBOB Guidelines with respect to HCV treatment and are screening new inmates for HCV. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief asking the Court to intervene to provide a proper screening mechanism for new inmates is denied as moot. Although they admit that Defendants have adopted the FBOP Guidelines, the Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have not addressed the second prong of the mootness test because they “have not carried their burden to establish that there is no reasonable probability that the actual and threatened injuries Plaintiffs complained of at the beginning of the litigation have been completely and adequately resolved.”
CONCLUSION Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is denied.
The Defendants’ motions as to Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief are granted on the ground that Plaintiffs’ request for such relief is moot. The Defendants’ motions are denied as to the § 1983 claims but granted as to the ADA claims. Defendants’ motion to file an overlength brief and motion to seal are granted.
In Novinger, Plaintiff’s attorney requested a lien on the settlement prior to the conclusion of the case. The district court subsequently issued an order stating that the court would determine attorney’s fees at the conclusion of the case. Here, the court was informed by the parties that the matter had been settled, jurisdiction was not retained to resolve any outstanding issues, and Plaintiff moved for enforcement several months after settlement.

369,PC-NJ-0020,"On December 3, 2008, plaintiff, a prisoner who is an ordained Pentecostal minister, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the District of New Jersey under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc, et seq. (""RLUIPA"") against the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections and the Administrator at the New Jersey State Prison (NJSP). Specifically, plaintiff claimed that defendants violated plaintiff's First Amendment right by implementing a policy banning all prisoners from preaching in the prison.  During the litigation, the state changed its policy to allow the plaintiff to preach to groups of six or fewer prisoners, and on November 25, 2009, the parties filed a Stipulation of Dismissal, as the claims in the action had been resolved by the parties.","Far from disrupting security at NJSP, Mr. Thompson's activities have been praised by NJSP chaplains as helpful to the rehabilitation ofmany of those confined at NJSP. Last year, however, NJSP implemented a new policy without warning or justification that bans Mr. Thompson and all other inmates from preaching in the prison. NJSP's blanket prohibition on inmate preaching prevents Mr. Thompson from fulfilling his religious calling as a minister and a Pentecostal.
Because the policy is not the least restrictive means of advancing any compelling governmental interest, it violates Mr. Thompson's rights under RLUIPA.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc, et seq. (""RLUIPA""). This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.

This Court has jurisdiction to issue the declaratory relief requested pursuant to the Declaratory Relief Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202. Venue is proper in the District of New Jersey pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), because all parties reside within the District of New Jersey and the events described in this Complaint occurred in the District of New Jersey. PARTIES 4.
As an ordained minister in the Pentecostal faith, Mr. Thompson feels compelled by his sincerely held religious beliefs to preach and minister to other inmates. Defendant Michelle R. Ricci is employed by the New Jersey Department of Corrections (""NJ DOC"") as the Administrator ofNJSP. She is responsible for the daily operations ofNJSP, including all policies relating to prisoners' freedom to preach and minister to others inmates.
Ricci is sued in her official capacity.
Defendant George W. Hayman is the Commissioner ofthe NJ DOC. He is responsible for the overall operations of the prison facilities in the State ofNew Jersey, including NJSP. Hayman is sued in his official capacity.
NJSP receives financial assistance from the U.S. government. NJSP's policy banning inmate preaching, and its refusal to grant Plaintiff Thompson an accommodation under that policy, substantially burdens Mr. Thompson's religious exercise and sincerely held religious belief. NJSP's policy banning inmate preaching, and its refusal to grant Plaintiff Thompson an accommodation under that policy, is not the least restrictive means of furthering any compelling governmental interest.
D (attached thereto). To date, the Defendants have provided no explanation for the preaching ban. Indeed, at no point since implementing the ban has NJSP mentioned any justification or relevant incidents that might explain the prison's interest in this newfound policy.
at 35. From 1995 to 2003, the prison's chaplains allowed Mr. Spratt to preach during weekly services.
Although his preaching resulted in no disciplinary problems, in 2003 the prison prohibited him from continuing to preach Id. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment for the defendant department of corrections, id. at 37-43, and the defendant ultimately agreed to a settlement in July 2007 that allowed Mr. Spratt and other inmates to resume supervised preaching, see, e.g., Eric Tucker, ""R.I.
BACKGROUND A.
Factual Background Plaintiff Howard Thompson, Jr., is an inmate at the New Jersey State Prison (“NJSP”). Plaintiff brings suit against Michelle Ricci, the administrator of the NJSP; and George Hayman, the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections (“NJDOC”)(collectively “Defendants”). In 1986, Thompson was sentenced to thirty years-to-life in prison.
In October 2008, Plaintiff, through counsel, requested Defendants lift their ban on inmate-led preaching.
Plaintiff was dissatisfied with the response he received from NJDOC and filed the instant action, requesting a preliminary injunction forbidding Defendants from enforcing a blanket policy against inmate preaching, contending it violates his rights under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”). For the reasons stated below, Plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief is denied. DISCUSSION A.
Furthermore, injunctive relief is by its nature an extraordinary remedy which should be granted in limited circumstances. Frank’s GMC Truck Ctr., Inc., v Gen. Motors Corp., 847 F.2d 100, 102 (3d Cir.

Before FEINBERG, Chief Judge, NEWMAN and PRATT, Circuit Judges. FEINBERG, Chief Judge: This is an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) from an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, Michael A. Telesca, J., granting a preliminary injunction in a class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 challenging the conditions at the Special Housing Unit (SHU) at the Attica Correctional Facility. The preliminary injunction requires the defendants in the class action (appellants here) to provide mental health services at Attica in accordance with various specified procedures.
The court concluded that plaintiffs had made a showing of substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claim and that the potentially devastating effects of the SHU environment on a mentally ill inmate, as illustrated by Dzeilak's death, were sufficient to establish irreparable harm. The court then reissued its January 1987 injunctive order. This second appeal followed.
Because we find that the restricted grant of leave to intervene may be appealed after any final judgment in the underlying action, we dismiss the appeal. This is a class action alleging that the defendants, all state correction officials or prison authorities at Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York, have systematically violated the constitutional rights of the inmates of Attica's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a segregated and highly restricted disciplinary prison unit. The named plaintiffs are all inmates of New York State prisons who are presently confined in the Attica SHU or have been so confined in the recent past.
They sought to have a class certified under Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P., consisting of all persons who have been, are presently, or will in the future be, incarcerated in the SHU.
The class is large, transitory and its members are difficult to identify precisely, since the Board of Corrections has not made available the identities of all those confined in the SHU during the relevant period. Chief Judge John T. Curtin, then presiding over the case, certified the class on October 19, 1981. In their second amended class action complaint,[1] filed October 27, 1983, the inmates complain that the conditions under which they are confined are ""inhumane, intolerable and are not consistent with concepts of fundamental human decency.""
While discovery was underway, the inmates found that their situation was deteriorating. Specifically, they alleged that the conditions in the SHU and harassment by the prison guards led one Anthony John (""Mike"") Dzeilak, a mentally ill inmate of the SHU, to commit suicide on June 3, 1985. The inmates alleged that the corrections officers who work in the SHU were aware of Dzeilak's mental instability and that they deliberately beat him, provoked him and harassed him into taking his own life.

The seventh settlement conference occurred on July 7,1998.... he conferences were conducted primarily by Sarah Betsy Fuller, attorney for Plaintiff, Prisoners' Legal Services[,] and Anthony J. Annucci, deputy Commissioner and Counsel for the Department of Correctional Services.
There are a number of issues yet to >e resolved.
Among these is the plaintiffs' alleged right to participate in Sweat Lodge ceremonies. Thereafter, the parties continued settlement negotiations, pn March 24,1999, counsel for the parties appeared before the undersigned for a status conference. At that time, counsel informed the Court that they had ""reached i • agreement in principle,"" but that there were still certain unresolved matters, such as the i issue df whether or not inmates would be permitted to engage in Sweat Lodge ceremonies.

The matter in controversy arises under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 1983. Venue properly lies in the Western District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS 4.
Defendant Dave Unger Defendant Jim Lindsay Defendant
The main yard lacks a concrete jogging path around the perimeter of the yard, thereby denying plaintiffs an opportunity to exercise in a manner afforded to non-disabled prisoners. The gym area at Five Points is inaccessible to plaintiffs. There is no gym equipment accessible to wheelchair users and there is no accessible path of travel in the weight room.
It has a wide door with no grab-bars and the toilet is to low for safe transfers between plaintiffs’ wheelchairs and the toilet. The Recreation Pen (“Rec Pen”) is inaccessible to plaintiffs because there are several stairs which prevent plaintiffs from entering the area. The Rec Pen area is particularly hazardous to plaintiffs because the fire exit is blocked by an 8 to 10 inch stair.
The water fountains in the cells are inaccessible to plaintiffs because they are located too high off the floor. The walkways throughout the facility are not accessible to plaintiffs because such walkways are riddled with potholes and uneven slabs of cement. Doorways throughout the facility are inaccessible because they are constructed with high thresholds that are difficult for plaintiffs to safely traverse.
Hence, plaintiffs are forced to sit sideways at the mess hall tables, or to hold a tray of hot liquids and foods on their laps while sitting in the aisles. The exterior doors throughout Orleans are inaccessible to plaintiffs because they require greater force to push or pull open than is reasonably possible to exert while seated in a wheelchair. Orleans personnel discriminate against plaintiffs by providing and coordinating recreational programs for non-disabled inmates, but failing to provide or coordinate recreational programs for plaintiffs.
As a result, plaintiffs are unable to properly maintain their personal hygiene. The law library at Attica is inaccessible to plaintiffs. The library is constructed and arranged in a narrow and restrictive manner that prevents plaintiffs from reasonably maneuvering their wheelchairs in the law library.
GREEN HAVEN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY 137. Green Haven Correctional Facility (“Green Haven”) is a maximum security prison located in Stormville, New York. The toilets in Green Haven’s Protective Custody Housing unit are not accessible to plaintiffs because they lack the necessary handrails to facilitate plaintiffs’ transfer between plaintiffs’ wheelchairs and the toilets.
Further, the Court is not persuaded that the limitations expressed by Defendants, with the exception of limiting the class to declaratory and injunctive relief, are necessary. Therefore, the Court certifies the following class: “Plaintiffs and all prisoners in the custody of the New York State Department of Correctional and Community Supervision who suffer from a mobility disability limiting one or more of the prisoner’s major life activities and that requires the use of a wheelchair.” The Court finds no basis at this juncture to limit the class to only the facilities alleged in the complaint.

The case was consolidated to include the complaints of two other prisoners. The prisoners won both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to provide them a Kosher diet at no personal cost. The permanent injunction, issued February 8, 2006, ordered the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections 'to immediately provide to the plaintiffs Kosher diets at no cost, [while complying with nutritional requirements currently applicable to all other ODOC prisoners].' On September 26, 2012 the Court found that the judgment entered in this case only applies to the claims pursued by the three named plaintiffs, and the permanent injunction relief does not apply to all Oklahoma Department of Corrections inmates. ","In Beerheide v. Suthers, 286 F.3d 1179(lOth Cir. 2002), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the United States District Court for the District ofColorado 's decision that, consistent with the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, the Colorado Department of Corrections must provide a kosher diet to its Jewish inmates following the dietary restrictions of Orthodox Judaism with no monetary contribution from the inmates. Applying the fourfactor test established in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78(1987), for evaluating the constitutional validity of prison regulations that burden constitutional rights of inmates, the Third and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have reached similar conclusions that a kosher diet must be provided to an inmate that satisfies the inmate's Orthodox ludaism dietary restrictions.
CIV-03-99-W consolidated with CIV-03-125-W consolidated with CIV-03-1465-W SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION1 Plaintiffs, who are three state prisoners appearing with court-appointed counsel, Mr. Rand Eddy, each filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction in these 42 U.S.C. §1983 civil rights actions, to which Defendant Director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections has responded. Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction ordering the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (“DOC”) to provide them with kosher meals free of cost to them. The matter has been referred to the undersigned Magistrate Judge for initial proceedings consistent with 28 U.S.C. §636(b)(1)(B).
Analysis under Turner There is judicial precedent in this and other circuits supporting Plaintiffs’ assertion of a First Amendment right to receive a kosher diet consistent with their sincere religious beliefs. Three Colorado inmates sought a preliminary injunction in 1996 in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado alleging a constitutional and statutory right to receive a kosher diet. In Beerheide v. Zavaras, 997 F.Supp.
Following the entry of the preliminary injunction, the Colorado DOC instituted a kosher diet program and proposed to the court that the inmate-plaintiffs be required to make a copayment of no more than 25% of the additional cost of the kosher meals. A trial was subsequently conducted in the district court on the issue of the sincerity of the religious beliefs of two of the inmate-plaintiffs and on the constitutionality of the Colorado DOC’s proposed program of cost-sharing for inmates desiring a kosher diet. Beerheide v. Suthers, 82 F.Supp.2d 1190 (D.Colo.

The controversy in each case centered on the refusal of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (""DOC"") to provide a Kosher diet. On January 21, 2005, a preliminary injunction was granted and the DOC was ordered to provide these three plaintiffs a Kosher diet at no cost.

The cases were then re-referred to United States Magistrate Judge Gary M. Purcell for further proceedings, including a determination whether permanent injunctive relief was warranted. The matter now comes before the Court on Magistrate Judge Purcell's Third Supplemental Report and Recommendation and on the Motion to Dismiss filed by Justin Jones, in his official capacity as DOC Director.

CLOSED,CONSOL,PURCELL U.S. District Court Western District of Oklahoma[LIVE] (Oklahoma City) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE 5:03−cv−00099−W","On January 26, 2006, three inmates of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (ODOC) filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under title 42, section 1983 of the United States Code. The plaintiffs alleged that the ODOC was violating their rights to freely exercise their Orthodox Jewish religion as guaranteed by the first amendment by failing to provide them with Kosher diets that complied with all nutritional requirements and standards currently applicable to the diets served to all other inmates in ODOC custody. On February 28, 2006, the Court entered a perm anent injunction ordering the defendant, Justin Jones, to provide to the plaintiffs Kosher diets at no cost. Nothing in the Judgment provided that it would be enforceable by all ODOC inmates. As of January 1, 2006, the compensation rate for attorneys appointed to represent persons eligible under the Criminal Justice Act was $92.00 in non- capital cases and $163.00 in federal capital prosecutions and post-conviction proceedings.","In 1996, three inmates of the Colorado Department of Corrections filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado alleging a constitutional and statutory right to receive a kosher diet in violation of the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. In 2002, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the district court's decision in Beerheide v. Suthers, 286 F.3d 1179(lOth Cir. 2002). The defendants appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court. On May 16, 2003, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. The case was consolidated and the parties agreed to a settlement agreement. The parties agreed that the defendants would pay the plaintiffs no more than 25% of the additional cost of the kosher meals. On January 21, 2005, a preliminary injunction was granted and the defendants were ordered to provide these plaintiffs a Kosher diet at no cost."

Her request for a TRO and preliminary injunction were denied at the district court level, and the circuit court affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction without comment on the TRO for lack of jurisdiction. On April 3, 2015, the district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss, dismissing the claims against all defendants in their individual capacities without prejudice, and all the claims against them in their official capacity with prejudice.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION Plaintiff, a state prisoner appearing pro se, brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging various violations of her constitutional rights. United States District Judge Timothy D. DeGiusti had referred the matter to the undersigned Magistrate Judge for the preparation and submission of proposed findings and recommendations as to dispositive matters referenced in 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and (B).
In the declaration supporting her motion, Plaintiff does not address her efforts to notify the Defendants of the application or provide any reasons for her inability to provide such notice. As a result, it is recommended that the motion for a temporary restraining order be denied. Commercial Security Bank, 456 F.2d at 1356 (reversing the district court's issuance of a temporary restraining order in part because the court had failed to comply with Fed R. Civ P. 65(b)).

She complains about a lack of adequate hormonal treatment, but concedes that she received no such treatment from 1988 to 2011 or 2012.

But Dr. McCurdy did prescribe Plaintiff filed a third RTS to Dr. McCurdy on June 27, 2013, requesting an increase in dosage of both Estradiol, and Spironolactone. She also requested vaginoplasty surgery. (SR 29-3, at 7) Dr. McCurdy replied, again stating that maximum daily dosage of Estradiol.
(SR 29-9). But Plaintiff did not comply with the time limitations in the grievance process. Plaintiff filed an RTS on May 15, 2003, seeking to have her gender amended to female on all prison records.
(SR 29-8 at 12). The request was denied on May 15, 2013. But Plaintiff did not file her grievance until June 5, 2013, outside the 15-day time period during which a prisoner must file a grievance, if one is to be filed.
Although Plaintiff allegedly was prevented from filing a timely objection by circumstances beyond her control, the Court finds that a de novo determination of the portions of the Report to which she proposes to object would not affect the outcome of the case. First, Plaintiff concedes that her official-capacity claims against the director and employees of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (“DOC”) for money damages were properly dismissed. But she asserts that claims for injunctive relief should not be dismissed.

Although a claim for prospective injunctive relief may sometimes proceed under the Ex parte Young doctrine,1 any such claim would fail in this case for other reasons. Second, Plaintiff challenges the dismissal of her claims against some defendants for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. She contends the Complaint adequately alleges a basis for supervisory liability under Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 556 U.S. 662 (2009).

On April 9, 2013, the U.S. District Court (Judge William B. Nealon) granted in part and denied in part defendant's motion to dismiss, declining to certify the class.

Here, plaintiff George White alleged that the Social Security Administration delayed processing numerous disability claims in violation of the Social Security Act. However, because the Administration had processed White’s claim while his class certification motion was pending, the court had to determine whether the mooting of his individual claim mooted the entire class action Id.

This concept of undue delay was also discussed by the Fifth Circuit under similar circumstances in Sandoz v. Cingular Wireless LLC, 553 F.3d 913 (5th Cir. Sandoz filed a class action complaint against Cingular Wireless in state court.

Twenty-four days after the case was removed to federal court, Cingular made a Rule 68 offer of judgment and then sought to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court concluded that the Rule 68 offer did not moot the entire case and denied the motion to dismiss. The case was taken up on interlocutory appeal, and the Fifth Circuit concluded that application of the relation back doctrine was appropriate.

This class action lawsuit concerns the inadequate and unconstitutional treatment of prisoners within the Special Management Unit (“SMU”) at the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg (“USP Lewisburg”) who suffer from mental illness.

Introduction. This matter involves the treatment of prisoners who are housed within the Special Management Unit at the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania (“USP Lewisburg”).

This case concerns an action filed by forty-seven federal inmates under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C § 2674. Plaintiffs generally complain about conditions at the Federal Correctional Complex in Beaumont, Texas, resulting from the aftermath from Hurricane Rita in 2005. Plaintiffs allege the United States is liable because the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) breached its duty of care under 18 U.S.C. 4042(a)(2) by failing to provide suitable quarters, safekeeping, care and subsistence at the Federal Correctional Complex Medium Security Institution in Beaumont, Texas (FCC Beaumont Medium).

380,PC-TX-0022,"On May 21, 2012, a Native American prisoner incarcerated at the McConnell Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) filed this pro se federal civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. He sued multiple TDCJ employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. He alleged that TDJC policies that prevented his smoking a prayer pipe during Native American pipe ceremonies, limited his ability to wear a religiously significant medicine bag, and prevented him from growing long hair violated his rights under RLUIPA and the First Amendment. He sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief as well as attorney's fees and costs. An additional Native American prisoner plaintiff joined the suit shortly after filing. 

In February 2013, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, consented to proceedings before a Magistrate Judge, and voluntarily dismissed all of their claims except their three RLUIPA challenges against the TDCJ Director in his official capacity and their First Amendment claim seeking damages against the Program Analyst in his individual capacity. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. On February 27, 2014, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment was granted and a final judgment entered in their favor. The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit and were successful in getting judgement on the RLUIPA grooming policy claim vacated and remanded. On remand, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the RLUIPA grooming claim was denied. As the RLUIPA grooming policy claim moved towards trial, the initial prisoner plaintiff in the case was released and his claims were dismissed. The Court ordered the consolidation of cases Casey v. Davis (2:14-cv-13) and Cobb v. Morris (2:14-cv-22) with this case, as the two cases also were brought by Native American prisoner incarcerated at the McConnell Unit and involved RLUIPA grooming policy claims moving towards trial. After a bench trial, Judge Ramos granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief permitting them to grow their hair long, consistent with their Native American religious beliefs and entered a final judgment on February 26, 2019. The defendant appealed, but moved to dismiss the appeal shortly after. The Fifth Circuit granted the motion to dismiss the appeal on July 9, 2019. This case is closed.","Defendant #I: William B.

(See Appx 245-247). On June 16, 2011, William Chance, a Native American prisoner confined at the Michael Unit in Tennessee Colony, Texas, sued the TDCJ and certain officials in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, alleging that he had been denied, inter alia, the right to participate in pipe ceremonies and smudging rituals in violation of RLUIPA and his First Amendment rights. (See Chance v. TDCJ, Case No. 6:11-cv-435, D.E.
at 202. Prior to this change in policy, Plaintiffs and other NA offenders were allowed to smoke a communal sacred pipe. However, several NA offenders filed administrative grievances with the TDCJ complaining about the risk of communicable disease transmission from a communal pipe, prompting TDCJ officials to seek a medical opinion from Dr. Robert Williams, Deputy Director of TDCJ’s Health Service Division.
He advised prison officials that he would not cut his hair due to his religious beliefs, but officials told him he would not be exempt from the grooming policy. He sued under RLUIPA and the district court dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit referenced its decision in Diaz v. Collins, 114 F.3d 69 (1997), that was decided under RFRA, and held: “Because the test under RLUIPA is sufficiently the same as that previously imposed under RFRA, we hold TDCJ-ID did not violate Longoria’s rights by, pursuant to the grooming policy, denying him permission to grow his hair.”
In addition, there is no indication that appointed counsel would aid in the efficient and equitable disposition of the case. The Court has the authority to award attorneys' fees to prevailing plaintiffs. 42 U.S.C. § 1988.
Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991). The district court concluded that the challenged regulations and practices were rationally connected to valid government interest, and did not violate the First Amendment. In this Court, Davis and Goodman merely state, in a single paragraph and without elaboration, that ""[t]he evidence is clear that the Appell[ants] have indeed established a First Amendment Constitutional violation thereby clearly overcoming the Qualified Immunity Analysis [sic].""
The TDCJ Chaplaincy Manual was revised in July 2012 to reflect this change. The district court in Chance granted summary judgment for TDCJ on the pipe-ceremony issue. This Court affirmed and held that TDCJ had carried its burden of demonstrating that the policy banning communal and individual pipes and allowing only the ceremony leader to smoke the pipe at ceremonies was the least restrictive means of furthering compelling government interests in ""prison health, administration, and security,"" and, accordingly, did not violate RLUIPA.
The policy made no religious exceptions, but did allow inmates with diagnosed dermatological conditions to wear a J;t -inch beard. In accordance with his Muslim faith, Gregory Holt sought permission to grow a Y2-inch beard.

The court issued a preliminary injunction. In 2007, the parties agreed to settle and the case was dismissed.","Specifically, Couch alleges that during Ramadan 2005, defendants restricted Couch's caloric intake to a mere 1000 calories per day, forced Couch to observe 31 days of Ramadan (though Ramadan may not last more than 30 days), scheduled the Eid Prayer at night (though the Eid Prayer may be performed only on the morning following Ramadan), and held the Eid Meal 4 days after Ramadan ended (though the Eid Meal must be served within 3 days after Ramadan ends.

JOHN JABE, et al., Defendants Civil Action No.: 7:05cv00642 ORDER By: PAMELA MEADE SARGENT United States Magistrate Judge This matter is before the undersigned on plaintiff’s Motion For Preliminary Injunction, (Docket Item No. 40), and plaintiff’s Motion To Post Security For Preliminary Injunction, (Docket Item No. 44). The plaintiff, William R. Couch, is an inmate within the Virginia Department of Corrections, (“VDOC”), incarcerated at Keen Mountain Correctional Center. Couch states that he is an observant Sunni Muslim who plans to participate in a required dawn to sunset fast during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan1 beginning September 23, 2006.
He further stated that the portion size for the dinner meal for the fasting World Community inmates was the same as that served to the general population inmates. He asked why this was the case. On November 4, 2004, Oslin replied that the portions were in compliance with departmental policies and procedures.
The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of “cruel and unusual punishments.” U.S CONST. amend VIII.
As the Seventh Circuit reasoned in Al-Alamin v. Gramley, 926 F.2d 680, 688 (7th Cir. 1991), here, Keen Mountain made special accommodations for providing inmates the opportunity to participate in the Ramadan fast. Moreover, I find that the fact that the defendants made such accommodations satisfies the First Amendment 10In Haines, the Supreme Court held that the allegations of a pro se complaint are held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by attorneys.
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o state shall... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” U.S CONST. AMEND XIV.
For these reasons, I will deny the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on this ground. In his complaint, Couch alleges that the defendants deprived him of the Eid ul Fitr meal following Ramadan 2003. Couch states that the Eid ul Fitr meal is a special meal served one to three days after the completion of Ramadan to celebrate the 30 days of fasting.

383,PC-VA-0024,"On May 6, 2019, twelve prisoners who had been held in solitary confinement in two Virginia supermax prisons for at least two years filed this putative class action lawsuit in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The plaintiffs alleged that each prison had violated their Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment rights by continuing to implement a program that intentionally held prisoners in solitary confinement without the possibility of re-entering the general population. They alleged that this program also violated an earlier settlement agreement, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The defendants, the Virginia Department of Corrections, its employees, and the wardens of each prison, filed two motions to dismiss. District Judge Robert E. Payne has not yet issued a decision on either motion.","That report also documented the arbitrary administration of the Phase Program and revealed how the Phase Program incentivized abusive practices by prison administrators and employees, resulting in prisoners languishing in long-term solitary confinement indefinitely. In the wake of that report, VDOC reached a comprehensive settlement in the Brown case.
The Settlement Agreement in Brown was intended to carry out VDOC’s pledge to “ensure that the systematic degeneration of the correctional operations which occurred at [Mecklenburg] does not occur again at any institution in the Virginia Department of Corrections.” Under the Settlement Agreement, VDOC stated that it “has discontinued the phase program and does not intend to reinstate any similar program in the future.” Under the Settlement Agreement, VDOC also agreed without qualification that the Special Management Unit “has been and will remain abolished.”
The class alleged that these practices violated the prisoners’ rights to due process and the Eighth Amendment’s bar on cruel and unusual punishments.43 74. In the wake of the 1984 Mecklenburg Study Committee Report, the VDOC defendants entered into a Settlement Agreement with “[a] class of all prisoners who are, or will be, confined in the Mecklenburg Correctional Center of 40 Hutto Compl. 41 Id.
The Settlement Agreement also binds VDOC to permanently “discontinue[] the phase program” and VDOC stated that it did “not intend to reinstate any similar program in the future. The parties submitted the Settlement Agreement to the Court, which issued a consent decree on April 5, 1985. When it closed the SMU and abolished the Phase Program, VDOC transferred all prisoners into “C Custody”—a general-population classification it created for maximum-security prisoners at Mecklenburg.
As recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, life in a super-max prison is “synonymous with extreme isolation. Conditions at Red Onion and Wallens Ridge are no exception. But, as with Mecklenburg, the conditions of long-term solitary confinement at Red Onion and Wallens Ridge go beyond what the general population in maximum security prisons experience by depriving prisoners of almost every aspect of ordinary prison life.
Daily Cavity Searches and Lack of Humanizing Physical Contact. Prisoners in long-term solitary confinement at Red Onion and Wallens Ridge endure dehumanizing, daily cavity searches. Before leaving his cell, a prisoner is forced to strip naked before two officers, who inspect his head, hair, mouth, torso, pelvic area, legs, and feet.
As with the failed Phase Program and SMU at Mecklenburg, VDOC’s policies render solitary confinement at Red Onion and Wallens Ridge long-term, arbitrary, and indefinite. VDOC has held some prisoners, including Plaintiffs Thorpe and McNabb, in solitary confinement for well over a decade. Remaining infraction free, completing all required programming, and refraining from any acts approaching violent behavior does not guarantee a return to general population.
HRW observed that staff used excessive violence with prisoners for even minor issues or misunderstandings.64 Responding to “allegations of improper treatment at Red Onion and Wallens Ridge,” the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) initiated an investigation into Red Onion for use of excessive force.65 124. Following a class-action suit filed by the ACLU of Connecticut, the Connecticut Department of Corrections withdrew its prisoners from Red Onion and Wallens Ridge and cancelled its interstate compact with Virginia. After the DOJ announcement and Connecticut’s cancellation of its agreement with Virginia, VDOC instituted a so-called “Progressive Housing Phase Program” at Red Onion.
Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1 to 221 as if fully set forth herein. In 1985, VDOC and the individual Defendants became bound to the Brown v. Landon Settlement Agreement. With respect to the Phase Program and SMU, VDOC entered into permanent and binding obligations that required no ongoing court supervision.

The plaintiffs alleged that VDOC used a so-called “Phase Program,” whereby prisoners could advance through “phases” of solitary confinement with varying levels of privileges and ultimately become eligible for return to the general prison population. The class alleged that this program caused mental and physical harms. The case was settled in 1983 with a settlement agreement that required VDOC to abolish its long-term solitary confinement programs at Red Onion and Wallens Ridge. The settlement agreement also required the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with access to mental health services. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification on May 6, 2019.

Judge John P. Jones denied the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief in 2017 and initially granted summary judgment in favor of VDOC in 2018, but the Fourth Circuit overturned him on appeal in late 2019, saying that VDOC's use of access to television for religious services as an incentive program unduly burdens the plaintiff's rights to practice a bona fide religious belief. The panel stated that religious practice should be a right, not a privilege that can be taken away through an incentive program.

This court originally denied Greenhill’s request for preliminary injunctive relief, and Greenhill noted an interlocutory appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit remanded the case for further proceedings on Greenhill’s request for preliminary injunctive relief. On remand, Greenhill’s request for preliminary injunctive relief is before the undersigned magistrate judge on referral pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) for a report setting forth appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended disposition.

After conducting a de novo review, I will overrule the objections, adopt the Report, and deny Greenhill’s motions for interlocutory relief.

After I denied Greenhill’s motion seeking a preliminary injunction, he took an interlocutory appeal.

The court of appeals affirmed this court’s denial of preliminary injunctive relief as to Greenhill’s claims regarding the prison’s grooming policy and process of serving religious meals, but remanded the case for further consideration of his contention that the court should order prison officials to allow him to participate in Jum’ah, the Islamic Friday congregational service. I referred the matter to the magistrate judge, resulting in the present Report and Greenhill’s objections to it.
He proposes that officials should use portable tray boxes and maintain one to be used only for halal meals. The defendants’ refusal to follow Greenhill’s portable box proposal does not violate the First Amendment. First, Greenhill fails to show any substantial burden on his religious dietary beliefs.

V. Defendant represented by Harold W. Clarke Director of the State of Virginia Department of Corrections","On May 10, 2017, inmate Alfonza Hardy Greenhill filed this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) against the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Greenhill was housed in solitary confinement in the Red Onion State Prison. He was an observant Muslim and wanted to participate in a weekly Friday prayer, the Jum’ah, and maintain a four-inch beard. The district court denied Greenhill’s request for preliminary injunctive relief, but remanded the case for further consideration of his contention that the court should order prison officials to allow him to attend Jum'ah. The court of appeals affirmed the district court's denial of Greenhill's request. The case is now closed.","In 2012, a Muslim inmate at Red Onion State Prison in Virginia filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia against the Director of the State of Virginia Department of Corrections, the Chief of Corrections Operations, and the Warden of the prison.

The court of appeals remanded the case for further proceedings on Greenhill’s request for preliminary injunctive relief. The district court denied Greenhill's motion for a preliminary injunction.

Plaintiff is the United States of America. Defendant is the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (“Jail”). Defendant is responsible for the safety, care, custody, and control of prisoners housed in the Hampton Roads Regional Jail at 2690 Elmhurst Lane in Portsmouth, Virginia.
The Jail is an institution within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1997(1). The Jail houses over 900 individuals, including pre-trial detainees, convicted prisoners, and youth accused of adult crimes (“prisoners”). The Jail is a public entity within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1) and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104, and is therefore subject to Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, and its implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. Part 35.
INTRODUCTION 1. This matter involves the medical and mental health care that the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority (“HRRJ” or “Jail” or “Regional Jail”) provides to prisoners, HRRJ’s use of restrictive housing for prisoners with serious mental illness (“SMI”), and HRRJ’s provision of services, programs, and activities to prisoners with mental health disabilities. In 2016, the United States initiated an investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131.
The investigation focused on HRRJ’s provision of medical and mental health care, its use of restrictive housing for prisoners who had mental illnesses, and its provision of access to services, programs, and activities to prisoners with mental health disabilities. On December 19, 2018, the United States issued a CRIPA Notice to HRRJ, concluding that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions at HRRJ violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution through HRRJ’s failure to provide adequate medical and mental health care to prisoners and its placement of prisoners with serious mental illness in restrictive housing for prolonged periods of time.
In order to resolve the issues pending between the Parties without the expense, risks, delays, and uncertainties of litigation, the Parties agree to the terms of this Agreement as stated below. This Agreement resolves the United States’ investigation of HRRJ’s alleged constitutional and ADA violations. The Parties agree that this Agreement does not constitute an admission by Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority of the truth of any of the conclusions contained in the United States’ December 19, 2018 CRIPA Notice.
Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, all new or revised policies and procedures that were changed or created to align with this Agreement will be fully implemented (including completing all staff training) within six months of the United States' approval of the policy or procedure (except as otherwise stated in the Agreement). The Jail will annually review its policies and procedures, revising them as necessary. Any revisions to the policies and procedures will be submitted to the United States for approval in accordance with Paragraph 20.a above.
MEDICAL CARE 39. The Jail will provide constitutionally adequate medical care. Medical Staffing: To meet the requirements of this Agreement and ensure that prisoners receive constitutionally adequate medical care, the Jail will increase medical staffing by hiring sufficient additional staff with appropriate credentials (e.g., MDs, RNs, and LPNs) and increasing the hours that current staff with higher credentials are onsite on evenings and weekends.
Officers will document their checks. The Jail will ensure that video surveillance will not be used for a prisoner on “constant” observation nor for the 15 minute irregular checks on “close” observation. The Jail will ensure that an order of “constant” observation requires that a staff member have an unobstructed view of the prisoner at all times.
HRRJ will maintain sufficient records and data to document that the requirements of this Agreement are being properly implemented and will make such records available to the Monitor U.S. District Court Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE 2:20-cv-00410-RBS-LRL Create an Alert for This Case on RECAP

39, at 10. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On June 25, 2009, Plaintiff filed this case. Dkt.
She makes a claim for violation of her right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under both the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution (via 42 U.S.C. § 1983) and Article 1, Section 14 of the Washington State Constitution Id.
She seeks declaratory relief that the Defendants violated her rights under both the federal and state constitution Id. She also seeks damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. 1215*1215 Parties have now filed cross motions for summary judgment Dkts.
The outstanding issues are summarized in Section I.D. below. RESOLVED ISSUES With the exception of Officers Glasco and Joy, all individually named Defendants have been dismissed by stipulation Dkts.
Pittman v. Oregon Employment Dept., 509 F.3d 1065, 1071 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotations omitted) (as the Supreme Court has applied the Eleventh Amendment, an unconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citizens of another State absent certain exceptions). Defendants' motion seeking dismissal of the damages claims against Washington and the Department of Corrections should be granted. SUMMARY OF REMAINING ISSUES Plaintiff states that her remaining claims are that Officers Glasco and Joy ""violated her Eighth Amendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment when they shackled her during labor and immediately postpartum on April 15 and 16, 2007.""
Exhibits 2 and 3 of Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' motion, (Dkt. 43, at 7-36), complaints purportedly filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. These pleadings are of limited relevance and were not considered.
To the extent that Defendants use the doctrine to defend against her other claims, the motion should be denied. It is undisputed that Plaintiff filed this action within the applicable statute of limitations. Defendants make no showing that by reason of the delay Plaintiff has altered their position.
Plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that by April of 2007 shackling inmates while they are in labor was clearly established as a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Defendants admit that Washington Department of Correction's own policy prohibited it. Although not binding authority, the Eight Circuit recently held that a female inmate's ""protections from being shackled during labor had... been clearly established by decisions of the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts before September 2003.""
2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). In Hope, the Supreme Court held that under the circumstances presented in the case, handcuffing an inmate to a hitching post was a violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Hope court held that the prison officials had acted with deliberate indifference to Hope's health and safety in ""violation of the Eighth Amendment by restraining him `[d]espite the clear lack of an emergency situation' in a manner `that created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation.'""

Eldon Vail Secretary, Washington State Department of Corrections, in his official capacity","On June 25, 2009, a female inmate at the Washington Corrections Center for Women (WCCW) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) for violating her constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 14 of Washington State Constitution Id. The plaintiff alleged that she was shackled to a hospital bed in violation of her right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under both the federal and state constitutions. The court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the liability of Officer Glasco. The case is closed.","On June 25, 2009, a female inmate at the Washington Corrections Center for Women (""WCCW"") filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the Washington State Department of Corrections (""DOC""), the former Secretary of the DOC, and other defendants. She sought declaratory relief that Defendants violated her right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under both the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 14 of Washington State Constitution Id. She also sought damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The case was dismissed by stipulation Dkts. Pittman v.

387,PC-WA-0026,"Washington state prisoners with serious medical problems sued the Washington Department of Corrections for failing to provide adequate medical care. The plaintiffs believed that the DOC applied the term ""medically necessary"" too narrowly and denied immediate care and that decisions to provide outside treatment are decided arbitrarily, without medical justification. The plaintiffs sought class action certification but Judge Richard A. Jones denied the certification on September 18, 2017 on the grounds that the proposed class lacked commonality. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an appeal by the plaintiffs later that year. Between June 2018 and March 2019, each remaining plaintiff filed to dismiss himself as a party. As a result, the court closed the case on March 27, 2019 when no plaintiffs remained.","Despite the documented history of recurrent nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), and 17 the associated acute and chronic pain that DOC treated with intermittent narcotic pain 18 medication, DOC has ceased authorizing any pain treatment through opioids. DOC offered to prescribe Torodol to Mr. Haldane to treat his pain. He did not 20 take the Torodol, based on the recommendation of the outside urologist he saw in 2011.
As a result of Defendants' refusal to properly treat his condition, Mr. Haldane is 7 likely to continue suffering severe pain and limitations on basic daily activities. 8 The CRC is withholding needed medical carefrom Wendel Johnson. Wendel Johnson was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome before coming to 10 DOC.
He appealed the denial to the highest level possible. His appeals were denied. 52 Mr. Johnson's symptoms have not resolved.

As a result of Defendants' refusal to properly treat his condition, Mr. Johnson is 21 likely to continue suffering severe pain and limitations on basic daily activities. The CRC is withholding needed medical care from Timothy Martin. In 2013, while in DOC custody, Mr. Martin underwent surgery to repair a left inguinal hernia.
As a result of Defendants' denial of the treatment necessary to properly treat his 8 condition, Mr. Martin is likely to continue suffering severe pain and limitations on basic daily 9 activities. The CRC is withholding needed medical care from LeeShawn Redic. In 2009, DOC medical staff diagnosed LeeShawn Redic with an umbilical hernia.
For the reasons stated below, the Court DENIES 2 Plaintiffs’ Motion. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs are prisoners in the custody of the Washington Department of 5 Corrections (DOC) Dkt. 1 (Complaint).
Though the Court agrees that 20 Parsons is on point in this matter, the Court disagrees that Parsons aids the Plaintiffs in 21 their arguments. In Parsons, the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court’s order granting class 23 certification. There, the plaintiffs’ 74-page complaint detailed the Arizona Department of Correction’s (ADC) mass deficiencies, going so far as to outline fifteen specific, uniform, ORDER-4 1 statewide policies and practices that exposed all ADC’s inmates to a substantial risk of 2 harm Id.
82 Mr. Redic has filed multiple grievances about the CRC’s refusal of treatment to repair his hernia. His grievances were denied. He appealed the decisions to the highest level possible, but his appeals were also denied.

389,PC-WY-0006,"On April 3, 2008, Muslim prisoners sued the Wyoming Department of Corrections for violations of First Amendment Rights and the RLUIPA for failure to accommodate their religious practices.  The case was resolved by Consent Decree on November 19, 2008.","Civ No. 08-CV-090B PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, AND BRIEF IN SUPPORT INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs Joseph Miller and Hurie Purdiman, Jr., are Muslim prisoners incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary (""WSP""). They file this motion in an effort to immediately halt further violations of rights guaranteed them by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (""RLUIPA""), 114 Stat. 804, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc.

Defendant Michael Murphy is the Warden of WSP, and Defendant Robert Lampert is the Director of the Wyoming Department of Corrections (""WDOC""). These prison officials adopted, and their subordinates at WSP enforce, a policy known as the ""twenty-minute"" rule. This policy requires segregated prisoners to eat their meals within twenty minutes after delivery by guards.
For reasons set forth in their Declarations, Plaintiffs pray five times each day and periodically engage in religious fasts from sunup until sundown. In addition, they receive special religious (""Halal"") meals from WSP due to their religious dietary constraints. Defendant Michael Murphy is the Warden of WSP.
Prison officials refused to offer other types of Halal food that were readily available and medically palatable to Mr Shakur. The district court granted summary judgment to prison officials on Mr. Shakur's RLUIPA claim, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Prison officials were giving Mr. Shakur a ""Hobson's choice"" that violated RLUIPA, requiring him to choose between eating and remaining faithful to his religious beliefs.
Plaintiffs are under the care custody and control of the named defendants, Micha el Murphy, Wa rden of WSP, and Robert Lampe rt, Director of the Wyomi ng Department of Correction s. Plaintiffs filed this action seeking relief under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and under the Reli gio us Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act 42 U.S.c. §§ 2000cc et seq. (RLUl PA). Plaintiffs devote certain times each day to prayer, and certain days each year to fasting.
The Court commends the parties for reaching a reasonable result that accommodates Plaintiffs' religious exercises while not unduly threatening the needs of prison officials to maintain order and security. Dated this fY'!:. day of MW!h t""cR1.
In a word, RLUIPA is designed to ensure that prisoners have a right to engage in certain religious exercises, even if is inconvenient for prison officials to accommodate that right, unless prison officials have a compelling need to suppress these religious activities. The two named Plaintiffs in this lawsuit are Muslims incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary. As a matter of faith, Plaintiffs devote specific time each day to prayer, and certain days of each year to fasting.
As a result of the prison policy challenged herein, Plaintiffs must choose between adhering to their deeply held religious beliefs and eating meals. Defendants' policy requires prisoners to eat their meals within twenty minutes after delivery, after which the meals are confiscated. Plaintiffs have requested of Defendants that they be exempted from this rule when a religious exercise, such as prayer or fasting, renders consuming the meal within twenty minutes impracticable, but Defendants have denied these requests.
PARTIES 2. Plaintiffs Joseph Miller and Hurie Purdiman, Jr. are serving criminal sentences in the state of Wyoming and are incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary (WSP). Plaintiffs have been placed under the care, custody, and control of the Wyoming Department of Corrections (WDOC).
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 6. Defendants have issued, and they enforce, the following rule known herein as the ""twenty-minute"" rule. This rule affords prisoners only twenty minutes to eat their meals.
Jewish prisoners at WSP, as well as Muslim prisoners, have been adversely impacted by Defendants' ""twenty-minute"" rule. Both Jewish and Muslim prisoners have grieved the rule through the prison's administrative grievance process, to no avail. In response to one Jewish prisoner's grievance, Acting-Chaplain Sergeant Denise Neu stated: It is reasonable to say that each person has a right to practice a religion and a belief of their own and to follow in the ways of the religion(s) [sic] faith and beliefs as scripted by time, but regardless an inmate's chosen religious belief, an unfortunate consequence of his incarceration is that one may be required to consume their meal in a manner which may not be to their religious preference.

On June 15, 2016 the parties filed a joint motion for judgment granting final declaratory and partial injunctive relief. On October 27, 2016 the court sua sponte raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, giving both parties a chance to submit briefs addressing the issue.

On September 25, 2017 plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On October 4, 2018 the Fifth Circuit dismissed the case as moot because it found that since the appeal was filed, Louisiana lawmakers had reallocated funding for appointed counsel sufficient to render the waitlists for non-capital defendants nonexistent.

Louisiana’s Funding Scheme for Public Defense 58. Plaintiffs’ placement on a waiting list for appointed counsel results from the State of Louisiana’s chronic underfunding of its public defender system. The Louisiana Constitution obligates the legislature to provide a uniform system of securing competent representation for indigent defendants LA.

In E.T v. Cantil-Sakauye, the plaintiffs were foster children who brought a putative class action against state and county judicial officials, alleging that the caseloads of the county dependency court and courtappointed attorneys were so excessive as to violate federal law. The district court granted a motion to dismiss, finding that it was required to abstain. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
The court declined the plaintiffs’ “invitation to consider in isolation their (now-narrowed) request for relief, as though reaching the merits of their declaratory judgment claims would end the matter.
And no waitlists no live case or controversy no jurisdiction. We thus DISMISS this appeal as moot. I Louisiana funds representation for non-capital defendants through legislative appropriations at the state level, supplemented by traffic tickets and other local fines assessed by each defender district.
Appellants later amended their complaint to seek injunctive relief too, specifically requesting that Appellees be ordered to develop a plan to provide appointed counsel for each waitlisted defendant and to submit various reports. After several months of negotiation, the parties submitted a Joint Motion for Final Declaratory and Partial Injunctive Relief. The accompanying 2 See Walker v. DOT, 817 So.
It dismissed the case, citing Younger abstention, justiciability, and federalism concerns.3 Appellants then filed an unopposed Motion for Relief from Judgment. The district court denied the motion, and Appellants appealed. Then in 2017, after this appeal was filed, the Louisiana Legislature amended the Public Defender Act to steer $5 million more to district defenders for non-capital indigent defense.
The nub of today’s “dispute” is undisputed: Louisiana no longer maintains waitlists for non-capital defendants. The case, thus moot, must be dismissed. A Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement imposes an “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,”5 which consists of three elements: (1) a plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is... concrete and particularized, and... actual or 3 See Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971) (generally barring federal courts, except in certain circumstances, from interfering with ongoing state criminal proceedings).

They all agree that waitlists for non-capital defendants no longer exist.

392,PN-AL-0003,"A juvenile sex offender and his parents filed a lawsuit in 2013 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama objecting to the Sheriff's Office's program of unannounced, random, and suspicion-less compliance investigations of every individual in the county who is subject to requirements of the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act, Ala. Code  § 15-20A-4(12).  On February 13, 2014 the Court dismissed the case because they were informed that the parties reached a written agreement on the merits of the action and litigation costs ","OF ALABAMA COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. The Etowah County Sheriffs Office operates a program of unannounced, random and suspicionless compliance investigations of every individual in the county who is subject to the registration requirements of the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act. Essential to the Sheriffs Office's program is that officers search the home of each registrant. Officers must also question the registrant about his or her registration information.
He resides there with his parents, John Doe and Jane Doe, and his two minor siblings. He is categorized as a ""juvenile sex offender"" under the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act (the ""Act"" or ""RCNA"") Ala. Code § 15-20A-4(12).
Following sex offender treatment, a risk assessment, and a full hearing pursuant to Section 15-20A-26 of the Code, the Etowah County Circuit Court determined that James' risk of re-offending is low. Since April 2012, officers from the Etowah County Sheriffs Office have subjected James to random, suspicionless searches of his home without consent. The officers have also required James to submit to questioning about his registration status.
He is the father of Plaintiff James Doe. Since April 2012, officers from the Etowah County Sheriffs Office have entered his home on numerous occasions without his consent. On many of these occasions, they searched his home without his consent.
She is the mother of Plaintiff James Doe. Since April 2012, officers from the Etowah County Sheriffs Office have entered her home on numerous occasions without her consent. On many of those occasions, they searched her home without her consent.
Defendant Todd Entrekin is the duly elected Sheriff of Etowah County and serves as the county's chief law enforcement officer. He has final policymaking authority for the Etowah County Sheriffs Office. He bears direct and ultimate responsibility for the Office's policies and practices at issue in this suit.
He is sued in his individual and official capacities. Defendant Victor Payne is an officer in the Etowah County Sheriffs Office. He has conducted at least three compliance inspections at Plaintiffs' home.
He is sued in his individual capacity. Defendant James Craig Tyler is an officer in the Etowah County Sheriffs Office. He has conducted at least five compliance inspections at Plaintiffs' home.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND The Etowah County Sheriff's Compliance Sweeps ofRCNA Registrants 14. The Etowah County Sheriffs Office has announced on its website that, along with registering and tracking all individuals in the county who are subject to the RCNA, its deputies and investigators conduct ""random, monthly visits"" to the home and work addresses of registrants Ex. A (PDF ofEtowah Sex Offender Site).
These inspections are routinely conducted without a warrant and without ·any suspicion of criminal non-compliance with the RCNA. The primary purpose of the Etowah County Sheriffs Office's program is law enforcement. The Sheriffs Office uses compliance inspections to identify and arrest individuals who are not compliant with RCNA requirements, or to make arrests for other crimes based on evidence an officer discovers during the inspection.
The court did not order notification in James' case because he completed his G.E.D. at Mt. Meigs prior to release. The court ordered that James be placed on aftercare, that he report to a juvenile probation officer (""JPO""), and that he complete a counseling program approved by the JPO.
James Doe's Obligations under and Compliance with the RCNA 32. James' adjudications subject him to lifetime registration under the RCNA Ala. Code § 15-20-30(e).

393,PN-CA-0018,"On June 26, 2003, two separate suits were filed against the City of Oakland and the Oakland Police Department (OPD), and related defendants, in federal court. The suits were filed in response to the OPD's actions on April 7 at a peaceful antiwar demonstration at the Port of Oakland. The Police, without giving sufficient notice to disperse and without provocation, barraged demonstrators with a variety of ""less-lethal"" munitions, while blocking the main exit routes. Police pursued demonstrators and others present when they attempted to disperse, while continuing to fire at them and intentionally strike them with motorcycles. On August 11, 2003, the Court ordered that the cases be officially related and heard before the same judge. One of the two cases, Local 10 ILWU v. City of Oakland, was filed as a class-action on behalf of all persons who attended the April 7 demonstration. The suit also named as plaintiffs Local 10 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, plus nine of its members who were ""standing by"" in the vicinity of the demonstration but not active participants in it. The other suit, Coles v. City of Oakland, sought relieve for several individual demonstrators who were allegedly injured by the OPD. In both cases, Plaintiffs sought compensatory, exemplary, and punitive damages, as well as to recover legal costs. They also sought declaratory judgments holding the Defendants' actions to be unlawful violations of the Plaintiffs' rights under the Constitutions of the U.S. and of California and of statutory law. They sought injunctions that among other things would prohibit the Defendants from unlawfully interference with the constitutional and statutory rights of participants in public demonstrations and protests.

On December 24, 2004, the parties entered a court-approved partial settlement addressing the Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief to the extent that those claims related to the Defendants' crowd control policies. Oakland adopted a new official Crowd Control Policy that forbade the police from dispersing crowds that had not behaved illegally or that did not pose a clear and present danger of imminent violence. It also forbade the indiscriminate use of less-lethal weapons directly against crowds, even when specific individuals in the group were violent. The remaining issues eventually settled, with awards of damages and attorneys' fees well in excess of $1,000,000.","represented by Gregory Mellon Fox (See above for address) ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED represented by Gregory Mellon Fox (See above for address) ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED

397,PN-CO-0005,"This class action lawsuit was filed in response to police actions amidst the nationwide protests that ensued following the police killing of George Floyd. The complaint, filed by seven private individuals, argues that the police use of weapons like pepper balls, pepper spray, and rubber bullets constituted violations of the protesters' First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The suit established two classes of plaintiffs, the Arrest Class and the Direct Force Class. 

The case is ongoing as of January 2, 2021.","It also causes disorientation, severe coughing, crying, and difficulty breathing. Defendants also used kinetic impact projectiles (“KIPs”) during the protests on peaceful protestors. The DPD uses 40mm launchers to shoot KIPs as well as flashbang grenades.
On May 30, 2020, at around 1:00 p.m., the Mayor of Denver declared an “emergency” and announced a curfew order for the entire city, set to begin at 8:00 p.m. that evening. The curfew was issued while thousands of individuals peacefully marched and demonstrated in Denver. The curfew was imposed in all public places within the City and County of Denver, including streets and public rights-of-way, from 8:00 p.m. on May 30, 2020 to 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, May 31, 2020, and from 8:00 p.m. on May 31, 2020 until 5:00 a.m. on June 1, 2020.

When some of the protestors began marching north, Fitouri joined Parkins as Parkins marched with them. The protest was peaceful. Fitouri and Parkins marched through Confluence Park toward I-25 with the rest of the marchers.



On or around 1:00 p.m. on May 29, 2020, Fitouri and Parkins arrived at or near the Capitol to join the protest and march. They marched with the other protestors, who were peaceful. The march went to several locations, including the City and County Building and the jail.

At approximately 8:00 p.m., Fitouri and Parkins and other protestors were at the intersection of Colfax and Broadway. The group was peaceful. Someone in the group may have lofted a water bottle into the air.

On Sunday, May 31, 2020, in the early evening, Fitouri and Parkins met at the Capitol to join the protest, which was peaceful. They marched with the other protestors. After the 8:00 p.m. curfew, when Fitouri and Parkins and the protestors marched by the police precinct on Washington and Colfax, Defendant Officers intentionally allowed half the group to pass and then began tear gassing, flashbanging, and pepper spraying the middle of the protest march.

The younger protestor asked the Officers for his inhaler; the Officers heard him and opened and closed the door numerous times, but they ignored him. Sannier was detained in the jail for approximately 36 hours. In jail, he saw another protestor who had a giant bruise under his eye from being hit by a projectile.

Plaintiff Youssef Amghar participated in the protests on May 30 and 31, 2020. Amghar wanted to protest police brutality against Black and Brown people. On May 31, 2020, well before curfew, Amghar was with other peaceful protestors on the corner of Colfax and Lincoln.

As a photographer and freelance journalist, he wanted to document the protests as well as the police response. He has also been the victim of police violence in the past. Throughout the evening, he documented the protests and police action as a photojournalist.

He was with protestors in front of the Capitol. The protestors were chanting and peaceful. There were over 100 people present.

There were approximately 35 people at that corner, and they were all younger protestors, including teenagers. Almost all of them were Black. One protestor was having a seizure.

Even though Cruz stopped and was on the ground, the other Defendant DPD Officer continued firing pepper balls at him, including at the back of his head. Cruz was placed in handcuffs. The Defendant DPD Officer who had been repeatedly firing pepper balls at Cruz at close range taunted him, saying things like, “What happened to you?

Defendant Officers also used kinetic impact projectiles (“KIPs”) during the protests on peaceful protestors. KIPs refers to a range of projectiles used in crowd control settings that are made from combinations of rubber, plastic, PVC, various metals, wood, hard foam, and wax, which are often generically referred to as “rubber bullets.”
Defendant Officers consistently wore riot gear while present during the protests in Denver beginning on May 28, 2020. Pepper ball guns are air-powered launch devices that fire rounds containing plastic sphere projectiles filled with OC powder. These spheres explode OC powder onto the person who gets hit, causing the person to struggle to breathe.
The Doe Defendant Officers ran after them. The officers were shooting them with pepper balls. They did not give any orders or warnings.
De La Vaca went to the corner of Lincoln, east of Civic Center station, but there was another police assault at that time and he inhaled a big waft of tear gas. It was painful and difficult to breathe. He choked and threw up.

(lcdlf2) (Entered: 08/19/2020)","On May 25, 2020, a group of peaceful demonstrators gathered in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., to protest the murder of George Floyd, a father, son, brother, and African American man. On the same day, President Trump told senior advisors that they had to show that they could control the streets of Washington and the area around the White House. At the same time law enforcement officers were violently attacking demonstrators in the square. The plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against the President and Attorney General of the United States, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army 200 Army Pentagon, and the Secretary of the Army for violating the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment rights of the demonstrators by ordering the use of violence against them.","In May 2020, a group of civil rights activists filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald Trump, the President's Chief of Staff, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Chief of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, and several other government officials. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants conspired to use violence against the plaintiffs and their supporters in Lafayette Square on May 31, 2020. The plaintiffs filed this suit on June 4, 2020. On August 19, 2020, the court entered a verdict against the defendants."
400,PN-GA-0003,"In 2009, patrons of an Atlanta gay bar sued the Atlanta Police Department, alleging that a raid on the bar had taken place without particularized reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The parties reached a settlement requiring the police department to reform its policies. However, after the judgment, the plaintiffs filed for sanctions twice because the police department had not implemented the policies. 

In response to a joint motion by the parties, the Court ordered the appointment of a special master on June 22, 2016 to monitor the Atlanta Police Department's compliance with court orders and assist the parties in addressing any obstacles with compliance or relevant discovery. After some time, the special master noted several disputes between the parties. The Court ordered the police department to show cause why it should not be held in contempt for violating the court order. However, as of September 2018, the parties were close to reaching a settlement agreement.  ","This Complaint also seeks redress for the numerous state law torts committed by individual Defendants, including false imprisonment, assault, battery, and trespass. Defendants violated the Constitution and committed said torts when, without search or arrest warrants, officers of the Atlanta Police Department (“APD”) raided the Atlanta Eagle (“the Eagle”) and Rawhide Leather (“Rawhide”) on September 10-11, 2009 (the “Raid”). During the Raid, officers of the APD detained all persons who were customers or employees at the Eagle and Rawhide (forcing most to lay flat on the ground, many to lay in spilled beer and broken glass, and restraining some with handcuffs); used excessive force, including shoving individuals to the floor and kicking others already on the floor; made threats of improper and excessive violence; made anti-gay slurs; searched all persons on the premises; seized the driver’s licenses or other ID documents of persons on the premises; and entered the names of persons on the premises into a police computer and checked their names against a police database.
(Affidavit of John Carney, 31, Attachment 4 hereto.) This action arises from a warrantless raid (the “Raid”) conducted on the night of September 10, 2009 and early morning of September 11, 1009, by the Atlanta Police Department (“APD”) on a bar called the Atlanta Eagle. Defendants have admitted that APD officers forced all 60-70 persons in the establishment to lay on the floor while they frisked them and entered all their names into a police database to search for warrants and/or criminal history.2 Plaintiffs contend, among other things, that Defendants unlawfully detained them without particularized reasonable articulable suspicion; unlawfully arrested them without probable cause; unlawfully frisked them for weapons without particularized reasonable articulable suspicion that they were armed and dangerous; unlawfully searched them without a warrant or probable cause; unlawfully searched the premises of the Atlanta Eagle, a retail store in the same building, and the home of Plaintiff Shepherd without a warrant or probable cause; and unlawfully arrested Plaintiff Shepherd in his home.
While Defendants concede that discovery in this matter has not progressed as smoothly as either side would have anticipated, this is not solely the responsibility of Defendants. This case originally was filed on November 24, 2009 alleging constitutional violations relative to an event that occurred on September 10, 2009 at the Atlanta Eagle. Service was effectuated by consent of the City on January 4, 2010 and the appropriated waivers were filed thereafter.

The specific events as they pertain to this Order are as follows. In December 2010, the parties entered into a consent order (the “2010 Order”) settling a lawsuit regarding the Atlanta Police Department’s (“APD”) unconstitutional search of an Atlanta nightclub. The 2010 Order set forth a number of reforms the City was required to undertake in order to remediate the unlawful practices of its police force.
The question here is whether this Court can award fees in this case, not the emergency petition. This case was based on § 1983, one of the civil rights law listed in § 1988. Thus, this Court has the power to award fees.

Rawhide Leather, Inc. a Georgia corporation (See above for address) LEAD ATTORNEY","On December 8, 2009, a group of gay bar owners and employees filed a lawsuit against the City of Atlanta in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The plaintiffs alleged that the City's police officers violated their civil rights when they unlawfully raided the Eagle and Rawhide bar in downtown Atlanta. The parties reached a settlement agreement in which the City agreed to implement certain reforms to deter future instances of police misconduct, including the use of anti-gay slurs, excessive force, and search and seizure. The settlement agreement was entered into on June 6, 2011, and the parties filed a motion for entry of a consent order on June 22, 2011. On July 14, 2016, the parties agreed to a joint consent order, which required the City to implement all of the reforms set forth in Exhibit A to the settlement agreement within 180 days (i.e., before June 6, 2011) of the original complaint. On June 22, 2016, the Court granted the parties' motion for consent order and for contempt of court, and on July 28, 2016, the court entered a final consent order.","On September 10, 2009, a group of customers and employees of the Atlanta Eagle nightclub and Rawhide Leather filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the Atlanta Police Department and the City of Atlanta. The complaint alleged that the defendants conducted a warrantless raid of the Eagle on September 11, 2009 without a warrant or probable cause. In December 2010, the parties entered into a consent order (the ""2010 Order""), which required the APD to undertake a number of reforms to its police force. The 2010 Order also required the City to pay the plaintiffs' attorney's fees and costs. The parties agreed to dismiss the case without prejudice."
401,PN-IL-0007,"In November 1974, several individuals and groups filed a civil rights action against Chicago's mayor and police officials, claiming that they had engaged in unlawful intelligence gathering and electronic surveillance. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants had violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and they sought both damages and injunctive relief.

After the case was consolidated with a number of related cases, in August 1981, the parties entered into a consent decree settlement. The consent decree barred the City from political spying, harassment, and investigation of certain activities protected by the First Amendment. Despite the settlement, decades of litigation addressing enforcement of the decree followed.

In April 2011, the district court granted the City's motion to dismiss the case. The court's order permitted the plaintiffs to file a motion to reinstate the consent decree within 45 days if the City did not conduct an audit showing compliance with the terms of the agreement. There was no further legal action taken by either party.","(See Paragraph 97, plaintiffs’ complaint) *441 In order to protect the parties’ right to prove their respective contentions, this Court follows the approach taken by the District Court for the District of Columbia in Black v. United States, 389 F.Supp. In that case, plaintiff alleged that defendant’s unlawful electronic surveillance and dissemination of information damaged him financially. The Court was faced with defendant’s failure to produce logs kept on the electronic surveillance of plaintiff.
There the class at issue consisted of all persons of Spanish surname in the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs alleged that the class had been subjected to a ""pattern and practice of harassment."" 540 F.2d at 1065.
The guidelines led to a sharp reduction in the number of domestic security investigations and set the stage for the settlement of the suit. The parties signed a settlement agreement in the fall of 1980. The agreement runs to 31 doublespaced typewritten pages and includes among other extraordinary provisions a section that gives standing not only to the plaintiffs but to every resident of Chicago at the time of the settlement to enforce the decree by application to the district court, and a section that empowers the plaintiffs' representatives to monitor compliance with the decree for five years with the help of periodic reports that the decree requires the Justice Department to furnish them.
Plaintiffs indicate that if the case were brought to trial, they would testify that their activities were always lawful. The only defendant in this case is the City of Chicago (""City""); claims against individual members of the Chicago Police Department have been settled and dismissed. The actions complained of in this case are deemed to have been done under color of state law and represent the official policy of the City of Chicago.
*4 Res judicata (claim preclusion) does not apply to this action, since res judicata cannot bar litigation which could not have been raised in the prior adjudication. This case is an action to enforce a 1981 consent decree which was issued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Since, any proceeding to enforce the decree must be filed in this court, the District of Columbia’s court’s ruling cannot constitute res judicata as to this proceeding.
First, implementation was delayed several times by agreement. Later, the court found that the Commonwealth violated the consent decree Id. Then, the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted legislation prohibiting the expenditure of state funds for the I/M program.
at 551. Delaware Valley then sought attorney’s fees and costs under the Clean Air Act for all of the work it performed after issuance of the consent decree. This fee petition included the time spent monitoring the Commonwealth’s compliance under the consent decree, and spent in hearings before the Environmental Protection Agency.4 Significantly, the Court affirmed the district court’s award of these attorney’s fees, emphasizing that numerous courts had permitted monitoring fees under § 1988 Id.
In 1974, the original plaintiffs in this case, including the Alliance to End Repression and the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a class action complaint against the City of Chicago, the Chicago Police Department, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Director of the FBI, alleging that the defendants were engaging in unconstitutional conduct directed at their First Amendment activities. After several years, the case was settled in August of 1981 by the entry of a consent decree which was approved by a district judge. [1]Alliance to End Repression v. Chicago, 91 F.R.D.
Both sides filed for summary judgment. Ultimately, the district judge found that the defendants had violated the decree. She ordered the relief requested.
When this case was filed in 1974, the possibility that an investigation aimed exclusively at First Amendment activity would be launched was not at all remote. The plaintiffs in this case originally alleged that the Chicago field office conducted ""domestic security"" investigations with the intent to harass and intimidate various groups and individuals for expressing their political views. From 1948 to 1966 the FBI is said to have committed numerous ""black bag jobs"" (breakings and enterings) in the Chicago area, many of which resulted in the gathering of information concerning lawful political activities.
This is not clear and convincing evidence that the police were monitoring CounterMedia’s radio communications, nor that the investigation was directed toward First Amendment conduct. Plaintiffs also allege that the police disrupted CounterMedia’s internal radio communications. While arresting Lee Wells, one of the CounterMedia journalists, during the Festival of the Oppressed, police seized his radio.

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had engaged in a pattern and practice involving the following activities: (1) surveillance and intelligence-gathering on individuals and organizations engaged in lawful activities; (2) unlawful wire-tapping and other forms of electronic surveillance; and (3) unlawful entry and seizure. The parties entered into a consent decree to govern the City's investigation of political and other activities engaged in by plaintiffs. The decree provided extensive regulations intended to govern police department investigations that are directed toward First Amendment activity, setting out procedures for such investigations (citation omitted)","In 1974, the Alliance to End Repression and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class action complaint against the City of Chicago, the Chicago Police Department, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Director of the FBI, alleging that the defendants were engaging in unconstitutional conduct directed at their First Amendment activities.

402,PN-IL-0008,"In a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the plaintiffs challenged Chicago Police Department's alleged unconstitutional pattern and practice of detaining persons under its control for excessive periods of time and under conditions plaintiffs claimed reached the level of ""soft torture."" This case settled on October 6, 2010 for $16.5 million.","In appealing that decision, Defendant City of Chicago essentially conceded the Fourth Amendment violation but represented to the Seventh Circuit that it had abolished the policy allowing such detentions. The Seventh Circuit reversed the award of the injunction on standing grounds. However, the CPD completely failed to enact any policies forbidding the challenged detentions or to take other appropriate steps to cease the detentions.

The need for appropriate sleeping facilities while being detained for extended periods by the CPD is so obvious that the failure to provide them while continuing to maintain this policy manifests deliberate indifference; b. The City of Chicago maintains no policies regarding furnishing proper sleeping facilities to arrestees, nor does it maintain any policies regarding the maximum duration for which an arrestee may be kept in an interview room. The failure to maintain such policies is likely to result in the unconstitutional use of such rooms to house arrestees that it manifests deliberate indifference; c.
At no time during the entire detention did they receive a mattress, blanket or pillow. This is because Chicago has failed to provide proper facilities for arrestees being held overnight. After approximately 62 hours, Plaintiffs were released without being charged with any crime.

No. 04 C 6804 Judge Robert W. Gettleman MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Plaintiffs Thomas Dunn (""Dunn"") and Denny Robinson (""Robinson""), individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a four-count putative class action against defendant City of Chicago (""City"") pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 on October 21,2004. Plaintiffs allege that while in the custody of the Chicago Police Department (""CPO"") as post-arrest detainees, they were subjected to unlawful inten·ogation room detentions (Count I), deprived of adequate accommodations for sleep (Count II), and detained more than 48 hours before receiving a judicial hearing (Count III). Count IV asserts a respondeat superior claim.
For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motion to reconsider is granted, and Class III is redefined as: All persons arrested on suspicion of a felony without an arrest warrant and who were detained by the CPD in excess of 48 hours without a judicial probable cause hearing at any time from March 15, 1999, to the date of this order. Footnotes The court also denied certification of Class I and granted certification of Class II by agreement. The issues addressed in this opinion do not affect those two classes.
NO: 04-CV-6804 Judge Gettleman Magistrate Schenkier JURY TRIAL DEMANDED AMENDED COMPLAINT NOW COME Plaintiffs THOMAS DUNN, DENNY ROBINSON, VERONICA IMPERIAL, and LEONARD KIMBLE, on behalf of themselves and a class of others similarly situated, through their attorneys Loevy Loevy, and for their complaint against Defendant CITY OF CHICAGO, state as follows: Introduction 1. This is a class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C Section 1983 challenging the Chicago Police Department’s (“CPD” or “Department”) inhumane and unlawful system for detaining persons under the Department’s control. As is explained in detail below, the CPD has engaged, for decades, in a repeated pattern of detaining citizens incommunicado within its police departments, holding them for unconstitutional lengths of time and subjecting them to torture in order to accomplish unjust ends.
(b) amed Plaintiffs’ Incentive Awards. The Named Plaintiffs’ incentive awards (“Incentive Awards”) will be paid out of the Settlement Fund. Subject to Court approval, Thomas Dunn is eligible to receive an Incentive Award not to exceed $25,000, Veronica Imperial is eligible to receive an Incentive Award not to exceed $25,000, and Denny Robinson is eligible to receive an Incentive Award not to exceed $25,000.
Class Counsel’s attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses will be paid out of the Settlement Fund. Class Counsel agree not to seek from the Court an award of attorneys’ fees in excess of $5,000,000.00, and costs and expenses in excess of $70,000.00 (the “Attorneys’ Fee Award”). The final determination of the Attorneys’ Fee Award will be decided by the Court, as further described in Paragraph 37.

SYKES, Circuit Judge.
John Vergara, Carlos Ruiz, and Jose Garcia filed a civil-rights lawsuit against the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Officers John Dal Ponte, Boonserm Srisuch, and Perry Nigro. The defendants moved to dismiss the suit as untimely. The plaintiffs asked the district judge to equitably estop the defendants from raising the limitations defense, claiming that the officers intimidated them into silence.
No. 18-1266 The judge dismissed the suit in a minute order saying she would later file an opinion explaining her reasons. The promised opinion came almost two years later, and the plaintiffs then appealed.
The plaintiffs were denied food, water, and access to a bathroom, and the officers tried to coerce false confessions from them. The officers also threatened to file false charges against the plaintiffs if they told anyone about their mistreatment at Homan Square. The plaintiffs were released only after they agreed to keep quiet about what had happened.
See FED R. APP P. 4(a)(7)(A). Here the judge dismissed the case by minute order entered on March 31, 2016. By operation of Rule 4(a)(7)(A), that order was deemed “entered” for appeal purposes 150 days later, and the time to file a notice of appeal expired 30 days after that.
On August 17, 2018, the defendants filed their docketing statement noting the untimeliness problem and moved to dismiss the appeal. We directed the parties to brief the dismissal motion with the merits. Discussion We begin by untangling the procedural snarl.
The February 6, 2018 notice of appeal was clearly untimely under these rules. The judge dismissed the case by minute order on March 31, 2016. Her opinion explaining her reasons came two years later—on January 31, 2018—along with a Rule 58 judgment.

After approximately three hours, Plaintiff Scott observed a small number of people in the crowd throw plastic water bottles. Other demonstrators immediately denounced the behavior. Without warning, the line of LMPD officers began advancing quickly with batons drawn, pushing the crowd back.

Plaintiff Tinsley responded that they were looking for her car. The other protester told the officers that they were on a public sidewalk. Defendant Officers John Does #10-13 responded by firing pepper balls at Plaintiff Tinsley and the other protester—from just a few feet away.

Thousands of peaceful protesters have been subjected to the Crowd Control Weaponry that the LMPD has deployed from May 28, 2020 to July 30, 2020. Hundreds of peaceful protesters have been arrested during that time. The questions of law and fact presented by Plaintiffs are common to all members of the Plaintiff Class.
The violations suffered by Plaintiffs are typical of the Plaintiff Class. Plaintiffs were peacefully protesting when LMPD employed Crowd Control Weaponry on them. The injuries they suffered as a result of Crowd Control Weaponry, as well as the chilling effect of these uses of force on their willingness to peacefully assemble to protest, are identical to the injuries sustained by the rest of the Plaintiff Class.

Samuel Shapiro (See above for address) LEAD ATTORNEY ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED V. Defendant Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government Defendant Greg Fischer individually and in his official capacity as Mayor of Louisville","On August 25, 2020, the Kentucky Alliance Against Racial and Political Repression (KAARPR) filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky against the city of Louisville and its mayor. The plaintiffs allege that the city's police department used excessive force against peaceful protesters who were demonstrating against the death of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and other unarmed Black people by police. The case was brought against Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government Defendant Greg Fischer individually and in his official capacity as Mayor of Louisville.","On May 28, 2020, the ACLU of Kentucky and the NAACP of Louisville filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against the city of Louisville and the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) alleging that the LMPD used disproportionate violence to stop peaceful protesters from exercising their First and Fourth Amendment rights to peacefully assemble to protest. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the use of military-grade weaponry, including tear gas, batons, and pepper balls, against peaceful protesters was disproportionate to the injuries sustained by the rest of the Plaintiff Class. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction. The case is still pending in federal court."
405,PN-MD-0001,"In July 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ] initiated an investigation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141 of alleged misconduct by the Canine Section of the Prince George's County Police Department [PGPD].  The investigation followed some eighteen civil rights lawsuits filed between 1993 through 1998 by individuals that alleged dog attacks by the PGPD's canine unit. Following the DOJ's investigation, DOJ, PGPD and local FOP officials met and negotiated agreements to address all of the DOJ's concerns which resulted in a Consent Decree being entered on January 22, 2004. On February 12, 2007, the Court granted the motion stating that PGPD had a) complied fully with the consent decree, and b) eliminated the last vestiges of unlawful behavior and had thus satisfied the decree.

In July 1999, the Department of Justice initiated an investigation of alleged misconduct by the Canine Section of the Prince George’s County Police Department. In October 2000, the Department of Justice initiated an investigation of an alleged pattern or practice of excessive force throughout the Prince George’s County Police Department. Both investigations were commenced pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141, and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3789d.

The term “non-disciplinary corrective action” refers to action other than discipline taken by a PGPD supervisor to enable or encourage an officer to modify or improve his or her performance. The term “PGPD” means the Prince George’s County Police Department. The term “police officer” or “officer” means any law enforcement officer employed by PGPD, including supervisors.

The United States is authorized to initiate this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 14141. Venue is proper in the District of Maryland pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as the Defendants reside in and the claims arose in the District of Maryland. This Agreement resolves all claims between the United States and Prince George’s County, Maryland involving the Canine Section of the Prince George's County Police Department in the United States’ Complaint filed in this case.

On November 17, 2004 representatives from the PGPD and the Office of the County Attorney traveled to the Pittsburgh, PA Police Bureau, for a briefing on their Performance Assessment and Review System (PARS). The PARS system is an automated personnel performance management system which was mandated in the Pittsburgh Consent Decree settling a civil rights complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging that the Pittsburgh Police Bureau had engaged in a pattern or practice of police misconduct. The Pittsburgh PARS system has been cited nationally by many law enforcement officials as a “best practice” model for Early Identification and Warning Systems.
On December 21, 2004, the PGPD and the Office of the County Attorney sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice regarding a recommendation concerning item (g) of paragraph 34 of the MOA. The PGPD and the Office of the County Attorney have proposed to insert language in the PGPD Use of Force Policies, specifically prohibiting the use of choke holds and similar carotid holds by its police officers. This proposal does not incorporate the MOA’s extended requirement in item (g) which makes an exception to allow the use of choke holds and similar carotid holds in those instances where deadly force is authorized.
The Department implemented a “Police Accountability” project which provides for the placement of Placards at all police District Stations. These placards describe the process for filing a complaint against a Prince George’s County police officer. Bilingual brochures are also being made available though this project.
On March 11, 2004, at the request of both parties, the Court entered the Consent Decree, addressing use of force by the Prince George’s County Police Department Canine Section, as an Order of the Court.
The term of the agreement, as specified in paragraph 77, is three years. The three-year anniversary of the decree is March 11, 2007. Contemporaneously with the negotiation of the Consent Decree, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Agreement addressing the entire Prince George’s County Police Department’s use of force.
Pursuant to paragraph 74 of the Consent Decree, the Defendants have provided quarterly updates detailing their progress towards compliance (see Appendix A). Additionally, the Defendant’s have posted each report on the County’s public website. Pursuant to paragraphs 69 to 73 of the Consent Decree, the United States has monitored the Defendants’ progress implementing the Consent Decree.

According to the above-referenced policies, detainees who require the use of a wheelchair are to be transported and housed at the Northeastern District. The Northeastern District is equipped with two commodes that are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). During our onsite assessment, we interviewed staff at all five Districts regarding detainees who required the use of a wheelchair.

We also inspected the Grand River Neighborhood City Hall and two libraries – Henry Chaney and Campbell. We found the appropriate posters on display. One location did not have a supply of complaint forms or brochures, and we advised the employees to call for replacements.

Under this paragraph, there were a total of 62 auditable forms reviewed by the commander. There were four violations of policy. Two of the four violations occurred due to one lieutenant not signing (command review) the auditable form.

SHIRA A. SCHEINDLIN, U.S.D.J. INTRODUCTION This putative class action challenges the policies and practices that the New York City Police Department (""NYPD"") and the New York City Housing Authority (""NYCHA"") use to enforce prohibitions against trespassing on public housing property. The lawsuit alleges that defendants' actions have resulted in a widespread pattern of unlawful stops, questioning, frisks, searches, and arrests of NYCHA residents and their invited guests.1 This is the second of three lawsuits before this Court that challenge the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices.2 Like the other two cases, and like many of its predecessors, this suit “thrusts to the fore difficult and troublesome issues regarding a sensitive area of police activity.
153, 159 (S.D.N.Y. What distinguishes this case from the other two is its focus on stop and frisk practices at public housing properties owned and operated by the New York City Housing Authority (“NYCHA”). Plaintiffs argue that the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) uses unlawful stops, searches, and arrests to enforce the prohibition against trespassing in NYCHA buildings.2 According to plaintiffs, the NYPD’s practices violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees “[t]he right of the people to be secure... against unreasonable searches and seizures.”

FACTUAL BACKGROUND I. The NYPD’s Aggressive Response to Prior Protests. The NYPD’s unconstitutional response to the 2020 Racial Justice Protests is part of its long history of aggressively policing protests.

Numerous lawsuits were filed against the NYPD following the 2003 anti-war protest, 2004 RNC protests, and 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests. These suits alleged, inter alia, that the NYPD: used unnecessary and excessive force against peaceful protesters, bystanders, legal N.Y. Civil Liberties Union, Rights and Wrongs at the RNC (2005), https://www.nyclu.org/sites/default/files/publications/nyclu_pub_rights_wrongs_rnc.pdf.
On May 31, protests throughout the city continued, with thousands marching from the Barclays Center over the Manhattan Bridge into Lower Manhattan, near the Williamsburg Bridge, and in Times Square and Midtown. At least 325 protesters were arrested. On, June 1, Mayor de Blasio issued Emergency Executive Order 117, imposing an 11:00 p.m. curfew for New York City.

The NYPD Continued its Custom of Using Unjustified Force at the 2020 Racial Justice Protests. NYPD Officers continued the NYPD’s practice of using excessive force against peaceful protesters at the Protests. NYPD Officers applied excessive force in myriad ways at the Protests, including with batons, bicycles, Oleoresin Capsicum (O.C.)

NYPD Officers hit protesters indiscriminately and without provocation. NYPD Officers Indiscriminately Pepper Sprayed Protesters. During the Protests, NYPD Officers engaged in a pattern or practice of using pepper spray indiscriminately against protesters who were not posing a threat to any individual or actively resisting arrest.
The NYPD Continued its Custom of Unlawfully Detaining and Arresting Individuals at the 2020 Racial Justice Protests. NYPD Officers continued the Department’s practice of unlawfully detaining and arresting protesters at the Protests. NYPD Officers arrested or detained without legal justification hundreds of protesters, legal observers, medics, and others at the Protests.

After more than two hours, elected officials helped broker a deal whereby NYPD Officers let protesters exit the Bridge from the Brooklyn side. As a result of the NYPD Officers’ actions, hundreds of peaceful protesters were wrongly detained for hours. June 3, Downtown Brooklyn (Cadman Plaza) 286.

At approximately 8:38 p.m., protesters realized they were flanked by police on both sides and could neither continue north towards the Brooklyn Bridge, nor retreat to the south. Protest organizers then tried to negotiate with NYPD Officers to allow for protesters to safely exit the protest zone. During this time, the march was at a standstill.

Shortly before 9:00 p.m., protesters at East 54th Street and Third Avenue noticed that they were flanked on all sides by NYPD Officers. NYPD Officers blocked protesters with their bicycle frames from leaving the protest zone. Within minutes, dozens of NYPD Officers charged into protesters from all sides and used excessive force while making unlawful arrests.

412,PN-OH-0010,"Individual plaintiffs sued the city of Columbus, Ohio and multiple police officers after protesting the murder of George Floyd. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force to infringe upon their freedom to assemble. ","Two African-American protestors had megaphones and were leading the chants and singing. One of the chants was, “Whose streets? Our streets.”
When Mr. Kaigler observed the Columbus Police Officers, Broad Street was closed to vehicle traffic and officers and protestors were in the street. The protest was loud but peaceful. Upon seeing the Columbus Police Officers, Mr. Kaigler decided to make a political statement: he walked within approximately five feet of them, stopped and raised his arms in a “hands up, don’t shoot” position and stated to the officers “I can’t breathe.”

M. Mistreatment of Plaintiff Rebecca Lamey 292. On May 31, 2020, Ms. Lamey, along with two friends, participated in a peaceful protest for hours. At 7:54 p.m., Columbus Police Officers abruptly decided to stop the protest.

On Friday, June 5, 2020, a lawsuit was filed against Defendant City alleging that the indefinite, city-wide curfew was unconstitutional. Hours after the lawsuit was filed, Mayor Ginther rescinded the curfew.

At that point, there were virtually no protestors in the streets, and Ms. Ruffin and other protestors were on the sidewalk. Columbus Police Officers began deploying tear-gas and smoke bombs against the protestors. The onslaught of tear-gas and smoke bombs continued for more than five minutes.

In Grendell, for example, the Sixth Circuit reviewed a case against the Ohio Supreme Court. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, contending that the Ohio Supreme Court Practice Rule XIV § 5 was unconstitutional on its face. Absent evidence of a real and immediate threat of repeated injury, Mr. Grendell’s prior injury (i.e., being previously sanctioned by the Ohio Supreme Court) did not establish an adequate injury in fact to confer standing,.

This case seeks to stop the Portland police1 from assaulting news reporters, photographers, legal observers, and other neutrals who are documenting the police’s violent response to protests over the murder of George Floyd. The police’s efforts to intimidate the press and suppress reporting on the police’s own misconduct offends fundamental constitutional protections and strikes at the core of our democracy.

But nearly every night, the Portland police have used increasingly severe tactics to deter speech on this important issue. Portland police have shot rubber bullets into crowds of protesters. Rubber bullets are 40mm-wide “pain compliance devices.”


It’s simply too dangerous for them to be out there right now. Portland police have a policy or practice of using indiscriminate killbox or kettling tactics against crowds including journalists and other neutrals. They have used the same tactic in at least November 2014, January 2017, and June 2017.32 F.


Although Defendants have not yet formally appeared in this lawsuit or had sufficient time to file any responsive documents, on July 1 and July 2, 2020, the Court heard the respective positions of the parties by telephone conference. For the reasons explained below, Plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order (""TRO"") is granted in part. STANDARDS In deciding whether to grant a motion for TRO, courts look to substantially the same factors that apply to a court's decision on whether to issue a preliminary injunction.

On June 1, 2020, people from Pittsburgh and surrounding communities assembled in the East Liberty neighborhood of the City of Pittsburgh to add their voices to these nationwide protests and seek change locally. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (“PBP”) responded by escalating a peaceful protest into a scene of pandemonium, panic, violence and bloodshed. The PBP deployed hundreds of officers to counter approximately 150 protesters.
Numerous videos demonstrate that these statements were patently false. Plaintiffs are peaceful protesters who were subjected to police violence while protesting police violence. • Nicole Rulli and Charles Bryant brought Ms. Rulli’s thirteen-year-old son, A.F., to the protest to teach him about his First Amendment rights.
Defendant Wendell Hissrich is the Director of the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety. Hissrich is the chief policymaker for the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety. At all times relevant, Hissrich ordered, authorized, participated in and/or acquiesced in the violations of Plaintiffs’ rights as alleged herein.
Hissrich is sued in his official and individual capacities. Defendant Scott Schubert is the Chief of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. At all times relevant, Schubert was a policymaker of Defendant City of Pittsburgh.
However, following some reports of property damage, PBP officers used chemical gas, rubber bullets and other projectiles, pepper spray, flashbang grenades and other riot control agents indiscriminately against everyone present, including peaceful protesters and nonviolent bystanders. Numerous protesters were seriously injured. The PBP arrested 46 people at the protests for “failure to disperse.”
The Protesters stopped on Centre Avenue approximately 30 feet from the line of police officers. The Protesters were peaceful. The Protesters’ behavior was not materially different from the behavior of the larger group of protesters earlier in the day, which the PBP openly approved and supported.
Individual Defendants witnessed or were otherwise aware of the events described herein as they unfolded.

416,PN-RI-0001,"Plaintiffs, individual Hispanic members of a high school soccer team, sued police officers and the City of Coventry based on police search of the team after an away soccer game. Plaintiffs alleged Fourth Amendment and Equal Protection claims in violation of  42 U.S.C. § 1983 as well as a number of analogous state law claims. On September 9, 2009, the district court granted summary judgment for defendants on all of plaintiffs' claims, and on April 1, 2011, the First Circuit affirmed.","The Coventry police, including defendants Harris, Kennedy, Michailides and Nelson raced to the scene with lights blaring and blocked the school bus from departing. The Coventry students made accusations to the police that the Central Falls students had stolen items from their locker room. Defendants Harris, Kennedy, Michailides and Nelson requested to speak with the Central Falls players and the players were told to exit the bus with their belongings.

The Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint arose out of an incident taking place on or about September 28, 2006. On that date, the Plaintiffs, who are Hispanic, were members of the Central Falls High School Soccer Team.
Counts I, II, and III are actions brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging deprivation of the Plaintiffs’ rights to due process, equal protection, and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. The Plaintiffs also brought state law claims. Count IV alleged an invasion of privacy pursuant to R.I.G.L.

The Defendants also attempt to obtain summary judgment on Count II of Plaintiffs’ complaint, a § 1983 claim for violation of their right to equal protection. The Defendants claim that they are entitled to summary judgment because there was no evidence that the Plaintiffs were treated differently than others similarly situated based upon their race. There is more than sufficient evidence to support a jury finding to the contrary.
THE DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THEIR CLAIMS INVOLVING FAILURE TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE TRAINING. Plaintiffs brought a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 asserting that the Coventry Chief of Police and the Town of Coventry failed to provide adequate training to the Defendant police officers who conducted the mass search. To sustain a § 1983 claim for failure to provide adequate police training, the Plaintiffs must show that the Chief and Town showed “deliberate indifference” to the rights of the individuals with whom their underlings would be in contact.
The instant matter arose out of an incident taking place on or about September 28, 2006. The Appellants, who are Hispanic, were members of the Central Falls High School Men’s Soccer Team. The team had travelled by bus to an “away” game in Coventry, a predominately white community.
§ 9-1-35, Racial/National Origin Intimidation. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Coventry defendants on all counts. The District Court found that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the claims for the violations of the Central Falls’ players rights under the Fourth Amendment, and also under R.I.G.L.
As its basis, the District Court ruled that Coach Marchand had given an uncoerced consent to the search.
STATEMENT OF THE CASE This is an appeal from a judgment entered in favor of Appellees following an order granting summary judgment on all counts of the Appellants’ Amended Complaint. Appellants had brought action against the Town of Coventry and various of its police officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of their rights to unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as their rights to due process and equal protection pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellants had also alleged a violation of their rights to privacy pursuant to R.I.G.L.
After discovery, the Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts, which was granted in full on September 11, 2009. The District Court also filed a final judgment on the same day. Appellants take the position that the District Court’s ruling was in error, except as to the claims of municipal and supervisory liability V.
The differences were indeed glaring. The Coventry police singled out the Hispanic Central Falls players for a search. Their peers from predominately-white Coventry were not even asked to agree to a search.

418,PN-VI-0001,"In March 2004, the Department of Justice (DOJ) opened an investigation into the Virgin Islands Police Department's (VIPD) practices regarding use of excessive force, and on December 23, 2008, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of the Virgin Islands. On March 24, 2009, the parties signed a consent decree, detailing specific actions to be taken by VIPD. Enforcement of the consent decree is in progress.","Virgin Islands officials met with DOJ officials to facilitate the Virgin Islands' cooperation with the Departmc:mt ofJustice investigation and craft a consent decree addressing all the parties' concelns. This consent decree (""Agreement"") is the result of a cooperative effort that evinces a commitment to constitutional policing on the part of the Department ofJustice; the Territory ofthe Virgin Islands; and the Virgin lslsnds Police Department (collectively, ""the parties'1. General Previsions 3.
The parties also jointly request the adoption of an action plan. On March 23, 2009, the Court approved a Consent Decree in this matter (the “Consent Decree”). The Consent decree set forth various reforms to be implemented by the Government of the Virgin Islands and the Virgin Islands Police Department (collectively, the “Virgin Islands”) in order to correct an alleged systematic violation of constitutional rights through excessive force.
Introduction This is the Third Quarterly Report of 2013 from the Office of the Independent Monitor (the “OIM” or the “Monitor”) for the United States Virgin Islands Police Department (the “VIPD” or the “Department”), covering the quarter ending on September 30, 2013. The OIM was established in January 2010 to monitor compliance by the United States Virgin Islands (the “Territory”) and the VIPD with the Consent Decree entered by the United States District Court for the District of the Virgin Islands (the “Court”) on March 23, 2009. The Monitor is required by the Consent Decree to “issue quarterly written, public reports detailing the Territory‟s compliance with and implementation of each substantive provision” of the Consent Decree.2 The Consent Decree reflects the agreement between the Territory, the VIPD, and the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) (collectively, the “Parties”) to resolve a lawsuit brought by the United States alleging that the Territory and the VIPD violated 42 U.S.C. § 14141 by engaging “in a pattern or practice of excessive force by Officers of the Virgin Islands Police Department and by the failure to adequately train, supervise, investigate, and discipline Officers.


In addition, there were frequent communications and updates, telephonically and electronically, between the VIPD and the Police Practices Experts during the Fourth Quarter of 2013, as well as periodic telephone conferences among the VIPD, the Virgin Islands Attorney General’s Office (the “VIAG”), the Office of the Governor, the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the Police Practices Experts, and the Monitor to discuss the VIPD’s efforts towards substantial compliance with the Consent Decree. On November 18, 2013 (the “November 18 Hearing”), the United States District Court for the District of the Virgin Islands (the “Court”) held a full day hearing to review a joint motion filed by the Parties to extend the Consent Decree’s October 31, 2013 substantial compliance deadline for another two years (the “Joint Motion”). As previously reported, the original deadline for substantial compliance was March 23, 2012, to be followed by two consecutive years of compliance, at which time the Consent Decree would terminate.
Also, during this reporting period training was conducted in Crisis Intervention May 13-14 and 15-16, 2014 in the St. Thomas/St. John District and May 19-20, 2014 and May 21-22, 2014 in the St. Croix District. There were internal VIPD discussions as to whether or not the crisis intervention training referenced above satisfies subsection (i) of paragraph 79, to which the compliance coordinator recommended that course information relative to said training be forwarded to IMT to enlist their input in said determination.
Measures of lawful, constitutional uses of force will be the cornerstone of the measures and assessment package. These are the practices which the parties agreed to remedy. Final settlement of Consent Decree compliance can only be justified by demonstrating that constitutional behaviors and practices are in place and have been sustained for the two-year period required by the Consent Decree.","In March 2004, the Department of Justice (""DOJ"") initiated an investigation of an alleged pattern or practice of excessive force throughout the Virgin Islands Police Department (""VIPD"") under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C.  14141 (""CD""). The CD is the result of a cooperative effort that evinces a commitment to constitutional policing on the part of the DOJ and the Territory of the Virgin Island. The CD was issued on January 7, 2014 and requires the VIPD to implement corrective action, deficiencies and made recommendations; going including training, and disciplinary action against forward, the OIM will track how VIPD the sworn personnel and applicable civilian implement these recommendations. The OIM is not satisfied with progress to date. It has issued two principal Orders that ca ll for prioritization of compliance goals and stringent timetables ""Quarterly Goals.""","On March 23, 2009, the U.S. District Court for the District of the Virgin Islands (the 'Court') entered a Consent Decree between the Virgin Island Police Department ('VIPD') and the Department of Justice ('DOJ') to correct an alleged systematic violation of constitutional rights through excessive force. The Consent Decree required the VIPD to implement a series of reforms, including training, supervision, investigation, and discipline measures. The parties agreed to a two-year extension of the Consent Decree's deadline for substantial compliance, which was March 23, 2012, to be followed by two consecutive years of compliance, at which time the consent decree would terminate. The third quarterly report of the Office of the Independent Monitor ('OIM' or the 'Monitor') for the United States Virgin Islands Police Department covered the quarter ending on September 30, 2013.

419,PN-WA-0004,"In May 2014, approximately 125 police officers from the Seattle Police Department (SPD) brought this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The plaintiffs alleged that SPD's new policy that limited the amount of force they could use on civilians was a violation of their constitutional right to self-defense. The court dismissed the case in October 2017, holding that there was no constitutional right to self-defense. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the holding.","Defendants Perez, Durkan and Defendant, Jonathan Smith, Chief of Special Litigation for DOJ worked closely with the Mayor's office to develop the Consent Agreement and the subsequent UF Policy, as did other members of the Special Litigation Section, including Defendants Emily Gunston and Timothy Mygatt. DOJ continues to be involved in the implementation of, and training under, the new policy. Defendant Jocelyn Samuels is the current Acting AAG for Civil Rights.
Doing so subjects us to unreasonable risks to our safety, and to the constant, unreasonable threat that we will be sanctioned for performing our job in anything less than a perfect (impossible!) manner under the policy. The UF Policy operates under a mistaken and dangerous assumption that threatening situations always move in a linear, predictable direction.
However, his cursory, one-and-one-half-page order contains no 24 substantive analysis of the UF Policy's constitutionality, particularly as it relates to Plaintiffs' constitutional right to protect and defend the public and themselves from threatening and dangerous behavior by suspects. In July 2012, a Settlement Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding (Consent Agreement) was entered into between the United States and the City. The City The Honorable Marsha J. Pechman agreed to develop a new UF policy consistent with the constitutional requirements 1 of Graham v Connor.
This immunity is known as “quasi-judicial” because it is derived from the immunity 22 given to judges, and Merrick Bobb is entitled to it both because he was appointed as an agent of 1 a judge and because he was engaged in activities that parallel those of a judge. Because the 2 officers’ case is not supported by the Constitution or case law, the Court dismisses the lawsuit.

420,PR-NV-0001,"A rural Nevada church brought this lawsuit against the Governor of Nevada on May 22, 2020, alleging that the governor’s COVID-19 gathering ban was a violation of the church’s First Amendment rights. The district court denied the church’s motions for preliminary injunctive relief; the church appealed this denial to the Ninth Circuit. Both the Ninth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court denied motions for injunction pending the Ninth Circuit’s appeal; as of August 6, 2020, the appeal is pending in the Ninth Circuit.","This action challenges Governor Steve Sisolak’s emergency orders 3 prohibiting churches and other places of worship from holding in-person worship 4 services of ten or more people, even when such services could be held in accordance 5 with social distancing and public health guidelines (the “Church Gathering Ban”). For over two months, Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley (the “Church”) 7 has been unable to hold an in-person worship service due to Covid-19 and the 8 Governor’s Church Gathering Ban.

FACTS Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley 20. Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley has operated as a Christian church in 6 Dayton, Nevada since February 5, 2006. The Church believes that the Bible is the inspired Word of God and 8 infallible rule of faith and practice.
I am and have been at all time relevant hereto the Senior Pastor of Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley (CCDV). CCDV has operated as a Christian church in Dayton, Nevada, since February 5, 7 3. Our church is comprised of approximately 400 people who primarily live and work in and around the Dayton area of Lyon County, Nevada.

They prohibit all mass gatherings 20 exceeding fifty people, whether general mass gatherings, religious services, movie theaters, 21 or trade schools. They prohibit live entertainment venues from having any spectators. 22 Calvary offers no facts suggesting that Governor Sisolak has any animus towards religious 23 organizations.
10 STEVE SISOLAK AARON FORD 11 FRANK HUNEWILL Defendant(s). INTRODUCTION Before the Court are Plaintiff Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley’s (“Calvary” or “Plaintiff”) 16 Emergency Motions for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. ECF Nos.
The complaint brought facial and as-applied First and 22 Fourteenth Amendment challenges to Governor Sisolak’s emergency directives in response to the 23 COVID-19 pandemic Id. Plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary 24 injunction on May 28 and May 29, 2020.
However, Calvary sincerely believes that online services and drive-in 10 services thwart the Bible’s requirement of in-person services for corporate worship, and some 11 12 church attendees do not have internet access and therefore are not able to participate in online 13 services. Calvary therefore wishes to resume in-person services. On May 26, 2020, Defendant Governor Sisolak announced that Nevada would enter “Phase 15 Two” of its reopening.
Calvary has presented 13 no evidence indicating that it has been subject to actual enforcement by the Sheriff or any other 14 law enforcement officer. Calvary therefore has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the 15 merits of its selective enforcement claim. If Calvary does in fact have evidence of selective 16 enforcement against it, nothing in this order shall prohibit it from returning to the Court with that 17 18 evidence and filing a new motion for a preliminary injunction.
It wishes to host worship services for about 90 congregants, a figure that amounts to 50% of its fire-code capacity. In conducting these services, Calvary Chapel plans to take many precautions that go beyond anything that the State requires. In addition to asking congregants to adhere to proper social distancing protocols, it intends to cut the length of services in half.
Citing this disparate treatment, Calvary Chapel brought suit in Federal District Court and sought an injunction allowing it to conduct services, in accordance with its plan, for up to 50% of maximum occupancy. The District Court refused to grant relief, the Ninth Circuit denied Calvary Chapel’s application for an injunction pending appeal, and now this Court likewise denies relief. I would grant an injunction pending appeal.
Few worship services last two hours. (Calvary Chapel now limits its services to 45 minutes.) And worshippers do not generally mill around the church while a service is in progress.
In my view, the State of California’s explanation, at least on that record, did not persuasively distinguish religious services from several of the favored secular organizations, particularly restaurants and supermarkets. But the Court ultimately denied the church’s request for an emergency injunction. In his concurrence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE appropriately emphasized both the high standard for obtaining injunctive relief in this Court and the ongoing and rapidly changing public health emergency.","On May 22, 2020, a church in Nevada filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada against the State of Nevada, the Nevada Gaming Commission, and Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak. The church claimed that the state's ban on church gatherings violated its First Amendment rights. The district court denied the church's motion for preliminary injunction pending appeal, and the case is now closed.","On February 5, 2018, Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley (the “Church”) filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada against Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak and the Nevada Department of Health. The Church challenged the Governor’s emergency orders 3 prohibiting churches and other places of worship from holding in-person worship 4 services of ten or more people, even when such services could be held in accordance with public health guidelines. On May 26, 2020, the District Court denied the Church’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction pending appeal. The District Court granted the Church a preliminary injunction on May 28, 2020. On May 29, 2020, the Court granted a permanent restraining order. The Court also granted the church's request for a permanent injunction on June 5, 2020."

After the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the opinion and directed the Second Circuit to dismiss the case as moot because there was a change in presidential administrations due to the 2020 election.","The collection of replies and replies-toreplies is sometimes referred to as a “comment thread.” Twitter is called a “social” media 30 Favoriting.

One or more of the Defendants blocked Mr. Pappas from the @realDonaldTrump account on June 5, 2017. That morning, President Trump tweeted: “The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court seek much tougher version!”

Barrington D. Parker, Circuit Judge, statement with respect to the denial of rehearing en banc. This case arises from the President's use of the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account (the ""Account"") as a primary vehicle for his official communications. He uses this account to make official statements on a wide variety of subjects, many of great national importance.
Because the panel opinion contravenes both our state-action and public-forum precedents, I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc. This case concerns the President's personal Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, which he created in 2009, more than six years before taking office. The President ""blocked"" Plaintiffs from interacting with his account, and they sued, claiming a violation of the First Amendment.
The 9 Plaintiffs sued President Trump along with certain White House officials, 10 contending that the blocking violated the First Amendment.

424,PR-NY-0010,"A group of Orthodox Jewish synagogues brought this lawsuit against the Governor of New York on October 8, 2020, alleging that the governor's restrictions on gatherings in light of surges in COVID-19 cases violated the Free Exercise Clause. After the district court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, they appealed to the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court granted the injunction in part to block the enforcement of the executive order's attendance caps pending the outcome of the appeal in the Second Circuit. The case is ongoing. ","EO 202.68 burdens Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs by restricting the number of individuals who may gather in houses of worship, at risk of substantial financial penalties. Plaintiffs are sincere practitioners of Judaism who believe that attending religious services at the synagogue, especially on Jewish holidays, is a critical and necessary component of their religious practices and beliefs. EO 202.68’s restrictions make it impossible for Plaintiffs and their congregants and others to conduct services on Jewish holidays observed on October 9, 10, and 11, 2020, thereby infringing upon Plaintiffs’ ability to comply with religious dictates.
Two days before these holidays, Defendant banned thousands of Orthodox Jews from fulfilling a core an essential religious tradition that has been observed for more than 2,000 years. In doing so, Defendant singled out this religious minority for public scorn at a press conference. See Professor Josh Blackman, New York Governor Cuomo: “I’m Going to Say to the Orthodox Community Tomorrow If You Don’t Agree Then We Will Have to Close Down Your Religious Institutions,” The Volokh Conspiracy (Oct. 6, 2020) https://reason.com/2020/10/06/new-yorkgovernor-cuomo-im-going-to-say-to-the-orthodox-community-tomorrow-if-you-dont-agree-thenwe-will-have-to-close-down-your-religious-institutions/.
at *29–30, 35. Two days ago, Defendant instituted new gathering restrictions designed to target religious institutions. During a press conference on October 5, 2020, Defendant singled out “[r]eligious institutions” as “the greatest potential” threat, declaring that “[w]e know religious institutions have been a problem.”
Among other things, Plaintiffs have split the traditional congregational service into several separate gatherings, which accommodates every congregant while still ensuring that congregants maintain proper social distancing Id. Plaintiffs require congregants to wear masks during the entirety of their religious services, and congregants have fully complied with the mask policy. By implementing rigorous health and safety protocols, Plaintiffs have been able to allow their members to continue to practice their religious beliefs while still safeguarding from the spread of COVID-19.
Closure of houses of worship would require Plaintiffs to sacrifice religious practice. Plaintiffs are sincere practitioners of Judaism who wish to worship in synagogue. But the limits proscribed by Defendant’s restrictions makes such worship impossible.
Accordingly, it need only be supported by a rational basis. 13 Both the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit subsequently denied plaintiffs’ requested injunctive relief. Calvary Chapel Dayton Vall v.

In each case, the district court denied the Appellants’ motion for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the order. The Appellants now move for emergency injunctions pending appeal and to expedite their appeals, after an applications Judge on our Court denied their requests for an administrative stay, No. 20-3572, doc.

On March 18, 2019, this case was consolidated for pretrial proceedings with a separate case filed by the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA; a national membership organization of Title X providers that operate or administer more than 3,500 health centers providing family planning services to more than 3.7 million patients each year), a Washington-based NFPRHA member organization, and two health care professionals, challenging the same HHS Rule on behalf of themselves and their patients.

Washington and the NFPRHA parties filed preliminary injunctions on March 22, 2019, seeking to prohibit HHS from implementing the Final Rule. Judge Bastian granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Final Rule nationwide until further order of the court. On May 3, 2019, defendants filed a notice of appeal and motion to stay the preliminary injunction, as well as a notice of interlocutory and preliminary injunction appeal regarding plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction.

On June 20, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a three-judge panel per curiam decision granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit noted that the Final Rule was challenged in federal court in California, Oregon, and Washington (this case), and district courts in each case granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. HHS appealed in each case and sought to stay the injunctions pending a decision of the merits of its appeals. The panel found that HHS was likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and that the remaining factors also favored a stay pending appeal. 

On June 25, 2019, plaintiffs in the Oregon and Washington cases filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc regarding the stay. On July 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that the three cases (California, Oregon, and Washington) be reheard en banc, and that the motions for stay pending appeal granted by the Ninth Circuit panel would not be cited as precedent by or to any court of the Ninth Circuit. 

On July 11, 2019, the Ninth Circuit en banc court denied the motions for administrative stay of the three-judge panel’s order granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The en banc court stated they would proceed expeditiously to rehear and reconsider the merits of Defendant-Appellants’ motions for stay of the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders pending consideration of the appeals on the merits. This case is ongoing.","STATE OF CALIFORNIA V. AZAR Title X grantees challenged the Final Rule in federal court in three states (California, Washington and Oregon), and sought preliminary injunctive relief. The district courts in all three states granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. The Department appealed and sought to stay the injunctions pending a decision of the merits of its appeals.
The panel first noted that the Final Rule was a reasonable interpretation of § 1008.
But a group of state governments and existing Title X grantees (“Plaintiffs”) challenged the Final Rule in federal court in three states (California, Washington, and Oregon), and sought preliminary injunctive relief. The district courts in all three states granted Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. See Washington v. STATE OF CALIFORNIA V. AZAR Azar, 19-cv-3040, 2019 WL 1868632 (E.D Wash Apr.
In March 2019, HHS promulgated the 2019 rule, which was similar to the regulations adopted in 1988 and upheld by Rust. Plaintiffs, including several states and private Title X grantees, brought various suits challenging the 2019 Final Rule. The en banc court first considered plaintiffs’ argument that the 2019 Final Rule was facially invalid because two intervening congressional enactments altered the legal landscape so that Rust’s holdings were no longer valid.
Finally, the court held that the Final Rule’s restrictions on referral lists did not render pregnancy counseling directive because a referral list did not present information in a way that encouraged or promoted a specific option. The en banc court held that the 2019 Final Rule was consistent with § 1554 of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). The court held that the ACA did not address the implementation of Congress’s choice not to subsidize certain activities.
In light of HHS’s reasoned explanation of its decisions and its consideration of the comments raised, the court rejected plaintiffs’ arguments that HHS failed to base its decision on evidence, failed to consider potential harms in its cost-benefit analysis, failed to explain its reasons for departing from the 2000 Rule’s provisions, and failed to consider the reliance interest of providers who have incurred costs relying on HHS’s previous regulation. Second, plaintiffs argued that HHS’s cost-benefit analysis of the 2019 Final Rule was arbitrary and capricious. The court held that HHS reasonably concluded that the harms flowing from a gap in care would not develop, and on this record, the court would not second-guess HHS’s consideration of the risks and benefits of its action.
The en banc court held that plaintiffs would not prevail on the merits of their legal claims, and they were not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the court vacated the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders, and remanded for further proceedings. The government’s motion for a stay pending appeal was denied as moot.
42 U.S.C. § 18114(3). The district courts agreed. See California, 385 F. Supp.
See Winter, 555 U.S. at 22. Accordingly, the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders are vacated and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The government’s motion for a stay pending appeal is denied as moot.
42 U.S.C. § 18114 (“section 1554”). The three district courts separately determined that the Rule violates section 1554 of the ACA. See Oregon, 389 F. Supp.

The plaintiffs sought to enjoin the HHS from implementing the Final Rule, which would require all Title X family planning services to be nondirective. The Final Rule is scheduled to take effect on May 3, 2019. The parties sought to preserve the status quo pending a final determination on the merits. The district courts granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. The panel granted the HHS motion for a stay pending appeal of three preliminary injunction orders issued by district courts in three states, which enjoined from going into effect the 2019 revised regulations to Title X of the Public Health Service Act, pertaining to pre-pregnancy family planning. The case is now closed.","A group of state governments and existing Title X grantees challenged the Final Rule in federal court in three states (California, Washington, and Oregon) and sought preliminary injunctive relief.

426,SD-LA-0013,"In 1964, a group of African American families filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant Jefferson Parish School Board had violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by continuing to segregate the school system. The Court granted injunctive relief, mandated desegregation of the school system, and required that the defendants use busing to speed up the integration process. The injunction remained in place for several decades. In 2007, the School Board sought to implement a magnet school program in the hopes of boosting academics and increasing school diversity. The parties jointly moved to supplement the desegregation plan to include the magnet school program, and the Court issued Consent Orders in 2008-2009 that enabled the School Board's plans. However, issues arose in the following years with the School Board's implementation of the plan. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants were using the Consent Orders as a pretext to conceal attempts to continue a system of racially segregated schools. After the Consent Orders expired, the parties reached a settlement agreement and the Court declared Jefferson Parish Schools unitary in 2011. ","Opinion **19 *1219 Mr. Justice MARSHALL, Circuit Justice. On August 10, 1971, the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, 332 F.Supp. 590, ordered the Jefferson Parish School Board to implement, beginning on August 31, 1971, the plan for desegregation of the public schools of said parish which had been submitted to the court eight days earlier.
There are no unusual circumstances in this case. The schools involved have been mired in litigation for seven years. Whatever progress toward desegregation has been made apparently, and unfortunately, derives only from judicial action initiated by those persons situated as perpetual plaintiffs below.
Parents moved to intervene as third-party plaintiffs. The District Court, Kurt D. Engelhardt, J., held that motions to intervene were untimely. Motions denied.
Because the Court deems oral argument unnecessary, it CANCELS oral argument and rules as set forth herein. BACKGROUND This action was originally commenced on July 31, 1964. In the original Complaint (See Rec Doc.
The plan submitted by the JPSB, however, was not accepted, and Plaintiffs were granted further relief pursuant to Swann. The United States Fifth Circuit, in its opinion entered on February 11, 1972, affirmed the decision of the District Court from which the JPSB had taken an appeal. 456 F.2d 552.
Prior orders or portions of orders of the court presently in effect and not in conflict with the provisions of this Consent Order shall remain in force and effect. This Consent Order shall terminate on June 30, 2011. In the event the school district has not substantially complied with one or more provisions of this Consent Order at the time of its termination, such provisions may be continued by the Court or further remedies may be ordered.
The JPSB must be able to show that any proposal to alter the May 14th Order moves the school system toward unitary status. In this instance, it has not made that showing. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion for Approval of the Advanced Magnet Studies Plan (Rec Doc.
Such dismissal shall be without prejudice only to the extent that plaintiffs may, with the exception of Paragraph B(5) of this Agreement, file a separate action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana seeking to enforce the terms of this Agreement. Background This suit was originally filed on July 30, 1964, to desegregate the public schools of Jefferson Parish and to eliminate the vestiges of the prior dual school system. After various judicial proceedings and decrees, by Consent Order [164] entered May 15, 2008, the court approved numerous unopposed modifications of the previously operative Orders covering all phases of school district operation.
Mediation shall take place in Jefferson Parish; the mediator need not be from that Parish, however. The costs of Mediation shall be Defendants' responsibility. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Parties, Mediation must commence within forty-five (45) calendar days from receipt of Notice.

Decided Aug. Plaintiffs filed separate complaints alleging that university’s admissions policy impermissibly utilized race as a factor in determining admissions. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Patrick J. Duggan, J., 183 F.R.D.
For the following reasons, the motion is denied. In an opinion and order dated March 27, 2001, the court found that the University of Michigan Law School has violated the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by using race as a factor in considering applications for admission. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 137 F.Supp.3d 821 (E.D.Mich.2001).
Argued: Dec. 6, 2001 Decided and Filed: May 14, 2002 Regents of state university and its law school appealed from a decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Bernard A. Friedman, J., 137 F.Supp.2d 821, which determined that the law school’s consideration of race and ethnicity in its admissions decisions violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The Court of Appeals, Boyce F. Martin, Jr., Chief Judge, held that law school’s admissions policy admissions policy was narrowly tailored to serve its compelling interest in achieving a diverse student body, and therefore its policy was valid.
In Grutter v. Bollinger, 188 F.3d 394 (6th Cir.1999), a panel consisting of Judge Daughtrey, myself, and Judge William H. Stafford, a senior district judge from the Northern District of Florida, reversed district court *757 orders denying the motions of prospective intervenors to intervene in the present case and in its companion case, Gratz v Bollinger. The opinion in the intervenors’ case was issued on August 10, 1999. Subsequent to that decision, the defendants requested permission to appeal the district courts’ certification of plaintiff classes in Grutter and Gratz, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f).
There are potentially two judgments in Bakke. One struck down UC Davis’s admissions program. The second purported to overturn an injunction against all use of race, after discussing possible permissible bases for utilizing race in admissions decisions.
[*] 311 *311 JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court. This case requires us to decide whether the use of race as a factor in student admissions by the University of Michigan Law School (Law School) is unlawful. 312 *312 I A 313 The Law School ranks among the Nation's top law schools.
191a-192a. The District Court heard oral argument on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2000. Taking the motions under advisement, the District Court indicated that it would decide as a matter of law whether the Law School's asserted interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a 318 diverse student body was compelling.
The District Court went on to hold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that interest. The District Court granted petitioner's request for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions.
The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal. Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment and vacated the injunction. The Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest.
Id., at 320. Thus, we reversed that part of the lower court's judgment that enjoined the university ""from any consideration of the race of any applicant."" Ibid.

The court found that the law school’s use of race was not narrowly tailored to serve the university’s interest in diversity, either past or present, because the remedying of societal discrimination has not been recognized as a compelling state interest.","On December 3, 1997, the University of Michigan Law School was sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for violating the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by using race as a factor in its admissions decisions. The Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit reversed the district court's ruling in Grutter v.

429,SD-MI-0003,"On Oct. 14, 1997, two applicants who had been denied admission to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor brought this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the university. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest counsel, claimed that the university's admissions policy treated race as a predominant factor in granting admission, and that they, as white applicants, had been discriminated against in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The case went to the Supreme Court, which held that the school's admission policy that automatically awarded 20 points out of a possible 150 to underrepresented minorities was not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest of diversity in education and so violated the Equal Protection Clause.","July 7, 1998. Plaintiffs filed complaint alleging that university’s admissions policy impermissibly utilized race as a factor in determining admissions. Prospective minority applicants for admission to university and non-profit organization dedicated to preserving higher educational opportunities for minority students filed motion to intervene as of right, or in the alternative for permission to intervene.
Plaintiffs claim the articulated interest in the preservation of the use of race as a factor in admissions is insufficient to demonstrate a “substantial legal interest” because the proposed intervenors cannot claim a legally enforceable right in the continued voluntary use of race as a factor in admissions. This lawsuit is predicated upon plaintiffs’ contention that the University’s admission policy is unlawful because it impermissibly utilizes race as a factor in determining admissions. Plaintiffs have not advanced a claim that the policy adversely affects minorities.
Decided Aug. Plaintiffs filed separate complaints alleging that university’s admissions policy impermissibly utilized race as a factor in determining admissions. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Patrick J. Duggan, J., 183 F.R.D.
See id., at 833. Accordingly, the District Court denied petitioners' request for injunctive relief. See id., at 814.
at 836. Because the court ruled that the current admissions policy was constitutional, it denied Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief. The court subsequently certified two questions for interlocutory appeal to the Sixth Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).

The plaintiffs filed a motion to intervene on behalf of 17 prospective minority applicants for admission to university and non-profit organizations dedicated to preserving higher educational opportunities for minority students.

430,VR-DC-1178,"On January 6, 2021, there was a violent insurrection and disruption of Congressional processes as members approved the results of the Electoral College in order to elect the next President and Vice President of the United States. On February 16, 2021, a U.S. Representative, in his personal capacity, sued the President of the United States in his personal capacity, the President’s personal lawyer, Proud Boys International, and Oath Keepers under the Ku Klux Klan Act alleging that the defendants plotted, coordinated, and executed a common plan to prevent Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election. This case has been assigned to Judge Amit P. Mehta and is ongoing. ","RETURN OF SERVICE/AFFIDAVIT of Summons and Complaint Executed.

In doing so, the Defendants each intended to prevent, and ultimately delayed, members of Congress from discharging their duty commanded by the United States Constitution to approve the results of the Electoral College in order to elect the next President and Vice President of the United States. Plaintiff, the Honorable Bennie G. Thompson, Member of the United States House of Representatives, brings this action against the Defendants for conspiring to prevent him and other Members of Congress from discharging these official duties, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(1). Enacted as the “Ku Klux Klan Act” in 1871, Section 1985(1) was intended to protect against conspiracies, through violence and intimidation, that sought to prevent Members of Congress from discharging their official duties.
Both cities have large African American populations. Defendant Giuliani claimed that Philadelphia had “a sad history of voter fraud.” He also named deceased African Americans, whom he falsely claimed were still allowed to vote.
As states finished certifying the official election results, confirming that Defendant Trump had lost the presidential election, Defendants Trump and Giuliani began characterizing the presidential election as stolen. On December 12, 2020, “Stop the Steal” rallies occurred across the country where violence erupted among the demonstrators. Rather than urging the demonstrators to act peacefully, Defendant Trump expressed his unqualified support of those who participated in these rallies and their violent tactics and tweeted, “I’ll be seeing them!”
Nonetheless, on January 1, 2021, Defendant Trump retweeted a tweet from the chair of Women for America First, an organizer of the “Save America” rally, stating, “The cavalry [sic] is coming, Mr. President!” On December 29, 2020, Enrique Tarrio, Chairman of the Proud Boys, posted a message on the social media site Parler about the demonstration planned for January 6, 2021.
At approximately 12:50 PM on January 6, 2021, Defendant Proud Boys, rallied by leader Joseph Biggs, coalesced and marched towards the Capitol while Trump was speaking at the Save America rally.
En route to the Capitol, members of Defendant Proud Boys were engaged in various chants and response calls, including “Fuck Antifa!” and “Whose streets?
Our streets!” At the direction of the Defendant Proud Boys rally organizers, many Proud Boys members abandoned their organization’s colors of black and yellow in order to wear the black attire associated with Antifa. Captured on video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0MA5GjR6Zo, at approximately 12:52 PM, Defendant Proud Boys head Biggs dispatched the leader of the assault on the Capitol entrance.
Another post late in the day declared: “Yeah. We stormed the Capitol today. Teargassed, the whole, 9.
Gloating over their perceived success, Caldwell then sent another message reporting: “Proud boys scuffled with cops and drove them inside to hide. Breached the doors. One guy made it all the way to the house floor, another to Pelosi’s office.
Viewing their success in disrupting the Congress as a model for similar actions in the future, Caldwell sent another message stating: “We need to do this at the local level. Let’s storm the capitol in Ohio. Tell me when!”
Rioters doused law enforcement officers with bear mace, a concentrated pepper spray designed to deter bear attacks, i.e., not intended to be deployed against humans. Capitol Police Officers were dragged and kicked. At least one officer was beaten with the pole attached to an American flag.
We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.”

This case was dismissed with prejudice on July 24, 2013 in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v Holder.","The Justice Department’s decision to invest its resources in a suit without a Section 5 claim vividly underscores the incoherence of Plaintiffs’ allegation that data matching authorized by precleared state law and mandated by federal law is a “change” subject to Section 5 preclearance. In fact, the Northern District of Florida denied the Justice Department’s motion for a temporary restraining order in part because the Secretary has discontinued the MDAVE data matching. See United States v. Florida, No. 4:12cv285, Order Denying A Temporary Restraining Order at 1 (N.D Fla.
The Northern District of Florida has denied the Justice Department’s motion for a temporary restraining order in that case. See DOJ Order.
Moreover, there is no basis, reasonable or otherwise, to believe that the Secretary will reinstate the MDAVE data matching because the Secretary now seeks—and has filed suit to secure—the SAVE data withheld by the Department of Homeland Security. Indeed, the Secretary’s voluntary abandonment of the MDAVE data matching with no reasonable basis to suspect reinstatement was one of the principal reasons that the Northern District of Florida denied the Justice Department’s motion for a temporary restraining order. See DOJ Order at 10–11.
The Southern District of Texas rejected that claim for two reasons. First, the court held that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a “change” in procedure at all.

This new practice has not been submitted for administrative or judicial preclearance pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and despite a lack of preclearance, the change has been implemented in Florida's covered counties subject to Section 5.
The Secretary of State may bring civil actions to enforce the perfonnance of any duties of a county supervisor of elections or any official performing duties with respect to chapters 97 102 and 105 or to enforce compliance with a nule of the Department adopted to interpret or implement any of those chapters.

See Sullivan v. Browning, Civ No. 1:11-cv-10047-KMM.
The decision to continue the process comes about a week after federal officials sent Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner a letter demanding the state end the search for noncitizen voters. The request- made by T. Christian Herren, voting section chief for the Department of Justice- claimed Florida's purge violates federal antidiscrimination and voter registration laws.

This is an action to modify Georgia’s ballot-access requirements for independent and third-party candidates in light of the current public health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus.

Because of recent litigation, the signature requirements for independent presidential candidates and presidential candidates nominated by political bodies that are not qualified under Section 21-2-180 is currently lower than prescribed by Georgia law. In 2016, U.S. District Judge Richard Story ruled that the one-percent signature requirement in O.C.G.A. § 21-2-170(b) is unconstitutional as applied to presidential candidates.
Subject to this objection, Defendant admits that De La Fuente submitted 15,000 signatures; that the Secretary of State verified 2,964 of those signatures; and that De La Fuente employed at least one paid professional petition circulator.

Defendant objects further to Winger’s testimony on this subject as he is not qualified to testify as a political scientist. The State of Maine uses ranked-choice voting in general elections to elect U.S. Senators and U.S Representatives. In 2018, a federal district court upheld the state’s ranked-choice system against a constitutional challenge brought by a losing congressional candidate.
In that action, Mr. Cowen advanced many of the same arguments made here—namely, that Georgia’s petition requirements present a severe burden on candidates’ voting and associational rights in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendment. This Court, however, granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary based upon controlling Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent upholding the constitutionality of Georgia’s petition requirements. (See id.
As discussed further below, that precedent is also controlling here. The Green Party has also sought reduction of Georgia’s petition requirements for presidential candidates in prior litigation. See Green Party, 171 F. Supp.

Finally, in light of the state officials’ work to “ameliorate the impact” of the natural disaster, the court held that the plaintiffs’ claims that the “[State’s] efforts will ‘disenfranchise’ minority voters is disingenuous.” Because Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries under the Fourteenth Amendment and VRA “are not caused by or fairly traceable to the actions of the State, but rather are caused by the global pandemic”, their claims must be dismissed.

Civil Action No. 3:20-cv-1552 (JMC) STATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES CONCERNING SECTION 201 OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT The United States respectfully submits this Statement of Interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517, which authorizes the Attorney General “to attend to the interests of the United States in a suit pending in a court of the United States.” This case presents important questions regarding Section 201 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10501 (“Section 201”). Congress has accorded the Attorney General broad authority to enforce the Voting Rights Act on behalf of the United States.
For these same reasons, Plaintiffs’ Voting Rights Act’s claims are likewise without merit. The Fourth Circuit has concluded that Virginia’s Voter ID statute does not violate the Voting Rights Act. In Lee v Va.
CONCLUSION Accordingly, based upon all of these factors, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. Thus, the preliminary injunction should be denied and the case dismissed. Respectfully submitted, ALAN WILSON Attorney General Federal ID No.10457 ROBERT D.

This case is still in the discovery stage and has been ongoing for four years. ","No. 4:16-cv-1693 (Jury Trial Demanded) CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Introduction 1. The Plaintiffs in this case are all impoverished Missourians who were jailed by the City of Florissant because they were unable to make a monetary payment to the City arising from traffic tickets or other minor municipal offenses. In each instance, the City kept a human being in its jail solely because the person could not afford to pay for their release.

Defendant City of Florissant is a municipal corporation organized under the laws of the State of Missouri. The Defendant operates the Florissant City Jail and the Florissant Municipal Court. Factual Background A.

With no clocks inside of, or visible from, the jail cells and no access to natural light, Mr. Baker sometimes had little sense of what time it was or how long he had been detained in the jail. The City of Florissant did not provide cups to its inmates. The only source of water was a spout connected to the toilet.

In November 2012, the City of Florissant took Mr. Bailey into custody from the St. Louis City Justice Center. He had spent two months in the “Workhouse” (the St. Louis City Medium Security Institution) as a pre-trial detainee because he had been unable to pay a bond issued by St. Louis City until it was reduced to $100, which he borrowed money to pay. The temperature outside was twenty-eight degrees when Florissant took Mr. Bailey into custody.

This arrest stemmed from a failure to appear warrant Ms. Bolden was again assessed two $200 bonds that she could pay to secure her release. The conditions in the jail were substantially the same as during her incarceration in March, 2014. At this time, however, Ms. Bolden was in her third trimester of pregnancy, and her mother had recently died Ms. Bolden received a small sum of money from her mother’s life insurance policy.

The walls were moldy and covered in gum, paint chips, blood, mucus, and feces. The jail did not provide clean mats, and also passed dirty blankets from previous inmates to new inmates without cleaning them. If the inmates wanted water, she and the other women were forced to drink warm water from a mechanism above the toilet, which smelled like a sewer.

iii. The Deplorable Conditions in the Florissant Jail 136. As described above, inmates jailed for non-payment have, as a matter of City policy and practice, been kept in overcrowded cells with inmates strewn about the floors.

It is and has been the policy and practice of the City to issue invalid arrest warrants and to apply arbitrary and illegal policies for the issuance and recalling of warrants. Among the policies and practices of the City of Florissant are the following: a. The City informs people that they can remove outstanding warrants simply by paying a sum of money but does not offer a way for the indigent to remove arrest warrants.15 b.

Pursuant to City policy, thousands of additional arrestees have been and will be charged by the City with new ordinance violations and kept in jail pursuant to the City’s illegal post-arrest money-based detention policies. The City has kept hundreds of people in its jail for non-payment of cash “bond” in each of the past five years. The City retains, and is required by law to retain, records of these instances.

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that caseloads were too large, leaving many children in the foster care system for far too long with unresolved cases. Additionally, the complaint alleged inappropriate placements for children and inadequate efforts to return children home.

Article I, known as the vesting clause, provides: “All legislative Powers... shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.” U.S CONST. I, § 1, cl.1.

It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that Plaintiffs’ Motions for Summary Judgment (ECF Nos. 72, 79) are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and this case is DISMISSED with prejudice. The Court DECLARES that 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901–23, 25 U.S.C. § 1951–52, 25 C.F.R. §§ 23.106–22, 25 C.F.R. §§ 23.124–32, and 25 C.F.R. §§ 23.140–41 are UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
The district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment in part, concluding that ICWA and the Final Rule violated equal protection, the Tenth Amendment, and the nondelegation doctrine, and that the challenged portions of the Final Rule were invalid under the APA.4 Defendants appealed. A panel of this court subsequently stayed the district court’s judgment pending further order of this court. In total, fourteen amicus briefs were filed in this court, including a brief in support of Plaintiffs and affirmance filed by the state of Ohio; and a brief in support of Defendants and reversal filed by the states of California, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, 3 The Navajo Nation had previously moved to intervene twice in the district court.
Level of Scrutiny We begin by determining whether ICWA’s definition of “Indian child” is a race-based or political classification and, consequently, which level of scrutiny applies. The district court concluded that ICWA’s “Indian Child” definition was a race-based classification. We conclude that this was error.
Defendants appealed. A panel of this court reversed and rendered judgment for the Defendants. See Brackeen v. Bernhardt, 937 F.3d 406, 414 (5th Cir.
Case: 18-11479 The anticommandeering doctrine, by contrast, is rooted in the Tenth Amendment, which states that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” U.S Const. amend X. Congress’s legislative powers are limited to those enumerated under the Constitution, and “conspicuously absent from the list of powers given to Congress is the power to issue direct orders to the governments of the States.”
The Navajo Nation again opposes the Brackeens’ petition to adopt Y.R.J. based on ICWA’s placement preferences. The proceedings are ongoing.
The district court denied the motion, finding that at least one Plaintiff had standing to bring each claim. Plaintiffs then moved for summary judgment on all their claims, which the district court granted in part and denied in part. See Brackeen v. Zinke, 338 F. Supp.
When pressed for prior authority allowing Congress’s “plenary” power to interfere with state child-custody proceedings, counsel responded that “this”—i.e. the instant challenge to ICWA—“is the case that presents that [issue].” Rec. of Oral Argument at 10:30–10:55. nothing like ICWA’s intrusion into state child-custody proceedings.
Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint, the one operative here, sought a declaration that specific sections of ICWA are unconstitutional and an injunction prohibiting the Federal Defendants from implementing or administering those sections. It also sought vacatur of the Final Rule. The district court, however, granted only declaratory relief as to specific provisions of ICWA and the Final Rule, and Plaintiffs have not cross-appealed seeking to modify the district court’s judgment.

The parties entered into a consent decree requiring the city to make its services and facilities accessible, pay attorneys' fees and costs, and pay $12,250 to the plaintiffs.","Plaintiffs have encountered various accessibility barriers throughout Steamboat Springs. There are numerous issues related to SST, the city’s public transportation system, as well as several of the city’s other programs and facilities. Both Mr. Richardson and Mr. Steele have encountered buses without lifts or with broken lifts Mr. Richardson must often wait as long as an hour — while three or four buses pass him by — before a properly equipped, accessible bus arrives at his stop.
For example, some of the bus stops have shelters inside of which patrons of the bus system may shield themselves from the winter wind and cold as they wait. Some of these shelters are inaccessible to persons who use wheelchairs. Mr. Richardson’s case of frostbite was at least partially due to the inaccessibility of a shelter.
They have also been injured by the stigma of Defendant’s discrimination, which has been and continues to be a barrier to the full participation of people with disabilities in the Steamboat Springs community. In addition to the accessibility barriers to Steamboat Springs’ public transportation system, there are several other facilities in Steamboat Springs that are inaccessible to individuals with disabilities, particularly persons who use wheelchairs. For example: a.
The parking lot at Spring Creek Reservoir, a city-owned and -operated park that Mr. Steele frequents, is almost exclusively reserved for persons with disabilities. Steamboat Springs, however, removed a wheelchair-accessible portable restroom from this location, leaving only an inaccessible, standard portable restroom.
b. Mr. Steele has attended the Chariot Races held in the winter at Romick Rodeo Arena, part of the City’s Howelsen Hill Complex. These races are inaccessible to persons who use wheelchairs. There is no disabled parking available for this event.
Defendant has violated the Rehabilitation Act by denying Plaintiffs and other persons who use wheelchairs its benefits, including access to its public transportation system, as more fully set forth above.

CITY OF STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Defendant. INTRODUCTION On July 1, 1999, Timothy Richardson and Jonathan Steele (“Individual Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against the City of Steamboat Springs, Colorado (“City”), alleging that the City had discriminated against them on the basis of disability in connection with the provision of transit service and certain other City services, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12149 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehabilitation Act”), 29 U.S.C. § 794. By Order dated April 20, 2000, the United States intervened in Individual Plaintiffs’ action against the City to the extent that it alleged violations of transportation provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.
At the time the City operator requests dispatch of such alternate transportation, the operator shall inform the disabled individual of the expected time of arrival of the accessible vehicle, and when the dispatcher is on duty, the dispatcher shall record the times of the request and the dispatch of alternate transportation. The City shall continue to provide comprehensive training for all bus and van operators, dispatchers, and mechanics. The City shall also provide said training upon hiring of any new operator or mechanic, whether or not said employee previously worked for the City.
The City denies and continues to deny any and all liability to Individual Plaintiffs for any such claims. As part of this Consent Decree, the City agrees to the following: 1. The three, accessible parking spaces on the east side of the rodeo grounds at Howelsen Hill complex shall continue to exist as designated, accessible spaces for the term of this Consent Decree.

443,DR-CO-0011,"Plaintiffs were disabled individuals who sued the Colorado Rockies baseball club after it removed accessible seats in Coors Field and raised prices on others. There was a trial held, after which the court dismissed all claims by stipulation. It is unclear, however, whether the parties settled.","Defendant Colorado Rockies Baseball Club, Ltd. is a Colorado limited partnership with its principal place of business in Denver, Colorado. Defendant owns the Colorado Rockies major league baseball team and leases and operates Coors Field, the stadium in which the team plays. FACTS 12.
Defendant leases and/or operates Coors Field. Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs on the basis of disability. Defendant’s discriminatory conduct includes but is not limited to: a. Discriminatory exclusion from and/or denial of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, accommodations, and/or opportunities; b.
That this Court assume jurisdiction; 2. That this Court issue an order declaring the Defendant to be in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act; 3. That this Court issue an injunction ordering the Defendant to bring Coors Field into compliance with, and to operate Coors Field in compliance with, the Americans with Disabilities Act; 4.
In light of this and their relative distance from, and height above, the field, the wheelchair-accessible seats behind the back row of the Lower Level Box seats do not provide views or lines of sight comparable to those from the ambulatory seats in the front row or close to the infield. Coors Field has 406 wheelchair-accessible seats. Of these, only 12% are located at the front of their respective seating areas.
Receiving baseballs from field attendants or players. The Individual Plaintiffs are all baseball fans who enjoy attending games at Coors Field. CCDC members, including Individual Plaintiffs, have been to Coors Field in the past, have sat prior to 2001 in the wheelchair-accessible seating behind home plate (the “Backstop Accessible Seats”), and would like to return to Coors Field and sit in seats adjacent to the infield for the same price as non-disabled patrons pay to sit near the infield in the Infield Box Seats.
III. The Lower Level Box Seating Areas At Coors Field Are In Violation of the ADA. Congress, in discussing the ADA’s “fundamental principle” of integration for people with disabilities, stated that: [h]istorically, persons with disabilities have been relegated to separate and often inferior services.
Defendant argues that the Bleacher/Balcony Exception excuses the current configuration at Coors Field, in which all wheelchair-accessible seats in the Lower Level Box seating areas are located behind the back row of ambulatory seating. This is not the case. As an initial matter, the Bleacher/Balcony Exception does not apply to the Lower Level Box seating areas at Coors Field.
The Court, having considered the arguments of counsel, the parties' written submissions and accompanying materials, the applicable law, the pleadings of record, and being fully advised, FINDS that the defendant's motion for partial summary judgment should be DENIED, for the reasons stated below. Background In these two consolidated cases, the plaintiffs assert that defendant has violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA"") in certain respects, particularly including the failure to provide appropriate seating to those required to use wheelchairs when attending a baseball game in the facility used by the Colorado Rockies. The defendant, not surprisingly, disagrees with plaintiffs' contentions.
There are 383 front row ambulatory seats in the Lower Level Box seating area; 1,996 ambulatory seats within the first five rows of those areas, all $38 or less. In 2001, a wheelchair using fan who wanted to sit at Coors Field had to pay approximately three times as much as most non-disabled patrons to sit near the infield. Wheelchair accessible seats behind the back rows of Sections 114-126 and 135-147 of the Lower Level Box seating areas are under the overhang created by the Club Level seating area; wheelchair accessible seats behind Sections 127-134 are under the somewhat less severe overhang of the press box.
Wheelchair accessible seats behind the back row of the Lower Level Box do not provide views or lines of sight comparable to ambulatory seats in the front row or close to the infield. Plaintiffs argue that Coors Field has 406 wheelchair accessible seats. Of these, only 12% are located at the front of their respective seating areas; the remaining 88% are located in the back of their respective seating areas.
This Court agrees with the analysis employed by the Berry v. City of Lowell court. City of Lowell court. The Rockies may not ""ghettoize"" wheelchair spaces or designate a few token wheelchair spaces in the luxury seating areas as has been done.

FACT SHEET Rhode Island Supported Employment and Integrated Day Services Consent Decree Background The consent decree resolves the Civil Rights Division’s Jan. 6, 2014, findings that the State of Rhode Island violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead v. L.C. by failing to serve individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) in the most integrated day activity service setting appropriate for their needs, and by placing transition-age youth at serious risk of segregation.
People with I/DD in sheltered workshops typically earn wages that are well below minimum wage.  Facility-based day programs are programs in which people with disabilities participate in segregated non-work activities during the day. These services are often provided by the same service providers and in the same buildings as sheltered workshops.
 Compliance with the consent decree will be overseen by a monitor jointly selected by the parties. U.S. District Court District of Rhode Island (Providence) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE 1:14−cv−00175−JJM−PAS CLOSED

Plaintiff asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit the consideration of race in college admissions, claiming that UNC's current admissions policy discriminated against Asian American applicants. The court denied summary judgement and, as of April 9th, 2020, the suit is ongoing.","INTRODUCTION 1. This is an action brought under the Fourteenth Amendment and federal civil rights laws to prohibit UNC-Chapel Hill from engaging in intentional discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity. “Classifications of citizens solely on the basis of race are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.

UNC-Chapel Hill can achieve student body diversity without using racial preferences by eliminating legacy admissions preferences in conjunction with other race-neutral measures.

The plaintiffs alleged that Wal-Mart discriminated against African-Americans in hiring of over-the-road truck drivers.  On May 16, 2007, the court certified a class of African Americans who had not been hired or had been deterred from applying for these jobs.  Discovery continued in preparation for trial and on January 13, 2009 the court denied the defendant's motions for decertification and summary judgment.    The parties thereafter reached a settlement that was approved by the court on March 5, 2009.

It was rumored in Searcy that the charging party was Armstrong. In fact, the charging party was Daryal Nelson of Mississippi. Wal-Mart reacted to the charge by hastily employing one African-American female driver and two African-American male drivers.

See EEOC Opinion, Exhibit 3 at 1. On May 11, 1998, the EEOC vacated the Department of Treasury’s final agency decision and certified the class again.

The EEOC alleged that Yellow Transportation (later merged into YRC) had violated §703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) by subjecting black employees to greater scrutiny, more frequent and greater discipline, lower paying and less favorable job assignments, more difficult and time-consuming work, and a hostile work environment. The EEOC sought injunctive and monetary relief, including economic and noneconomic harm to the employees, punitive damages, development of policies and programs to provide equal employment opportunity and eradicate the effects of its past discrimination. The EEOC also sought to recover its costs. The charging parties later intervened as plaintiffs on their own behalf, adding claims for retaliation.

457,EE-KS-0025,"Plaintiffs sued Sprint, alleging ADEA violations pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 621, the ADA, and 42 U.S.C. §12203. Class comprised just under 1,700 members. Eventually, parties reached $57 million settlement agreement.","The stated purpose of the reduction in force was to eliminate job functions and reduce costs. Plaintiff alleges that Sprint engaged in a pattern and practice of age discrimination in connection with its RIF by treating younger employees more favorably than older employees in implementing the RIF. Specifically, plaintiff contends that Sprint, before and during the RIF process, routinely transferred younger employees (i.e., employees under the age of 40) to “safe” positions–positions that would not be eliminated during the RIF; that Sprint identified younger employees as “key talent” and took extraordinary measures to exempt those employees from the RIF; that Sprint transferred older employees (i.e., employees over the age of 40) to positions or departments which Sprint intended to phase out or eliminate during the RIF process; and that Sprint filled “open” positions with younger employees just prior to the RIF and then terminated older employees in the same or similar positions during the RIF.
Pat Paden and Darin Collins, who had been promoted to the same position and same pay grade that plaintiff held just two weeks earlier, were not terminated on March 13, 2002. Defendant discriminated against plaintiff on the basis of her age with respect to the terms and conditions of her employment, by denying her promotional opportunities, and by terminating her employment on March 13, 2002. Upon plaintiff’s termination, her position was filled by and/or her former job duties were assumed by one or more younger employees.
Plaintiff’s age was a motivating and/or determining factor in the decision to terminate her employment. Defendant’s stated reasons for plaintiff’s termination were a pretext for discrimination on the basis of her age. Based upon defendant’s discrimination against her, plaintiff filed a timely charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on or about May 21, 2002.
Plaintiff Williams hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation and averment in her General Allegations as though fully set forth herein. Defendant Sprint discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of her age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 623. Defendant Sprint, by and through its officers, employees and agents, engaged in a continuing pattern and practice of discrimination against or disparate treatment of Plaintiff based upon Plaintiff’s age, denying Plaintiff opportunities for promotions and ultimately terminating Plaintiff.
Plaintiffs have not shown that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in this regard. In Minshall, the plaintiff, a former on-air investigative reporter for the defendant’s television news program, was terminated and he sued the defendant for age discrimination. 323 F.3d at 1277-78.
Plaintiff and Opt-Ins hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation and averment above as though fully set forth in Count I herein. Defendants discriminated against plaintiffs and opt-ins on the basis of age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 623. Defendant, by and through its officers, employees and agents, engaged in a continuing pattern and practice of discrimination against and/or disparate treatment of plaintiffs and opt-ins based upon age, in defendant’s denials of plaintiffs’/opt-ins’ opportunities for promotions, in defendant’s terminations of plaintiffs/opt-ins, and in defendant’s denial of plaintiffs’/opt-ins’ equal opportunities for rehire post-RIF.
The case was assigned to Judge Vratil. Defendant moved for summary judgment, asserting that Mr. Shikles’ “failure to cooperate in the EEOC’s investigation of his charge constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies that deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction.” at 1307.
at 1317. The Circuit, however, vacated the grant of summary judgment and directed the district court to dismiss Mr. Shikles’ claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

The Commission alleges that Ms. Gaston, a black female, applied for employment to Defendant AdvanceMed Corporation (“Defendant”) as a Chief Nurse and though qualified for the position, was rejected because of her race.

","FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. FOCUS's Religious Beliefs. FOCUS's mission is, with the blessing and approval of Archbishop Samuel Aquila of Denver and with the blessings and approval of the local Bishop in each diocese in which a specific college is located, to equip and enable qualified POCUS-trained missionaries to serve as the hands and feet of the Catholic Church and its auxiliaries by meeting college students where they live, i.e., dorms, intramural sports, student unions, Greek life, etc., by making a personal, sacrificial investment in the lives of those students, and by stressing 'incamational evangelization' and God's love to each student.
They also object to losing their health insurance coverage provided by FOCUS, and to be forced in such a circumstarice to buy themselves and their families a health insurance plan from another source that (because of the Mandate challenged here) will require them to buy coverage of abortifacients, contraception, sterilization, and education and counseling in favor of the same. FOCUS's Health Insurance Plan•. FOCUS currently has about 450 full-time employees and provides health insurance through a self-insured plan administered by a third party administrator.
FOCUS, and the individual plaintiffs, cannot participate in or facilitate Defendants' scheme in this manner without violating their religious convictions. The Mandate and FOCUS's Health Insurance Plan. The plan year for FOCUS's next employee health plan begins on July 1,2014.
They also object to losing their health insurance coverage provided by FOCUS, and to be forced in such a circumstance to buy themselves and their families a health insurance plan from another source that (because of the Mandate challenged here) will require them to buy coverage of abortifacients, contraception, sterilization, and education and counseling in favor of the same. B. FOCUS’s Health Insurance Plan.
FOCUS, and the individual plaintiffs, cannot participate in or facilitate Defendants’ scheme in this manner without violating their religious convictions. The Mandate and FOCUS’s Health Insurance Plan. The plan year for FOCUS’s next employee health plan begins on July 1, 2014.
2 Plaintiffs believe that it is sinful and imm oral to provide or facilitate coverage of contraceptives and abortifacien ts in their he alth care plan. The so-called “accommodation” requires that the objectionable contraceptives a nd abortifacients be made available to those covered under FOCUS’s em ployee health insurance plan. FOCUS is required to serve as a conduit for or facilitato r of such coverage.
F OCUS need only f ulfill the self certification requirement and provide the complete d self-certification to its TPA. It need not provide payments for contraceptive services to its employees. Instead, a third party—FOCUS’s TPA—provides payments for contraceptive services, at no cost to FOCUS.

Plaintiffs’ original Verified Complaint and First Amended Verified Complaint (“VC”) are sworn affidavits and thus serve as evidence in support of Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. Defendants’ Mandate requires coverage of contraceptives /abortifacients and re lated services in employee health plans maintained by religious non-profit organizations, like FOCUS, for plans that commence on or after January 1, 2014. See 78 Fed Reg. 39,870 (July 2, 2013).
VC, 127-132. C. Defendants force FOCUS to provide or cont ract for contraceptive/abortifacient coverage in its health plan. To coerce non-profit, non-church, ERISA-governed plans such as FOCUS’s plan to cover objectionable drugs, devices, and services, Defenda nts created what Defe ndants euphemistically call an “accommodation” (not an exem ption, and not a withholding of penalties).

It is licensed to do business in 50 states and employs a total of 187 employees. Plaintiffs provide self-funded health insurance through Midwest Fastener Corp., to employees and their dependents. Approximately 91 employees (and their dependents) of Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp., Inc. are currently covered by this group health insurance plan.
Between 2011 and 2013, the DeVries Plaintiffs have annually and in compliance with their religious faith made efforts to ensure that Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp conducted annual reviews of its insurance coverage plans to exclude the coverage of any Abortifacients under their employee health policies. They have further instructed the agents and employees of their insurer that they object to the inclusion coverage of Abortifacients in any policy of coverage covered by Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp. 10. In April of 2013, the DeVries Plaintiffs discovered that the health insurance plan offered by Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp. to its employees and their dependents (approximately 187 employees) covered “FDA-approved contraceptives.”
Because there was not time in late April 2013 to seek judicial relief, and without any viable option, the DeVries Plaintiffs, and Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp, were forced, at least temporarily, to comply with the HHS Mandate or face the threat of heavy fines and penalties. The Plaintiff’s are currently exploring ways of eliminating such objectionable abortion-inducing drugs from their employee health insurance plan. The HHS Mandate also forces the Plaintiffs to fund government-dictated speech, to wit: education and counseling about abortion-inducing drugs, that is directly at odds with the deeply held religious beliefs that they strive to embody in the management and operation of Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp. 16.
The insurer thereupon informed the DeVries Plaintiffs that, without injunctive relief from this Court, the insurer was required to comply with the HHS Mandate and to include such abortion-inducing drugs in Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp.’s group health insurance plan. Plaintiff Midwest Fasteners Corp. further provides its employees with option health savings accounts (“HSA”), which allow employees to pay pre-tax income for services not covered under Plaintiff Midwest Fasteners Corp.’s health insurance. Because the DeVries Plaintiffs were unaware of the coverage there was not time in late December 2012 to seek judicial relief relating to the plan beginning on and after January 1, 2013, without any viable option, the DeVries Plaintiffs, and Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp. are forced to comply with the HHS Mandate or face the threat of heavy fines and penalties.
Plaintiffs reallege all matters set forth above and incorporate them herein by reference. Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them from providing coverage for abortion-inducing drugs and related education and counseling in Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp. employee health insurance plan. When Plaintiffs comply with their sincerely held religious biblical beliefs on abortion-inducing drugs and related education and counseling, they exercise religion within the meaning of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 105.
Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit them from providing coverage for abortion-inducing drugs and related education and counseling in Plaintiff Midwest Fastener Corp. employee health insurance plan. When Plaintiffs comply with their sincerely held religious beliefs on abortioninducing drugs and related education and counseling, they exercise religion within the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause.
The delays or allowances made by Defendants appear to purposely exclude Plaintiffs and others who seek exclusion based upon religious beliefs and provide further evidence of the Defendants animus towards religious groups. The Defendants actions amount to selective enforcement of the Affordable Care Act. 147. The delay further provides evidence that granting of injunctive relief to the Plaintiff’s is necessary to restore the balance of equities and prevent Defendants from utilizing portions of the Affordable Care Act to impose or forward their own religious beliefs on the Plaintiffs and others while excusing enforcement on parties for political or other reasons.

EO 13950 PROHIBITS AND CENSORS PROTECTED SPEECH.
EO 13950 also threatens the prospect of enforcement against those who express viewpoints that the Trump Administration disfavors. Specifically, the Order directs the Attorney General to assess the extent to which “workplace training that teaches the divisive concepts” may contribute to a hostile work environment and give rise to liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. EO 13950 further permits contractors who become involved in, or are threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of compliance with EO 13950 to request that the United States enter the litigation to protect the interest of the United States.
EO 13950 DIRECTLY HARMS PLAINTIFFS NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE, NATIONAL FAIR HOUSING ALLIANCE, AND CLASS MEMBERS 128.

NUL has also received many grant awards from various federal government agencies and expects to continue to apply for and receive federal grants in the future. Several of NUL’s government grants are currently effective. NUL received a grant from DOL and ETA for $4,626,557 for the period of July 1, 2020 through November 1, 2020.
NFHA has also held conversations, discussions, education and outreach events, and trainings with non-profit groups and housing and lending stakeholders, including fair housing organizations, academicians, think tanks, non-profit organizations, financial services institutions, governmental entities, real estate sales groups, and housing industry trade associations on issues of systemic racism, structural inequities, sexism, unconscious bias, and intersectionality. Many of these groups include NFHA's members. These conversations, discussions, education and outreach events, and trainings increased precipitously in the aftermath of the COVID-19 health pandemic and the murder of George Floyd.
This report is used by a wide group of stakeholders, including its members and employees. The Order purports to prohibit private entities from speaking about structural inequalities in America and implicit biases with their employees or member organizations by deeming such subjects “divisive concepts.” Based on its past and future speech, NFHA could face debarment or the loss of future opportunities to compete for federal grants and contracts should it continue to discuss issues of race and inclusion with its members and its employees consistent with its mission and purpose.

On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court held that the clearest case on point, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. 431 U.

In the United States Court of Appeals For the Seventh Circuit No. 10-3835 PAMELA J. HARRIS, et al., v. Plaintiffs-Appellants, GOVERNOR PAT QUINN, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Illinois, et al., Defendants-Appellees. Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. No. 10 CV 02477—Sharon Johnson-Coleman, Judge.
The plaintiffs in this appeal provide in-home care for people with varying levels of disabilities and other health needs. They present a narrow question: Does a collective bargaining agreement that requires Medicaid home-care personal assistants to pay a fee to a union representative violate No. 10-3835 the First Amendment, regardless of the amount of those fees or how the union uses them? We hold that it does not.
The Disabilities Program plaintiffs argued that although they did not yet pay fees, they are harmed by the mere threat of an agreement requiring fair share fees. The district court dismissed the Rehabilitation Program plaintiffs’ claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. It dismissed the Disabilities Program plaintiffs’ claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because they lacked standing and their claims were not ripe.
The plaintiffs appeal both dismissals.
The district court did err in one respect however. After holding that the Disabilities Program plaintiffs’ claims were not yet ripe, it dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Generally, when a complaint is dismissed because it is not ripe (or because the plaintiffs lack standing, for that matter) it is dismissed without prejudice unless it appears beyond a doubt that there is no way the plaintiffs’ grievance could ever mature into justiciable claims.
Given our holding above, it may be that such a claim will not last long, but we will not prejudge the issue in this case. Therefore, we will remand the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the claims of the Disabilities Program plaintiffs without prejudice. III.
See App. The union and the State subsequently entered into collective-bargaining agreements that require all personal assistants who are not union members to pay a “fair share” of the union dues. Id., at 24–25.
Abood held that a government entity may, consistently with the First Amendment, require public employees to pay a fair share of the cost that a union incurs negotiating on their behalf for better terms of employment. That is exactly what Illinois did in entering into collective bargaining agreements with the Service Employees International Union Healthcare (SEIU) which included fair-share provisions. Contrary to the Court’s decision, those agreements fall squarely within Abood’s holding.

The district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice and noted that the plaintiffs failed to articulate any impermissible way in which the statutory scheme impinged upon their First Amendment rights. The Seventh Circuit affirmed in relevant part, concluding that the case was controlled by the Court’s decision in Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ. 431 U.S. 209 (1977), which held that a government entity may, consistently with the First Amendment, require public employees to pay a fair share of the cost that a union incurs negotiating on their behalf for better terms of employment.

468,FH-DC-0018,"On May 8, 2018, several Texas organizations filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. They alleged that HUD suspended a provision of the Fair Housing Act that would require cities to report incidents of housing discrimination and that that this suspension violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The defendants' motion to dismiss was granted, and the plaintiffs filed to reopen the case and amend their complaint. This motion was denied on August 26, 2019. ","In January 2018, HUD abruptly announced that it was suspending for years the requirement that jurisdictions prepare AFHs and submit them for HUD review, effectively suspending the Rule itself. Plaintiffs National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), Texas Low Income Housing Information Service (Texas Housers), and Texas Appleseed bring this suit to challenge HUD’s suspension of the AFFH Rule’s requirements as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 500, et seq. 4. Before it promulgated the AFFH Rule, HUD engaged in little enforcement of this important provision of the Fair Housing Act, permitting its grantees to virtually ignore it.
In January 2018, HUD issued a notice suspending for almost three years the requirement that jurisdictions prepare AFHs and submit them for HUD review, effectively suspending the Rule itself. Plaintiffs sued.

Less than two weeks later, in May 2018, HUD withdrew that notice, but the agency simultaneously replaced it with another notice that accomplishes the same result by withdrawing the Assessment Tool, thus making it impossible for jurisdictions to prepare and submit AFHs. Plaintiffs National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), Texas Low Income Housing Information Service (Texas Housers), and Texas Appleseed bring this suit to challenge HUD’s suspension of the Tool, which in effect suspends the AFFH Rule, as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The effect of HUD’s action is that jurisdictions return to the dysfunctional process that was in effect from 1995 to 2015, pursuant to which HUD required only an annual certification that a jurisdiction had studied fair housing impediments, taken “appropriate actions” to address them, and maintained related records.

Primarily, Plaintiffs allege that the City's actions discriminate against them based on their handicapped status where these two zoning provisions limit the ability of Plaintiffs to reside in residential areas of the City.
For others the deprivation may have been shortterm, but repeated itself with frequency when he or she would relapse and again find themselves without their family, their home, their job, or ability to care for his or herself.

These criteria subvert the law against hiring illegal immigrants and 4 effectively turn a blind eye to factors which any reasonable employer would know 5 indicate job applicants are unauthorized for employment in the U.S.: 1) hiring workers who cannot speak English while claiming to be U.S.
2622, 86 L.Ed.2d 215 (1985), the District Court dismissed an action by investors for violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, on the ground that, because the investors themselves had violated the same laws under which recovery was sought by trading on inside information, they were in pari delicto and thus were barred from recovery. The Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court. The Supreme Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit, holding in pertinent part: Nothing in Perma Life suggested that public policy considerations should govern only where Congress expressly provides for private remedies; the classic formulation of the in pari delicto doctrine itself required a careful consideration of such implications before allowing the defense... Moreover, we repeatedly have emphasized that implied private actions provide ‘a most effective weapon in the enforcement’ of the securities laws and are ‘a necessary supplement to Commission action.’...
Plaintiff also cites the “Order re Affirmative Defenses” filed on February 23, 2004 in Mendoza v. Zirkle Fruit Company, No. CY-00-3024-FVS, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington: COMMON LAW DEFENSES The defendants allege the plaintiffs knew about the presence of illegal workers at both Zirkle Fruit Company and Matson Fruit Company. The defendants claim the plaintiffs had a duty to report immigration violations to their employers or to an appropriate government agency. To the extent the plaintiffs failed to do so, say the defendants, they are barred from recovery by the doctrines of contributory fault, contributory negligence, waiver, consent, acquiescence, ratification, estoppel, in pari delicto, unclean hands, equal involvement, payment, failure to mitigate, and/or assumption of the risk.
Plaintiff asserts the FAC alleges that Defendants violated civil RICO continuously, starting in 2002. This action was commenced on October 5, 2006. However, as Defendants note, the FAC does not specifically allege that the Illegal Hiring Scheme commenced in 2002.

477,IM-CA-0146,"On July 16, 2019, the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, Al Otro Lado, Innovation Law Lab, and the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles brought this suit against the U.S. Attorney General and  Secretary of Homeland Security. Plaintiffs challenged the federal immigration rule restricting eligibility for asylum for noncitizens who transited through another country prior to reaching the southern U.S. border. Plaintiffs claimed the rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Plaintiffs successfully sought a preliminary nationwide injunction.  However, defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit and the nationwide scope of the injunction was stayed. Then the District Court restored the nationwide scope of the injunction on September 9, 2019, but the government again appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay pending disposition of the appeal in the 9th Circuit.

12 Harms to Plaintiffs 109. Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that provide assistance to asylum seekers, including those who came to the United States after transiting through another country. The new Rule will cause each Plaintiff significant harm.

Plaintiff East Bay Sanctuary Covenant provides legal and social services to 18 immigrants and refugees within the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Asylum Office, including 19 applicants in California, Washington, and Oregon. It offers clients legal assistance in affirmative 20 asylum applications; provides social services; and helps train professionals to assist immigrant and 21 refugee communities.
The Court discusses the 9 United States District Court Northern District of California 1 proffered reasons for both the Rule and the waiver of § 553 requirements as relevant below. Procedural History Plaintiffs East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, Al Otro Lado, Innovation Law Lab, and Central 4 American Resource Center (the “Organizations”) filed this lawsuit on July 16, 2019, the day the 5 Rule went into effect. Complaint (“Compl.
Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump (“East 9 Bay III”), 354 F. Supp. Defendants appealed that order to the Ninth Circuit and moved for a stay pending appeal. 11 The Ninth Circuit denied the motion for stay pending appeal, but only “insofar as the injunction 12 applies within the Ninth Circuit.”
East Bay V, 2019 WL 3850928, at *2. This 19 is such a case. Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth above, the Court grants the 20 Organizations’ motion to restore the nationwide scope of the injunction.
No. 19A230 Opinion The application for stay presented to Justice KAGAN and by her referred to the Court is granted. The district court’s July 24, 2019 order granting a preliminary injunction and September 9, 2019 order restoring the nationwide scope of the injunction are stayed in full pending disposition of the Government’s appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and disposition of the Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is sought. If a writ of certiorari is sought and the Court denies the petition, this order shall terminate automatically.
The Final 24 Rule will cause each Plaintiff significant harm. Plaintiff East Bay Sanctuary Covenant provides legal and social services to 26 immigrants and refugees within the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Asylum Office, including 27 applicants in California, Washington, and Oregon. It offers clients legal assistance in affirmative 28 asylum applications; provides social services; and helps train professionals to assist immigrant and 1 refugee communities.
The Supreme Court’s stay remains in effect “pending disposition of the Government’s 24 appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and disposition of the 25 Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ is sought.” The Interim Rule was also challenged in an action filed in the District Court for the District 27 of Columbia. On June 30, 2020, that court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and 28 vacated the Interim Rule, finding that it was invalid under the Administrative Procedures Act 2 United States District Court Northern District of California 1 (“APA”) for failing to adhere to notice and comment procedures.
Next, the panel agreed with the district court that plaintiffs established a sufficient likelihood of irreparable harm through diversion of resources and the non-speculative loss of substantial funding from other sources. The panel also held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the balance of equities and the public interest. As to the scope of the injunction, the panel noted that the motions panel had stayed the injunction insofar as it operated outside the Ninth Circuit.
We describe the Rule in detail below. Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that represent asylum seekers. They brought suit in district court seeking an injunction against enforcement of the Rule, contending that the Rule is invalid on three grounds: first, the Rule is not “consistent with” Section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158; second, the Rule is arbitrary and capricious; third, the Rule was adopted without notice and comment.
The district court found that plaintiffs had a likelihood of success on all three grounds and entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Rule, with effect in the four states on our border with Mexico. We hold that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the first and second grounds.
Third, under § 706(2)(D), the Rule was adopted “without observance of procedure required by law” because it was adopted without notice and comment. The district court agreed with plaintiffs on all three grounds. We affirm on the first two.
I would restrict the injunction along the lines suggested by the government, so that it prohibits the application of the EAST BAY SANCTUARY COVENANT V.

The new Rule serves to bar a similar group of people in a categorical fashion— 5 noncitizens who transit through another country prior to reaching the southern border. Indeed, the new Rule is more draconian than its 2018 counterpart because it forecloses the protection of asylum to those who seek asylum even at a port of entry.

478,IM-CA-0149,"On August 16, 2019, several health care providers and nonprofit organizations serving immigrant communities filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs challenged the Department of Homeland Security's Final Public Charge Rule (the Rule), which added non-cash benefits to the factors considered in determining whether a person applying for legal permanent residence is likely to become a public charge. The plaintiffs alleged that the Government violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding its statutory authority, claimed that the Rule was ""arbitrary and capricious,"" and asserted that the Rule violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In October 2019, a district court judge denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining the government from implementing the Rule, but issued an order for preliminary injunction in a related case that would enjoin the implementation of the rule in California, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Maine, and Pennsylvania. This preliminary injunction was stayed by the Ninth Circuit in December 2019. It was affirmed a year later in December 2020, but the order was stayed pending petitions to the Supreme Court in the Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits. The Rule was abandoned by DHS on March 9, 2021.

In December 2014, the D.C. District (Judge Beryl A. Howell) dismissed the case, holding that Sheriff Arpaio lacked standing. The D.C.

Plaintiff respectfully asks the Court to enter Declaratory Judgment that the executive branch granting authorization to work in the United States as part of DACA and Executive Order Amnesty are unconstitutional as failing the rational basis test for the exercise of delegated authority in administrative law.

4, 2009)), ECF No. 13-10. 6 This is the DACA program challenged by the plaintiff. See Pl.’s Mot., Ex.
Procedural Background On November 20, 2014, in a televised address, President Barack Obama announced the principal features of the most recent deferred action programs, namely, the 2014 DACA Revisions and DAPA. On the same day, the plaintiff filed this action seeking invalidation of these two programs as well as DACA, which had been announced over two years earlier. Although the plaintiff’s Complaint references a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff did not formally or separately move for a preliminary injunction, as required by the Local Civil Rules of this Court, until December 4, 2014.
See Local Civ R. 65.1. In opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction, the defendants argued that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring this suit and requested dismissal of the suit. See Defs.’ Mem.
National Academy of Sciences, 974 F.2d 192, 196 (D.C Cir. Absent subject matter jurisdiction over a case, the court must dismiss it. Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006); FED R. CIV P. 12(h)(3).

But, recognizing that Sheriff Arpaio’s claims reflect the widespread perception that the administration’s prosecutorial discretion meme is constitutionally problematic, I write separately to emphasize the narrowness of today’s ruling, and note the consequences of our modern obsession with a myopic and constrained notion of standing. Sheriff Joseph Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, filed suit to prevent the President from implementing programs deferring the removal of certain undocumented immigrants from the United States. These programs, referred to as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), generally delay removal proceedings for undocumented immigrants who pass a background check and satisfy specified eligibility criteria.
Indeed, at first blush, Sheriff Arpaio’s allegations appear somewhat similar to those the Supreme Court found sufficient to secure standing in Massachusetts v EPA. That case revolved around EPA’s decision not to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in new vehicles. Then, as now, standing consisted of a tripartite test.
See, e.g., Hemmer, supra, at 768–69; see also Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1985) (noting the “general unsuitability for judicial review of agency decisions to refuse enforcement”). Consider this case. The Sheriff’s claims on the merits may well raise a constitutionally cogent point.

The clients, asylum seekers, have both engaged in a hunger strike for about 140 days.

They contained evidence from a leading medical expert in detainee health attesting that they are medically vulnerable, and documents showing they pose no risk to public safety and no flight risk, having sponsors willing to host them upon release. ICE denied their parole requests. After the outbreak, SIFI renewed these requests, citing to the COVID-19 pandemic as a changed circumstance, and adding new supporting evidence.

482,IM-IL-0021,"In May 2018, the Council on American-Islamic Relations - Chicago (CAIR-Chicago) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiff sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services for failing to process its FOIA request for immigration records since the 2008 institution of the Controlled Application Review & Resolution Program, alleging that this conduct was a wrongful delay of release of records in violation of FOIA. The plaintiffs dismissed their claims without explanation on June 28, 2019.","Under the CARRP program, Muslim applicants for numerous immigration benefits, including those seeking to naturalize as American citizens, have had their applications delayed and ultimately denied without legal authority, and without even being informed of the existence of the program. In order to obtain information about the extent of the CARRP’s program impact on Muslim applicants for immigration benefits, on August 1, 2017, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to Defendants seeking the release of agency records concerning demographic information and processing times for individuals applying for naturalization, change of status, and asylum since April 11, 2008, when USCIS instituted CARRP. On September 6, 2017, Plaintiff revised the timeframe for which it is seeking the associated records.
This Court has both subject-matter jurisdiction over this FOIA claim and personal jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 552 (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6)(E)(iii); 28 U.S.C. § 1331; and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-06. Venue in the Northern District of Illinois is proper under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). STATEMENT OF FACTS 12.
Since 2008, USCIS has used CARRP—an internal policy that has neither been approved by Congress nor subjected to public notice and comment—to investigate and adjudicate applications deemed to present potential “national security concerns.” Regional offices of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (“CAIR”) and their litigation partners have previously filed lawsuits against USCIS to challenge inordinate, unreasonable delays due to CARRP.
See Group Exhibit B. On August 1, 2017, Plaintiff submitted an electronic FOIA request to the USCIS National Records Center FOIA/PA Office seeking: “information on all individuals who have applied for naturalization, change of status, and asylum through forms N-400, I-589, and I-485 since April 11, 2008,” specifically “the associated immigration benefit and form submitted by each applicant, the processing time for each application, the processing status for each application, the region and country of origin or asserted citizenship of each applicant, the number of times each applicant was interviewed by USCIS agents, and the number, if any, of subsidiary applicants and the status of their citizenship applications – including those who have had citizenship granted.”
See Group Exhibit C. The Plaintiff’s altered request also sought expedited processing and a waiver of fees. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E), agencies shall provide expedited processing of records where “the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need.”
Further, the tenure of CAIRChicago staff directly handling this research project is temporary and ending on July 5, 2018. Plaintiff is therefore prejudiced by the undue delay in processing this request. COUNT I VIOLATION OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT WRONGFUL DELAY OF RELEASE OF RECORDS 31.
Defendants’ failure to make promptly available the records sought by CAIRChicago’s request violates FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A), and the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder. Defendants have wrongfully withheld agency records requested by Plaintiff. Plaintiff has exhausted all applicable administrative remedies with respect to Defendants’ withholding of the requested records.
5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i). Plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief with respect to the release and disclosure of the requested records.
Declare that Defendants violated the FOIA by failing to produce in a timely manner records that respond to Plaintiff’s request; B.
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1 through 30 above as though fully set forth verbatim herein. Defendants denied Plaintiff’s request for expedited processing. By appealing the adverse decision on expedited processing, Plaintiff has exhausted its administrative remedies.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests that this Honorable Court award the following relief: A. Declare that Defendants violated the FOIA by failing to grant Plaintiff’s request for expedited processing; B. Order Defendants to immediately conduct a reasonable search for all responsive records and disclose the requested records to Plaintiff on an expedited basis at no cost, and enter an injunction prohibiting Defendants from continuing to withhold the requested records from the public; C.

483,IM-MA-0001,"On March 2, 2007, a resident alien and two non-profits filed a class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, challenging the mandatory detention provision of Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The plaintiff also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, requesting his immediate release from detention.  

On July 12, 2007 district court held a hearing on the writ of habeas corpus, however, before ruling on the issue the plaintiff was released from custody. The court then dismissed the remainder of the case. 

","INTRODUCTION 1. This is an action to declare invalid the federal defendants’ misinterpretation of Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) (“mandatory detention” provision), and Section 303(b) (“Transitional Period Custody Rules” or “TPCR”) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”). Section 236(c) of the INA, in effect since October 9, 1998, requires the mandatory detention without bond of virtually all immigrants who commit a removable offense listed therein upon the immigrant’s release from the criminal custody that resulted from the offense. The TPCR provision, in effect until October 9, 1998, also required detention upon release for those who committed removable offenses listed therein—but did not preclude bond.
Defendants have misinterpreted both of the above provisions by erroneously applying § 236(c)(1) to immigrants with pre-October 9, 1998 removable offenses upon an immigrant’s post-October 9, 1998 “release” from a subsequent, unrelated state or local custodial encounter that does not constitute a removable offense under § 236(c)(1). Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent are immigrants unlawfully detained by defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Boston field office (“Boston ICE”) as a result of this misinterpretation. In erroneously subjecting plaintiffs and other class members to mandatory detention, defendants have deprived them of statutory and regulatory rights to be considered for release on bond under INA § 236(a), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), and under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(c)-(f).
This CLINIC program’s goal is to identify those unjustly detained and, as resources permit, represent them, help them obtain private or pro bono counsel, and explain law and policy in written materials, at rights presentations, and otherwise. B) Plaintiff POLITICAL ASYLUM/IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION PROJECT (PAIR) is a not-for-profit organization that is the core provider of pro bono legal services to indigent asylum-seekers and immigration detainees in Massachusetts. Through its Detention Center Program, PAIR assists immigration detainees held by defendant Boston ICE in contract facilities throughout the New England region, with the goal of identifying immigrants unjustly detained and, as resources permit, representing them or helping them obtain private counsel.
MEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON NOTICE OF DISMISSAL AND MOTION TO INTERVENE STEARNS, District Judge.
At issue in this putative class action is the mandatory detention provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). On March 2, 2007, Sassan Parinejad (Parinejad)[1] and two organizations that represent indigent aliens, the Political Asylum/Immigration Representation Project (PAIR) and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. (CLINIC), filed this action seeking a determination that Parinejad and similarly-situated aliens are not subject to the mandatory detention provision of section 1226(c). In addition, Parinejad filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.
On May 31, 2007, respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, lack of standing as to PAIR and CLINIC, and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. On June 8, 2007, Parinejad filed a motion to show cause why his habeas petition should not be allowed.
2005) (a habeas petition challenging ""only the petitioner's detention rather than his removal"" is not barred by the provisions of RIDA). Accordingly, it is clear that the only claim over which this court has jurisdiction is the petition for writ of habeas corpus. The next issue to resolve is whether PAIR and CLINIC have standing to maintain a petition for writ of habeas corpus without Parinejad's presence as a party to the suit.
Should he wish to pursue his claims, Bilecz must file his own lawsuit. Saysana's motion to intervene will be TERMINATED as MOOT. SO ORDERED.

484,IM-MA-0018,"In September 2019, the Irish International Immigrant Center sued U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services and President Trump. Plaintiff alleged defendants illegally terminated an immigration relief program that granted ""deferred action"" to seriously ill individuals and their families.

The court granted a joint motion to stay the case on October 31, 2019, so parties could seek a nonjudicial resolution.

KENNETH THOMAS CUCCINELLI II, Acting Director, U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services, LORI PIETROPAOLI, Regional Director, Northeast Region U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services MICHAEL J. McCLEARY, Director, Boston Field Office, U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services, U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES, KEVIN K. McALEENAN, Acting Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, Defendants. COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION This lawsuit challenges the Trump Administration’s abrupt termination of a longstanding government program that protects seriously ill people from deportation and death. The Administration’s action is unconscionable.
Because eliminating the authority of USCIS field offices to grant deferred action to individuals with dire medical needs is arbitrary, capricious, and based on impermissible animus, it violates the APA and the Equal Protection guarantees of the U.S Constitution. The IIIC therefore asks this Court to declare the termination of USCIS’s deferred-action program unlawful and enjoin its enforcement. JURISDICTION AND VENUE This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.
This Court has authority to issue declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-06, and the Court’s inherent equitable powers. Venue is proper in the District of Massachusetts under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). PARTIES Plaintiff Irish International Immigrant Center, Inc. is a nonprofit organization based in Boston, Massachusetts.
Founded by Irish immigrants in 1989, the IIIC provides services for 3,500 immigrants and refugees from more than 120 countries every year.
The IIIC employs a staff of six attorneys and two program associates who provide immigration legal services. The legal services provided by the IIIC include legal clinics serving 8 Id. at 3-4, 12-13.
On August 7, 2019, USCIS abruptly and without notice stopped its consideration of deferred action for non-military requestors. USCIS did not publicly announce its change in policy. Nor, on information and belief, did it provide a reason for the change.

Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States of America, the U.S. Department of State, and Michael R.

This case concerns President Trump’s ongoing, unlawful attempts to make it harder for underprivileged immigrants—from countries he has vilified—to come to the United States.

The Consular Visa Process. This case involves the process by which non-citizens may apply for a visa to enter the United States, and the Trump Administration’s attempts to restrict that process for noncitizens who may use public benefits. There are two general categories of visas: immigrant visas, for non-citizens who intend to become permanent residents in, and potentially citizens of, the United States, and nonimmigrant visas, for those that do not seek to reside in the United States permanently.

486,IM-NM-0002,"On May 4, 2020, two individuals in ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) custody sued ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. They claimed that restrictions to telephone access by impsing costs and denying access to incoming calls during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person visitations have been rendered impossible is unconstitutional. Specifically, they alleged that their Fifth and First Amendment rights had been violated by preventing communication with counsel, denying their right to legal representation, and other resources critical to support their cases. The case is ongoing. ","Instead, Defendants require Plaintiffs 22 to make calls in the presence of detention officers and other detained individuals. ICE has acknowledged that it refuses to accommodate confidential legal calls. In 24 response to an April 9, 2020 request from a non-profit legal services provider to personnel at 25 Otero to schedule confidential legal calls with two detained individuals, Otero responded four 26 days later that “the facility cannot provide a confidential place for a legal call at this time.”
Plaintiffs’ ability to locate, retain and communicate with counsel, and to gather 25 and present evidence in their removal proceedings, is further restricted by the fact that the 26 telephone services provided by Defendants for calls from El Paso and Otero are unreasonably – 27 and often prohibitively – expensive. Personnel at Otero have admitted that the facility does not provide free legal calls. 2 In an email dated April 23, 2020, in response to a request to provide detained individuals with 3 free legal calls, ICE personnel wrote, “IT DOESN’T MATTER IF IT’S A LEGAL CALL THEY 4 ARE NOT FREE.”
INTRODUCTION Individuals detained in the Otero County Detention Processing Center (“Otero”) and the 3 El Paso Service Processing Center (“El Paso”) must access free, confidential legal calls in order 4 to speak to their attorneys and to be able to effectuate their constitutional, statutory, and 5 regulatory rights in their immigration proceedings. This case challenges the federal 6 government’s systematic denial of such access. Proposed class members (“Plaintiffs”) are individuals who are or will be detained in the 8 custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) at El Paso and Otero.

Defendants’ conduct has turned the immigration court system into a public health hazard, an effect going to the heart of the Court’s jurisdiction in this case and its ability to fashion effective relief on Plaintiffs’ claims. Plaintiffs are six nonprofit organizations who provide legal services to immigrants and practice in the immigration court system. Plaintiffs require immediate, essential, and temporary relief.
The All Writs Act leaves to the sound discretion of the court the scope of the relief and instructs the court to “avail itself of [the Act] when the use of such historic aids is calculated in its sound judgment to achieve the ends of justice entrusted to it.” New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. at 172–73 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Before this Court is Plaintiffs’ Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), the All Writs Act. ECF 28. Plaintiffs are six organizations that provide legal services to immigrant clients. Plaintiffs seek an emergency order with respect to immigration courts nationwide for the duration of the national COVID-19 emergency or the next 28 days, whichever is shorter.

CLASSWIDE ALLEGATIONS 42. Petitioners are among dozens of detainees in the State of Pennsylvania—and the Middle District of Pennsylvania in particular—who have been held for six months or more without a hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified. Indeed, it is the government’s policy or practice to detain non-citizens for prolonged periods of time pending completion of their removal proceedings without providing them with hearings to determine whether such detention is justified.
Petitioners request only one form of relief: a constitutionally adequate hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified. Petitioners argue here that: (1) the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) does not authorize their prolonged detention without such a hearing, and (2) if it does, their prolonged detention without adequate review violates the Due Process Clause. In Demore v. Kim, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of mandatory, pre-final order detention only where the non-citizen had conceded removability and was held for the “brief period necessary for [completing] removal proceedings.”
By this Memorandum and Order, the Court does not finally resolve the petitioners’ claims, but sets forth its initial legal holdings and establishes a framework for additional proceedings. BACKGROUND The petitioners are lawful permanent residents charged by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement with being deportable from the United States as a result of certain criminal convictions. In their combination habeas petition and civil complaint, the petitioners challenge their detention during the pendency of removal proceedings pursuant to the mandatory detention provisions of Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c).
Consideration of the petitioners’ motion for a preliminary injunction will be consolidated with the merits of their petition, and the motion will be denied as moot. Finally, the portions of the petitioners’ habeas petition seeking class relief will be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the petitioners’ motion for class certification will be denied. NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: 1.

489,IM-SC-0001,"This is a class action lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a South Carolina immigration law which requires state and local law enforcement officers to investigate the immigration status of any individual they stop, detain, or arrest whenever they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the individual lacks immigration status, allows law enforcement officers to arrest individuals solely for failing to carry registration documents, makes it a crime to harbor or transport an undocumented immigrant or to be harbored or transported by others if one is an undocumented immigrant, and imposes civil liability on the police for failing to enforce its provisions to the maximum extent possible. The law was patterned after Arizona's SB 1070. The District Court has issued a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the law, and this injunction has been appealed to the Fourth Circuit; in the meantime, the case, along with several others like it from different states, are stayed at the District Court or U.S. Appellate level pending the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Arizona.

After Arizona v. United States was decided the issue was remanded to the District Court. The district court left in place most of its original preliminary injunction, enjoining the state from enforcing Sections 4, 5, and 6 (B)(2). The 4th Circuit per Judge Davis agreed and affirmed the order on July 13, 2013. In March of 2014 Judge Gergel permanently enjoined South Carolina from enforcing Sections 4, 5, and 6(B)(2). Furthermore the state agreed to more favorable interpretations of Section 7, and the remainder of Section, encouraging the Plaintiffs to dismiss their claims on those sections without prejudice.

Some of Nuevos Caminos’s services are provided to crime victims.

495,JC-CO-0006,"On April 2, 2002, prisoners at the El Paso County Jail in Colorado Springs filed a class action lawsuit uagainst El Paso County, the Board of County Commissioners, and former and current Sheriffs. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, alleged that the jail failed to protect and adequately provide for prisoners with serious mental health needs, particularly in preventing suicides. On June 28, 2006, Judge Richard P. Matsch denied class certification and on September 22, 2006, he dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.  ","The Jail houses recent arrestees, persons awaiting trial, and persons convicted and sentenced to terms of two years or less. The Jail houses both male and female prisoners and houses both adults and juveniles who have been charged as adults. The Jail comprises two buildings, both located in Colorado Springs: the Criminal Justice Center (“CJC”), and the Metro Detention Center (“Metro”).
Restraints and Use of Force Against Prisoners With Mental Illness 34. The Jail’s use-of-force policy permits officers to use pepper spray against prisoners “in the maintenance of order and discipline.” Pepper spray is sprayed in the face, and causes excruciating pain, gagging, and temporary paralysis of the larynx.
An actual and immediate controversy exists between the plaintiffs and the defendants. Plaintiffs contend that the conditions of confinement described herein are unconstitutional. Defendants contend that the conditions of confinement described herein are constitutional.
Nevertheless, the Report concludes that even these two suicides “may point to a need for better inmate management in the CJC.” Since the filing of the Complaint, the Jail’s inadequate suicide prevention procedures have led to the suicides of two additional pretrial detainees, Douglas Spencer Parrish and Marca Anne Wilson, as well as numerous serious suicide attempts. Indeed, the Jail’s “Annual Report for Mental Health, 2003” states that there were 22 suicidal gestures and attempts in 2003, up from 16 in 2002.

Plaintiffs and their counsel have vigorously pursued this case since it was commenced in 2002, and no conflicts between plaintiffs or their counsel and other class members have been identified.
GORSUCH, Circuit Judge. Plaintiffs Mark Shook and Dennis Jones, along with several intervenors, appear before us for the second time to contest the district court’s denial of their motion to certify a class action consisting of all present and future m entally ill inmates at Colorado’s El Paso County Jail. In their first appeal, we held that in denying class certification the district court erred by relying on the jurisdictional limitations imposed by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) to the total exclusion of the standards laid out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.
The difficulty with the district court’s opinion, in our view, was that it conflated a merits analysis of the relief available to plaintiffs – relief potentially curtailed by the PLRA – with the threshold class certification requirements of Rule 23 – which are not affected by the PLRA. On remand, the district court again denied class certification, but did so this time with reference to Rule 23’s strictures. We find that the district court’s analysis of the Rule 23 framework is free of the legal errors we identified in its first effort, and although we might reach a different conclusion were we addressing the certification question in the first instance, we are unable to say that the district court abused its discretion in declining to certify the proposed class under Rule 23(b)(2).
644, 647 (D Colo. We reversed. Noting that “[t] he text of the PLRA says nothing about the certification of class actions,” though it does contain provisions discussing the administration of class actions once certified, we held that “the PLRA does not alter the class certification analysis under Rule 23.”
at 117-18. The district court again denied class certification. This time, the court held that plaintiffs had failed to satisfy either Rule 23(a)(2), (a)(3) or (b)(2).

The DOJ claimed that the defendant failed to provide adequate suicide protection and mental health care to the inmates. The parties agreed to a consent decree, which was entered on May 22, 2013. Timely compliance has been a challenge and as of April 15, 2020 the defendants were still not in compliance. ","This letter provides MDCR with our findings. On April 2, 2008, we notified officials of Miami-Dade Calmty (""County"") of our intent to investigate the MDCR corrections facilities pursuant to the Civil Rights oflnstitutionalized Persons Act (""CRIPA""), 42 U.S.C.§ 1997. CRIPA gives the Department of Justice authority to seek a remedy for a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the constihltional rights of prisoners in adult detention and corrections facilities.
BACKGROUND The corrections facilities operated by MDCR (collectively ""Miami-Dade County Jail"" or ""the Jail"") hold an average of7,000 prisoners in a complex of buildings spread out across the county, making it the nation's eighth largest jail. The Jail has six corrections facilities: the Pre­ Trial Detention Center (""PTDC""); the Women's Detention Center (""WDC""); the Training and Treatment Center (""Stockade""); the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center (""TGK""); and the Metro West Detention Center (""MWDC""). Additionally, MDCR operates a boot camp program, with a housing facility adjacent to TGK (""Boot Camp"").
The sanitation within the Jail is not reasonably adequate to provide minimal civilized standards of life's necessities. The level of cleanliness at the Jail is poor. While some facilities, such as vVDC, are generally clean, other facilities are deplorable.

The County will analyze these reports and take appropriate corrective action within the following quarter, including changes to policy, training, and accountability measures.
The parties jointly move that this Court enter the proposed Stipulated Order, attached hereto as Exhibit 1, establishing the Compliance Plan as an Order of the Court. The parties stipulate that the relief is compliant with the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a). The United States has reviewed the Compliance Plan, attached hereto as Exhibit 2, and believes, at this point, that the entry of a Stipulated Order is the most expeditious route to moving Defendants towards full compliance with the Agreement.
See ECF No. [82]. Plaintiff United States of America (the “Government”) and Defendants Miami-Dade County, Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioners, and Miami-Dade County Public Health Trust (collectively, “Defendants” or the “County”) entered into a Consent Agreement, ECF No. [5-2] (“Consent Agreement”), effective May 22, 2013, that addressed alleged constitutional violations regarding the provision of medical and mental health care at the correctional facilities operated by Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation Department (“MDCR”). According to the Consent Agreement, on April 2, 2008, the Government notified Miami-Dade County officials of its intention to investigate conditions at MDCR.



Second Revised Summary Action Plan. On April 20, 2016, the Court held a status conference during which the parties noted that the County was not in full compliance with the Consent Agreement. See ECF No. [44].



And the reason I bring this to bear is 15 that that will be precisely seven years, seven years. The Settlement Agreement was effective on April 30, 17 2013 and the Consent Decree on May 22, 2013. And while I had 18 hoped that it would have been five years, I had hoped last 19 year it would have been six years.
If I can just enlighten the Court, the downtown jail 10 is the only jail within our system where one of two jails 11 within our system where the family members actually come into 12 the secure confines of the jail to visit with the inmates. That has presented its challenges. The jail was 14 built in 1950.

Defendants, John and Jane Doe, are correctional officers employed by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. Defendants John and Jane Doe engaged in the practice of conducting strip searches and visual body cavity searches of all persons who were admitted to the CBIF, regardless of the nature of charges or the circumstances of the individual.
Defendants John and Jane Doe knew or should have known that the strip search policy and practice at the CBIF, and as performed by them upon Plaintiff, were unconstitutional.
As a matter of law, the Baltimore Police Department is not an agency of the City and officers of that Department are not agents, servants or employees of the City.

Plaintiff seeks punitive damages as part of her judgment against the City. It is well established, however, that punitive damages cannot be recovered against a municipality such as the City for actions as alleged in the Complaint.
Here, Plaintiff has not alleged, and cannot allege, any facts to show an evil motive on the part of the City or the intent on the part of the City to injure Ms. Munyiri or anything to support a claim for punitive damages against the City. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages should be dismissed. CONCLUSION For all the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss the Complaint as to the City with prejudice.

In 1974, the NYCLU served as class counsel in Manicone v. Cleary, 74 Civ. 575 (JBW) (E.D.N.Y. ), a class action challenging certain conditions of confinement at the SCCF. That case resulted in a consent order that remained in effect for more than two decades, during which time the NYCLU consistently served as counsel to the class in enforcement actions and motions to modify the consent order.
Other individuals detained in the SCCF are alleged to have violated the terms of their parole and are awaiting their parole hearings or serving a sentence for a parole violation. The SCCF has a history of violating minimum health and safety standards for correctional facilities in the State of New York. In 1997, The New York Times quoted a spokesman for the New York State Commission of Corrections (“NYSCOC”), who described the SCCF as “the most seriously and profoundly overcrowded county facility in the state.”
Despite these toxic conditions, windows are often kept shut, preventing fresh air from circulating (except, that is, when some corrections officers attempt to punish the men for complaining about the cold temperatures in the facility by opening the windows to let in the freezing air). Riverhead’s unsanitary environment is compounded by inadequate ventilation. Inadequate ventilation creates and exacerbates unsanitary and unhealthy conditions by providing an environment hospitable to fungus, mold, rust, and bacteria, and by contributing to the transmission of airborne diseases.
Men are forced to live in each others’ filth and waste. The facilities are infested with rodents and insects. The water is undrinkable and visibly dirty, and the food is inadequate and unsafe and served in visibly filthy conditions.

While the number of available counselors is encouraging, the fact that they do not communicate regularly, share information on clients, or have access to each other’s progress notes means that the service delivery system is disjointed and a strong potential exists for a youth’s mental health needs to fall through the cracks.

502,JI-TN-0006,"In 2016, a minor detainee at Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center filed this class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiff alleged that the practice of placing minors in solitary confinement as punishment violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. In 2017, the plaintiff was granted a preliminary injunction and the parties began the settlement process. The case settled in July 2019. The settlement agreement included a permanent injunction prohibiting Rutherford County from using seclusion as punishment for minors.","Defendants’ actions make it clear that they may continue John Doe’s solitary confinement, contingent on whether his behavior is “good,” with only slight modification, ad infinitum. Defendants have placed John Doe into solitary confinement in the past. Defendants’ actions to place John Doe in solitary confinement are not motivated by safety and are, instead, motivated by a desire to punish/discipline John Doe.
County”), Lynn Duke (“Duke”), and Lieutenant Angela Istvanditsch, in their individual and official capacities as director and officer of the Facility, showing as follows: NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. This class action lawsuit challenges the unconstitutional and inhumane treatment of juveniles placed into lengthy periods of solitary confinement under Tennessee’s juvenile justice system.
Named Plaintiff John Doe is a child who was charged with and later adjudicated of offenses that render him delinquent under the laws of Tennessee. John Doe was incarcerated as a pretrial detainee at the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Facility. He is currently in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services (“DCS”) and is placed at the Middle Tennessee Juvenile Detention Facility in Maury County, Tennessee.
Prior to his adjudication as delinquent, Rutherford County subjected John Doe to lengthy periods of solitary confinement on multiple occasions for punitive or disciplinary reasons. The policies and procedures of the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center require solitary confinement of juveniles who violate facility rules, beginning at isolation for periods of twelve (12) hours and continuing up to indefinite solitary confinement. John Doe spent several days in solitary confinement at the Rutherford County Detention Center between March and May, 2016 based on these policies.
(3) defendant Bonnie Hommrich, in her official capacity as the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of the Children’s Services; . (4) defendant the Tennessee Department of the Children’s Services (the “Department”); and (5) defendant Rutherford County, Tennessee (“Rutherford County”) (collectively, these defendants will be referred to as the “Parties”). This Court previously certified a class in this matter (Docket No. 100), and the class is “all juveniles detained in the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center who are or were placed in solitary confinement or isolation for punitive purposes, from April 25, 2015 to the present” (the “Class”).
The Court concludes that the Class Settlement Agreement was the result of an arm’s length negotiation between experienced counsel for the Parties and not the product of overreaching or fraud. The Parties submitted the Class Settlement Agreement to the Court in their Motion (the “Class Settlement Agreement”). The Court preliminarily finds that on its face the Class Settlement Agreement provides the certified Class with the primary relief they sought, namely permanent injunctive relief.
(3) to explain how you may object to the proposed settlement if you disagree with it. THE BASIS FOR THIS CASE: A class action lawsuit alleged that the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center was improperly holding detainees in “solitary confinement” or isolation as a form of punishment or discipline, and that the practice amounted to cruel and unusual punishment that is unconstitutional.
The lawsuit also alleged that the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services (DCS) participated in decisions affecting detainees housed at the center and elsewhere and that DCS failed to take any action in order to prevent placement of detainees into “solitary confinement.” The parties have reached a tentative settlement that the Court has preliminarily approved. The settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or an indication that any law was violated.

Barr et al Assigned to: Hon. Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers Cause: 28:2201 Declaratory Judgement
AND FIVE MONTHS LATER IN SEPTEMBER, TWITTER RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE FBI THESE ARE ALL EXHIBITS TO OUR COMPLAINT RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE FBI SAYING THAT IT COULD NOT IT COULD NOT RESPOND AND ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR TWITTER BUT IT SAID THAT THE LETTER DID CONTAIN CLASSIFIED INFORMATION SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND THAT THE THE TRANSPARENCY REPORT COULDN'T BE RELEASED BUT THE GOVERNMENT WASN'T WILLING TO MAKE A REDACTION AND INFORM TWITTER AS TO WHAT COULD OR COULDN'T BE COULD OR COULDN'T BE PUBLISHED. AND THEN ABOUT A MONTH LATER, TWITTER TWITTER FILED ITS COMPLAINT. IN NOVEMBER ON NOVEMBER 17TH, THE GOVERNMENT FILED WITH THE COURT A REDACTED VERSION OF THE TRANSPARENCY REPORT.
BUT THEY DO NOT ARGUE THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY NON-DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY ARE CONSTITUTIONAL FACIALLY OR AS APPLIED. THE COURT: HAS TWITTER RELEASED THE REDACTED VERSION OF THE TRANSPARENCY REPORT? MR. SUSSMANN: I BELIEVE THAT IT HAS.
First, the transparency-reporting bands mandated by the DAG Letter 6 prohibit “Twitter’s ability to say ‘zero,’ that is, to truthfully deny receipt of any national security legal 7 process, or specific kinds of national security legal process.” (This is the “zero” rule.)
Second, the 8 reporting bands are so large as to impede meaningful, truthful speech about the scale of government 9 surveillance requests. (This is the “bands” rule.) And third, the government has taken the position that 10 “similarly situated” companies, including Twitter, must pre-clear transparency reports that do not comply 11 with the rules set out in the DAG Letter with the government before speaking publicly about national- 12 security process the companies (do or do not) receive.
at 17. (This is the “clearance” rule.) All of 13 these restrictions are content-based and therefore subject to strict scrutiny.
BACKGROUND Twitter’s action herein alleges claims for declaratory relief from prohibitions on its speech 27 in violation of the First Amendment. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that Twitter 28 seeks to publish a “Transparency Report” with certain data about legal process it has received 2 1 from the Government, including requests pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 2 (“FISA”) and National Security Letters (“NSLs”). Underlying Facts On January 27, 2014, in connection with pending complaints filed with the Foreign 5 Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) by Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and LinkedIn, 6 the Government filed a Notice attaching and referencing the DAG Letter.
Along those same lines, the USAFA’s changes to section 2709 make Twitter’s facial and 10 as-applied challenges to the prior versions of these nondisclosure provisions no longer germane. 11 Twitter alleged that section 2709 was a prior restraint and content-based restriction on speech that United States District Court Northern District of California 12 was not narrowly tailored and lacked procedural safeguards consistent with strict scrutiny. 13 (Complaint 46, 47, 48.)
For classification at the 4 “Secret” and “Top Secret” levels, the classifying entity must expect “serious” and “exceptionally 5 grave” damage, respectively Id. The information that Defendants redacted from Twitter’s draft Transparency 7 Report was not properly classified under Executive Order No. 13526. That information therefore 8 is not properly classified and, as a consequence, is therefore protected by the First Amendment.

PARTIES Plaintiff The New York Times Company publishes The New York Times newspaper. The New York Times Company is headquartered in this judicial district at 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York.
Plaintiff Charlie Savage is a reporter for The New York Times. Defendant DOJ is an agency of the federal government that has possession and control of the records that Plaintiffs seek.
Over the past decade, there has been growing public attention to the expansion of government surveillance and data-collection activities set in motion following the terrorist attacks of Sept. In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former government contractor, leaked classified documents to journalists. The resulting news articles, and subsequent declassifications, brought to light that the FISC had, since 2006, granted government requests to systematically collect data in bulk on Americans' domestic phone calls and, from 2004 to 2011, granted government requests to systematically collect data in bulk on Americans' e-mail traffic.
However, many crucial documents related to FISC remain secret. On March 12, 2014, Mr. Savage submitted a FOIA request (the ""Request"") to DOJ seeking certain materials pertaining to the FISC. The Request sought ""all government motions and briefs, judicial orders, and memorandum opinions"" concerning the following FISC litigation: 1) The July 22, 2002 case, ""In Re Electronic Surveillance and Physical Search oflnternational Terrorist Groups, Their Agents, and Related Targets"" 2) The ""Raw Take"" sharing order 3) The January 10, 2007 orders bringing the warrantless surveillance program under FISC authority whose existence were disclosed by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in his Jan.
Under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(C), a person making a request for materials under FOIA ""shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such a request if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions"" ofFOIA. Accordingly, The Times is deemed to have exhausted its administrative remedies as to the Request. DOJ has asserted no lawful basis under FOIA for withholding documents asked for by the Request.
DOJ's failure to provide responsive documents violates FOIA. Accordingly, The Times is entitled to an order compelling the DOJ to undertake an adequate search of its records and produce the documents sought by the Report Request.

Introduction This case concerns the Developmental Disabilities Alternative Community Services Medicaid Waiver (""ACS waiver"") administered by the Arkansas Department of Human Services (""ADHS""). Plaintiff, already a Medicaid recipient, seeks a preliminary injunction requiring ADHS to immediately accept her ACS waiver application, determine her eligibility for ACS waiver services, and, if she is eligible, provide ACS waiver services.
The defendants suggest on page 10 of their brief that they do not have a binding obligation to provide ACS services to the plaintiff because the ACS program is optional and of ""finite duration"". The plaintiff agrees that the program, like all waiver programs developed under 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c), is an optional program that Arkansas has chosen to include in its State Medicaid Plan. However, even though the program is optional, the fact remains that the ACS program is part of the Plan, and that the defendants must comply with all federal statutes and regulations that apply to § 1396n(c) waiver programs as long as it remains.
The defendants argue at page 5 of their brief that the plaintiff does not suffer a threat of irreparable harm arising out of their refusal to give her an application for ACS services. The plaintiff disagrees. Because the defendants refuse to give an application to the plaintiff, she has no way of applying for ACS services.

Even though animus is clearly present in its legislative history, the Court, having examined that history, the arguments made in its support, and the effects of the law, is persuaded that something short of animus may have motivated DOMA’s passage: Prejudice, we are beginning to understand, rises not from malice or hostile animus alone.

59a (“DOMA unconstitutionally discriminates against same-sex couples.”). The case arose after Ms. Golinski, a Staff Attorney with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for more than 20 years, was denied health coverage for her spouse Amy Cunninghis, to whom she is lawfully married under California law Pet. App.
In this litigation, Ms. Golinski seeks federal health insurance coverage for Ms. Cunninghis based on Ms. Golinski’s employment as a staff attorney for the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The litigation began as an administrative proceeding in the Ninth Circuit Judicial Council’s employee dispute resolution program. Chief Judge Kozinski, sitting in his administrative capacity, ruled that although Ms. Cunninghis could not be regarded as Ms. Golinski’s “spouse” within the meaning of the relevant statutes, she nevertheless was entitled to benefits as a “member of [Ms. Golinski’s] family.”
Golinski filed suit, contending that § 3 of DOMA, as applied to her, violated the equal protection and due process components of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S Constitution. The district court granted Golinski’s motion for summary judgment, holding that § 3 of DOMA “unconstitutionally discriminates against same-sex couples” and therefore “violates [Golinski]’s right to equal protection of the law under the Fifth Amendment.” The district court issued a permanent injunction “enjoining defendants... from interfering with the enrollment of Ms. Golinski’s wife in her family health benefits plan.”
These consolidated appeals followed.

507,PB-CA-0039,"Plaintiff, an individual with muscular dystrophy, filed this lawsuit alleging that the state's planned reduction in his home care nursing services (due to his reaching his 21st birthday and transition into ""adult"" services) puts him at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in violation of the ADA and Section 504. The parties reached a settlement agreement and on August 1, 2013, the case was dismissed.","INTRODUCTION 1. This civil rights action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the 3 devastating reduction in Medi-Cal funded in-home nursing care to Plaintiff Pablo Carranza. This 4 young man has Muscular Dystrophy, a severe and progressive disease that has left him unable even 5 to breathe or swallow on his own.

Defendants have the discretion and the ability to modify State Medi-Cal rules to Carranza v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief 1 increase the arbitrary cap on Plaintiff’s in-home nursing care to enable him to receive the skilled 2 nursing care he needs, and that is ordered by his doctors. They have refused to do so. So far, Defendants have not cut Plaintiff’s in-home nursing care but may do so at 4 any time after December 16, 2012, when his current authorization from Medi-Cal expires.
Plaintiff 5 obtained a delay in the planned reduction in his nursing via an administrative appeal, but because 6 Defendant Douglas has the authority to set aside any administrative decision and substitute his own 7 decision, this process offers Plaintiff no protection after December 16, 2012, when his current 8 Medi-Cal authorization for in-home nursing services ends. Defendants’ actions violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 10 § 12312 (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 11 504”). Under the ADA and Section 504, a public agency such as DHCS has a duty to provide 12 services to people with disabilities in the “most integrated setting appropriate to their needs” and 13 avoid unnecessary institutionalization.
California has elected to 10 participate in the Medicaid program, and so must comply with the requirements of the federal 11 Medicaid Act and its implementing regulations. California’s Medicaid program is known as 12 “Medi-Cal.” 18. The purpose of Medicaid is to furnish, as far as practicable, “medical assistance on 14 behalf of... aged, blind or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to 15 meet the costs of necessary medical services” and “to help such families and individuals to attain or 16 retain capability for independence or self-care....” 42 U.S.C. § 1396.
10 Muscular Dystrophy is a degenerative disease involving advancing muscle weakness and loss of 11 muscle tissue over time. Pablo’s health care has been funded entirely by Medi-Cal. 42. Pablo lives at home with his mother, Leticia Martinez, and brother, Raul Carranza, 14 who also has Muscular Dystrophy.
Under the due process clause of United States Constitution, when recipients of 8 needs-based public benefits such as Medicaid are facing a reduction or termination of benefits, they 9 are entitled to advance written notice explaining the basis for the adverse government action and an 10 opportunity for a hearing prior to reduction or termination of their benefits.

508,PB-DC-0004,"Institutionalized individuals with disabilities filed this challenge to the District of Columbia's Medicaid policies. Plaintiffs alleged that the District does not have an effective plan to prevent unnecessary institutionalization and that the inability of individuals to access sufficient community-based supports and services under DC's policies violates the ADA. Following trial in 2016, Judge Huvelle found that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate entitlement to class-wide relief and entered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed the decision; the D.C. circuit reversed and remanded. Discovery is now ongoing.","DHCF is a public agency and a recipient of federal financial assistance. DHCF is responsible for admini stering the District of Columbia's long-term care system for people with disabilities. See D.C. Code § 7-771.07(9).
Approximately 200 additional D.C. residents currently are placed in out-of-state nursing facilities; D.C. Medicaid continues to fund their care. The District also provides in-home and community-based services to people with disabilities under the Medicaid program. People with disabilities are entitled to personal care aide services in their homes under the District of Columbia's Medicaid State Plan and the Medicaid Waiver Programs for those who are Elderly or have Physical Disabilities (""EPD Waiver"").


DHCF is responsible for administering the District of Columbia's long-term care system for people with disabilities.
The United States therefore has a strong interest in the resolution of this matter. This lawsuit alleges that the District of Columbia (―District‖) administers its program of long-term care services for persons with disabilities in a manner that unnecessarily confines them to segregated nursing facilities. (First Amended Complaint (―Compl.‖) at 82, 84, 99, 101, ECF No. 17, March 30, 2011.)
Holdings: The District Court, Ellen Segal Huvelle, J., held that: [1] complaint would not be dismissed for lack of standing based on failure to allege causal connection between individuals’ placement in nursing facilities and District’s actions; [2] complaint would not be dismissed because there was no allegation that District had determined that community-based services were appropriate for plaintiffs; [3] it was not basis for dismissal that plaintiffs did not allege that cost of community care for given individual would be less than cost of institutional care; [4] fact issues existed as to whether District had Olmstead Integration Plan for placement of disabled persons in community settings rather than institutions or had moved individuals to the “most integrated setting” as required by Olmstead; and [5] claims against city officials, in their official capacities, would be dismissed as redundant.

They seek an injunction requiring the District to alter its policies and procedures in order to help them transition to the community. After a nine-day bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of the District. We now reverse and remand.
Plaintiffs are physically disabled individuals in these facilities who have been receiving nursingfacility-based care for more than ninety days but wish to transition—and are capable of transitioning—to communitybased care. This litigation began in late 2010, when four disabled individuals filed a class action against the District, alleging that the District’s failure to transition them to community-based care violated Title II of the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The district court rejected the District’s initial argument that it was entitled to summary judgment because it had in place an effective “Olmstead Plan”—that is, 1 Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program through which the federal government funds medical care provided by States to, among others, individuals with physical disabilities who meet certain financial requirements.","The District of Columbia's Department of Health and Human Services (DHCF) failed to comply with Olmstead v L C. ex reZ. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, which held that state and local governments may be liable for unnecessary institutionalization of individuals with disabilities under Title II of the ADA. The district court dismissed the claims of two named plaintiffs for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that their claims were moot. The plaintiffs appealed. The 6th Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal of the claims and remanded the case for further proceedings.","In 2010, four disabled individuals filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (D.C.) alleging that the District's failure to transition disabled individuals to community-based care violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (R.A. 1973). The district court entered judgment in favor of the District. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

Proceedings In October 2007, the Plaintiffs–Appellees filed suit in the Eastern District of Louisiana against the Registrar in her official capacity, seeking (1) a declaration that the Registrar’s refusal to issue the Certificate violates both the Full Faith and Credit Clause (the “Clause”) and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and (2) a mandatory injunction requiring the Registrar to issue a Certificate that identifies both Adoptive Parents as Infant J’s parents. The Registrar filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction which the district court denied. After the Registrar filed an answer to the amended complaint, the Adoptive Parents filed a motion for summary judgment.
Smith and Adar sued the Registrar under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that her action denies full faith and credit to the New York adoption decree and equal protection to them and Infant J. The district court ruled in favor of Smith and Adar on their full faith and credit claim. Following the Registrar's appeal, a panel ofthis court pretermitted the full faith and credit claim, concluding instead that Louisiana law, properly understood, required the Registrar to reissue the birth certificate.

510,PB-NC-0007,"On April 9th, 2014, several same-sex couples residing in North Carolina filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the state of North Carolina. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare that North Carolina's ban on same-sex is unconstitutional, declare North Carolina laws prohibiting joint adoption by same-sex couples are also unconstitutional,  enjoin the state from enforcing any of its laws banning same-sex marriage, direct the state to recognize same-sex marriages entered into in other states, and award the plaintiffs costs of suit and reasonable attorney's fees.

North Carolina law prevents Ms. Mejia from forming such a legal relationship in the only way she can—through application for adoption—also because of her sexual orientation.

RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE This matter is before the Court on Defendants’ Motions [Doc. #23, #30] to stay further proceedings in this case pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Bostic v. Schaefer, Case No. 14-1167. Also pending is a Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc.
Prior to the filing of the Complaint in the present case, a similar challenge was filed in Virginia. A motion for preliminary injunction was filed in that case in September 2013, and an Order was entered in February 2014, finding Virginia’s marriage laws facially unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to the extent that those laws deny the rights of marriage to same-sex couples or deny recognition of lawful marriages between same-sex couples that are validly entered into in other jurisdictions. That decision was immediately appealed to the Fourth Circuit in the case of Bostic v. Schaefer, and the Fourth Circuit is presently considering that case on an expedited basis, with oral argument already held on May 13, 2014.
IT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED that the Motions to Stay [Doc. #23, #30] be GRANTED, that all proceedings in this case, including consideration of Defendants’ pending Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, be stayed pending the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Bostic v. Schaefer, Case No. 14-1167 (4th Cir. 2014), and that the parties be directed to notify the Court in writing of their position on the course of future proceedings within 10 days following issuance of a decision by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Bostic.
Defendant asserts that the litigation here is analogous to McGee v. Cole, 115 F. Supp. district court awarded attorneys’ fees of less than one-third of the requested amount. The court in McGee noted that “[t]here was no discovery, only one brief hearing, and only two rounds of substantial briefing for early motions to dismiss and later cross-motions for summary judgment.”

511,PB-NE-0004,"On December 2, 2014, seven same-sex couples seeking marriage or recognition of an out-of-state marriage in Nebraska filed claim against the state of Nebraska under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. The District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, and it was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit on interlocutory appeal following the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. On February 4, 2016, Judge Bataillon issued a permanent injunction striking down Nebraska’s ban on gay marriage. ","They left Nebraska because they could not both be legally recognized parents of their daughter here. That is because Nebraska law limits joint and second parent adoption to married couples but bars same-sex couples from marrying or having their marriages recognized. Sally and Susan feared that the lack of a legal tie to one of her parents put their daughter at risk in the event something happened to her legal parent, so they moved to a state where they were able to provide her with the security of two legal parents by doing a second parent adoption.

I, § 29. The plaintiffs are same-sex couples who seek to marry in Nebraska or to have their marriages from other states recognized in Nebraska. They assert claims for deprivation of their fundamental right to marry and allege discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
They were married in 2013 in Iowa. They are the parents of a three-year-old girl that Nickolas Kramer adopted in a single parent adoption in Nebraska. They have shown that the lack of a legal parent-child relationship between the child and Jason Cadek denies their daughter important protections and resources and causes them profound stress and insecurity.
The State's interest in enforcing its laws diminishes with the strong showing that the same-sex marriage ban is not a legitimate exercise of its traditional authority over domestic relations matters. All but one of the plaintiff couples are married in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage. All of the couples have been in committed relationships for many years.
PER CURIAM. Plaintiffs are seven same-sex couples seeking to marry in Nebraska or to have their marriage in another state recognized in Nebraska.
They also seek state benefits incident to marriage. The district court1 granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. It found that Article I, § 29 of the Nebraska Constitution, which denies same-sex couples the right to marry, likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.
Thereafter, defendants appealed the Court’s order and filed an Emergency Motion for Stay Pending Appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eighth Circuit then issued an order granting defendant’s motion to stay. The Eighth Circuit decided to defer any oral arguments or decision until the Supreme Court decided Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S Ct. 2584 (2015).
August 11, 2015), at 4-5 (Filing No. 78). The Eighth Circuit then remanded the case to this Court for proceedings consistent with its opinion. Filing No. 79 and Filing No. 80.
While precedent does in fact dictate the result in the case before this Court, Section 29 has not specifically been declared unconstitutional. The Court agrees with the plaintiffs. The decision by the United States Supreme Court in Obergefell does not provide the certainty plaintiffs requested from this Court.
They simply want their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief permanently enjoined. The Court agrees with the plaintiff. The plaintiffs are not asking for a decision on past liability.
The court is advised that the parties have resolved all pending matters, including the payment of attorney fees and costs Id. This court earlier declared Article I, § 29 of the Nebraska Constitution unconstitutional in light of Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S Ct. 2584 (2015) and granted the plaintiffs a permanent injunction.

512,PB-SC-0005,"In 2016, a same-sex married couple filed this Civil Rights Act of 1871 complaint in the District Court of South Carolina (Columbia Division). Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming violations of their fundamental right to marry and other protected liberties related to the differential treatment of birth records for children with same-sex married parents. Summary Judgment was granted in favor of the Plaintiffs and a consent decree entered ordering South Carolina to make changes to the policies of their birth-record keeping, as well as the issuance of corrected birth certificates to the Plaintiffs and all who qualified under the new policies and requested such a correction. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement for attorney’s fees and the case closed in June 2017.","COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF NATURE OF THE ACTION 1. Plaintiffs Casy Carson (“Casy”) and Jacqueline Carson (“Jacqueline”) are a married couple who were denied accurate birth certificates for their newborn twins, simply because Casy and Jacqueline are spouses of the same sex. Even though South Carolina’s Department of Health and Environmental Control (“DHEC”) routinely lists both different-sex spouses as parents on their children’s birth certificates (including when their children were born through assisted reproduction and one of the parents is not genetically related to the children), Casy and Jaqueline’s twins received birth certificates inaccurately stating that they have only one parent, because DHEC refuses to recognize Casy and Jacqueline’s marriage on the same terms as the marriages of different-sex couples.

Casy and Jacqueline bring this suit, on their own behalf and on behalf of their children (together, “Plaintiffs” or the “Carson family”), pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for the violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs ask this Court to: (1) declare that the denial of accurate birth certificates for the children of same-sex spouses is unconstitutional; . (2) enjoin Defendant Heigel’s ongoing refusal to issue accurate two-parent birth certificates for the children of same-sex spouses on the same terms as the children of different-spouses; and (3) order Defendant Heigel to ensure that corrected birth certificates are issued upon request to the Carson family, and to other same-sex spouses and children previously denied them, without charging any fees that otherwise might apply to a corrected birth certificate.

Upon information and belief, and as required by the Regulation, DHEC routinely provides birth certificates listing both different-sex spouses as parents based on the fact of their marriage. DHEC refuses, however, to issue accurate birth certificates on the same terms to same-sex couples. Instead, upon information and belief, DHEC will not issue a birth certificate accurately listing both same-sex spouses as parents unless the omitted parent obtains either an adoption decree or some other court order requiring DHEC to issue an accurate birth certificate.

and S.D.C. Plaintiff Jacqueline Carson became pregnant with their children by means of artificial insemination. Under the current practice of Defendant, Plaintiff Jacqueline Carson, as the birth mother of the twins, is listed as a parent on S.B.C.=s and S.D.C.=s birth certificates, but the birth certificates fail to name Plaintiff Jacqueline Carson=s spouse, Plaintiff Casy Carson.
According to Plaintiffs, Defendant=s granting birth certificates identifying non-genetic fathers but refraining to name non-genetic mothers as parents of children born to their female spouses violates Plaintiffs= rights to Equal Protection.
Plaintiffs argue Defendant=s policy discriminates on the basis of sex and sexual orientation.
Plaintiffs assert Defendant is also discriminating against S.B.C. and S.D.C., as well as the children of other same-sex parents. Plaintiffs aver Defendant has neither a legitimate nor compelling interest in denying marital children of same-sex spouses birth certificates with both parents named on them.
WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED hereafter, the Defendant shall prepare and issue birth certificates in the State of South Carolina in compliance with the following directives: 1. DHEC shall apply all rules, procedures, policies and practices relating to the issuance of birth certificates to same-sex spouses on the same terms as it applies them to differentsex spouses. The birth mother will be listed on the original birth record as the “Mother” of a child born in the State of South Carolina.
1 provides additional details for birth clerks and the general public regarding the forthcoming changes to vital statistics record-keeping policy related to how birth records will be entered for children born in this State to married same-sex couples). Immediately upon entry of this Consent Decree, Defendant will issue two-parent birth certificates to married same-sex parents on the same terms, and using the same protocols, as two-parent certificates are provided to married, different-sex parents. Defendant will modify its existing vital records system to allow updates to its current systems and forms so the first parent is listed as “Mother/ Parent,” and the second parent is listed as “Father/Parent.”

), an ongoing class action concerning the IDOC’s treatment of mentally ill prisoners, the Defendants acknowledged that Anthony was among a handful of IDOC prisoners who were so mentally ill that they needed acute, inpatient psychiatric care. Defendants refused to provide this care. Instead, they continued to hold Anthony in extreme isolation, with the devastating impact that Anthony continued to mutilate himself.

Counts Two and Three—Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act.

The Defendants also discriminated against Anthony because of his mental illness, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”). Anthony’s severe mental illness was a disability covered by the ADA and the RA. While the Defendants have policies to ensure that that IDOC prisoners with conventional medical needs (such as physical injuries or illnesses) receive the medical treatment they need, the Defendants did not provide equivalent treatment for Anthony’s mental condition.

Instead, they followed a continuing discriminatory policy of forcing him to undergo extended torture in solitary confinement, without appropriate treatment, until his sentence was completed. In further violation of the ADA and the RA, the Defendants failed to provide reasonable accommodations for Anthony’s disability. The Defendants provide IDOC prisoners with a variety of programs and services, and they are obligated not to segregate disabled and non-disabled persons.

With reasonable accommodations to his disability, the Defendants could have provided Anthony with these programs and services, but they chose not to. Instead they placed him in extended solitary confinement. Anthony served years in disciplinary solitary confinement because he exhibited behaviors that were a result of the fact that the Defendants had put a disabled person in solitary confinement.

They could have sought Anthony’s referral to an inpatient psychiatric facility through the “collegial review” process operated by Wexford, their employer. They did not do so, however. (c) Defendant Wexford was capable of providing Anthony with the treatment he needed, or having him transferred out of IDOC facilities for inpatient mental health treatment.

Wexford was and is under contract with the State of Illinois to provide both medical and mental health care to all prisoners within the IDOC. This included the provision of “[c]omprehensive and specialized mental health services” for IDOC prisoners, including off-site and hospitalization services as necessary to treat the medical and mental health needs of the IDOC’s prisoners. (Indeed, pursuant to this contract Wexford arranges every day for IDOC prisoners suffering from injuries and “physical” illnesses, like cancer, to be transported outside of IDOC prisons to medical facilities where they can receive the medical care they need.)

Nor did they ameliorate the conditions of his confinement in prison, or provide him with effective treatment. Instead, they allowed him to remain isolated in solitary confinement. Defendants conspired to keep Anthony in solitary confinement in institutions throughout the IDOC.

The State of Illinois and the IDOC receive federal financial assistance. Defendants discriminated against Anthony by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for his mental disabilities. By placing Anthony in solitary confinement and depriving him access to appropriate services, programs, and activities, including education, programming, recreation, exercise and mental health services, the Defendants discriminated against him on the basis of his disability in violation of the Rehabilitation Act.

As Commission, Ms. Corcoran responsibilities also include responding to appeals of complaints. and grievances brought by individuals in the Department's custody. As Commissioner, Ms. Corcoran was aware of DPSCS and DOC policies and practices regarding prisoners, including policies and practices· regarding wheelchair-bound prisoners and those with other disabilities or perceived disabilities.
Failure to Maintain Wheelchair Accessible Facilities Mr. Jardina resided in at least two DPSCS facilities, WCI and DRCF. Each facility has features that are inaccessible to wheelchair users. WCI is almost entirely inaccessible to a wheelchair-bound individual.
This stall is in the plain view of other prisoners and guards and there is no privacy screen. The dining halls at WCI and DRCF have insufficient seating for wheelchair users. Prisoners with disabilities must wait, sometimes outside without cover, until a seat is available for their wheelchair.
Work assignments also provide valuable vocational training for re-entry. DRCF houses numerous wheelchair-bound individuals. Approximately twentyfour (24) wheelchair-bound prisoners reside in Housing Unit 1-C (the ""Housing Unit"")-an allegedly ADA-compliant housing unit within DRCF.
Plaintiffs are also routinely denied appropriate and timely medical care, follow up treatment, and medical supplies. Specifically, the Wheelchair Plaintiffs are not provided with supplies or pa1ts for their wheelchairs, ileostomy bags, and other necessary devices to accommodate their disabilities. This practice has resulted in the Wheelchair Plaintiffs being unable to repair their wheelchairs when necessary, or to use the bathroom in a safe and sanitary marmer, and has caused them to suffer embarrassment, humiliation, and tremendous physical and emotional discomfort.
He alleges that he was “mysteriously released” from the custody of the Department in June 2019, after the Department allegedly “conceded that it could not accommodate [his] ongoing and serious medical needs,” Compl., 11, and that “[d]uring his incarceration with [Department]... [he] was housed at several [Department] facilities, including the Western Correctional Institution (“WCI”) and [Dorsey Run].” 1 The complaint was filed on August 30, 2019 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.

The lawsuit claimed that, instead of providing interpreters, the prison made him train other inmates as his interpreters and they were not qualified to help him and were also privy to confidential information. In May 2016, the Court granted partial summary judgment for the defendant. Following a jury trial on the remaining claims, the Court dismissed the plaintiff's ADA claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the PLRA. The jury awarded the plaintiff $400,000 in noneconomic damages. The Court awarded the plaintiff $683,873.13 in attorneys' fees, $18,155.19 in costs, and $3,924.79 in litigation expenses.

Plaintiff, in turn, asserts his claim is based on a pattern or practice of discrimination by Defendant rather than a series of discrete, individually actionable acts; he brought this action while Defendant's conduct was ongoing, and, therefore, his claim properly includes all of Defendant’s acts; and, accordingly, the continuing-violations doctrine applies under these circumstances.

Plaintiff alleges that (1) Max Williams, the former Director of the Oregon Department of Corrections (“ODOC”); . (2) Jeff Premo, the Superintendent at OSP; .
For the reasons set forth below, I GRANT Plaintiff’s motion for appointment of counsel and DENY Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Jacob Barrett is an inmate of the Oregon Department of Corrections (“ODOC”) and is currently in the custody of the Florida Department of Corrections. Plaintiff was previously in the custody of the New Mexico Corrections Department (“NMCD”) and while there, sent an envelope with a drawing on it to his cousin who was an inmate at the Oregon State Penitentiary (“OSP”).
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated his First Amendment free speech rights and his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights when they rejected his mailing. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff’s claims. I concluded in my November 14, 2013, Opinion Order that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity insofar as Plaintiff sought money damages.1 I, however, denied Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff’s First Amendment free speech claim, which alleges that Defendants violated Plaintiff’s First Amendment free speech rights when they rejected his envelope containing a drawing on it.
(collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated his First Amendment rights by rejecting and returning a letter that Plaintiff sent to an inmate at OSP because of a picture Plaintiff had drawn on the front of the envelope. This Court conducted a one-day bench trial on February 19, 2015.
These are the Court’s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Fed. R Civ P. 52 (a)(1).
As explained below, Defendants violated Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights. As a result, Plaintiff is awarded declaratory and injunctive relief. FINDINGS OF FACT I.
Plaintiff filed a Tort Claim Notice on April 8, 2011. Plaintiff filed the present lawsuit on November 10, 2011. Complaint, [2].

Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953). Plaintiff has established that ODOC’s incoming mail policy burdens his First Amendment rights, as well as the First Amendment rights of other inmates and their correspondents. Defendants face the possibility of spending a minimal amount of additional time each day looking more closely at envelopes in order to read the recipient’s address.
Therefore, the evidence shows that Mr. Premo and Ms. Dodson’s denial of Plaintiff’s appeal constituted a direct violation of his constitutional rights. CONCLUSION Defendants violated Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights. Plaintiff is entitled to declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from rejecting or otherwise prohibiting incoming mail for containing artwork on the front of envelopes.
ODOC shall provide this notice through the ODOC newsletter that is issued to inmates on a routine basis. DECLARATORY RELIEF The Court orders relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as follows: ODOC's policy of rejecting inmate mail for containing drawings or artwork on the front of the envelope violated Plaintiff's First Amendment rights. Defendants Jeff Premo and Michelle Dodson violated Plaintiff's First Amendment rights by denying Plaintiff's appeal of ODOC's rejection of his letter for containing artwork on the envelope and affirming that rejection.

522,PC-PA-0031,"The Disability Rights Network (DRN), a Pennsylvania non-profit, filed this Eighth Amendment suit against the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (PDOC) for the PDOC's use of solitary confinement with severely mentally ill prisoners. On January 5, 2015, the parties executed a settlement agreement for dismissal of the matter, in which the PDOC agreed to implement certain improvements and to pay $750,000 to DRN.  In particular, the PDOC will evaluate all incoming prisoners for serious mental illness, and will place prisoners with serious mental illness in solitary confinement only in ""exceptional"" circumstances; even then, a prisoner with serious mental illness can be kept in solitary confinement for no longer than 30 days and must be allowed out of their cells for 20 hours per week. The settlement also provided for a monitor to report on compliance, and will remain in effect for 3 years (less if the defendant demonstrates substantial compliance for a period of 18 months). There has been no activity on the docket since May 2015 and the case is presumably closed since the three year time period set in the agreement has lapsed. ","Introduction 1. This action seeks to stop the cruel and unusual punishment of prisoners in Pennsylvania prisons diagnosed with serious mental illness. These men and women are confined in so-called Restricted Housing Units (RHUs) under horrific conditions, through an unconstitutional process that takes no account of—and exacerbates—their mental illness.
In February 2010, Prisoner #2 was evaluated and found incompetent to stand trial by a psychiatrist at Torrance State Hospital, who opined that he was “floridly psychotic” and in need of “structured and supervised psychiatric care.” The DOC has not provided him with such care. Instead, Prisoner #2 has been repeatedly charged with rules infractions and received disciplinary sanctions in the RHU for conduct that is symptomatic of his mental illness, such as swearing at corrections officers, refusing to provide a urine sample for the past 3 years, masturbation in front of a female staff person, smearing feces on his own body and throughout his cell, self-mutilation, and attempted suicide.
He also experiences auditory hallucinations. Other prisoners have sexually assaulted him on numerous occasions. Threats of that nature make him extremely anxious, which as a result of his diagnosed mental illness causes him to threaten or assault others.
The law suit alleges that the department is aw are that such confinement exacerbates their mental illness, but does not adequately take their mental health into account before disciplining them by placing them in solitary confinement for extended periods of time. The law suit alleges the state's mistreatment of these prisoners, who make up about 33% of the total RHU population, violates their rights under the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Prisoners in RHUs are locked dow n at least 23 hours a day in cells as small as 80 square feet the size of an average home bathroom.

Defendant John E. Wetzel is the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (“DOC”). Defendant Wetzel is responsible for the overall operation of the DOC.

For the past 21 years, Shoatz has been prohibited from having physical contact with his visitors, including with family members. For the past 21 years, Shoatz has been subjected to a mandatory strip search and the possibility of a body-cavity search every time he leaves his cell. For the past 21 years, Shoatz has been placed in shackles every time he leaves his cell.

During the past 21 years, Shoatz was issued only one misconduct for covering an air conditioning vent because he was cold. DOC has a “no talking” policy for prisoners in solitary confinement. DOC has sealed the steel doors of the cells in solitary confinement.

The conditions imposed upon Shoatz for the past 21 years are significantly harsher than those imposed on prisoners in general population.

Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, April 14, 2016 Justice Department Closes Investigation After Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Takes Significant Steps to Reform its Use of Solitary Confinement The Justice Department announced today that it has closed its investigation into the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (PDOC) following significant improvements made by PDOC to its policies and practices that are intended to protect prisoners with serious mental illness and intellectual disabilities from the harmful effects of solitary confinement. The department opened its statewide investigation into the use of solitary confinement on prisoners with serious mental illness and intellectual disabilities in May 2013 after finding a pattern of constitutional violations as well as violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act at the State Correctional Institution in Cresson, Pennsylvania. After working in cooperation with PDOC to conduct an intensive review of prisons across the state, on Feb.
“We remain dedicated to vigorously enforcing the civil rights of those who have serious mental illness throughout Pennsylvania, regardless of their situation.”
The department initiated this investigation under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), which prohibits a pattern or practice of deprivation of constitutional rights of individuals confined to state or local government-run correctional facilities. This investigation was conducted by attorneys with the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Western District of Pennsylvania. Additional information about the Civil Rights Division is available on its website at www.justice.gov/crt.
The improvements we have seen since our February 2014 findings, together with PDOC's commitment to sustainable reform, give us confidence that the same pattern or practice of violations we found early in our investigation does not exist today. PDOC's reforms include a number ofpositive changes that go to the heart ofour investigation. Solitary Confinement and Discipline.
Out-of-Cell Options. PDOC has begun implementing new procedures that require its prison personnel to offer out-of-cell activities and treatment to prisoners with SMI/ID for 20 hours per week,4 and often more, to meet each prisoner's individual treatment needs. Prisoners receive these out-of-cell options in the specialized treatment units that are now less stark than in the past and feature colorful murals and recovery-based messages.
PDOC has expanded its mental health5 diagnostic and classification processes so that thousands more prisoners benefit from its treatment units. In the past, prisoners could be subjected to solitary confinement as long as they were not experiencing active mental health symptoms. Today, all prisoners with a current or past serious mental illness diagnosis are diverted to treatment units and thus protected from the harmfu l effects of solitary confinement.

The district court dismissed the case with prejudice, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.","CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Plaintiffs Sharon Burnette, Pamela K. Burroughs, Frank Carter, Jr., Edward Conquest, Donald W. Hoffman, Monty King, Larry Macon, Marvin McClain, Benjamin Perdue, Jr., Henry Stump and Barbara Tabor, by counsel, bring this class action on behalf ofthemselves and all other similarly situated inmates and for their causes of action allege as follows: NATURE OF THE CASE 1. This is a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of a class of inmates in Virginia's prisons whose constitutional rights are being violated by the practices, policies and procedures of the Virginia Parole Board (""the Board""). Plaintiffs were convicted of ""violent"" offenses committed prior to January 1, 1995, and have been legally eligible for parole under Virginia law for eleven years or more.
THE PARTIES The Plaintiffs 4. Plaintiff Sharon Burnette is a 49-year old prisoner in the custody of the Virginia Department of Corrections (""DOC"") at Fluvanna Correctional Cent.er for Women. She has been incarcerated for more than 28 years.
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT COME NOW the Defendants, Helen F. Fahey, Carol Ann Sievers, Jackie T. Stump, Michael M. Hawes, and Rudolph C. McCollum, Jr. (hereinafter collectively referred to as “The Virginia Parole Board”), by counsel, and in support of their motion to dismiss submit the following. Plaintiffs, all inmates within the custody of the Virginia Department of Corrections, have filed, by counsel, this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violation of their constitutional rights with regard to discretionary parole release. Specifically they allege the following Claims: CLAIM I.
(i) Deferrals of Parole. Plaintiffs allege that the Parole Board has deferred parole consideration in an arbitrary manner. Plaintiffs acknowledge that the Parole Board is permitted by statute to 4 “In the discretion of the Board, interviews may be conducted by the Board or its representatives and may be either public or private.”
For the reasons set forth below, the motion will be granted. I • BACKGROUND This action was filed by eleven inmates who are prisoners with the Virginia Department of Corrections (""DOC""). The Complaint alleges that Defendants, who are members of the Virginia Parole Board (""the Board""), violated the Plaintiffs' constitutional rights with respect to discretionary parole.
The two claims are summarized below.
The dismissal of the Complaint as legally insufficient necessitates that the PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR LEAVE TO CONDUCT LIMITED DISCOVERY PRIOR TO A RULE 26(f) CONFERENCE (Docket No. 15) will be denied and John R. Lay's MOTION/PETITION FOR JOINDER AS PARTY PETITIONER(S)/PLAINTIFF(S) (Docket No.8) will be denied. The action will be dismissed. It is so ORDERED.
Argued: March 21, 2012. Decided: July 9, 2012. Synopsis Background: State prisoners filed action against members of Virginia Parole Board in their official capacities contending that Board had adopted policies and procedures with respect to parole-eligible inmates imprisoned for violent offenses that violated Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses.
The Inmates brought suit, asserting that the Board’s policy changes—particularly its alleged de facto abolition of parole—violate their rights under the Due Process Clause and the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. The district court granted the Board’s motion to dismiss the complaint. Analyzing the due process claim, the district court first recognized that the Inmates have a limited constitutional interest in parole consideration derived from Virginia law.
See Greenholtz v. *181 Inmates of the Neb. *181 Inmates of the Neb. Penal Corr.
Some have garnered the support of counselors, DOC officers, and others in seeking parole. Nevertheless, the Board has refused to release them based on the seriousness of their crimes. Indeed, *183 for eight of the eleven Appellants, this factor, the “serious nature and circumstances of the crime” (or like words), has been the sole reason given in explaining repeated parole denials.3 Yet we cannot infer from these facts that the Board is failing to consider each Inmate individually, according to the relevant factors, when making these parole determinations.
Nevertheless, they are not relieved of their obligation under the Iqbal-Twombly pleading standard to allege facts demonstrating a plausible, not merely possible, entitlement to relief. Because they have failed to meet this obligation, dismissal of the complaint was appropriate. For this reason, we affirm the judgment of the district court.

The plaintiffs alleged rampant discrimination on the basis of race and family status, rent overcharges, and a failure to maintain rental units. After participating in settlement conferences, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice and without costs in July 2017. The case is now closed.","This lawsuit is brought on behalf of current and former residents of the Alexander County Housing Authority (“ACHA”) to remedy rampant race discrimination and family status discrimination as well as substantial rent overcharges. For years, ACHA and its agents have discriminated against residents of its McBride and Elmwood family housing developments based on their race and familial status, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003. ACHA also has overcharged its residents for rent, in violation of the Brooke Amendment to the U.S. Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1437a, in many instances collecting $100-$200 per month in excess of the limit permitted by federal law.

ACHA also has engaged in a pattern and practice of not maintaining the Elmwood and McBride developments – which are occupied almost exclusively by African-American tenants – so that they have deteriorated to the point that they are nearly uninhabitable. McBride and Elmwood apartments, which are located in Cairo, Illinois, are infested with mice, roaches, and bedbugs. For years, Elmwood and McBride residents made request for repairs, and ACHA ignored them or repaired them in a substandard manner.

ACHA has refused to place families with children in certain public housing developments, such as Connell Smith, in order to prevent African American families from living in majority white public housing developments. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS HISTORY OF RACE DISCRIMINATON AT ACHA 22. ACHA has had a long history of discriminating against African-American residents based on their race. In 1974, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against ACHA for intentionally segregating its two main public housing complexes by race.

At the time, Elmwood was reserved for white residents, and Pyramid Courts (now McBride) was reserved for AfricanAmerican residents. The lawsuit was eventually settled, and ACHA agreed to stop segregating its housing based on race. ACHA agreed to prioritize occupancy such that Pyramid Courts would have 71 white residents (out of 237), and Elmwood would have 39 black tenants (out of 159).

As a result, ACHA breached its leases with Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Frey, and Nelson causing them substantial monetary injury. Mary Holder, Barbara Holder, Frey, and Nelson substantially performed their obligations under their residential leases with ACHA. Wilson, Upchurch, Pink, and Franklin worked as ACHA’s Executive Director during the past two years and were responsible for ensuring that residents’ rent was calculated in accordance with HUD regulations.
In 2014, 80.3% of Alexander County households with children under the age of 18 were income eligible for federally assisted housing, compared with 46.1% of Alexander County households with no children under the age of 18 in the household. African-Americans also disproportionately reside in ACHA’s public housing. Almost 80% of ACHA’s units contain a head of household who is African-American.

Plaintiffs re-allege paragraphs 1 to 80 of this Complaint and incorporate them herein. Defendants’ actions as described above perpetrate segregation on the basis of race in violation of the Fair Housing Act § 3604. COUNT IV – FAIR HOUSING ACT CLAIM FAILURE TO AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHER FAIR HOUSING (On behalf of the McBride Elmwood Race Discrimination and Familial Status Discrimination Subclasses against ACHA) 87.

ACHA’s breach caused Plaintiffs to suffer out of pocket costs associated with paying the rent as well as substantial monetary injury. Plaintiffs substantially performed their obligations under their residential leases with ACHA. In failing to maintain Plaintiffs’ units in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition, Defendants demonstrated a conscious disregard for Plaintiffs’ welfare.
Enter a preliminary and permanent injunction, without bond or upon a nominal bond, enjoining ACHA from discriminating against the Plaintiffs and members of the McBride and Elmwood subclass based on their race or familial status and directing ACHA to take all affirmative steps necessary to remedy the effects of the illegal, discriminatory conduct described herein and to prevent similar occurrences in the future; d. Find that the Defendants violated the residential lease; e. Award monetary relief to the Plaintiffs in the amount of compensatory damages, abatement of rent, punitive damages, and prejudgment interest in an amount to be proven at trial; f.

The plaintiffs, protesting systemic racism in policing, alleged that the police used excessive force in a racially motivated manner to end the protests.","Black people have been hunted, brutalized and killed by the police since the 2 inception of law enforcement in the United States, including a demonstrable history of 3 violence in San José. This action arises out of protests across the nation in response to 4 the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police Department officers. 5 Floyd’s death, so soon after law enforcement killed Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud 6 Arbery, mobilized millions of people around the country to condemn the deaths of 7 Black and Brown people by law enforcement in one of the largest social justice 8 movements in U.S. history.1 9 2.

This was ineffective in deescalating the police response. The CITY OF SAN JOSÉ Police Officers aimed their weapons at the demonstrators and began to strike and jab protesters with batons in their faces, chest, and abdomen. The police show of force quickly escalated to using chemical weapons, impact munitions and explosive flash-bang grenades and stinger grenades.

But unbeknownst to Mr. Acosta, around 7 p.m., a reported white supremacist deliberately drove a grey SUV into the crowd, hitting two people near Clara and sending demonstrators running and screaming.
Moreover, to satisfy First Amendment requirements, a curfew must both be narrowly tailored and allow for ample alternative channels of communication. Defendant CITY OF SAN JOSÉ’s curfew was not narrowly tailored and did not allow for ample alternative channels of communication. Less burdensome means for preventing violence were readily available by employing traditional legal methods.
Similarly, on May 30, 2020, Plaintiff SHAUNN CARTWRIGHT tried to stay back against a wall near City Hall on deployed chemical weapons into the crowd. She could not outrun the chemicals due to her disability. Defendants aimed at Ms. Cartwright as she attempted to make herself smaller and hide, and shot her four times in quick succession with impact munitions as if she were a sitting duck.

The defendants in the action include: the City of Steubenville [""City""], the Steubenville Police Department [""SPD""], the Steubenville City Manager and the Steubenville Civil Service Commission. The parties entered into a consent decree [""decree""] resolving the subject matter of this action and the Court approved the decree on September 3, 1997. The Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Steuben Lodge No. 1 [""FOP""] now contests portions of the decree and seeks to intervene in the action as a third-party plaintiff.
For the reasons that follow, the Defendants' Motion to Consolidate is GRANTED. The Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is DENIED. The Plaintiff's Motion to Remand is DENIED.
Finally, the Court must consider whether the parties currently named in this case may adequately protect the interests of the United States. The Consent Decree issued in this case was agreed to by the City of Steubenville and the United States. The very terms of the Decree indicate that the parties anticipated ongoing enforcement issues as well as the need for a lengthy term in which the jurisdiction of this Court was retained.

The Defendants, City of Steubenville, et al., removed the case to this Court claiming that the relief sought by the Plaintiff is in direct contradiction of the provisions of the Consent Decree entered by this Court in 1997.

Most recently, I found that the City was still in substantial compliance with the Decree during the last quarter of 2004, October 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004. As a result, the City has maintained compliance with the Decree for two years. In light of the City's fulfilling the requirements of Paragraph 96 of the Decree, I support the parties' joint request to terminate the Decree and dismiss the case.
Reynolds was required to review and to evaluate all of the City’s internal affairs reports, use of force reports, and warrantless search and seizure reports, including all reports generated by the Thorne incident. In January 2003, Reynolds determined that Steubenville was in substantial compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree. Moreover, after the Thorne incident occurred, Reynolds also found that Steubenville had maintained substantial compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree through the remainder of 2004.

Plaintiffs request immediate emergency relief enjoining Defendant from enforcing the deadline for third party presidential candidates to file election petitions with Defendant and extending the deadline to September 1, 2020. To secure access to the District’s general election presidential ballot, independent and third-party presidential candidates are required to file petitions with Defendant containing the signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of all registered voters within the District of Columbia.
VENUE 11. Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District. Furthermore, Defendants exercises statutory authority within this district and maintains their principal office within the District.
The CDC continues to recommend that everyone avoid large gatherings and crowds, and maintain a distance of approximately six feet from all strangers (i.e., all non-family members). On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. On March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a national emergency, retroactive to March 2, 2020, due to uncontained community transmission of the Wuhan novel coronavirus within the United States and the resulting expanding outbreak of COVID-19.
See, Coronavirus Omnibus Emergency Amendment Act of 2020, §21(a) (codified, May 13, 2020, D.C. Act 23-317, 67 DCR 5235) and 67 D.C.

See, D.C. Official Code § 1-1001.08(j)(4)(A) and (1)(B); D.C. Official Code § 1123(d)(2).
The District also reduced the signature requirements for local candidates to secure ballot access requiring them to collect less than 250 signatures to secure ballot access. 38 However, the District failed to lower the signature collection requirement for third party and independent presidential candidates to secure ballot access for the 2020 general election.
The Due Process Clause requires timely notice of the requirements to secure access to the District’s general election ballot so that Plaintiffs can plan their actions to secure ballot access based on the requirements of the law. The District’s reduction of the number of signatures required to be collected to secure access to the general election ballot on August 6, 2020, after the August 60. Despite the reduction of the number of signatures required to be collected from 5,007 to 250 the day after the August 5, 2020 deadline has passed, Defendant continues to enforce the August 5, 2020 deadline preventing Plaintiffs the opportunity to secure ballot access and plan and execute a petition drive to collect 250 signatures for the 2020 general election in violation of rights guaranteed to Plaintiffs under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The Court held that the scheme was unconstitutional. The scheme “resulted in... significant population disparities,” and the state could not fall back on its reliance on census figures to justify these disparities because “[t]he... use of [a] census enumeration to support a conclusion that all of the Navy personnel on a ship actually resided within the state senatorial district in which the ship was docked placed upon the census figures a weight that they were not intended to bear.”

He seeks a preliminary injunction delaying his execution until he receives the information. The district court denied Wood’s motion.

No. 17-16330 Argued and Submitted September 12, 2018 San Francisco, California Filed September 17, 2019 Synopsis Background: Arizona death-row inmates and non-profit advocacy organization brought § 1983 action against state prison officials, challenging Arizona’s execution procedures, alleging that they violated the First Amendment by restricting the ability of execution witnesses to hear the sounds of the entire execution process, failing to disclose the source and quality of the lethal-injection drugs used in the inmates’ executions, and failing to disclose specific qualifications of the execution team members who would insert intravenous lines into the inmates. The United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Neil V. Wake, Senior District Judge, 188 F.Supp.3d 940, dismissed the action, in part. Holdings: The Court of Appeals, Watford, Circuit Judge, held that: [1] the First Amendment right of access to governmental proceedings encompasses the right to hear the sounds of the entire execution; [2] Arizona’s alleged restrictions witnesses’ ability to hear sounds of execution impermissibly burdened the First Amendment right of access to governmental proceedings; [3] right of access to governmental proceedings did not entitle inmates to information regarding the lethal-injection drugs or the execution team members’ qualifications; and [4] Arizona’s restrictions did not implicate inmates’ First Amendment right of access to the courts.
According to the complaint, ADC officials are violating the inmates’ First Amendment rights by limiting their access to important information about the execution process, thus hindering their ability to challenge the constitutionality of their executions. The district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court held that the right of access to governmental proceedings does not encompass either the right to hear the sounds of the execution process or the right to obtain the requested information regarding execution drugs and personnel.","In 2007, a group of Arizona death row inmates filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona against the Arizona Department of Corrections. The plaintiffs alleged that the state's execution procedures violated their First Amendment rights. The court granted a temporary stay of execution to allow the plaintiffs to challenge the use of non-FDA-approved sodium thiopental in combination with midazolam. The parties agreed to revise their procedures and pay the plaintiffs' costs. The case is ongoing.","Death-row inmates and a non-profit advocacy organization brought  1983 action against state prison officials, challenging Arizona’s execution procedures, alleging that they violated the First Amendment by restricting the ability of execution witnesses to hear the sounds of the entire execution process.

Relevant experience As further detailed in my c.v., I regularly make maps that analyze Census and other demographic data in relation to statutory restrictions that impose geographic limits for criminal justice purposes.1 My experience includes: • I testified in Whitaker v. Perdue (U.S Dist. Georgia, 4:06-cv-00140-CC) in 2006 and 2008 regarding the impact of HB1059, Georgia's sex offender residency restriction law. I prepared maps of 1,000 foot exclusion zones around schools, day-care centers, bus stops, parks and other areas listed in the statute as places that people on the sex offender registry cannot live.
In addition, registry information is often inaccurate. The registry purports to provide information on “convicted sex offenders.” Public Sex Offender Registry Home Page.3 But some registrants were convicted of crimes that are not sex offenses; others had their cases dismissed before a final judgment was entered, and were never convicted.

Bruce and Utsler allege at least two third-party actors who were responsible for their injury: the Royal Oak Music Theater and the Royal Oak Police Department. According to these Plaintiffs, the Royal Oak Music Theater decided to cancel their “Hallowicked” concert event following the Royal Oak Police Department’s request. Although Bruce and Utsler allege that the Royal Oak Police Department cited the DOJ’s report in asking the Theater to cancel the “Hallowicked” concert, the complaint does not allege that the DOJ or FBI directed either party to do so.

ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge. Juggalos are fans of the musical group “Insane Clown Posse.” In 2011, the National Gang Intelligence Center labeled Juggalos “a loosely-organized hybrid gang.”

A group of self-identified Juggalos brought Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) claims against the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), asserting that the gang designation violated their First and Fifth Amendment rights. The district court determined that the gang designation was not a final agency action and dismissed the suit. We agree and affirm.
They asserted that the Juggalo gang designation in the 2011 NGIC Report violated the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), because the gang designation was contrary to Appellants’ First Amendment rights of freedom of expression and association and Fifth Amendment due-process rights, was arbitrary and capricious, and was made without observance of proper procedure. The district court initially granted a motion by DOJ and FBI to dismiss the case for lack of standing. We reversed that decision, finding that Appellants had alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate standing to pursue their APA claims against DOJ and FBI.
On remand, DOJ and FBI filed a second motion to dismiss, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that the Juggalo gang designation was not reviewable because it was not a final agency action and was committed to agency discretion by law.
The district court granted the motion to dismiss, holding that the Juggalo gang designation was not a final agency action and, even if it was, it was committed to agency discretion by law. Appellants timely appealed the judgment of the district court. III.

539,CJ-NY-0015,"On June 28, 2018, Black Love Resists in the Rust and four individual plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit against the City of Buffalo in the Western District of New York. They claimed that the Buffalo Police Department disproportionately used vehicle checkpoints in Black and Latino communities to generate revenue, resulting in disparate impact on Black and Latino people. The plaintiffs sought an injunction to end and remediate these traffic enforcement practices, as well as monetary damages for the financial harm, humiliation, and loss of liberty and property. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 21, 2020; the case is ongoing. ","Statistically, the variable of “Black or Latino population” is the dominant explanation for Checkpoint location, explaining nearly 80 percent of the variation in Checkpoint location. The City has deployed vehicle Checkpoints to generate revenue. The year the City implemented a vehicle Checkpoint strategy, the Buffalo Police Department (BPD) issued more than 36,000 traffic violations, an increase of 92% over the prior year.
In June 2012, Mayor Brown, former Commissioner Derenda, and BPD launched the Strike Force – a mobile unit that targeted supposed crime hotspots to reduce guns, drugs, and gang activity. The Strike Force, in order both to advance the City of Buffalo’s general interest in crime control and to increase revenue, employed suspicionless vehicle Checkpoints. “Suspicionless” in this context means that all cars approaching the Checkpoint are stopped, without regard to whether there is reasonable suspicion (much less probable cause) to believe that a crime or a traffic violation has been committed.
More than 1400 of these were conducted in the period from January 2013 to June 30, 2017, the period prior to BPD’s efforts, as alleged below, to cover up its unconstitutional activities. Defendants conducted the vast majority of Checkpoints in Black or Latino neighborhoods. BPD conducted nearly 40% of all Checkpoints through June 30, 2017—545 out of 1424—in just three of Buffalo’s 77 Census tracts.
All of Defendant Brown’s challengers in the Democratic primary, including Erie County Legislator Betty Jean Grant, City Comptroller Mark Schroeder, and Plaintiff Taniqua Simmons, criticized BPD’s racially discriminatory use of police Checkpoints at mayoral debates and in the media. In response to these and other complaints, Defendants Brown and Derenda defended the City’s traffic enforcement policies and practices, including those pertaining to Checkpoints. 13 Greater Buffalo Racial Equity Roundtable, The Racial Equity Dividend: Buffalo’s Great Opportunity, at 32 (September 2016) 23 126.
Thus, the percentage of Checkpoints in (a) majority-minority areas and (b) largely white areas, by period, was as follows: Period 2013 2014 2015 2016 Jan.-June 2017 July-Oct. 2017 in Majority/ Minority Areas in Largely White (Minorities 25%) Areas 134. In December 2017, the Attorney General of the State of New York opened an in- vestigation into BPD’s Checkpoint practices. The investigation resulted from a complaint filed by Black Lives Matter-Buffalo that alleged widespread racial discrimination by BPD.
In January 2018, Defendant Derenda retired as BPD Commissioner.
159 Ms. Franklin observed that, to the extent white people went through the Bailey Avenue Checkpoint, they tended to pass through without being pulled over for a secondary stop. Most of the drivers pulled over for secondary inspections were Black. During the operation of the Checkpoints that Ms. Franklin observed, the entire street was lined with cars waiting for secondary inspection or to be ticketed and/or towed.
The damages suffered by class members, although substantial in the aggregate, are small in relation to the extraordinary expense and burden of individual litigation. Managing this case as a class action should not present any particular difficulty. Plaintiffs Doe’s claims are typical of class and subclass members’ claims.

On information and belief, Defendant DOC, has adopted an official policy and practice that denies necessary surgical treatment to inmates with a severe eye disease in one eye, but with another eye that provides some level of vision that Defendant DOC claims to be adequate. This policy and practice is referred to as the “One Good Eye” policy. As a consequence of Defendant DOC’s “One Good Eye” policy, inmates are denied necessary surgical treatment for cataracts and other conditions and are forced to languish with serious eye conditions, which can cause legal or total blindness in the diseased eye.
Defendant DOC’s current “One Good Eye” policy is in the exclusive possession of Defendants and is not publically available. Defendant DOC’s “One Good Eye” policy discriminates against individuals with physical eye impairments on the basis of their disability. There is no medical justification for the “One Good Eye” policy.

545,ED-MS-0006,"In 2017, four low-income African American mothers filed suit against the numerous officials of the State of Mississippi claiming the state failed to live up to the educational requirements set by the Mississippi Readmission Act of 1870. They sought declaratory relief that the requirements are still intact. The case was dismissed in 2018 due to the state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit which affirmed in part and reversed in part. The defendants requested rehearing en banc, but the Fifth Circuit denied the request. The defendants then filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court and a request to stay the Fifth Circuit's mandate in January 2021. The case is ongoing.","(relying on Pennhurst State School Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984), a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the “Eleventh Amendment bars a suit against state officials when ‘the state is the real, substantial party in interest.’”). Thereafter, the Court entered a Final Judgment by which the case was dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiffs have now moved to have the judgment in this case altered or amended under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Merely requiring the named defendants to abide by the 1868 version of the education clause, however, would not end the alleged violation of the Readmission Act (which, again, allegedly resulted because the state constitution was amended) because the amendments to the constitution would still remain in place, and would control the actions of, and the decisions made by, any elected or public official who is not named as a defendant in this case. Next, Plaintiffs argue that the Court erred in entering a Final Judgment dismissing this case with prejudice. The Court agrees.
Accordingly, the Court will grant the Motion to Alter or Amend to the extent that an Amended Final Judgment will be entered dismissing the case without prejudice. Finally, Plaintiffs have moved for leave to amend their complaint to cure the pleading defects that they believe resulted in the dismissal of this case. The proposed cures include insertion of the word “prospective” to modify the type of declaratory judgment they seek, and the withdrawal of their request that the amendments made to the education clause of the Mississippi Constitution be declared void ab initio.
16 Stat. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit are low-income African-American women whose children attend public schools in Mississippi.
They filed suit against multiple state officials in 2017, alleging that the current version of the Mississippi Constitution violates the “school rights and privileges” condition of the Mississippi Readmission Act. The district court held that plaintiffs’ suit was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and dismissed the case. Though we agree that a portion of the relief plaintiffs seek is prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment, we hold that the lawsuit also partially seeks relief that satisfies the Ex parte Young exception to sovereign immunity.
Defendants moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6). The district court granted defendants’ motion for dismissal under 12(b)(1), holding that plaintiffs’ complaint was barred by sovereign immunity. Although plaintiffs sued state officials rather than Mississippi itself, the court concluded that the relief plaintiffs seek would impermissibly “result in the issuing of an order that No. 19-60069 would, and could, operate only against the State.”
The district court also held that plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief was not covered by the Ex parte Young exception to the Eleventh Amendment because it sought to “rectify prior violations of the Mississippi Readmission Act” rather than prospectively dictate future conduct. Plaintiffs timely moved for reconsideration of the district court’s order. The district court denied the motion on the merits, but amended the judgment to reflect the fact that the dismissal was without prejudice—a mandatory condition for a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).
III. The district court dismissed the complaint because it concluded that plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. On appeal, the state officials defend the district court’s judgment while also making several alternative arguments in support of affirmance, contending that plaintiffs lack standing, the suit is barred by the political question doctrine, and there is no private right of action under the Mississippi Readmission Act.
Read literally, the text of the Eleventh Amendment prevents only non-citizens of a state from suing that state. U.S Const. amend XI.
court granted the defendants’ 12(b)(1) motion, holding that it lacked jurisdiction based on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. On reconsideration, the court dismissed without prejudice. On appeal, the plaintiffs defended their “request [for] a ‘prospective declaratory judgment’ that makes two distinct findings: first ‘that Section 201 of the Mississippi Constitution is violating the Readmission Act,’ and second, ‘that the requirements of Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution of 1868 remain legally binding on the [d]efendants, their employees, their agents, and their successors.’” Id.

547,EE-AL-0122,"This case was brought by an African-American job applicant against Cook's Pest Control, Inc., alleging that Cooks had maintained a pattern and practice of discrimination in employment on the basis of race. The parties reached a settlement in October of 2011 and the court has granted preliminary approval and certified a settlement class. The court approved the parties' settlement and dismissed the case with prejudice in July 2012. ","Background. Plaintiff Marion Waters (“Waters”) initiated this action against the defendant, Cook’s Pest Control, Inc., on February 28, 2007. His complaint (“Original Complaint”) included class allegations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 20 U.S.C. § 2000(e), et seq. (“Title VII”), and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (“§ 1981”).
Its founder and president, attorney Thomas A Warren has over 30 years experience in class action and fair employment /civil right law and has been class counsel in some of the country's largest fair employment class action cases. The Claims Administrator shall serve as the Trustee of the Settlement Fund. Class Action Status is Appropriate.
Plaintiff Marion Waters filed this lawsuit on behalf of himself and other African-American applicants or individuals denied employment or discouraged from applying for jobs with Cook’s because of their race. The terms of this settlement will provide Cook’s employees with training and hiring procedures developed to eliminate race discrimination in the workplace. The settlement will also provide monetary relief for African-American class members who applied for, but were denied, employment at any Cook’s location during a specified period.
(Fisher Decl., 28). In this case, the work for the Plaintiff began in 2006. Counsel with qualifications and experience necessary to properly handle complex class actions involving hiring and use of selection criteria is “a tiny specialty within the overall field” would not take cases similar to this one without the option of a substantial enhancement being added to the court-awarded attorney fees to compensate such counsel for the considerable risk of prosecuting the case for years on a contingent fee basis.
(Doc.
Specifically, Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and equitable relief to redress alleged racially discriminatory practices in Defendant’s application process. Plaintiffs accused Cook’s Pest Control, Inc. (“Cook’s”), of: (1) discouraging job applications by AfricanAmericans by telling callers with a dialect or diction that may indicate they are AfricanAmericans, or African-Americans who apply in person, that there are no jobs available; . (2) discouraging applications by African-Americans by stating that applications for jobs must be placed on file at every office where employment is sought because African-Americans tend to be less financially able to travel to all offices; .
The Decree will include the following terms: (1) With the assistance and approval of the Monitor, Cook’s will establish objective, facially neutral hiring criteria that shall be used in the hiring process for the positions of sales, pest control technician, or termite technician during the term of the Decree. (2) Cook’s will hire qualified applicants at each facility without regard to race.
(3) Cook’s CEO will issue to all employees a statement affirming Cook’s antidiscrimination policy and describe its implementation and the reporting process if employees believe a violation has occurred. (4) Cook’s will institute periodic training of its hiring and other management and supervisory personnel relative to the terms of the Decree, nondiscriminatory hiring, and other terms and conditions of employment. (5) Cook’s will put in place mutually agreed upon record keeping procedures that shall include the compilation by each facility of applicant flow data by race, the number of Monitored Position hires by race, and a summary of the reasons for selection/rejection of each applicant for the Monitored Positions.
The predominant relief requested is a consent decree requiring implementation of new hiring procedures, training programs, and methods of record keeping, as well as the institution of a monitor to oversee the decree. The parties also request a Court order enjoining Cook’s from violating the decree or discriminating against African-Americans in employment based on their race. Because the predominant relief requested is equitable, and individual damages are easy to calculate and manage based on the formula agreed upon by the parties, certification is appropriate under both Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).
Namely, a consent decree will be entered requiring Cook’s to implement new hiring procedures, training programs, and methods of record keeping, and a monitor will be instituted to oversee the decree. The Court will also enjoin Cook’s from violating the decree or discriminating against African-Americans in employment based on their race. This factor strongly weighs in favor of the slightly enhanced attorneys’ fee of 35% of the Settlement Fund O.
B Training. Cook’s shall institute periodic training of its hiring and other management and supervisory personnel regarding the terms of the Decree, and non-discrimination in hiring, and other terms and conditions of employment. C Hiring.

Plaintiffs’ case has some strengths – e.g., the difficult-to-justify (in Plaintiffs’ view) exempt classification of Store Managers prior to their reclassification, based on the executive exemption under the FLSA, California, and New York law, since they appear to have so many sales and routine store maintenance duties, and since so much of their job is governed by central policies, practices, and procedures.
Defendants reserve the right to raise these arguments should it be necessary to do so. The amount offered in settlement. As discussed in depth supra, the five hours per week of overtime, plus liquidated damages, 10% interest, three hours per week of California meal/rest, itemized wage statement penalties, vacation time compensation, and recovery for alleged retaliation against the named Plaintiffs under the Settlement – discounted modestly and appropriately for litigation risk and attorneys’ fees – all suggest a fair offer.

(af, COURT STAFF) (Filed on 7/31/2009) (Entered: 07/31/2009)","This class action lawsuit was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Samsonite Company Stores, Inc. (Samsonite) on behalf of a group of employees who worked as store managers in the State of New York. The plaintiffs alleged that they were entitled to overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) because they were exempt from the executive exemption under the FLSA, California, and New York law. The court approved a settlement in which Samsonite agreed to pay a total of $850,000 to the plaintiffs. The amount of the settlement was determined by multiplying the amount of overtime pay by the number of hours worked over the course of the class period.","On July 15, 2009, employees of Samsonite Company Stores, Inc. filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs alleged that they were entitled to overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and other federal and state wage and hour laws.

549,EE-CA-0363,"The Women's National Soccer Team alleged that the United States Soccer Federation discriminated against them in terms of pay and working conditions in violation of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The court denied the Equal Pay Act claim because the team failed to provide sufficient evidence for gender-based unequal pay. The Title VII claim is moving forward however on the premise of unequal working conditions and is scheduled for a jury trial on January 26, 2021. The case is ongoing. ","In reality, the USSF has utterly failed to promote gender equality. 16 It has stubbornly refused to treat its female employees who are members of the WNT 17 equally to its male employees who are members of the MNT. The USSF, in fact, has 18 admitted that it pays its female player employees less than its male player employees 19 and has gone so far as to claim that “market realities are such that the women do not 20 deserve to be paid equally to the men.”
Plaintiffs and MNT players do not work in a single location, but are 10 required to perform and work in games throughout the United States and globally, 11 according to the playing schedule set by the USSF. Plaintiffs and similarly situated male employees of the USSF must adhere 13 to the same rules of the game of soccer as established by the Federation Internationale 14 de Football Association (“FIFA”). They play on the same size field; use the same size 15 ball; have the same duration of matches and play by the same rules regarding start and 16 restart of play, offside, fouls and misconduct, free kicks, penalty kicks, throw-ins, 17 goals kicks, corner kicks, etc.
The USSF categorically rejected this model as well. The USSF continues its policy and practice of paying female WNT 10 players less than similarly situated male MNT players on a per game basis. Each Plaintiff has and continues to earn less compensation on a per game 12 basis than comparable male players on the MNT.
Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation COMPLAINT 80. The USSF has engaged in systemic gender-based pay discrimination 2 against its female WNT employees. The USSF has caused, contributed to, and 3 perpetuated gender-based pay disparities through common policies, practices, and 4 procedures, including but not limited to common compensation policies, common 5 conduct management policies, and centralized decision-making.
Whether, as a result of the USSF’s ongoing conduct, violation of 10 Title VII, and/or willful discrimination, Plaintiff and similarly situated former and 11 current WNT members have suffered and will continue to suffer harm, including but 12 not limited to lost earnings, lost benefits, and other financial loss, as well as non- 13 economic damages. The USSF’s policies at issue apply uniformly to all members of the 15 Class. The prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class 17 would create the risk of: a.

In this case Charles Taylor alleges that the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (“WASA”) discriminated against him and other WASA African American employees in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.

On March 28, 2013, the Court approved a settlement agreement between the parties. The parties entered into a final settlement agreement on March 30, 2014. The parties agreed that the defendant would pay a total of $1 million to African-Americans who were not part of the proposed class.

Plaintiffs commenced this action on August 5, 1998.
In April, 1999, Judge Nicholas Politan granted Defendants’ motion. A number of Counts were dismissed with prejudice, and the remainder of the Complaint was dismissed without prejudice, so that Plaintiffs could re-file an appropriate Amended class action Complaint. Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint on June 7, 1999.
The AT TMPP is a ""defined benefit plan"" subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA""), as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 1001, et seq. The Plan was established in October 1980 as a benefit plan available to AT T management employees. AT T is the ""plan administrator"" as that term is defined by ERISA.
Plaintiffs sought an order from the court which would reinstate each plaintiff as a participant in the plan Id. The district court entered summary judgment for the employees and defendants appealed Id. On appeal, the Supreme Court determined that plaintiffs who were no longer plan members were authorized to bring an action under the catchall provision, § 502(a)(3), for appropriate equitable relief based on defendants's breach of fiduciary duty.
For the reasons set forth below, both motions will be DENIED. BACKGROUND This case arises out of disputes over an AT&T Pension Plan (the ""Plan""). The background to this case has been stated in previous Opinions in this case most recently, the Opinion of March 30, 2006 and will not be repeated here.
Moreover, to the extent that Defendants seek to constrain P 88A by relying on any of the Court's prior rulings on the Tenth Claim in the Third Amended Complaint, 1 this runs contrary both to their previous statement and to this Court's previous decision. Defendants appealed the November 17, 2004 Order by the Magistrate Judge to the district court. In their brief, Defendants argued that ""new paragraph 88A adds an entirely different claim.""

In designing the transition provisions from the old pension plan to the new cash balance plan, Defendant deliberately treated Plaintiffs differently because of age. Defendant’s actions discriminate against Plaintiffs because of age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a) and 29 U.S.C. § 626(b). Defendant’s actions also discriminate against Plaintiffs in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination.

On March 30, 2006, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed Plaintiffs’ Fourth and Fifth Claims “without prejudice to be re-filed once Plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies.” On May 8, 2006, Plaintiffs transmitted a letter of appeal to the AT&T Employees’ Benefit Committee.
OPINION ROTH, Circuit Judge: I. Introduction **1 Engers and several other AT T employees (collectively, Engers) appeal several orders of the District Court granting summary judgment on their claims against AT T under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). In 1998, Engers brought a class action against AT T, alleging that changes to its Management Employees’ Pension Plan (the Plan) in April 1997 disproportionately harmed older employees in violation of the ADEA, and violated ERISA’s disclosure, anti-backloading, and anti-cutback rules.
After extensive discovery and over a decade of litigation, the District Court granted summary judgment to AT T on all of Engers’s claims. Engers contends on appeal that the District Court misinterpreted the ADEA and *77 several ERISA provisions and mistakenly concluded that certain of his claims had not been adequately pleaded.

555,EE-NY-0192,"On May 21, 2007, the United States and African American and Hispanic applicants for positions in the New York City Fire Department filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District Court of New York, claiming that the test used by the NYFD resulted in disparate impact discrimination against the two groups. The Court bifurcated the case and ordered broad remedial relief, and even after the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S.Ct. 2541 (U.S. 2011), disallowed decertification of the class.  On March 18, 2014, the District Court received a letter that the plaintiffs and the City settled as to the disparate treatment dispute. Later, the parties settled the intentional discrimination claims. The settlements awarded $100 million in backpay and required institutional reform. The case is still ongoing as the court monitors the settlement's implementation. ","There are also large sample sizes, which make a finding of statistical significance more reliable. Hundreds of black and Hispanic applicants were affected by the City’s written examinations. Given the practical significance of the disparities here on the actual hiring rates for black and Hispanic applicants, this case is clearly distinguishable from Waisome.

In August 2002, the Vulcans filed an unlawful discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”). The EEOC subsequently referred the complaint to the Department of Justice. In May 2007, the United States (“the Government”) sued the City under Title VII, challenging two separate FDNY employment procedures for screening and selecting entry-level firefighters alleged to have an unjustified disparate impact on black and Hispanic applicants.
First, in considering the sufficiency of the City’s rebuttal evidence, the District Court’s task was only to determine whether the City’s rebuttal evidence satisfied the City’s burden of production. But the Court went beyond that task and granted summary judgment to the Intervenors. Although summary judgment at the preliminary stage might be proper in a rare case, the Intervenors have not cited any case, and we have found none, in which an employer’s rebuttal evidence in a discriminatory treatment case resulted in a summary judgment for the plaintiff.

This Order addresses whether eligible black claimants may seek compensatory damages under New York State Human Rights Law and New York City Human Rights Law for certain noneconomic losses due to the City’s disparate impact discrimination, as provided in the court’s Compensatory Damages Order.

The PORT AUTHORITY POLICE ASIAN JADE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK NEW JERSEY INC., Christian Eng, Nicholas Yum, Alan Lew, Howard Chin, David Lim, George Martinez, Stanley Chin, Milton Fong, Richard Wong, Sanrit Booncome and Michael Chung, Plaintiffs, v. The PORT AUTHORITY OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY, Defendant.

A true and correct copy of the August 29, 2003 EEOC Determination is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. In the EEOC Determination, the EEOC found that ""there is reasonable cause to believe [the Port Authority] has violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended"". The EEOC ruled that: • ""Examination of the totality of the documentary and testimonial evidence reveals that highly qualified Asian police officers have repeatedly, over the years, been passed over for numerous promotions to the positions of sergeant.""
In late September 2003, the AJS was informed by the EEOC that all efforts to engage the Port Authority in discussions had failed. On September 26, 2003, the EEOC determined that efforts to conciliate the charge were unsuccessful and forwarded the case to the United States Department of Justice. On January 25,2005, the United States Department of Justice notified AJS of its right to institute a civil action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, within 90 days.
The Port Authority intentionally subjected and continues to subject Asian police offers to disciplinary charges without factual basis and to more frequent and more severe disciplinary action in respect of minor infractions than was received by non-Asians in respect of the same or similar infractions.
The employment practices of the Port Authority have had a disparate and adverse impact on Asian police officers. As a result of the foregoing, the Port Authority has violated and continues to violate provisions of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as amended. 42 U.S.C. § 2000(e).
The Port Authority’s thirteen facilities are policed by the Port Authority’s Public Safety Department. The plaintiffs are eleven Asian–American members of the Port Authority Public Safety Department. All of the plaintiffs began their careers with the Department as Officers.
The Asian Jade Society received a Right to Sue letter on January 25, 2005. On April 15, 2005, the Asian Jade Society and the individual plaintiffs filed the Complaint in this case. The Complaint alleges that the Port Authority intentionally discriminated against Asian–Americans in making promotions to Sergeant, that the Port Authority had a pattern or practice of intentionally discriminating against Asian–Americans in making promotions to Sergeant, and that the Port Authority’s practices for promotion to Sergeant had a disparate impact on Asian–American officers.
42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(g)(1) provides that back pay cannot be awarded from a date earlier than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the EEOC. The plaintiffs’ EEOC charge was filed on January 31, 2001. Two years prior to that date is January 31, 1999.

LIVINGSTON, Circuit Judge: Plaintiffs-appellees, eleven Asian Americans currently or formerly employed as police officers by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (“Port Authority”), sued the Port Authority under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., alleging that they were passed over for promotions because of their race. The plaintiffs asserted three theories of liability for discrimination: individual disparate treatment, pattern-or-practice disparate treatment, and disparate impact.

BACKGROUND The Port Authority is a bi-state transportation agency whose facilities are policed by its Public Safety Department. The eleven plaintiffs-appellees in this case are Asian Americans who were employed by that department as police officers.

This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706 (f)(1) and (3) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3) (""Title VII"") and Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. § 1981a. The unlawful employment practices alleged below were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division. PARTIES 3.

Defendant Whirlpool Corporation represented by Adam Carl Wit Littler, Mendelson, P.C. 200 N LaSalle Street Suite 2900 Chicago, IL 60601 (312) 372−5520
STATEMENT OF CLAIMS 6. More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, Carlota Freeman filed a charge with the Commission alleging violations of Title VII by Defendant Employer. All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1345. Plaintiffs EEOC and Freeman allege that Defendant impermissibly discriminated against Freeman in violation of Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981 by not responding adequately to coworker Baker’s racial and sexual harassment of Freeman, thereby creating a hostile work environment that culminated in a physical assault on Freeman. Defendants dispute the content of the employees’ interactions, the steps taken by Freeman to report those interactions, and the propriety of Defendant’s response to the alleged harassment.
The next Monday, March 22, Baker used racial slurs while working on the line and Freeman told Kim Wheeler, the Group Leader, to alert Fisher. Wheeler did so. Fisher then called Gamauf again and left another message.
Rather, “[p]rong one of the affirmative defense requires an inquiry that looks behind the face of a policy to determine whether the policy was effective in practice in reasonably preventing and correcting any harassing behavior.” Whirlpool maintained a policy prohibiting racial and sexual harassment that was distributed to employees on a regular basis. That policy had a procedure through which an employee could bring a complaint of harassment to her supervisor, department head, or the Human Resources Department.
Defendant clearly knew about the harassing behavior and therefore had an affirmative duty to correct or prevent the harassment. However, Defendant did not take reasonable care to prevent or correct the harassing behavior. Freeman complained to Fisher for two months before Fisher confronted Baker about his behavior.

560,EE-VA-0141,"On December 19, 2018 two US Airmen under pseudonym and OutServe-SLDN, a network of LGBTQ military service-people, filed suit against the U.S. Department of Defense, James Mattis, and Heather Wilson in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Plaintiffs argued that the U.S had violated equal protection under the fifth amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs represented by Winston and Strawn LLP, LAMBDA Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Outserve-SLDN (now known as the Modern Military Association of America) sought declaratory and injunctive relief allowing HIV positive service members to continue to serve and damages. The Plaintiffs allege that they were discharged from their duties in the Air Force due to their HIV status. The case was assigned to Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.  On January 11, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to  prevent the defendants from restricting Roe and Voe and others similarly situated from being promoted, changing duty station, or re-training on the same terms as other service members living with HIV who are not being separated.  A hearing was held before Judge Brinkema on February 15, 2019. The same day, Judge Brinkema issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.  The order enjoined the defendants from separating or dicharging from military service Richard Roe, Victor Voe, and any other similarly situated active-duty member of the Air Force because they are classified as ineligible for worldwide deployment or deployment to the United States Central Command area due to their HIV-positive status.  The defendants appealed to the decision on the preliminary injunction to the Fourth Circuit.  Oral argument was held on September 18, 2019 before a panel of Fourth Circuit Judges comprised of Judges James A. Wynn Jr, Albert Diaz, and Henry F. Floyd.  In January 2020, the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the district court's decision.  In the district court, both parties have filed motions for summary judgment, and oral argument is set for August 4, 2020.  The case is ongoing.","This case poses federal questions that arise under the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–06. Venue is proper in the Eastern District of Virginia under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e)(1). On information and belief, a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to these claims occurred in this district.
Defendants routinely permit similarly situated individuals who do not have HIV, including but not limited to people with comparable chronic, manageable conditions, to deploy worldwide and to continue to serve. Defendants have determined that Roe and Voe are not worldwide-deployable and, therefore, are to be discharged solely on the basis of their HIV status. Although some individuals living with HIV may qualify under certain statutory schemes as having a disability or as being disabled, discrimination targeting people based on their HIV-positive status warrants a more rigorous degree of scrutiny than was described in City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985).

OutServe-SLDN (OutServe), an organization that works on behalf of the LGBTQ+ and HIV-positive military community, identified four other HIV-positive Air Force servicemembers found unfit for duty and ordered discharged based upon identical reasoning. In December 2018, Plaintiffs filed suit against the Government in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Plaintiffs contended the Air Force’s discharge decisions and the military’s deployment policies violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.
Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the Air Force from discharging them and prohibiting the Air Force and the Department of Defense from enforcing their policies in a manner that limits the deployability of servicemembers diagnosed with HIV. Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction, and the Government moved to dismiss the case. In an opinion dated February 15, 2019, the district court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ motion and denied the Government’s motion.
Dkt No. 34-1. The district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, enjoining the Air Force from discharging active-duty servicemembers because they are classified as ineligible to deploy to CENTCOM’s area of responsibility due to their HIV status.

562,FA-MO-0007,"Private citizens sought an exception to the Affordable Care Act mandate requiring employers to provide contraception coverage on that basis that paying for this insurance plan violated their Catholic religious beliefs. On October 16, 2013, the Eastern District of Missouri (Judge Jean C. Hamilton) dismissed the claim for want of standing, but on July 20, 2015, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for merits decision. Judge Hamilton dismissed all but one of the plaintiff's claims but granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff on that claim, enjoining the defendants from requiring the plaintiffs to pay for contraception through their insurance. The government appealed this determination, but following President Trump's May 4, 2017 executive order directing a change in regulations to allow for conscience-based exceptions to the contraceptive-care mandate, the parties agreed to have the case dismissed. The case is now closed.","The Plaintiffs believe abortion involves gravely immoral practices and the intentional destruction of innocent human life. The Plaintiffs believe that forcing them to provide insurance coverage to their daughters for contraceptives, sterilization and abortifacients and related counseling is a governmental interference with their parental rights and fundamental right to their family’s integrity. The Plaintiffs cannot obtain insurance coverage other than through Mr. Wieland’s employee plan without incurring significantly more expense.
The Plaintiffs, upon information and belief, cannot obtain insurance coverage without coverage for contraceptives, sterilization or abortifacients from any source II. The Affordable Care Act 40. In March 2010, Congress passed and President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub L. 111-148 (March 23, 2010), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Pub L. 111-152 (March 30, 2010), collectively known as the “Affordable Care Act.” 41.
The Plaintiffs’ compliance with these beliefs is a religious exercise.
Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Mandate is neutral. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor the Mandate is generally applicable. Defendants have created categorical exemptions and individualized assessment exemptions to the Mandate.
The Mandate creates government-imposed coercive pressure on the Plaintiffs to change or violate their religious beliefs and practices. The Mandate chills the Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. If the Plaintiffs do not change or violate their religious beliefs and practices, they will have to forfeit their valuable right to employee health insurance or not insure their daughters at all.
Nor have plaintiffs shown that, even if they received the injunction they seek, these third parties would offer Mr. Wieland a health plan that excludes contraceptive coverage. Accordingly, plaintiffs lack standing, and the case should be dismissed. Furthermore, even if plaintiffs had standing, all of their claims are without merit.
The motions are fully briefed and ready for disposition. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs brought this action to challenge regulations issued under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub L. 111-148 (Mar. 23, 2010), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, Pub L. 111-152 (Mar.
Departments of Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Labor and their respective Secretaries (collectively, HHS). The Wielands argue that the district court erred in concluding that they lacked standing to challenge certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) and its implementing regulations, which they allege require them to obtain, and provide to their daughters, healthcare coverage for contraceptives, sterilization, and abortifacients (collectively, contraceptives) in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs. We reverse and remand.
The Wielands claimed that if the requested relief were granted, the State and MCHCP would offer them a healthcare plan without coverage for contraceptives or an opportunity to opt out of such coverage. HHS moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing. According to HHS, the Wielands lacked standing because they were challenging provisions of the ACA that did not apply to them and were seeking an injunction prohibiting HHS from enforcing the Mandate against MCHCP and, ultimately, the State of Missouri, neither of which was a party to the case.
The court also rejected the Wielands’ contention that if it were to enter the requested injunction, a different state statute, Missouri Revised Statutes section 191.724, would require the State and MCHCP to offer a contraceptive-free healthcare plan. Because the district court concluded that the Wielands had not met their burden to establish standing, it dismissed their complaint with prejudice and without reaching the merits. The court also concluded that the Wielands’ failure to establish standing was fatal to their motion for declaratory and injunctive relief, and it denied that motion without further analysis.
We conclude therefore that the Wielands have alleged a sufficient basis on which to conclude that it is “likely” and not merely “speculative” that their injury would be redressed if they were granted the injunctive relief they seek. The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We express no opinion on the merits of the Wielands’ claims.
Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief; specifically, they seek a Court “order prohibiting Defendants from enforcing the Mandate against [them] insofar as it forces them to provide, fund or participate in the provision of [contraceptives].” In October 2013, this Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ Complaint for lack of standing.

563,FA-PA-0016,"On May 17, 2018, the plaintiff, a catholic foster care and social services agency, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the City of Philadelphia. The plaintiffs alleged that the City's decision to stop referring foster care discriminated against them for their religious beliefs and violated their contract, constitutional rights, and state law. On June 13, 2018, Judge Petrese B. Tucker denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction holding that the City of Philadelphia was entitled to suspend the contract for violations of the City Fair Ordinance which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The plaintiffs appealed on the same day, and the Third Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision on April 22, 2020. The case is ongoing, and the Supreme Court granted the plaintiff's petition for writ of certiorari on February 24, 2020. ","One of those agencies, Catholic Social Services (sometimes abbreviated to “CSS”), brought this action claiming that the City has violated its rights under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses, as well as under Pennsylvania’s Religious Freedom Protection Act. It seeks an order requiring the City to renew their contractual relationship while permitting it to turn away same-sex couples who wish to be foster parents. CSS sought preliminary injunctive relief to this effect from the District Court. When it denied the request after a three-day hearing, Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 320 F.Supp.3d 661 (E.D Pa.
Therefore the City could not possibly have breached the contract by suspending referrals. The letter noted several provisions of the contract that, it argued, forbade CSS’s policy of discrimination. After setting out the City’s legal interpretation of the contract, the letter stated its plan going forward: Please also note that CSS’s current contract expires on June 30, 2018, and the City is under no legal obligation to enter into a new contract for any period thereafter.
The hearing, which spanned three days, included testimony from plaintiffs Simms-Busch, Paul, and Fulton, as well as from Amato,5 Deputy Commissioner of Human Services Kimberly Ali, Commissioner Figueroa, and Frank Cervone, a child advocate who testified as an expert witness.6 (It was after this hearing that lawyers for the City informed the Court that it had resumed foster care operations with Bethany Christian when the latter agreed to cease discriminating against same-sex couples.) The District Court denied the application for preliminary injunctive relief in a memorandum opinion, and plaintiffs appealed the same day. They argue to us that the District Court wrongly held that they were not likely to succeed on the merits of their Free Exercise, Establishment Clause, and Freedom-of-Speech claims, as well as under the Pennsylvania Religious Freedom Protection Act. Plaintiffs asked the District Court for injunctive relief pending appeal the following day, which it denied.

Owners can be fined between $50 and $500 per day for violation of the ban, and the Police Chief, Defendant Paul Hatch, has ordered Plaintiffs to leave the City, effectively banishing them from the place they call home. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants' wealth-based banishment scheme. Jurisdiction and Venue 7.
Factual Allegations A. Defendants Banish from the City Those Who Are Too Poor to Live in Homes Worth $7,500 or More 15. On September 12, 2016, the City Council of the City of McCrory passed Ordinance No. 306 (the ""Trailer-Banishment Ordinance"" or the ""Ordinance""), that amended ""Ordinance 151A Regulating Trailers, Mobile Homes, Manufactured Housing, Trailer Parks, and Other Purposes."" The Ordinance stipulates, ""No trailer shall be put in the City of McCrory unless it has a value established by a certified appraiser or a bill of sale of not less than seven thousand five hundred ($7,500.00).
Among the most important, but not the only, common questions of fact are: • Do the City of McCrory and Police Chief Paul Hatch expel residents living in mobile homes worth less than $7,500? • Do the City of McCrory and Police Chief Paul Hatch impose fines upon residents living in mobile homes worth less than $7,500? • Do the City of McCrory and Police Chief Paul Hatch inform residents of McCrory who live in mobile homes worth less than $7,500 that they must leave the City?
Defendants enforce a wealthbased banishment scheme: wealthy residents of McCrory live undisturbed, while the poorest residents are forced to leave or pay exorbitant fines. The Class therefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the City of McCrory and Police Chief Paul Hatch from enforcing the Trailer-Banishment Ordinance. Because the putative Class challenges Defendants' scheme as unconstitutional through declaratory and injunctive relief that would apply the same relief to every Class Member, Rule 23(b)(2) certification is appropriate and necessary.

I, § 21. Plaintiffs challenge McCrory’s Trailer-Banishment Ordinance because it was unconstitutional. Defendants’ wealth-based banishment ordinance (1) violated substantive due process by infringing on Plaintiffs’ fundamental right not to be forcibly expelled from their place of residence; .
Factual Allegations A. Defendants Sought to Banish from the City Those Who Are Too Poor to Live in Homes Worth $7,500 or More 16. On September 12, 2016, the City Council of the City of McCrory passed Ordinance No. 306 (the “Trailer-Banishment Ordinance” or the “Ordinance”), that amended “Ordinance 151A Regulating Trailers, Mobile Homes, Manufactured Housing, Trailer Parks, and Other Purposes.” The Ordinance stipulated, “No trailer shall be put in the City of McCrory unless it has a value established by a certified appraiser or a bill of sale of not less than seven thousand five hundred ($7,500.00).
And they say the complaint fails to state a claim- the ordinance was never enforced against Watlington and Hollaway, so it didn't deprive them of any constitutional right. Although Watlington and Hollaway's request for injunctive relief is moot, they also seek some damages. Ng 25at15-16, 20.

565,FH-DC-0015,"In August 2017, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) abruptly announced it would delay, by two years, a rule designed to allow low-income families greater choice in their housing options.  The Plaintiffs argued that HUD’s failure to implement the rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act, and they sought a preliminary injunction, which was granted. HUD then agreed to implement the rule and paid the Plaintiffs' attorney's fees. ","INTRODUCTION 1. This suit challenges the decision of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to abruptly and unlawfully suspend implementation of its own promulgated rule, the Small Area Fair Market Rent Rule (Small Area FMR Rule). The rule provides that, as of January 1, 2018, tens of thousands of low-income families who participate in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program—families who disproportionally are African-American, Latino, and other racial minorities—can use their housing vouchers to move from poor and racially segregated communities to areas that provide greater opportunity in education, jobs, and more.
By the time HUD completed the rulemaking at issue here, it had considerable experience with the results of using small area FMRs and the mechanics of implementing them. In 2007, the Inclusive Communities Project (ICP) filed a lawsuit against HUD challenging its setting of a single FMR for the 12-county Dallas metropolitan region. ICP alleged that, by fashioning an FMR based on rent data from such a wide area, HUD was effectively steering voucher holders—who, in that area, are predominantly African-American—away from predominantly white areas (where the FMR was inadequate to meet neighborhood market rents) and into predominantly minority areas.
ICP alleged that HUD thus violated the Fair Housing Act and the Housing and Community Development Act. Complaint at 25, 36-37, Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), without notice and comment or particularized evidentiary findings, has delayed almost entirely by two years implementation of a rule requiring over 200 local Public Housing Authorities (“PHAs”) in 24 metropolitan areas, which HUD selected based on fixed, objective criteria, to calculate housing vouchers’ values based on local, rather than metropolitanwide, prevailing market rents. The plaintiffs, two voucher holders and a nonprofit organization devoted to providing housing opportunities for low-income people in Connecticut, move to preliminarily enjoin HUD to implement the rule on January 1, 2018, the rule’s effective date. Pls.’ Mot.
Carter Decl. Hartford’s voucher holders, who are disproportionately nonwhite, are concentrated in poor, racially segregated neighborhoods. Pls.’ Mot., Attach.
The plaintiffs thus have shown likely success on their claims’ merits. HUD Lacked Authority to Delay the Rule’s Implementation. The plaintiffs argue that they likely will succeed on the merits of their claim that HUD’s delay of the Rule is procedurally defective because HUD did not observe the requirements of notice and comment.
Mayo, 875 F.3d at 19 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (alterations omitted)). HUD’s two-year delay of the Rule’s implementation therefore was arbitrary and capricious. As such, the plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits as to their arbitrary and capricious claim, for essentially the same reasons they have shown likely success on the merits as to their notice and comment claim B.

The Defendants' failure to reimburse the workers' money in their first week of work was a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 20 I et seq, (hereinafter ""FLSA""). As a result of these expenditures, the workers earned substantially less than the minimum wage in their first week of work.
All actions and omissions alleged herein were undertaken by Defendants either directly and/or through their agents. The Defendants' failure to pay wages in compliance with the FLSA was willful. COUNT 1: FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT (29 U.S.C. § 216(b) COLLECTIVE ACTION) 57.

This count sets forth a claim for declaratory relief and damages for the Defendants' violations of the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA""). This count is brought by Representative Plaintiffs on behalf of a class of other similarly situated workers consisting of all those individuals admitted as H-2A Pis.

In this case, Plaintiffs’ Complaint sets forth the grounds for the Court’s jurisdiction, (29 U.S.C. § 216(b)(Fair Standards Labor Act), 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. § 1337 (action arising under Acts of Congress regarding commerce), and 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims). It sets forth the claims on which it is seeking relief (breach of contract and violations of the FLSA). It makes a demand for judgment based upon those claims.
The Defendants' failure to reimburse the workers' money in their first week of work was a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.c. § 201 et seq, (hereinafter ""FLSA"").

The Court disagrees. The FLSA authorizes workers to file private actions to recover unpaid wages, damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees. 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).
The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution trumps state law on the issue of liability and immunity for breach of contract. See U.S. Const., Art.
What is the lawsuit about? The individuals who filed the lawsuit claimed that Candy Brand, LLC and the other Defendants violated the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and breached your employment contracts. The lawsuit claims that Candy Brand failed to reimburse H2A workers during their first week of work for the costs of the H-2A visas and the travel from their homes to the United States.
In addition, the lawsuit claims that Candy Brand did not pay H-2A workers properly for their return travel at the end of the season, and did not pay them “subsistence pay” for the days they spent traveling. The lawsuit also claims that Candy Brand did not pay overtime wages to packing shed workers who worked more than 40 hours per week. The Court has already determined that Candy Brand and the other Defendants violated the law with respect to the above claims.
Any submission must be filed no later than Friday, March 16, 2012.

24 STATEMENT OF FACTS 25 25. For many years, Defendants have systematically exploited Plaintiffs and 27 other class members. Defendants required Plaintiffs and other class members to work as many as fourteen hours a day without paying them their lawful overtime wages.
Defendants' policies and practices resulted 6 in a series of schemes aimed at compelling Plaintiffs and other class members to work longer hours and produce more, for less pay, all the while preventing them from 8 exercising or demanding their workplace rights. Defendants required Plaintiffs and other class members to work in excess 10 of eight hours per day and in excess of forty hours per week without overtime pay and, 11 in some cases, without any payment of wages.

The lawsuit seeks changes to ICE and Facility policies; it does not ask for money damages. Class Counsel (representing the interests of detainees in the Facilities) and ICE’s attorneys have negotiated a settlement. The Court has given preliminary approval to this settlement, and the next step is for the Court to consider any comments and objections from class members.
ICE will have one year after the Court finally approves the Settlement to make the required changes. The Settlement will be in effect for four years after that. During this time, ICE must provide information to Class Counsel to monitor and enforce the Settlement, including providing various documents and allowing Class Counsel to visit the Facilities to interview detainees.

Specifically, the lawsuit asserted that ICE is violating the statutory and constitutional rights of immigration detainees because the telephone access conditions in the Facilities: (1) prevent detainees from retaining and communicating effectively with lawyers, and (2) prevent detainees from gathering evidence to present in immigration-related proceedings. The parties reached a settlement that the Court has approved. Description of the Settlement Agreement Below is a summary of the key points in the settlement agreement.

574,IM-CA-0167,"This case was filed in response to the July 6, 2020 directive by ICE that would effectively force international students studying under F-1 and M-1 visas to attend in-person classes or risk deportation. The state of California filed this suit against ICE and DHS on July 9, arguing that the directive was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in two ways. First, the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to take into account students' and universities' reliance interests and the defendants gave no reasoned basis for the new order. Second, the defendants were in violation of procedural elements of the APA, because they failed to use proper notice-and-comment rule-making when issuing the new order.

On July 15, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance and as a result, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. California continued to monitor the alterations ICE made to its website between July and September and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on October 19, 2020. ","Defendant

PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in its favor, 10 and grant the following relief: 1.
Issue a declaration that the rescission of the in-person learning exemption for F-1 12 and M-1 students is in violation of the APA; 2. Set aside the rescission of the in-person learning exemption for F-1 and M-1 14 students under 5 U.S.C. § 706; 3. Enjoin Defendants from rescinding the March 13 Guidance and imposing and 16 enforcing in-person learning requirements on F-1 and M-1 students for the duration of the 17 COVID-19 pandemic; and 4.
First, both actions are based on the same events and the same (or similar) legal theories against all of the same defendants.
On July 9, 2020, the State filed suit, on behalf of the California Community Colleges and the California State University, alleging that the rescission of the in- person learning exemption for F-1 and M-1 visa students in the July 6 Directive violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), because (1) the rescission of the March 13 Guidance is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, and (2) the rescission of the March 13 Guidance is an agency action subject to notice and comment rulemaking, which Defendants failed to undertake. On July 10, 2020, The Regents filed suit, as the corporation authorized and empowered to administer the University of California and its ten campuses, alleging that the rescission of the in-person learning exemption for F-1 visa students in the July 6 Directive violates the APA on the same or similar grounds. Both cases name as defendants U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), ICE, Acting Secretary of DHS Chad F. Wolf, and Acting Director of ICE Matthew Albence.

Kurlan (See above for address) LEAD ATTORNEY ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED","On July 6, 2020, the State of California filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of California against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE. The State alleged that the rescission of the in-person learning exemption for F-1 and M-1 visa students in the July 6 Directive violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, and is an agency action subject to notice and comment rulemaking, which Defendants failed to undertake.

On March 30, 2012, the District Court ordered DHS to provide adequate description of the exempted information in response to the FOIA request so that AILA could make a proper segregability determination.  This was the last action in this case.","represented by Seth A. Watkins STEPTOE &JOHNSON, LLP 1330 Connecticut Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20036 (202) 429−3000 Fax: (202) 429−3902 Email: sethwatkins@steptoe.com LEAD ATTORNEY ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED
The reliability and fairness of an adjudication process—especially in an area with such great importance as immigration—can only be evaluated if the procedures and actions of the government agency are transparent. To this end, AILA filed two FOIA requests with USCIS seeking detailed information relating to the current procedures for reviewing and adjudicating H-1B cases. The public interest in these procedures is particularly high because the aforementioned recent measures implemented by USCIS concerning H-1B petitions have caused confusion and concern among U.S. businesses that legitimately depend on temporary foreign workers with specialized knowledge in order to operate successfully.
The FOIA requests lodged by AILA seek to obtain records of particular importance in educating businesses, foreign workers, the bar, and the public at large concerning compliance with the H-1B rules, regulations, and associated law. This action concerns the failure of DHS and its component USCIS to release requested records under FOIA. PLAINTIFF’S FOIA REQUESTS AND DEFENDANTS’ FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FOIA First FOIA Request 19.
See Attachment 5.
In particular, AILA appealed the withholding of the six pages of responsive record(s) from disclosure by USCIS and DHS. AILA also challenged (i) the adequacy of the search for records responsive to the First FOIA Request, (ii) the failure to segregate non-exempt information from allegedly exempt information, and (iii) the alleged applicability of the cited FOIA exemptions to the records sought. AILA has not received any written acknowledgment from USCIS and DHS concerning its administrative appeal with respect to the First FOIA Request.
USCIS and DHS have failed to disclose any records in response to the First FOIA Request. Records responsive to the First FOIA Request that should have been disclosed by defendants include, but are not limited to: (1) field guidance to agency adjudicators instructing them to issue Requests for Evidence and (2) an H-1B Petition Fraud Referral Sheet.
Attachment 9.
In particular, AILA appealed the withholding of the responsive record from disclosure by USCIS and DHS. AILA also challenged the alleged applicability of the cited FOIA exemptions to the record sought. By letter dated February 18, 2010, which assigned the appeal case number APP2009000743, USCIS and DHS denied AILA’s administrative appeal and affirmed the “total denial” decision with respect to the Second FOIA Request.
Attachment 10. USCIS and DHS have failed to disclose any records in response to the Second FOIA Request. The record responsive to the Second FOIA Request that should have been disclosed by defendants is the Compliance Review Worksheet.
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AMERICAN IMMIGRATION LAWYERS ASSOCIATION Plaintiff, v Civ.

MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff American Immigration Lawyers Association (“AILA” or “plaintiff”) brings this action against the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, a DHS subdivision (“USCIS” collectively, “defendants”) under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), seeking the release of information withheld by the USCIS. Pending before the Court are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.
See id. The request for expedited processing was denied. Defs.’ SMF 13.
Docket No. 13. Plaintiff challenged, among other things, the adequacy of defendants’ searches. When the USCIS reviewed plaintiff’s summary judgment filing, it determined it may have missed documents potentially relevant to plaintiff’s requests.
In its motion, AILA alleges that USCIS improperly invoked exemption 7(E) as to several documents that were produced with redactions, and that USCIS has waived any ability to withhold the documents because they are in the public domain. Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, asking the Court to determine that they satisfied their obligations under FOIA as to all documents produced or withheld, that they properly invoked exemptions, and that they did not waive its ability to invoke the exemptions because of information that exists in the public domain II.

576,IM-DC-0021,Central American mothers and children detainees brought suit against the Department of Homeland Security and its various agencies for the government's unlawful expedited removal policies at the Artesia Family Residential Center. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case in January 2015 after DHS remedied the violations of Plaintiffs' rights in their immigration proceedings and closed the Artesia facility.,"JURISDICTION AND VENUE 10. This case arises under the United States Constitution; the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.; the regulations implementing the INA’s asylum process; and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. 11. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).
For purposes of habeas jurisdiction, all individual Plaintiffs are in custody because they are either subject to orders of removal and/or presently detained at the Artesia Family Residential Center in Artesia, New Mexico. Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A) requires that all § 1252(e)(3) actions be brought in the District Court for the District of Columbia. In addition, venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District.
8 U.S.C. § 1225 et seq. (setting forth the expedited removal system). In particular, this case concerns the government’s creation of a new, revised expedited removal system for use in cases involving recently arrived Central American families. As enacted by Congress, the expedited removal system involves a more streamlined process than regular INA § 240 removal proceedings and is reserved for people apprehended at or near the border.
Plaintiff R.E.C.G. represented by Arthur B. Spitzer (See above for address) LEAD ATTORNEY ATTORNEY TO BE NOTICED
The judge further stated that “gangs are not a reason for [them] to stay,” and then proceeded to tell Ms. B.C.M. that she was going to be deported. The judge also repeatedly interrupted Ms. B.C.M.
Moreover, Defendants’ new policies and procedures also seek to deter mothers and children from even applying for asylum in the first instance. Prior to their detention at Artesia, Plaintiffs and other Central American asylum seekers were detained by CBP. Agents of CBP have applied coercion to dissuade Plaintiffs and other asylum seekers from seeking legal counsel and otherwise asserting their rights through the legal process.
As another detained mother summed up the situation: “Officers control when you can use the telephone and even when I was able to use the telephone, they would cut me off after three or five minutes.” All of the Plaintiffs have been subject to such restrictions on their phone use. Indeed, earlier this week, an immigration officer forced Plaintiff M.S.P.C.
On multiple occasions, her attorney added her to the list of detainees whose attorneys sought to meet with them, yet ICE failed to produce Ms. R.E.C.G. for those meetings. These restrictive policies have prevented many mothers from meeting with volunteer attorneys and, even worse, discouraged them from believing that an attorney would be able to help them.
Civil Action No. 14-1437-ABJ Plaintiffs’ Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Pursuant to Rules 41(a)(1)(A)(i) and 41(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs submit this notice of voluntary dismissal of all claims, without prejudice, in the above captioned case. On August 22, 2014, Plaintiffs initiated this case to challenge the federal government’s unlawful expedited removal policies at the Artesia Family Residential Center. Plaintiffs are Central American mothers and children who are fleeing persecution in their home countries.

At the hearing, defendants represented that they had provided or would soon provide certain of the information requested. The Court therefore held the application for a TRO in abeyance and suggested that the parties meet and confer and provide a joint status report to the Court. The parties provided that joint status report [Dkt No. 26] on July 5, 2018 and represented that they had resolved several issues pertaining to the application, but that some matters were still outstanding.
BACKGROUND A. Factual History On April 6, 2018, the Attorney General of the United States announced a “zero-tolerance” immigration policy, under which all immigrant parents unlawfully crossing the United States-Mexico border with their young children would be subject to criminal prosecution and separated from their children. See Compl Exs.
The Executive Order did not, however, address the reunification of the more than 2,000 children whom the government had already separated from their parents. Plaintiffs in this action are three immigrant parents who were separated from their young children after crossing the United States-Mexico border prior to the issuance of the Executive Order on June 20, 2018. Subsequent to the filing of this lawsuit, two of the plaintiffs, M.G.U.
and A.P.F., were recently reunified with their children after spending many weeks apart.

Order Regarding Removal. Meanwhile, on June 26, 2018, Judge Dana M.

The complaint alleges that in preventing a Syrian national with a valid U.S. visa from returning to the U.S. pursuant to the EO, the defendants violated the First Amendment Establishment Clause, Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and international law. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. 

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and Bernard Harcourt of Columbia Law School, is a resident in the University of Illinois Chicago/Advocate Christ Hospital. He returned to the United Arab Emirates to get married on Jan. 23, and upon returning to the U.S. to continue his residency, he was detained at Abu Dhabi International Airport on Jan 29. Despite his valid visa, he was detained pursuant to the EO. If the plaintiff cannot return to the U.S., he faces the risk of being deported to Syria, where he is a citizen but has never been a resident. 

That same day, the plaintiff also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.

The case was assigned to Judge Elaine Bucklo.  At a status hearing on February 1, the parties told the judge they had reached a ""settlement in principle.""

On February 2, the plaintiff successfully entered the United States at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. On February 8, the plaintiff filed a motion for voluntary dismissal and leave to reinstate on or before August 1, 2017. Judge Bucklo granted this motion and terminated the case.

This court has further remedial authority pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq. 2. Venue properly lies within the Northern District of Illinois because Dr. Al Homssi works and resides in Oak Lawn, Illinois.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) is an agency within DHS with the primary mission of detecting and preventing the unlawful entry of persons and goods into the United States. Defendant John Kelly is the Secretary of DHS.
He is sued in his official capacity. Defendant Kevin K. McAleenan is the Acting Commissioner of CBP.
Defendant Donald Trump is the President of the United States.
Most relevant to the instant action is Section 3(c) of the EO, in which President Trump proclaims “that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,” and that he is therefore “suspend[ing] entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order,” with narrow exceptions not relevant here. According to the terms of the EO, therefore, the “entry into the United States” of non-citizens from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen is “suspended” from 90 days from the date of the EO. Plaintiff 16.
Plaintiff Amer Al Homssi is a 24-year-old citizen of Syria, who is married, with no children.

This is a human trafficking case brought by workers from India who were trafficked into the State of Mississippi. Defendants collectively engaged in a scheme to defraud Plaintiffs out of tens of thousands of dollars and, in the wake ofa devastating hurricane in the Gulf Coast region, unlawfully turned them into an exploitable source of cheap labor.
Plaintiffs traveled to the United States in late 2006 and were horrified by what they saw when they reached Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Their living conditions were deplorable. Signal forced them into overcrowded trailers in a fenced-in property with armed guards preventing visitors and carefully monitoring the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs were not permitted to opt out of the room and board provided by Signal; it was deducted from their pay even if they lived or ate elsewhere. The work conditions were no better. Signal supervisors verbally abused Plaintiffs and derided them for their race and alienage.
On information and belief, Pol was at all relevant times the sole corporate officer of Global. Pol and Global Resources, Inc. are alter egos. Global and Pol will be referred to collectively below as ""Pol,"" unless a distinction is drawn between them.
Each of the Plaintiffs was assigned to work at Signal's fabrication facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and to live in a nearby ""man camp"" built in the fall of2006 specifically for the Indian workers. Signal employees and management referred to the Pascagoula man camp as ""the Reservation."" They discussed among themselves, including in written email communication, that housing the workers in a secluded man camp on the outskirts of town was preferable, since it would keep the Indians segregated from the rest of the Pascagoula, Mississippi community.
Those who did eat often were served rotten food or food riddled with insects. Plaintiffs also were required to bring food from the mess hall for their lunches at Signal's Pascagoula facility. However, because the workers had to leave for work very early in the morning, their already rotting food would sit and bake in the Mississippi heat for several hours before they had the opportunity to eat it, by which time it was completely spoiled and inedible.
Some of the workers came into contact with locals residents who offered to accommodate them in better conditions for a fraction of the cost. However, Signal refused to allow this, claiming that they could not provide transportation to work to those who did not live at the camp. Signal's official response to the complaints was to inform Plaintiffs that if they tried to live outside the camps, Signal would continue to deduct $35 per day from their paychecks.
Defendants threatened not to extend Plaintiffs' H-2B visas, not to sponsor Plaintiffs for green cards, to deport Plaintiffs, and to send them back to India if they complained about conditions at Signal, and also deceived Plaintiffs about the terms of their immigration status, each in a manner that constitutes an abuse ofthe legal process under 18 U.S.C. § 1589(3). Defendants retaliated against Plaintiffs when they sought legal advice regarding their rights and immigration status. Defendants knowingly recruited, transported, harbored, provided, and/or obtained the Plaintiffs so as to procure their labor and services in violation of laws prohibiting peonage, involuntary servitude, and forced labor within the meaning of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1590.

580,IM-NY-0052,"In 2015, six refugees living in Utica, NY filed this class action in the Northern District of New York against the Utica School District Board of Education and the Utica City School District. The plaintiffs alleged that that the defendants consistently denied Utica residents between the ages of 17 and 20 who were limited English proficient (LEP) and immigrants access to educational opportunity. In 2016, the parties reached a settlement requiring the defendants to end their discriminatory practices and enact a detailed remedial plan. Enforcement of the consent decree is ongoing as of November 2018.","Index No. 15-cv-488 (TJM)(TWD) AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This action challenges the Defendants’ policy and practice of excluding limited English proficient (“LEP”) immigrants aged 17-20 from Thomas R. Proctor High School (“Proctor High School”) in Utica, N.Y. This action is brought on behalf of six refugees, Patrick Tuyizere, Suk Maya Rai, BBT by her parent and natural guardian Birkha Bolon, Ali JaNar, Cho Cho Win, and Ado Lar, and a class of similarly situated individuals.
In the 1990s, the Bhutanese military forcibly expelled the Lhotshampa people, including BBT’s parents and grandparents, from Bhutan because the Lhotshampa people refused to give up their language and customs. BBT’s native language is Nepali. She is not proficient in the English language.
Before he was born, his family fled Myanmar to escape ethnic persecution by the Myanmar military. Ado’s native language is Burmese. He is not proficient in the English language.
Alternative Programs Change, But Defendants’ Discriminatory Practice Stays the Same 67. In 2013, the Defendants disclaimed responsibility for the Newcomer Program. They transferred the Newcomer Program’s ESL teachers to elementary schools operated by the District and stopped providing any instructional services to students in the Newcomer Program, leaving approximately 60 students to fend for themselves.
Defendants’ discriminatory treatment of immigrant students on the basis of national origin extends beyond Proctor High School. Defendants also exclude immigrants from the District’s GED program. Indeed, the teacher for the District’s GED program, Joseph Mootz, has said that he will not take refugee or immigrant students in the District’s GED class and he takes his orders from Superintendent Karam, a defendant in this action, who is responsible for overseeing enrollment policies for the Utica schools.
All four requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied: (a) Numerosity: Joinder of all class members is impracticable because of the size of the class. There are approximately 55 LEP immigrant students aged 17-20 enrolled in the Newcomer Program and APPLE Program who have been unlawfully excluded from Proctor High School. (b) Commonality: There are questions of law and fact common to all members of the class, including, but not limited to, whether the Defendants discriminate against LEP immigrants aged 17-20 by excluding them from high school and diverting them to alternative education programs.
This Court has authority to award costs and attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. Venue is proper in the Northern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). All the events described in this complaint occurred in the Northern District of New York.

This is a third party action brought to recover monetary damages against the named Third Party Defendant for whatever monetary damages, if any, that are assessed to the Third Party Plaintiffs in the main action.

581,IM-NY-0082,"In 2020, two immigration detainees in the Batavia Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, NY, filed this class action in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. Plaintiffs claimed that they and others similarly situated had been improperly denied bond, that non-bond alternatives to detention had not been properly considered by their immigration judges, that such considerations were required by the Immigration and Nationality Act, and that the policy of placing the burden of proof on the Plaintiffs to show they posed no flight risk violated their Fifth Amendment Rights. The court granted relief for pre-hearing detainees, agreeing that they pled sufficient facts to state a Due Process Claim that the government is required to bear the burden of proof at bond hearings for individuals detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1226(a). It denied Plaintiffs' request to certify the putative post-hearing class.

Once denied bond, people with cases at the Batavia and Buffalo Immigration Courts can be detained for months, sometimes years, before a final decision is reached on whether they are, in fact, removable. Detention is devastating for detained individuals and their families. Most people arrested by local immigration authorities have lived in this country for long periods with their families and are deeply integrated into local communities.

On May 7, 2017, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed this suit seeking a declaratory judgment approving SB4.

CIVIL ACTION NO: 1:17-CV-00425-SS MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS BY DEFENDANTS CITY OF EL CENIZO, TEXAS, RAUL L. REYES, MAVERICK COUNTY, TOM SCHMERBER, AND MARIO A. HERNANDEZ Defendants City of El Cenizo, Texas, Raul L. Reyes, Maverick County, Tom Schmerber, and Mario A. Hernandez (“the El Cenizo parties”) move to dismiss Texas’s First Amended Complaint pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 12(b)(1). Immediately after SB 4 was signed, Texas filed this suit. Its barefaced attempt to outrun the lawsuits it anticipated, and thus upend the ordinary rule that plaintiffs—not governmental entities—decide the forum for challenges to statutes, fails.
Such requests for advisory opinions would be anathema to the constraints on federal judicial power. This case should be dismissed. Texas lacks standing, because it asserts no concrete harm.
However, there could be a darker desire in filing this suit by Texas, the elimination of dissent. Texas began this lawsuit by suing the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. And, now, it has enlarged this suit to include other nonprofits like the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund.
Before the passage of any redistricting bill, the staff of the Speaker of the House met with and advised a litigant on filing suit against the State of Texas to try and control any ensuing redistricting litigation pursuant to the first filed rule. This attempt failed as the suit was dismissed. If this Court allows Texas to move forward with this suit, then it can expect many more suits to be pre-emptively filed by Texas and many other jurisdictions in the very near term.
ROA.641. The district court granted the motions to dismiss. ROA.644.
Instead, however, the challenges were consolidated in the other venue, where they have made significant progress, including hundreds of pages of briefing on the merits, an all-day evidentiary hearing, a 94-page decision by the district court, and an appeal to this Court. The district court properly dismissed Texas’s unusual suit. Under binding Supreme Court precedent, federal district courts lack statutory jurisdiction over suits by States seeking preemptive declarations that state regulations comply with federal law.
See SB4 § 7.02. This Lawsuit. Governor Abbott signed SB4 into law on Sunday evening, May 7.
ROA.428, 449, 545. The defendants in Texas’s declaratory case moved to dismiss, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction and, in any event, should dismiss in its discretion. ROA.571-74, 60609.
The Decision Below. The district court, per Judge Sam Sparks, dismissed this case for lack of jurisdiction on August 9, 2017. ROA.635-45.
Argument I. Congress Has Granted Subject-Matter Jurisdiction to Hear This Case Because It Is an Action Arising Under Federal Law. The district court dismissed this action based on an alleged lack of standing, not a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. ROA.640-44.

The plaintiffs in this case argued that their case was distinguishable from <i>Florence</i>. However, no further action occurred in the case after 2012.  ","INTRODUCTION This is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants of rights secured to the Plaintiffs and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States of America. For the past several years, the Erie County Sheriff’s Departmem has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who emer either the Erie County Holding Center and/or the Erie County Correctional Facility, regardless of the crime upon which they are charged. Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from the written procedures of the Erie County Sheriff’s Department, and was promulgated by senior Department officials; specifically, Defendants Sheriff Patrick Gallivan, Undersheriff Timothy Howard, Acting Superintendent Daniel J. Livingston, Deputy Superintendent Robert Huggins, and Superintendent H. McCarthy Gibson.

BACKGROUND As the parties are well aware, this case is a putative class action (see Docket No. 131) asserted by three individuals who were detained by the Erie County Sheriff in either the Erie County Holding Center or the Erie County Correctional Facility. Plaintiffs allege that they were strip searched without individualized suspicion while in the County Defendants’ custody. Pertinent to this motion, plaintiffs obtained in discovery several e-mails sent by former Assistant County Attorney Kristin Machelor to individual defendants and other Sheriff’s Department officials regarding the Sheriff’s Department’s evolving policies regarding inmate strip searches.
Defendants then sought mandamus review by the Second Circuit, and in the meantime moved to stay the application of the order directing production of the disputed e-mails pending appellate court review. Both this court and a motions panel of the Second Circuit denied defendants’ request for a stay pending appeal, resulting in the release of the ten disputed e-mail communications to the plaintiffs. The Second Circuit subsequently took up the mandamus petition and granted the writ, finding that the petition raised the following issue of first impression: “whether the attorney-client privilege protects communications that pass between a government lawyer having no policymaking authority and a public official, where those communications assess the legality of a policy and propose alternative policies in that light.”
The strip search regimen put in place by the Erie County Sheriff’s Department falls squarely within the confines of the Florence decision, with one major exception. Specifically, Erie County only strip searched individuals that were admitted into the Erie County Holding Center (“ECHC”) and Erie County Correctional Facility (“ECCF”) after they had been arraigned and held for a significant period of time to enable them to post bail. The strip searches in question were done when individuals entered the general jail population, similar to those addressed in Florence.

By statute, a National Security Letter may include a requirement that the recipient not disclose the fact that it has received such a request. In this case, recipients of National Security Letters alleged that the nondisclosure requirement violates their First Amendment rights. The panel held that § 2709(c)’s nondisclosure requirement imposes a content-based restriction that is subject to, and withstands, strict scrutiny.
However, with respect to the 2013 NSLs to CREDO, the district court held that the government’s certification that one of the four enumerated harms would IN RE NATIONAL SECURITY LETTER result absent nondisclosure was insufficient. Accordingly, it granted CREDO’s petition to set aside the nondisclosure requirement in the 2013 NSLs.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 8. This action arises under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 USC § 552. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter pursuant to 5 USC § 552(a)(4)(B).
2 Ian Traynor, “Angela Merkel: NSA Spying on allies is not on,” The Guardian (Oct. 24, 2013). The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has ruled that the NSA’s bulk collection and storage of telephone metadata is consistent with both the Fourth Amendment and Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. In re application of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for an order requiring the production of tangible things from [REDACTED], No. BR 13-109 (F.I.S.C.
Each of the documents referred to in this Complaint is incorporated herein by reference. Defendants have violated FOIA by improperly withholding the requested records. Defendants have violated FOIA by failing to conduct an adequate search.
Defendants have violated FOIA by failing to grant Mr. Leopold’s requests for a fee waiver.
37 Mr. Leopold has been and will continue to be irreparably harmed until Defendants are ordered to produce the requested records.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: (1) Declare Defendant’s failure to comply with FOIA to be unlawful; . (2) Declare that Plaintiff is entitled to a fee waiver under FOIA; . (3) Order Defendant to process the requested records without further delay and release all nonexempt portions to Plaintiff without charging Plaintiff fees; .

Civil Action No. 14-cv-805 (TSC) MEMORANDUM OPINION In March 2014, Plaintiff Jason Leopold submitted two Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests seeking records related to surveillance of federal and state judges – one to the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and one to the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (“OLC” and, together with NSA, “Defendants”). Both agencies indicated that they had no records responsive to the FOIA requests, prompting Plaintiff to initiate this litigation. In July 2015, this court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ first motion for summary judgment, finding that Defendants had failed to conduct an adequate search and to adequately explain the basis for their search in certain limited respects.
Among other things, the court ordered OLC to reprocess Plaintiff’s FOIA request by searching for draft memoranda and legal opinions related to surveillance of federal and state judges.
Agency, 118 F. Supp. The July 2015 Memorandum Opinion ordered that two additional searches be conducted and that certain other information be provided to Plaintiff. See id.
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, et al., Defendants. Civil Action No. 14-cv-805 (TSC) MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Jason Leopold submitted two FOIA requests seeking records related to surveillance of federal and states judges—one to the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and one to the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (“OLC”). Both agencies indicated they had no records responsive to Leopold’s requests.
While the court agrees with Defendants on most of the issues raised by Leopold, the court finds that on a small number of issues, Defendants have failed to conduct an adequate search or failed to adequately explain the basis for their search. As a result, Defendants’ motion is granted in part and denied in part. BACKGROUND In March 2014, Leopold submitted two similar FOIA requests to NSA and OLC.
(Colborn Decl Ex. OLC responded the next month and stated that a search of its files located no records responsive to the request. Leopold appealed this determination, and the administrative appeal remained pending at the time Leopold filed this suit.

590,NS-DC-0105,"On September 16, 2016, The Associated Press, Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC, and Vice Media, LLC, filed a lawsuit seeking information about the recently purchased tool allowing government access to the phone of one of the perpetrators of the mass killings in San Bernardino, California on December 2, 2015. The Court granted the defendant's summary judgment motion on September 30, 2017, finding information at issue was protected under FOIA exemptions 1, 3, and 7.","Case No. 16-cv-1850 COMPLAINT Plaintiffs The Associated Press (“AP”), Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC d/b/a USA TODAY (”USA TODAY”), and Vice Media, LLC (“Vice”) (together, “News Organizations”), by and through their undersigned attorneys, allege: 1. This action is brought pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 552, et seq., for basic contracting information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) regarding one of its most publicly-discussed and controversial acquisitions: a technological tool openly purchased from a third-party vendor that was used to circumvent the need for a court order to access the locked iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the perpetrators of the mass killings in San Bernardino, California Mr. Farook and his wife were both killed in the attack, appear to have acted alone, and investigators long ago stated that they had uncovered no connection between the shooters and any foreign terrorist groups.1 The News Organizations seek injunctive and other appropriate relief, including release of agency records from the FBI. More specifically, through this action, the News Organizations seek to compel the FBI to provide records of the publicly-acknowledged business transaction that resulted in the purchase this March of the so-called iPhone access tool.
Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). The News Organizations each have exhausted all administrative remedies available in regard to the requests at issue. The FBI denied each of the News Organizations’ timely-filed administrative appeals in their entirety, and therefore the News Organizations are entitled to seek judicial review of those denials pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).
When Apple declined, the FBI took the unique step of obtaining a federal court order under the All Writs Act directing the company to assist the agency in obtaining access to the phone. When Apple again refused, the Government moved to compel Apple to do so. See Government’s Motion to Compel Apple to Comply, In the Matter of the Search of an Apple iPhone Seized During the Execution of a Search Warrant on a Black Lexus IS300, California License Plate 35KGD203, No. 5:16-cm-10-SP (“All Writs Act Proceeding”) (C.D Cal Feb.
The USA TODAY Request 20. On March 29, 2016, the day after the All Writs Act Order was vacated, USA TODAY reporter Brad Heath filed a FOIA request (the “USA TODAY Request”) with the FBI seeking “[c]omplete copies of any records memorializing agreements or expenditures to the ‘outside party’ that assisted the FBI in unlocking Syed Rizwan Farook’s iPhone.” The USA TODAY Request sought only the agreements or expenditure records themselves, not the actual content of the purchased technology.
On June 6, 2016, the FBI denied the USA TODAY Request. The FBI stated that it had located responsive records, but that it would withhold those records from disclosure. Specifically, the FBI cited FOIA Exemption 7(A), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A), which permits agencies to withhold “records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information … could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.”

The FBI is an agency subject to FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(f), and therefore must disclose in response to a FOIA request all responsive records in its possession at the time of the Request that are not specifically exempt from disclosure under FOIA, and must provide a lawful reason for withholding any records as to which it is claiming an exemption. The News Organizations have exhausted all administrative remedies, having filed administrative appeals that were denied. The News Organizations are therefore entitled to seek judicial review of those denials pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).

Plaintiff seeks an injunction requiring defendants to return or destroy any of plaintiff’s unconstitutionally seized telephone calls, emails, or text messages, or information derived therefrom, that defendants continue to retain, and prohibiting any use or disclosure of those communications and information. Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the provisions of the Patriot Act and FISA which permit the federal government to secretly collect, disseminate, and retain information from a person and which allow one to perform electronic surveillance and wiretaps of a person without first demonstrating to a court the existence of probable cause that the person has committed a crime are unconstitutional.

The ACLU seeks to compel the release of records describing the operation and 26 Organization File (“VGTOF”) maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), a 27 component of Defendant, DOJ.
PARTIES 24 7. Plaintiff ACLU is a Seattle, Washington based civil liberties organization. The ACLU 26 seeks access to these records in order to understand how the FBI is using the NCIC VGTOF as a 27 law enforcement tool and whether it is doing so in a manner consistent with civil liberties.
Defendant’s failure to comply with 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) amounts to a 6 constructive denial of Plaintiff’s acknowledged request. The FBI has wrongfully withheld the requested records from Plaintiff. CAUSE OF ACTION Defendant DOJ Failed to Disclose and Release Records Responsive to Plaintiff’s Request 12 23.

When plaintiff did not respond – 8 plaintiff maintains that it never received the notification letter – defendant put plaintiff’s FOIA 9 request aside without addressing plaintiff’s application for a waiver of fees. In May 2009, plaintiff filed this action to compel production of the requested 11 documents.

595,PB-FL-0012,"Jacqueline Jones filed this lawsuit challenging Florida's failure to provide her with sufficient home care services via the Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury Medicaid waiver. Although she sought to expand her case to represent a class of plaintiffs, the state began providing her with appropriate services after her lawsuit was filed and she agreed to a voluntary dismissal.  ","Affidavit of Kristen Russell. Because the named plaintiff‟s case became moot prior to certification of the class2, the action is moot and must be dismissed. This Court should dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and (6), Fed R Civ. P.. 4.
Plaintiff contends that both the ADA and Rehab Act require the provision of personal care services. This is not the case. Title II of the ADA states that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”

See Settlement, attached as Exhibit B. This Settlement was approved by the Court and the Court dismissed the action with prejudice pursuant to the Settlement‟s terms on January 4, 2007. See Order of Dismissal with Prejudice, attached as Exhibit C.
In Zeidman, the defendant made a tender of relief to the named plaintiffs after they filed for class status, but before the district court‟s final certification decision. The district court dismissed the action based on defendant‟s argument that Article III standing required a named plaintiff to maintain individual standing until the class is certified. The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that under the circumstances presented a district court‟s decision to certify a class could “relate back” to the filing of the motion for class certification Id.
Second, this is not a case in which Defendants would have to create “new” services for Miss Jones or class members. Defendants currently provide the personal care services both in nursing homes and in the community. As such, the provision of in-home personal care services would not fundamentally alter Defendants‟ program by forcing them to develop a new service for Miss Jones.
Plaintiff claims that Defendants’ failure to provide in-home services through the Medicaid program constitutes unlawful discrimination under both the ADA and the Rehab Act. On December 29, 2003, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and because the claims are barred by issue or claim preclusion. In brief: (1) the named Plaintiff’s case is moot as she is already in the process of being enrolled in the in the Traumatic Brain Injury Spinal Cord Injury Medicaid Waiver Program (TBI/SCI Waiver Program); . (2) the mooting of the named Plaintiff’s claim prior to the filing of a motion to certify the class renders the entire action moot; .
In the instant case, the named Plaintiff has no justiciable claims. The Defendants are in the process of assessing her needs in order to enroll her in the TBI/SCI Waiver Program pending a determination of her eligibility. See December 18, 2009, Affidavit of Kristen Russell (Docket number 24).
The United States also has a substantial interest in ensuring that recipients of federal financial assistance, such as the defendant, do not violate Section 504’s similar prohibition of disability discrimination. The private lawsuit was filed on December 2, 2009, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, on behalf of Jacqueline Jones, a 35-year old woman with quadriplegia, who alleged that the State of Florida failed to provide her with home and community-based services. The denial of community-based services put her at risk of institutionalization in violation of title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.2 Shortly after filing the Complaint on behalf of the individual plaintiff, the Complaint was amended to include class claims.
41, App A. The central issues of this case are critical to the Department of Justice’s efforts to advance national goals of community integration and enforce the civil rights of persons with disabilities. Thus, the United States’ interest in the pending litigation merits intervention as of right.
State participation in Medicaid is voluntary, but once a state elects to participate in the Medicaid program, it is required to administer the Medicaid program in accordance with all federal laws, including the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. 14. Florida participates in the Medicaid program. One source estimates that for each dollar that Florida has spent in 2010 on services in the Medicaid program, it received $2.09 in federal funding.
There are no other parties to this case, and no determination has been made as to whether this is a viable class action. All parties stipulate that the dismissal of the class allegations is without prejudice. All parties will be resp onsible for bearing their own fees and costs related to the class allegations.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED: 1. This case is DISMISSED without prejudice. Each party shall bear its own fees and costs.

Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they have standing or that the action is ripe. Accordingly, the action is DISMISSED without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. BACKGROUND A.
Because Act 267 amended the Civil Unions Law retroactively to add an immunity provision the absence of which formed the primary basis of the alleged constitutional infirmity of Act 1 the Complaint as written no longer constitutes a live controversy. In short, the Complaint is moot. See, e.g., Montana Wilderness Ass’n, Nine Quarter Circle Ranch v. U.S. Forest Serv., 655 F.2d 951, 958 (9th Cir.

598,PB-IL-0001,Plaintiffs filed this class action against the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services in 1989 in the U.C. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois claiming that the agency failed to provide services to assure family unification and instead removed children from parents and guardians who were unable to provide food or shelter. The case resulted in a Consent Decree whereby the agency agreed to assist families in obtaining housing and food assistance.,"Workers for intact families may be assigned no more than twenty families, while permanency services workers are expected to handle no more than twenty-five children at a time. Norman v. Suter is a class action suit involving DCFS that was settled by consent order in March 1991. The class was defined as all parents and guardians on or after March 91 whose children were in the temporary custody or under legal guardianship of DCFS with an indicated report or allegations that the children suffered adequate living conditions for their children.
THE DECREE AND SUBSEQUENT IMPLEMENTATION ORDERS 1. The Decree was approved by the Court on March 28, 1991, 1. The Decree was approved by the Court on March 28, 1991, after extensive litigation.
See Norman v. Johnson, 739 F Supp.
Subsequent to the approval of the Consent Decree after a fairness hearing, Jeanine Smith was selected as monitor Ms. Smith is a child welfare expert with extensive credentials, including background working in the DCFS Administration, and expertise in an array of child welfare programs, particularly in-home services for children and families. The defendant proposed Ms. Smith but the children and families. The defendant proposed Ms. Smith but the parties agreed that plaintiffs' nominee, Diane Fager, would be a co-monitor assisting Ms Smith.
This Court's entry of the March 10, 1995 Order extending monitoring until February 15, 1996, followed negotiations arising out of the Fifth Monitoring Report (dated March 15, 1994). That report documented extensive non- compliance by the defendant with numerous terms of the Decree. See Fifth Rep.
Notwithstanding these efforts, issues remain among plaintiffs' counsel, DCFS and the monitor. Accordingly, the parties have been involved in extensive negotiations over the last six months to resolve disagreements regarding the Defendant's compliance with the terms of the Consent Decree. As a result of these negotiations, the parties have reached an agreement regarding a course of action which will effectuate the underlying purposes of the Consent Decree.
1182, 1192 (N.D.Ill. The defendant appealed the preliminary injunction ruling, but then agreed to settle the case. The resulting Consent Decree constituted a ""complete resolution of [all] the claims in this action...."" Decree at T23.

Folloc:ir= notice to the class and a hearin g the rar:ies' proposed consent order was signed on March 28, 1991 (hereinafter the ""Consent Order"").
In February 1995, the parties agreed to move the court to extend that term to February 15, 1997. The basis of this motion was unresolved disputes regarding defendant's compliance with the Consent Order. An extension was granted, but only to February 15, 1996.

As plaintiffs point out, however, the shortfalls continue to occur and, as found by the Monitor, this has a discouraging effect on the use of the cash assistance prograr, which is a central element. of the Consent Order. Further efforts are necessary to ensure compliance, in Cook County, with the cash assistance program required by the Consent Order.
The District Court, Hart, J., held that one-year extension of monitoring period was warranted. Motion granted in part and denied in part. *1220 Laurene Marie Heybach,Susan Gail Wishnick, Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago, Chicago, IL, Joan Matlack, Putterman Howard, Chicago, IL, Diane L.

Following notice to the class and a hearing, the parties' proposed consent order was signed on March 28, 1991 (hereinafter the “Consent Order”).
Sixth Report 46. Defendant is not in compliance with 6(b) of the Consent Order. Plaintiffs also complain that defendant has not fully complied with data reporting requirements*1225 of the decree.
Conclusion: a. Cook County is out of compliance. b. Downstate is in compliance. Recommendation: a. HAP program and cash assistance monies not be co-mingled into one contract.

The marriage ban inflicts serious and irreparable harm on same-sex couples and their children.
and other children of same-sex couples without any compelling, important, or even legitimate justification. The State also has deprived Plaintiffs of their guarantee of equality under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by denying Veronica and Mayra and other lesbian and gay Indiana residents the right to marry the person of their choice based solely on their sexual orientation and sex.
On November 11, 1996, B.Y.R. was born. Mayra and Veronica took B.Y.R.
Veronica and Mayra were validly married in Illinois and seek through this suit to end the State’s current denial of recognition of their marriage on the ground that it is a marriage entered by two individuals of the same sex B. Indiana’s Marriage Ban Singles Out Same-Sex Couples and Excludes Them from Marriage. Indiana has enacted a statute that excludes same-sex couples from marriage. See Indiana Code § 31-11-1-1.
The State’s interest in child welfare is affirmatively harmed — not furthered — by the marriage ban. The marriage ban injures same-sex couples’ children without offering any benefit to other children. Barring same-sex couples from marriage does not prevent same-sex couples from raising children together.
Different-sex spouses will continue to enjoy the same rights and status conferred by marriage, regardless of whether same-sex couples may marry, unimpaired by the acknowledgment that this freedom belongs equally to lesbians and gay men. E. Veronica and Mayra’s Need for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction. Veronica and Mayra have been in a long-term committed relationship for over twenty-seven years.
Plaintiffs seek preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief to protect their constitutional rights and avoid the injuries described above. In addition, Veronica and Mayra seek a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary injunction against the Defendants. A favorable decision enjoining Defendants would redress and prevent the irreparable injuries to Plaintiffs identified herein, for which Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.
marry in the state and enjoy the benefits accorded by the state. On the heels of this change, Plaintiffs in this case seek an injunction for recognition by the State of Indiana of their out-ofstate same-sex marriage.
To this end, they moved for a Temporary Restraining Order, but while the court was reviewing the submissions, the parties jointly stipulated that certain relief be accorded to Plaintiffs while Bogan, supra, is pending an appeal in the Supreme Court of the United States. In particular they agree that Defendants will not enforce Indiana Code § 31-11-1-1(b) against Plaintiffs and will recognize their out-of-state marriage. And, should either adult Plaintiff die, the Department of Health will issue a death certificate recording the deceased Plaintiff’s status as “married” and list the other adult Plaintiff as the “surviving spouse.”
Moreover, they agree that the Department of Health assist local health departments, funeral homes, physicians, coroners, medical examiners, and others involved in the completion of death certificate to understand their duties under this agreement. The parties also agree that the case should otherwise be stayed until the Supreme Court issues its decision regarding the appeal in Bogan. This being an adversarial legal system, the Court will stay the case as requested.

600,PB-KY-0001,"In 2013, three same-sex couples married under the laws of other states filed a lawsuit, individually and on behalf of their children, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against the Commonwealth of Kentucky, challenging the constitutionality of Kentucky's laws prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying and voiding within Kentucky marriages of same-sex couples validly entered into under the laws of other states and countries.  Judge John Heyburn found for the plaintiffs on July 1st, 2014, and issued the final order declaring Kentucky laws banning same-sex marriages to be unconstitutional.  This order was stayed and then reversed by the Sixth Circuit. The case is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.","This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because the suit raises federal questions under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Venue is proper in the Western District of Kentucky under 28U.S.C. § 1391(b) because Defendants perform their official duties in this district.

Goodridge v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941, 969 (Mass. In May 2004, Massachusetts began marrying same-sex couples. In response, anti-same-sex marriage advocates in many states initiated campaigns to enact constitutional amendments to protect “traditional marriage.
For example, a same-sex spouse in Kentucky cannot take time off work to care for a sick spouse under the Family Medical Leave Act. 29 C.F.R. § 825.122(b). In addition, a same-sex spouse in Kentucky is denied access to a spouse’s social security benefits. 42 U.S.C. § 416(h)(1)(A)(i).
Nevertheless this institution of marriage is under attack by judges and elected officials who would legislate social policy that has already been in place for us for many, many years.... In May of this year, Massachusetts will begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.... We in the legislature, I think, have no other choice but to protect our communities from the desecration of these traditional values.... Once this amendment passes, no activist judge, no legislature or county clerk whether in the Commonwealth or outside of it will be able to change this fundamental fact: the sacred institution of marriage joins together a man and a woman for the stability of society and for the greater glory of God S. DEBATE, 108TH CONG., also demonstrates an obvious animus against same-sex couples may be debatable.
On February 13, 2014, they requested a Kentucky marriage license from the Jefferson County Clerk’s Office, presenting the requisite identification and filing fees. The Commonwealth refused to issue them a license because they are a same-sex couple. They allege that their inability to obtain a marriage license has affected them in many ways.

Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 383 (quotation omitted). Kentucky’s laws prevent all same-sex couples from marrying. This acts as a complete bar to Plaintiffs’ ability to marry each other, thus satisfying the “significant interference” threshold.

I, § 25. April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, a lesbian couple living in Michigan, challenge the constitutionality of this definition. Marriage was not their first objective.
The defendants’ experts testified that the evidence regarding the comparative success of children raised in same-sex households is inconclusive. The district court sided with the plaintiffs. It rejected all of the State’s bases for its marriage laws and concluded that the laws failed to satisfy rational basis review.
Citing the hardships imposed on them by the recognition ban—loss of tax breaks, exclusion from intestacy laws, loss of dignity—they seek to enjoin its enforcement. The district court ruled for the plaintiffs in both cases. In Love, the court held that the Commonwealth could not justify its definition of marriage on rational basis grounds.
They seek to amend their son’s Ohio birth certificate so that it lists both of them as parents. The district court granted the plaintiffs relief in both cases. In Obergefell, the court concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a fundamental right to keep existing marital relationships intact, and that the State failed to justify its law under heightened scrutiny.
The respondents appealed the decisions against them to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. It consolidated the cases and reversed the judgments of the District Courts. DeBoer v. Snyder, 772 F.
The Constitution grants them that right. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed. It is so ordered.

601,PB-NY-0003,"This class action was about whether the City of New York improperly denied federally sponsored cash assistance to qualified New York City residents under a program implemented by the city in the late 1990s. The plaintiffs each claimed to be qualified welfare beneficiaries who had been improperly denied assistance by one of New York City’s new job centers in violation of the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process, the city’s obligations under 7 U.S.C. §2020 (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—then referred to as Food Stamps) and 42 U.S.C. §1396 (Medicaid), in addition to violating state law; the plaintiffs sought class certification for all similarly situated New York City residents, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 16, 1998, with Judge William H. Pauley presiding. The court entered a temporary restraining order on the same day directing the city to provide emergency food stamps and cash assistance to the named plaintiffs. The court granted a preliminary injunction in-part to the plaintiffs on January 21, 1999. The court ordered the city to (1) allow applicants for public assistance to apply for benefits the first day they visit a job center, (2) cease conversion of income support centers to job centers without a formal hearing, (3) make eligibility requirements for food stamps and Medicaid separately from the eligibility determination from cash assistance, (4) send applicants timely notice of the city’s decision on whether they qualify for benefits, and (5) form a corrective plan for achieving its policy goals while also meeting the needs of public assistance applicants. The city moved to vacate the preliminary injunction on December 10, 1999, after procuring more evidence surrounding the efficacy of the job centers in achieving their welfare obligations. Meanwhile, the State of New York moved to dismiss the complaint against them for failure to state a claim. Judge Pauley denied both motions and granted the plaintiff’s motion for class certification on July 21, 2000. 

The court entered a permanent injunction in favor of the plaintiffs on December 30, 2004. The permanent injunction directed both the city and state to: (i) provide expedited food stamp service to eligible applications within 7 days; (ii) separately process applications for food stamps when the applications for cash assistance are denied or withdrawn; (iii) send notices to applicants confirming voluntary withdrawals for Medicaid in accord with 42 C.F.R. 435.913 and document such withdrawals pursuant to 7 C.F.R. 273.2(c)(6); and (iv) provide adequate and timely notice by correctly completing certain documentation. The injunction also required the state to supervise the city and make sure it met the obligations of the injunction. On January 13, 2005, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the part of the December order in which the court concluded that 8 N.Y.C.R.R. § 387.8(a)(2)(i)(a) did not confer a privately enforceable right of action and that plaintiffs’ claim under New York Social Services Law § 133 was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court granted the motion on February 14, 2005. Final judgement was entered on December 14, 2005; the court also granted the plaintiffs declaratory judgment.

Both the state and the city appealed the permanent injunction to the Second Circuit on January 12, 2006, but the city dropped its appeal. On October 31, 2007, the Second Circuit reversed the district court, ruling that the state did not have a non-delegable duty to administer the decentralized Medicaid and Food Stamp programs, the state’s efforts in supervising the city since the permanent injunction was issued were adequate, and the district court exceeded its authority by issuing a permanent injunction in light of New York State’s affirmative supervisory steps it had taken to assure compliance. In a series of stipulations and orders from January 31, 2007 to July 22, 2011, the City of New York agreed to pay a total of $2,920,675.94 to plaintiffs for attorney fees and costs sought; the state agreed to pay a further $639,918.98.

This Court granted that request and adjusted the discovery and pre-hearing briefing schedules to accommodate the parties’ needs. On January 14, 1999, the parties advised the Court that they were unsuccessful in their efforts to settle the action. The hearing date was rescheduled to January 20, 1999.
The following colloquy ensued: Q. Reject the case. Which case would you reject?
Under the Plan, signs entitled “What You Should Know If You Have an Emergency?” are to be posted in the job centers. Item E of the corrective action plan establishes procedures for processing applications for food stamps and Medicaid when applicants fail to comply with work requirements.
According to the City, the Reynolds Audit established that job centers generally outperform income support centers (O’Neill The problem with this argument (and similar ones advanced by the City defendants) is its reliance on a faulty premise: that the audit results are fundamentally reliable, and therefore provide a steady framework upon which such inferences may be drawn. That is not the case. Plaintiffs did far more than establish that the audit results are merely imprecise.
The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” U.S Const. amend XI.
See Reynolds III, 118 F.Supp.2d at 352. Additionally, this Court denied the State defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint and their application to modify the preliminary injunction. This Court also certified a class consisting of “all New York City residents who have sought, are seeking, or will seek to apply for food stamps, Medicaid, and/or cash assistance at a Job Center.”
Access *21 HRA has a policy in place emphasizing applicants’ right to apply for benefits on their initial contact at a Center. That policy is enforced through the “spot check” program. The evidence does not demonstrate that the City defendants have engaged in a pattern or policy of denying access.
Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees, as provided by 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and costs and disbursements related to their claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The parties are directed to meet and confer regarding reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements. SO ORDERED:
Plaintiffs alleged that the City engaged in unlawful conduct aimed to discourage and deter plaintiffs from obtaining benefits to which they were entitled and that the state failed to properly oversee and supervise the City’s administration of assistance programs. Almost seven years later, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Pauley, J.) awarded plaintiffs permanent injunctive relief, directing city defendants to comply with specified provisions of federal and state law and directing state defendants to supervise the City’s adherence to the injunction.
Fourth, the City *188 frequently failed to give adequate and complete notices to applicants regarding eligibility decisions, in violation of the plaintiffs’ due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and in violation of the regulations. See U.S. Const., amend.
In doing so, plaintiffs allege that the policies and practices of the New York City Human Resources Administration (“HRA”), the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (“OTDA”), and the New York State Department of Health (“DOH”) have the effect of preventing needy New York City families and individuals from applying for, and timely receiving, the benefits to which they are entitled.

Plaintiffs alleged that DOMA and the Oklahoma Amendment violates the Due Process, Equal Protection, Full Faith and Credit, and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The court found for the plaintiffs, holding on Jan. 14, 2014 that the ban on same-sex marriage violated the Equal Protection Clause.  

The Tenth Circuit found for the plaintiffs on July 18, 2014, and after the Supreme Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari (on October 6, 2014), the Court lifted the stay on its original mandate and enjoined the Defendant from enforcing the Oklahoma Amendment and denying same-sex couples marriage licenses. The Court awarded $309,485.27 in attorney's fees to the plaintiffs. The case is now closed.","They exchanged vows in a church-recognized commitment ceremony in March of 2002 but desire to be civilly married in Oklahoma.

First, Part A contains a definitional provision, which definesmarriage as the union of one man and one woman. This provision has the effect of preventing same-sex couples from receiving a marriage license and from being married under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. Second, Part A contains a type of reservation of power, which states that Oklahoma law shall not be construed to require that “marital status” or the “legal incidents thereof” be conefrred upon those who are “unmarried.”
Venue The Oklahoma Defendants raise three procedural arguments in support of their motion to dismiss. First, they argue that the Northern Disrtict of Oklahoma is an improper venue. Under the federal venue statute, an action may be brought in (1) a judicial district where any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the sa me State, (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claimoccurred, or (3) a judicial district in which any defendant may be found, if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.

18: Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rules 4-3 that the state's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. The state is scheduled to begin granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples May 17. Feb.
Defendant represented by Sally Howe Smith Tulsa County Court Clerk
Synopsis Background: Lesbian couples brought action against various government officials claiming that Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) section which functioned to deprive same-sex married couples of federal benefits, and amendment to Oklahoma constitution limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated due process and equal protection. Defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part, 447 F.Supp.2d 1239. State appealed.
*4 Although the Court did not issue a formal stay of the proceedings, the Court was aware that the United States Supreme Court had granted certiorari in two cases presenting nearly identical issues to those presented here—namely, the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA and the constitutionality of Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative amending the California Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. The Court delayed ruling in this case pending the Supreme Court’s decisions. On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court issued its heavily anticipated decisions in United States v. Windsor, ––– U.S. ––––, 133 S.Ct.
On February 13, 2009, the Bishop couple sought the issuance of a marriage license from Smith. Smith refused them a marriage license based upon their status as a same-sex couple.

The ruling was in a case called Coleman v. Wilson (now Coleman v. Brown). The case covers all prisoners with serious mental disorders housed in California state prisons. The case continues today.

Defendant JONES Case Counselor, Central State Prison Defendant DEPUTY WARDEN MIZELL DAVIS Defendant COUNSELOR RACHEAL MONCRIEF","On August 3, 2016, a blind inmate at Central State Prison filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia against the Georgia Department of Corrections, alleging that the defendants violated his constitutional and statutory rights under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act by failing to provide him with adequate food, sanitation, clothing, or any other necessity during his brief solitary confinement. On September 27, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The parties filed a joint motion to dismiss on October 2, 2018. On October 4, 2018, the court granted the defendants' motion to stay the case pending further proceedings.","On February 15, 2017, a prisoner filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia against the Georgia Department of Corrections. The prisoner alleged that he was discriminated against on the basis of his disability when he worked in the kitchen at Central State Prison, in Macon, Georgia. He also alleged that the prison failed to provide him with adequate medical care and adequate food. The court granted the prisoner's motion to dismiss, and the case was closed. The defendant then filed a motion to reopen the case, which was denied."
609,PC-MO-0018,"In 2016, two Missouri Medicaid recipients filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri after being denied medication to treat their Hepatitis C. The plaintiffs alleged that Missouri Department of Social Services and MO HealthNet denied medically necessary treatment to Medicaid beneficiaries with Hepatitis C, discriminated against similarly situated Medicaid beneficiaries, failed to provide ""reasonably prompt"" treatment, violated due process, and violated the American with Disabilities Act. In November 2017, MO HealthNet modified its policies and the case was dismissed as moot without prejudice. The case closed in November 2017.","This case challenges the policies of the Missouri Department of Social Services which result in the denial of medically necessary treatment for Plaintiffs J.E.M., J.L.M., and numerous other Medicaid beneficiaries infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a serious and communicable disease that can cause severe liver scarring, liver damage, cancer, and death.
Without this treatment, damage to enrollees’ livers grows more severe and the risk of complications from the disease increases.

Rather, Defendants’ denial of coverage is an effort to ration care because of its concern over the cost of DAAs. The Defendants’ coverage policies result in long delays for medically necessary services, and they exclude some Medicaid enrollees with HCV from medically necessary DAA treatment while providing the same treatment to other Medicaid enrollees with HCV. Plaintiffs Require DAAs to Treat Their HCV 46.

He also suffers from pancreatitis, spinal osteoarthritis, and high blood pressure. Because of his disabilities, J.E.M.

He receives Supplemental Security Income of $733 per month and approximately $190 in food stamps. He has Medicaid coverage based on his disabilities. Because of his Hepatitis C, J.E.M.

The patient’s fibrosis score is F2 [F1F2].” MO HealthNet did not offer J.E.M. any other medication as an alternative to treat his Hepatitis C.

She also has a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Because of her disabilities, J.L.M. is unable to work.

and J.L.M, Medicaid beneficiaries with Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”), seek a preliminary injunction against Defendant Brian Kinkade in his official capacity as Director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, and Joe Parks, M.D., in his official capacity as Director of the MO HealthNet Division, enjoining them from applying certain Hepatitis C drug- treatment policies and prior-authorization criteria that Plaintiffs argue exclude them from medically-necessary, direct-acting antiviral treatment (“DAAs”). With the Defendants’ agreement, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from requiring three months of negative drug and alcohol screens prior to submitting requests for DAA approval. The Court finds, however, that an evidentiary hearing is necessary before the Court can rule on the Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from applying policies and prior authorization criteria regarding fibrosis scores because a material factual dispute exists regarding the medical necessity of treating all HCV patients with DAAs regardless of fibrosis score.
Procedural and Factual Background Plaintiffs J.E.M. and J.L.M are Medicaid beneficiaries with Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”). Plaintiffs’ Complaint includes three claims for relief: 1) a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim for failure to provide medically-necessary prescription drugs in violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A) and 1396d(a); 2) a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim for violation of the Medicaid Act’s “comparability” requirement at 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B); and 3) a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim for violation of the Medicaid Act’s “reasonable promptness” requirement at 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8).
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. This case challenges the policies of the Missouri Department of Social Services which result in the denial of medically necessary treatment for Plaintiffs J.E.M., J.L.M., H.L.O., and numerous other Medicaid beneficiaries infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a serious and communicable disease that can cause severe liver scarring, liver damage, cancer, and death. This case is filed on behalf of enrollees in the Missouri Medicaid program, also known as MO HealthNet, who are infected with HCV, who meet the FDA’s standards for coverage of curative Hepatitis C medication, but who are denied coverage for medically necessary treatment because of the Defendants’ arbitrary and improper policies that restrict treatment only to the sickest beneficiaries.
The Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires the state Medicaid agency and its agents to provide each Medicaid recipient with adequate written notice and an opportunity for an impartial hearing before services are denied, reduced or terminated. U.S Const. XIV Amend.
On May 12, 2017, MO HealthNet again denied her doctor’s request for prior authorization, providing the same rationale for the denial. MO HealthNet did not offer H.LO. any other medication as an alternative to treat her Hepatitis C.

The plaintiffs allege that the Defendants’ denial of coverage is an effort to ration care because of its concern over the cost of direct-acting antiviral treatment (DAA) treatment.

610,PC-TX-0023,"Four incarcerated women alleged that their First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by being housed in the same facilities as transgender women. After years of litigation, the claims were eventually dismissed.","THIRD AMENDED VERIFIED COMPLAINT page 1 I. Introduction This action anses out of recent U.S. Bureau of Prisons (BOP) rules and regulations that authorize male prison inmates to be housed in the same facilities that house female inmates. Such a blending of the sexes in the confined and restricted conditions attendant to prisons violates the privacy of female inmates and causes numerous dangers and threats to the physical and mental health and safety of our female Plaintiffs, and has in fact resulted in many such dangers coming to fruition as detailed below.
General Prison Conditions 15. Plaintiffs are incarcerated women in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, serving sentences in excess of 50 months. Each of them is a non-violent, minimum security inmate.
Many other affected inmates at these facilities are serving sentences in excess of 20 years.
These characteristics make MTF Inmates substantially larger and stronger than the average female, thus rendering them a physical as well as sexual danger to female inmates and prison officials. The Conditions That Support This Lawsuit. As would be expected from the federal prison regulations requiring this, Plaintiffs have been housed with MTF Inmates, sometimes in the same sleeping and intimate spaces.

The BOP regulations identified above serve to create an environment wherein these Constitutional rights are violated, or are at constant risk of violation, all to the detriment of Plaintiffs. Violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act 87. Defendants' conduct in imposing rules and regulations, and in imposing conditions affecting Plaintiffs that violate their rights to practice the tenets of their faith, violate the First Amendment and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 88.
The Court has jurisdiction to issue the requested injunctive relief in accordance with 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 703, 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(4), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. The Court has jurisdiction to award attorney’s fees and costs in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 2412, 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and the Equal Access to Justice Act. 13. Venue is proper in the Northern District of Texas in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this district, and the policies being challenged are being implemented in the Northern District of Texas, among other locations IV.
There is no penological interest being served by placing male inmates within the general populations of federal women’s prisons. On September 25, 2017, the Court ordered that this case be abated pending the resolution of ongoing settlement negotiations. Order, ECF No. 111.
Plaintiff Brenda Rhames’ Notice Regarding Abatement Period and Settlement Negotiations 1, ECF No. 180. On May 31, the Court returned the case to active status. Order Setting Status Conference, ECF No. 183.
Civil Action No. 7:17-cv-009-O JUDGMENT This action came on for consideration by the Court, and the issues having been duly considered and decisions duly rendered, It is ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, or, in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 206) is GRANTED and this action is DISMISSED with prejudice.

The plaintiffs alleged that the recent changes to BOP rules and regulations that authorize male prison inmates to be housed in the same facilities that house female inmates violated their constitutional rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the Constitution's right to bodily privacy. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief and granted their motion for a preliminary injunction. The case is ongoing.","On February 12, 2017, a group of female inmates filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.

611,PC-WA-0032,"This case was filed by a trans woman incarcerated in a men's prison in Washington State on September 5, 2017 in the District Court for the Western District of Washington. She alleges that the blanket policy in the Washington Department of Correction denying prisoners access to gender affirming surgery amounts to a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. She is represented by the ACLU, and is seeking injunctive relief. The parties came to a preliminary settlement agreement on March 20, 2020, and proceedings were stayed for 180 days in an attempt to implement the agreement.","Dkt. Plaintiff is a 7 transgender woman who has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.
at p. 9.

August 22, 2018), ECF No. 171. In that case, Keohane, a transgender female inmate, CORR CRONIN LLP challenged the Department of Corrections’ policy banning hormone therapy for inmates. 1 Defendant argued that the case was moot because they permitted the plaintiff to begin hormone 3 therapy (after she filed her Complaint and a preliminary injunction was entered).
The Court in 4 that case provided an exhaustive analysis of the voluntary cessation doctrine, ultimately finding that “Defendant’s actions are too little too late to moot Ms. Keohane’s claims.”
15 In the present case, Defendants’ actions were far more egregious than those of the 16 Defendant in Keohane. Defendants refused to change their policy after Lotusflower filed her Complaint, and they refused to change their policy after Lotusflower filed for Summary 18 Judgment. They even refused to change their policy when opposing the Motion for Summary 20 Judgment and instead misled the Court to believe that the policy had in fact changed when in 21 reality, it had not.

Much of the anecdotal evidence focuses on the period of time during 14 which Messrs. Sybrandy and Witt provided public defense services, however.

PARTIES 7. Plaintiff Abilio James (“Jim”) Acosta is chief White House correspondent for Cable News Network, Inc. (“CNN”) and is a member of the White House Correspondents’ Association (“WHCA”). Acosta has been a journalist for more than two decades and is widely respected for his diligence and independence.
CNN reaches more individuals than any other cable television news organization in the United States. Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States. He is sued in his official capacity.
From 2003 to 2007, Acosta was a CBS News correspondent. In February 2012, CNN named Acosta one of its national correspondents and subsequently made him a senior White House correspondent. Acosta has been CNN’s chief White House correspondent since January 2018.
Without a hard pass, a reporter may well miss the newsworthy events, particularly including the many notable events that occur with little notice. A hard pass is effectively required to be a White House correspondent for a national news organization such as CNN. Without a hard pass, a reporter must ask for advance approval each time he wishes to enter the White House.
Hours after the press conference concluded, Press Secretary Sanders issued an official statement announcing that “the White House is suspending the hard pass of [Acosta] until further notice.” The Press Secretary accused Acosta of “placing his hands” on the White House staffer who attempted to take the microphone from Acosta during the press conference. The Press Secretary added that the alleged conduct “is absolutely unacceptable” and stated “[w]e will not tolerate this inappropriate behavior.”
The White House also rejected Acosta’s application for a day pass on November 8, 2018. On November 9, 2018, Defendants prohibited Acosta from fully covering the President on a trip to Paris to mark the centennial of the end of the First World War. Although Acosta traveled to Paris, he was told that he would not be allowed to access the President’s events, including an event that had been planned (but was ultimately cancelled due to inclement weather) to visit with French President Emmanuel Macron a cemetery to honor the fallen.
A declaration that the revocation of Acosta’s press credentials was unconstitutional, in violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; d. A declaration that the revocation of Acosta’s press credentials violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); and e. An order granting Plaintiffs costs, fees, and disbursements incurred in connection with these proceedings and such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.

614,PR-NY-0007,"When mass protests against police violence were exempted from New York’s COVID-19 gathering restrictions, but congregational worship continued to be prohibited, two Catholic priests and three Orthodox Jews brought this lawsuit, alleging that New York officials were discriminating against people of faith.  The court granted a preliminary injunction on June 26, 2020.","You look at places around the country. There were protests all across the country Protest. Just be smart about it.

For a High Mass, the Church norms provide for five altar servers to assist the priest, which would reduce the congregation at Saint Therese Church to around 45 members at each Mass, given the 25% of capacity limitation imposed by defendant Cuomo. This would require the offering of five Sunday Masses at Saint Therese Church in order to accommodate 260 worshipers. For a Low Mass, Church norms provide for two altar servers to assist the priest, which would reduce the congregation at Saint Therese Church to around 47 at each Mass, given the 25% capacity limitation.

LEXIS 68415 (emergency order restricting places of worship to five individuals or fewer within state’s police power); In re Abbot, 954 F.3d at 787-788 (holding that temporary ban on all “nonessential” abortions did not violate United States Constitution).
Additionally, speculative harm is not sufficient to entitle a party to a TRO. The complaint alleges that the Nicholville church may exceed gathering limits when children return to school. Since children are not now in school, any harms associated with school days is irrelevant to whether plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm in the short period before the court issues a decision on plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction.
The Court explained that when reviewing a statute “purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals or the public safety,” that allegedly violates a fundamental right, the statute must not be disturbed unless it “has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law...” Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 31. Indeed, the Southern District of New York has recently held on two occasions that the emergency gathering limitation does not violate the First Amendment right of freedom of speech and assembly. See Geller, 2020 U.S Dist.
It may be spread by schools. This is about mass gatherings. One of the prime places of mass gatherings are houses of worship.
We will assert the legal authority. We have been sued by the religious organizations. Our legal authority was upheld.

See Exhibit 1-1 at 1. Accordingly, plaintiffs Soos and Stamos join the “Red Zone” plaintiffs in seeking a TRO and permanent and final injunctive relief. Infant Plaintiffs P.L and G.L.
Accordingly, infant plaintiffs G.L. and P.L worship at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Brooklyn and are students at Good Shepherd Catholic Academy (“Good Shepherd”).

Blasio, G.A.L is unable to receive adequate speech therapy services, occupational therapy services and a regimented classroom setting required for him to thrive and address his disability.
We have been told since early March, beware the fall. Beware the fall. Weather gets colder.
It’s not like I’m putting forth a proposition. Enforcement works. Any rule is only as good as the enforcement.
1,200 enforcement actions just on bars and restaurants. That’s enforcement. The state is going to take over the enforcement oversight in all the hotspot clusters, okay?
So when we did New York on pause back on March 20th, we banned all mass gatherings, more than 10 people, and we closed all non-essential businesses. It was the mass gathering rule that was upheld. And so technically during that period of time, individuals could walk into a religious institution and pray, but you couldn’t have more than 10 people in a religious institution regardless of occupancy at any given time.
That’s for the bureaucracy to accept that and pivot and do it, and these are all difficult laws. Think about it. You’re a local politician.
The entire city, the entire county. Brooklyn closes. Governor Andrew M. Cuomo: (01:13:25) Now, theoretically, you want to drive into Manhattan, you can drive into Manhattan, but you have to drive into Manhattan or take a train into Manhattan.

615,SD-MI-0001,"The NAACP and Detroit students and parents sued the Detroit school board and other state defendants in federal court, alleging unconstitutional segregation in Detroit's schools. The district court found that Detroit's schools were illegally segregated, in part because of decisions made by the school board to create and maintain and segregated system. The district court found that a Detroit-only remedy would be insufficient, and ordered a busing plan that would have affected students in city schools and 53 largely white suburban school districts, but the Supreme Court rejected this plan and a Detroit-only remedy was implemented.","In our decision on the previous appeal, Bradley v. Milliken, 433 F.2d 897 (6th Cir. ), this court affirmed the order of the District Court refusing to grant a preliminary injunction and remanded the case for a hearing on its merits. The issue in this case is not what might be a desirable Detroit school plan, but whether or not there are constitutional violations in the school system as presently operated, and, if so, what relief is necessary to avoid further impairment of constitutional rights.
But its only reference is to an earlier section of the opinion that relates to the segregative. impact in Detroit of the school construction program in that district (id. at 144a151a).
On appeal this court held that § 12 of Act 48 was an unconstitutional interference with the lawful protection of Fourteenth Amendment rights, that there was no abuse of discretion in denying a preliminary injunction, and that the Governor and Attorney General should not have been dismissed as parties defendant at that stage of the proceeding. The case was remanded to the District Court for an expedited trial on the merits. 433 F.2d 897.
It opened in 1968. What was its enrollment? 1,897 pupils.
No costs are taxed. Each party will bear his own costs. 259*259 EDWARDS, CELEBREZZE, PECK, McCREE, and LIVELY, Circuit Judges, concur.
(Rulings dated September 3, 1970.) Upon appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit sustained the district court's denial of plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction but reversed the district court in part, holding that portions of Act 48 were unconstitutional and at the same time ordering that the Governor and the Attorney General remain as parties to the litigation. Bradley v. Milliken, 433 F.2d 897 (6th Cir.
(December 3, 1970, Ruling on School Plans.) Following a trial on the liability issue, the district court found that the Detroit School District was segregated on the basis of race. The court found that certain conduct on the part of the defendant Detroit Board of Education and the defendant State of Michigan, through its various state officials, fostered segregation in the Detroit Public School System and violated the Fourteenth Amendment rights of Detroit school children.
582 at 589. The district court thereafter ordered the parties to submit plans to desegregate the Detroit Public Schools. Pursuant to this order the defendant Detroit Board of Education submitted two plans, referred to as Plan A and Plan C, that were restricted to the corporate limits of the City of Detroit.
This court held that it would be within the equity power of the District Court to adopt a plan of desegregation extending beyond the boundaries of the Detroit School District. We remanded the case to the District Court for the taking of additional evidence because several of the suburban school districts had not been heard or had an opportunity to be heard. We held that as a prerequisite to the implementation of a plan affecting any school district, ""the affected district must be made a party to this litigation and afforded an opportunity to be heard.""
Nearly six years have elapsed since that remand, and almost ten years since this litigation began, yet we are unable to hold on the record before us that de jure segregation has been eliminated from the Detroit school system. We conclude that we must send the case back to the district court for further proceedings. The present appeal presents four questions for decision: (1) Did the district court err in holding that population and demographic changes in Detroit have obliterated all traces and effects of past acts of discrimination by the Detroit School Board and the State of Michigan?
484 F.2d 215 (6th Cir. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed in part. The Court held the district court had no equitable power to include in its remedial decree any school district whose racial composition had not been shown to be the product of de jure segregation.
The appellants are the plaintiff class[1] and the Detroit Federation of Teachers, a defendant in intervention. The district court's order provided for the termination of its jurisdiction over the Detroit school system's code of student conduct and community relations program. It also disbanded the court-created monitoring commission.
The panel encouraged the parties to negotiate and settle these and other issues. The product of the negotiations was a June 1981 stipulation between the parties. The parties agreed on the amount which the state defendants would contribute to the cost of providing for the educational remedies.
at 272. Accordingly, we vacated the district court's order and remanded the case for further proceedings, returning the case to the status quo ante. We also granted the district court the limited discretion to enter an order which would provide for a smooth transition back to these revitalized programs.
