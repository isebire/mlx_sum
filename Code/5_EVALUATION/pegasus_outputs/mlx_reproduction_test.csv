1,CJ-AL-0020,"In 2013, indigent detainee filed a complaint against the City of Montgomery and a Municipal Court Judge for unconstitutionally ordering the petitioner to serve time for her inability to pay court-order fines and fees for their traffic violations. The complaint was originally filed in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama and then transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, where it was consolidated with a similar case. In the amended complaint, petitioners alleged that the imprisonment orders violated their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. Petitioners sought remedy through injunctive and declaratory relief. In 2014, the parties reached a settlement that provided new judicial procedures for the Municipal Court to follow regarding indigent defendants and nonpayment. It also included three declarations, most importantly, it declared that the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S.

4,CJ-CA-0005,"On March 8, 2006, the Pacific News Service filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the California Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants had violated the constitutional rights of the press and the public to attend, meaningfully observe, and gather and report on important information at executions being carried out by the defendants at the California State Prison at San Quentin. On May 30, 2013, the issue in this case became moot due to a state court decision. In Sims v. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), the California Court of Appeals held that CDCR’s lethal injection regulations were invalid for failure to comply with the APA. The court permanently enjoined CDCR from carrying out the execution of any condemned inmate by lethal injection until their new regulations complied with the Administrative Procedure Act. This case closed after a voluntary dismissal filed by the plaintiff organization.","1 KEKER & VAN NEST, LLP JON B. STREETER - #101970 2 WENDY J. THU - #163558 AlA Y S. KRSHNAN - #222476 3 KATHERI J.

THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER, COLORADO Defendant. ______________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND ______________________________________________________________________________ Plaintiff Mickey Howard, by and through his counsel, Rebecca Wallace and Mark Silverstein of the AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION FOUNDATION OF COLORADO, respectfully alleges for his Complaint and Jury Demand as follows: INTRODUCTION 1. In the City and County of Denver (Denver), when a judge sets a monetary bond, Denver will release the defendant upon payment of that bond only if the defendant also pays a $50 bond fee. That means that even if the defendant can pay the monetary bond, Denver will not release the defendant if he cannot also pay the additional bond fee. Plaintiff Mickey Howard was a victim of this practice. In June of this year, he was arrested for alleged violations of municipal ordinances. The Denver judge set a $10 cash bond for his release, a sum Mr. Howard could pay. Mr. Howard could not, however, pay the additional $50 bond fee that Denver’s policy required as an additional condition of his release. As a result, Mr. Howard spent four additional Case 1:18-cv-02593-STV Document 1 Filed 10/10/18 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 12 nights in jail until the Colorado Freedom Fund, a non-profit bail fund, paid the required fee and secured his release.

11,CJ-KS-0002,"On October 21, 2015, a private plaintiff sued the City of Dodge City, Kansas and Ford County in a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff alleged that the Dodge City's wealth-based post-arrest detention scheme violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The plaintiff sought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and a declaration that the City's wealth-based detention practices were unlawful. The parties agreed to settle that the City would be enjoined from holding an arrestee in custody after a non-warrant arrest on the basis of inability to post bond.

In August 2018, granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, and held that the Judges’ policy/practice of not inquiring into the ability of the persons falling within the certified class to pay before they are imprisoned for non-payment of court debts was unconstitutional, and that the Judges’ failure to provide a neutral forum for determination of such persons’ ability to pay was unconstitutional. The defendants appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court on August 23, 2019.

17,CJ-MD-0001,"On January 19, 2006, a death-sentenced inmate of the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center in Baltimore, Maryland filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Maryland Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiff objected to the three-drug cocktail (sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in Maryland's lethal injections. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's lethal injection procedures arbitrarily and unnecessarily created a grave risk that he would suffer extreme pain during his execution, thus violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

The plaintiff also filed a similar complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleging that the defendants failed to follow Maryland law because the execution protocol had not been adopted under the Maryland Administrative Procedures Act (MAPA). 

On December 19, 2006 the Maryland Court of Appeals invalidated the Maryland execution protocols until such time as they were properly adopted under MAPA or exempted from that requirement by an act of the Maryland General Assembly. On January 29, 2007, two bills were introduced in the Maryland General Assembly, one that would exempt the death penalty protocols from the MAPA requirement and one that would repeal the death penalty in the state. The judge agreed to stay the proceedings of this case pending the outcome of the legislation. According to the status report on March 14, 2011, all executions in Maryland had been stayed until the proper administrative regulations were adopted. On August 16, 2012 this case was administratively closed. In May 2013 the Maryland legislature repealed the death penalty for all future convictions and in December 2014 Governor O'Malley commuted the death sentences of the four remaining death-row inmates to life without the possibility of parole.

18,CJ-MD-0006,"In response to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act, which created, among other things, the “Paycheck Protection Program.”  Under this program, small business owners could apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration; if they later certified that all of the loan funds had been used for qualifying expenses, the loan would be forgiven.  

The SBA’s rules disqualified many small business owners with criminal records.  Several small business owners brought this lawsuit against the SBA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenging this criminal record exclusion.  On June 29, the court granted a preliminary injunction requiring the SBA to extend the application deadline for the named plaintiffs from June 30 to July 21, 2020.  The following week, Congress passed follow-up legislation extending the deadline for all applicants to August 8, 2020.

The plaintiffs brought this action under 42 U.S.C. 1983, and allege that the Defendants violated their Due Process and Equal Protection rights under the 14th Amendment. The plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief. They want to enjoin the Defendants from enforcing their current debt collection program, which jails people who can't pay a certain portion of their fines for traffic and misdemeanor offenses. The Plaintiffs allege that Defendants adopted their debt collection program to generate revenue for they city, and the individual plaintiffs were not informed that they could assert their indigence. Rather, the Plaintiffs were simply told they had to pay or go to jail. On January 12th, 2017 Judge David Guaderrama granted the Defendant's motion to dismiss in part. Judge Guaderrama dismissed the Due Process claims, but did not reach the Equal Protection claims.

The Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in January 2017, and after the Court denied two motions to dismiss filed by defendants over the course of 2017, the parties stipulated to dismissal of the action pursuant to a settlement agreement. In the settlement agreement, defendants agreed to maintain certain administrative practices for three years.

31,CW-NY-0001,"Plaintiffs, children in the custody of the New York City Child Welfare Administration (""CWA""), and children who, while not in the custody of CWA, are or will be at risk of abuse or neglect and whose status is known or should be known to CWA, sought declaratory and injunctive relief against both the city and state for systematic deficiencies that jeopardized their well-being. The case was filed on December 13, 1995, and the parties reached to two separate settlement agreements, one with the city and one with the state, on December 2, 1988. The plaintiffs returned to court in January 2001, seeking an order directing the state to comply with specific terms of the state settlement agreement. The court found that the state had acted with insufficient diligence in implementing the information management system, and therefore extended the terms of the agreement in this area and directed that the plaintiffs receive semi-annual reports. The defendants provided a January 2017 report to show that they were continuing to develop, implement, and update their information systems for child welfare needs. A year later, the court ended its supervision of the portions of the settlement that it had retained jurisdiction to enforce.

32,CW-NY-0006,"This was a class action challenge to New York's unnecessary institutionalization of children in foster care in psychiatric facilities.

The agreement also required Amtrak to train staff on ADA compliance, establish a monitor-approved process for managing ADA complaints, and create a settlement fund to compensate individuals who were harmed by Amtrak’s most inaccessible stations.

40,DR-FL-0004,"On July 22, 2013, attorneys from United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the State of Florida. The DOJ alleged that nearly two hundred children with disabilities were unnecessarily segregated from their communities and the general population by the State, which had placed them in nursing homes. The DOJ sought an injunction requiring the State to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131-12134, which, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of disabled individuals, and mandates that their rehabilitative and medical needs be provided in a manner that enables disabled individuals to be independent and integrated members of the community.

THE STATE OF FLORIDA, Defendant. COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Nearly two hundred children with disabilities in Florida are segregated unnecessarily in nursing facilities. Many young adults, who entered nursing facilities as children and grew up in these institutions, remain unnecessarily segregated from their communities.1 As a result of limitations on community-based services and deficient assessment and transition planning processes, the Institutionalized Children have spent their formative years separated from their families and apart from their communities, often very far from home. 2. Unnecessary institutionalization denies children the full opportunity to develop and maintain bonds with family and friends; impairs their ability to interact with peers without disabilities; and prevents them from experiencing many of the social and recreational activities that contribute to child development. 3. Other children with significant medical needs who reside in the community and receive 1 These institutionalized children and young adults are collectively referred to hereinafter as the ""Institutionalized Children.""

The United States brings this action against the State to enforce the rights of children with significant medical needs to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. The StateThe Honorable Pamela Jo Bondi Attorney General for the State of Florida Florida Department of Legal Affairs PL-01 The Capitol Tallahassee, FL 32399-1050 Re: United States’ Investigation of the State of Florida’s Service System for Children with Disabilities Who Have Medically Complex Conditions, D.J. No. 204-18-212 Dear Attorney General Bondi: We write to report the findings of the Civil Rights Division’s investigation of the State of Florida (the “State”) with respect to its system for delivering services and supports to children with disabilities, including those who have medically complex or medically fragile conditions.1 During our investigation, we assessed the State’s compliance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.  ⁇  12131-12134 (the “ADA”), as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), requiring public entities to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. Our review of the State’s system reveals that the State fails to meet its obligations under Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Part 35, by unnecessarily institutionalizing hundreds of children with disabilities in nursing facilities. Many children entering nursing facilities in the State are unnecessarily separated from their families and communities for years. With adequate services and supports, these children could live at home with their families or in other more integrated community settings. The State’s policies and practices also place numerous other children who have medically complex or medically fragile conditions at risk of placement in nursing facilities and other institutional settings. 1 For the purposes of this letter, theCase: 0:13-cv-61576-WJZ As of: 11/04/2014 06:45 AM EST 1 of 5 CLOSED,PMH,REF_DISCOV U.S. District Court Southern District of Florida (Ft Lauderdale) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 0:13 ⁇ cv ⁇ 61576 ⁇ WJZ United States of America v.

Carranza in his official capacity as the Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education (the “Chancellor”) (collectively “Defendants”) on behalf of a class of almost 2,000 Staten Island students with disabilities who are being educated in segregated and unequal public schools and classrooms in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), and the New York City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”). 1 2. The DOE funds and operates a wholly separate citywide school district based solely on disability known as District 75, which on Staten Island draws students from Staten Island public schools (“Staten Island District 75”). 3. The DOE created District 75 to serve as a separate school district for students with “moderate to severe disabilities,” including autism spectrum disorders, cognitive delays, sensory impairments, emotional disturbances, and multiple disabilities. 4. Over 25,000 students with disabilities attend District 75 schools citywide, and almost 2,000 students with disabilities attend Staten Island District 75 schools. 5. District 75 students are placed in a separate District 75 school (containing only District 75 students) or a co-located District 75 placement that is composed of classrooms located within a neighborhood DOE school. 6. Regardless of the District 75 setting in which students are placed, District 75 students spend all or almost all of their school day segregated from students without disabilities. 7. Students with disabilities placed in Staten Island District 75 schools could be educated successfully alongside students without disabilities in traditional, neighborhood public schools—also called “community schools”—in Staten Island, if provided with appropriate and legally required services and supports.","This civil rights class action lawsuit is brought against the New York City Department of Education (the “DOE) and Richard Carranza .<n>Students with disabilities placed in Staten Island District 75 schools could be educated successfully alongside students without disabilities in traditional, neighborhood public schools ."

C. A. No.: _______________ COMPLAINT INTRODUCTION 1. Almost forty years after Congress mandated, through passage of the Rehabilitation Act, that institutions in receipt of federal funds could not discriminate on the basis of disability, defendant Free Library of Philadelphia (“Library”) has initiated and subsequently expanded a NOOK e-reading device lending program for older library patrons knowing that this device is completely inaccessible to its blind patrons. The Library has developed this lending program in an effort to “bridge the digital divide” between young and old patrons, but in doing so has needlessly exacerbated the “digital divide” between disabled and non-disabled library patrons. 2. Because today’s technology can offer blind individuals greater access to books, periodicals, and other materials that were traditionally available only in print, the Library has the statutory responsibility to ensure that it offers fully accessible e-reading technology. In the past, when libraries provided only print books, the libraries and their blind patrons had to rely on separate processes to obtain accessible versions of books. However, because e-books are not inherently visual, audible, or tactile, they provide individuals with an opportunity to access content through whatever methods are accessible to them.

The plaintiffs also alleged unlawful discrimination based on the religious content of their speech in violation of the Equal Access Act and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, in addition to violation of their freedom of expression under Massachusetts state law. On June 16, 2003, the Court entered a consent decree between the school and the plaintiffs. As per the decree, the defendants agreed to rescind punishment of the plaintiffs for the distribution of the religious materials, remove prior restraints and content-based restrictions of distribution of materials during non-instructional time without complying with substantive and procedural safeguards, so long as distribution doesn't substantially and materially disrupt the operation of the school or the new policies.

54,ED-MD-0002,"On May 31, 2018, The National Federation of the Blind filed this lawsuit in the U.C. District Court for the District of Maryland (Northern Division). The plaintiff sued the U.S. Department of Education and the Secretary of Education along with the Acting Assistant Secretary, claiming that the changes to the 2018 OCR Manual violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq., and was contrary to the mission of the OCR. These changes in § 108(t) of the 2018 OCR Manual require mandatory dismissal of complaints if the claim is either part of ""a pattern"" of complaints against multiple recipients, or places an unreasonable burden on OCR's resources. These changes also eliminate the appeal rights of complainants. The parties came to a settlement agreement reopening complaints dismissed under the contested rules of the manual and allowing parties that had their cases dismissed under the rule to petition the Department to reopen their cases. The case is not officially closed until February 2021, when the parties can no longer file for further enforcement.","Case: 1:18-cv-1568 As of: 06/04/2020 04:53 PM EDT 1 of 8 U.S. District Court District of Maryland (Baltimore) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 1:18 ⁇ cv ⁇ 01568 ⁇ TDC CLOSED The National Federation of the Blind et al v.

DEVOS, in her official capacity as United States Secretary of Education; KENNETH L. MARCUS, in his official capacity as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the United States Department of Education; and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, Defendants. Civil No. _______________ COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INTRODUCTION 1. Nearly half a century since the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), sexual harassment and assault remain a widespread problem for students of all ages. In 1972, Congress delegated to Defendant U.S. Department of Education (“ED” or “the Agency”) the power and responsibility to hold educational institutions receiving federal funds accountable for their responses to sex discrimination. Since 1997, the Agency has set standards governing the responsibilities of funding recipients to address sexual harassment, including sexual assault, and to take steps to prevent it. Under statutes imposing virtually identical obligations, schools that receive federal funding have also been required to respond to and prevent harassment and assault on the basis of race, national origin, and disability.1 Until now, 1 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”); Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“Title II”). Compare Title VI, 42 1 Case 1:20-cv-01224-RDB Document 1 Filed 05/14/20 Page 2 of 46 ED has imposed the same responsibilities on recipients to respond to harassment based on sex that it imposes on them to respond to harassment based on race, national origin, and disability. With the promulgation of the Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance regulation (RIN 1870-AA14, Docket No. ED2018-OCR-0064) (the “Rule”), however, the Agency has radically reduced the responsibility of schools to respond to complaints of sexual harassment and assault, creating an arbitrary and wholly unexplained disparity between its treatment of sex discrimination on the one hand, and race, national origin, and disability discrimination on the other. 2. Defendant ED",Plaintiffs: Advocates for Youth; Council of Equalities for Girls; Girl's for Equalities; and Riabel Devos .<n>Case filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (Baltimore) .
56,ED-MI-0001,"On November 7, 2006, the people of Michigan approved by majority vote a statewide ballot initiative-Proposal 2-which amended the Michigan Constitution to prohibit discrimination or preferential treatment based on race or gender in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting in the State.  Both Proposal 2 and the University of Michigan's announcement that it would comply triggered litigation.  On November 15, 2012, the en banc Sixth Circuit held that Proposal 2 created a comparative structural burden that undermined the Equal Protection Clause (which the court called the ""political process"" argument).  Accordingly, the court found Proposal 2 unconstitutional.  On March 24, 2013, the Supreme Court granted review of the case.  Argument will be after the Court's summer break.  

On October 15, 2013 the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case.  In an opinion written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, the court reversed the Sixth Circuit.  There were two concurring opinions and a single dissent.  In his opinion Kennedy asserts that this is not a case about resolving the debate about racial preferences, but rather about whether it is constitutional for Michigan to allow its voters to decide the issue.  The court holds that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in this Court’s precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school admissions.

The court granted the school district's motion to dismiss, but the appeals court reversed and remanded, and the district court has since granted a preliminary injunction allowing plaintiff access to the boy's bathroom. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the school district's appeal in 2016, but later remanded the case after the Department of Education and Department of Justice withdrew their prior guidance on the issue. The case was remanded to the district court to determine whether the plaintiff's graduation from high school rendered the case moot.

70,EE-CA-0222,"In September 2005, the EEOC filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California under Title I and Title VII against Taylor Made Digital Systems. The EEOC sought injunctive relief and damages, alleging that the defendant discriminated against one of its employees on the basis of her sex (female/pregnant) and race (African American). 

In October 2006, the court  (Judge Maxine M. Chesney) signed a proposed consent decree. The consent decree required the defendant to pay $30,600 to the employee who brought the initial charge. The defendant also agreed to comply with Title VII, not to engage in retaliation against any employee because of the lawsuit, and to continue to post an anti-discrimination policy on its company intranet. Finally, the consent decree required all inquiries about the employee who filed the initial charge to be directed to a specific member of human resources, who was prohibited from referring to the present lawsuit. The consent decree terminated after one year.","Case 3:05-cv-03952-MMC Document 1 Filed 09/29/2005 Page 1 of 5 WlLUAM R. TAMAYO (CA. Stale Bar No. 084965) JONATHAN T. PECK 01A.

73,EE-CO-0069,"On September 29, 2011, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC"") brought this lawsuit against Beverage Distributors Company, LLC (""BDC"") on behalf of a visually impaired company employee in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (""ADA""). The EEOC claimed that BDC discriminated against the employee in violation of the ADA when it conditioned his employment on the results of a medical exam and subsequently refused to hire him as a night warehouse loader upon learning that he had a disability. The jury initially awarded the employee $132,347 in back pay, but it found that his damages should be reduced by $102,803 because he could have mitigated those damages by finding a comparable position. On December 9, 2013, the District Court vacated these findings and awarded injunctive relief, only to be reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit because of erroneous jury instructions. The 10th Circuit denied the EEOC's petition for rehearing in May 2015. The parties entered into a consent decree in December 2015, and the matter appears to be closed.

DaimlerChrysler Corp., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2001) Opinion 2001 WL 908952 Only the Westlaw citation is currently available. United States District Court, N.D. Illinois, Western Division. CHAPMAN v. DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP. No. 00 C 50250. | July 26, 2001. MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER REINHARD, J. *1 On July 12, 2000, plaintiffs filed a complaint against Daimler–Chrysler Corporation (“DaimlerChrysler”) and the International Union of the United Auto Workers Local Union 1268. On November 30, 2000, DaimlerChrysler filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m), 41(b) and 12(b)(6), which has been fully briefed. On May 15, 2001, certain plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against DaimlerChrysler only, and DaimlerChrysler filed another motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(5), 4(m), 41(b) and 12(b)(6), essentially asserting the same grounds for dismissal. The thrust of DaimlerChrysler’s motion is that plaintiffs served the original complaint 121 days after it was filed, in violation of Rule 4(m)’s 120–day limitation. Plaintiffs argue their complaint has two dates stamped on it. One stamp shows “Received” with a date of July 12, 2000 underneath, and another stamp shows “Filed” with a date of July 13, 2000 underneath. Based on these stamped dates, according to plaintiffs, they calculated Rule 4(m)’s 120–day as starting from the “Filed” date of July 13, 2000, and served the complaint on November 10Case: 3:00-cv-50250 As of: 06/08/2010 01:19 PM CDT 1 of 7 MAHONEY, PROTO, TERMED United States District Court Northern District of Illinois  ⁇  CM/ECF LIVE, Ver 4.0.3 (Rockford) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 3:00 ⁇ cv ⁇ 50250 Chapman, et al v.

Sued by EEOC for Retaliation Food Market Terminated Manager Who Filed Discrimination Charge, Federal Agency Charges INDIANAPOLIS - Bright Petroleum Inc. d/b/a The Bright Market violated federal law by retaliating against a manager who filed and refused to drop a discrimination charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency charged in a lawsuit it filed yesterday. The Bright Market is a food market and gas station located in Lawrenceburg, Ind. According to the EEOC's lawsuit, The Bright Market retaliated against Deli Manager Michelle Bunte by singling her out for heightened scrutiny after learning that she had filed an EEOC charge and would not drop her charge. The company then disciplined and terminated her. Taking adverse actions against an employee who complains of discrimination, files an EEOC charge or otherwise exercises her rights under Title VII violates the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The prohibition against retaliation applies regardless of the outcome of the underlying charge. The EEOC asserts that the company's actions were intentional and demonstrated a reckless indifference to the worker's federally protected rights. The EEOC filed suit (Case No. 4:13-cv-00205)","The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed this action against Bright Petroleum d/b/a The Market .<n>The Commission alleges that Bright retaliated against Michelle Bunte by subjecting her to unwarranted scrutiny, discipline and termination ."

The plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief as well as class certification, alleging pattern or practice of age discrimination, disparate impact and disparate treatment by the defendants during the layoff and rehire process, in connection with Boeing's sale of its commercial airplane manufacturing facilities to Onex. The plaintiffs brought eight claims, two of which were dismissed during the pleading stage, five were dismissed as the District Court granted summary judgment in the defendants' favor in two separate opinions. The plaintiffs appealed to the 10th Circuit Court, but the 10th Circuit affirmed the lower court's decisions. The remaining claim in the case after the Circuit Court decision was the plaintiffs' ADEA claim of disparate treatment. A number of individual plaintiffs settled with defendants. After the plaintiffs failed to appear at a hearing on a motion to dismiss, Judge Melgran granted the motion. The plaintiffs appealed on February 9, 2015, and the appeal was dismissed on June 16, 2015 for failure to prosecute.

90,EE-LA-0065,"On August 22, 2005, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed this Title VII retaliation claim against Tasa, Inc., (doing business as Orr Minden Country Chevrolet) on behalf of a black employee who had a pending race discrimination charge and no discipline or warnings at the time of his firing. The complaint was filed with a joint motion for a consent decree, which the Court (Donald E. Walter) approved on November 11, 2005.
The terms of the decree provided for damages ($60,000 to the employee) and injunctive relief. The parties bore their own costs. Under the decree, Tasa, Inc., had to provide annual Title VII training to all employees in Louisiana, to post an EEOC poster in a conspicuous location, to report to the EEOC annually the date, attendees, and subject matters of the Title VII trainings, and to institute and follow a promotion policy. The promotion policy required that all vacant positions be posted before an employee is promoted to the positions, that all qualified candidates be interviewed, and that all applications, resumes, and interview notes be maintained. The decree expired automatically after three years. The case is now closed.

91,EE-LA-0118,"On April 13, 2015, a transgender man who was fired when he refused to sign an agreement to present and be treated as a woman at work as a condition of his employment filed a Title VII sex discrimination claim in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The EEOC later intervened in the case. District Judge Carl Barbier directed the parties to arbitrate the case pursuant to an arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and his employer. After the conclusion of the arbitration, which yielded monetary relief for the individual plaintiff, the EEOC continued to litigate the case to obtain injunctive relief. Judge Barbier entered an 18-month consent decree which required the defendant retrain its employees and post notice of what constitutes a violation of equal employment opportunity policies.","Case 2:15-cv-01161-CJB-SS Document 1 Filed 04/13/15 Page 1 of 11 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA TRISTAN BROUSSARD, Plaintiff, Civil Action No.: v.

95,EE-MD-0151,"On August 28, 2017, six transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland Maryland contesting the President's ban on transgender service in the U.S. military. Judge Garbis initially granted a motion for a preliminary injunction in September, but this was later stayed in 2019 when the Supreme Court issued a stay of this nationwide injunction in two factually similar cases contesting the ban. 

This case changed dramatically in 2018 when the government altered its policy on transgender service in the military, eliminating an outright ban and instead putting new guidance on transgender men and women entering the service. Judge Russell, reassigned to the case in 2018, dissolved the preliminary injunction, saying that it was only meant to stay a complete ban on transgender service in the military. This also dismissed all claims against the 2017 outright ban as moot, and removed all plaintiffs that were already in the service and not seeking to join. Discovery is ongoing in the case.","Case: 1:17-cv-2459 As of: 06/25/2020 12:26 PM EDT 1 of 46 CASREF,STAYED U.S. District Court District of Maryland (Baltimore) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 1:17 ⁇ cv ⁇ 02459 ⁇ GLR Stone et al v.

This class action seeks to vindicate the rights of the many AfricanAmerican detectives in the NYPD’s Intelligence Division1 whose promotions were denied or delayed solely based on race. For well over a decade, the NYPD’s Intelligence Division has implemented a secretive and unstructured promotions policy, administered by white supervisors 1 In 2013, the Intelligence Division changed its name to the Intelligence Bureau. For ease of reference, the Bureau will be referred to throughout this complaint as “Intelligence Division.” Case 1:17-cv-07265 Document 1 Filed 09/25/17 Page 2 of 31 who refuse to promote deserving African-Americans detectives. As a result of these policies, Named Plaintiffs and other African-American detectives have been repeatedly denied welldeserved promotions—even when recommended by their direct supervisors—without explanation, while less qualified white detectives have been promoted above them. 2. Detectives Theodore Coleman, Jon McCollum and Roland Stephens were each highly experienced African-American detectives, who devoted over twenty years of their careers to law enforcement. Over the course of their careers in the NYPD, they were each repeatedly commended for their investigative successes, leadership, professionalism, and devotion to achieving the finest results. 3. In 2001, all three of them joined the NYPD’s elite Intelligence Division, which is tasked with preventing and investigating terrorism and other major crimes. On September 11, 2001, they risked their lives to rescue those in the towers and to maintain security. Following the attacks, they assisted with the cleanup and investigation, interviewing hundreds of suspected terrorists and following up on innumerable leads. They dedicated their careers","This class action seeks class action on behalf of three African-American detectives who were denied promotions solely based on race .<n>The three detectives were each highly experienced African-Americans who risked their lives to rescue those in the September 11, 2001, attacks, interviewing hundreds of suspected terrorists ."
114,EE-NY-0298,"Current and former Black FDNY employees sued the City of New York alleging racial discrimination in their hiring, promotion, and compensation practices. Plaintiffs sought to represent a class of individuals similarly situated who suffered from FDNY's policies that afforded too much discretion to higher-level individuals and fostered a culture of favoritism that harmed Black candidates for hiring and advancement.  The City filed a motion to dismiss and the Court partially granted the motion, but sustained the plaintiffs' claims related to the hiring and promotion practices with the FDNY. The City moved for partial summary judgment in May 2020, arguing that the retired class representatives could not seek relief. At the same time, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. Both motions were pending as of February 11, 2021.","Create an Alert for This Case on RECAP ECF U.S. District Court Southern District of New York (Foley Square) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 1:17-cv-09447-JPO Richardson et al v.

Union Pacific Railroad Co. No. EP-02-CA-0445-DB (W.D. Tex. Feb. 2, 2004) The San Antonio District Office filed this Title VII race discrimination lawsuit against defendant, a railroad, because it terminated charging party, an African American switchman/brakeman/conductor, for allegedly lying on his job application about his criminal background but did not terminate non-black employees who actually lied on their applications. According to charging party, when he applied for employment defendant's interviewer asked him whether he had ever been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor. Charging party answered ""no"" to the question even though he had been convicted of misdemeanor theft.","Case 3:02-cv-00445-DB Document 19 filed April 7, 2003 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas .<n>Union Pacific Railroad Company allegedly terminated an African American switchman/brakeman/conductor because he lied on his job application about his criminal background ."
130,EE-TX-0434,"This class action suit was filed on January 12, 2006, under 38 U.S.C. § 4301, et seq. (""USERRA"") in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiff class consisted of all past and present pilots of American Airlines who are or were members of the United States Armed Services and who took military leave from January 2001 to 2006. They asked the court for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that American Airlines had violated USERRA by discriminating against pilots who took military leaves of absence. They claimed that they were unfairly charged fewer ""in service"" days which prevented them from bidding on a number of benefits including flight schedules, paid vacation time, and earned sick leave. Pilots who had taken comparable types of non-military leave were not similarly penalized. After filing two amended complaints, and the court denying the defendants' second motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs motion to certify class, preliminarily approve settlement agreement, and approve forms of class notice.

The plaintiff, later joined by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the Yankton Sioux Tribe, and the Oglala Sioux Tribe, sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, alleging that they had violated the NHPA, the CWA, and NEPA by authorizing the construction of a pipeline over tribal land.

138,FA-DC-0001,"In 2012, the Catholic Archbishop of Washington and several affiliated Catholic organizations filed a lawsuit in the District of DC against the Federal Government under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment.  The plaintiffs contended that this mandatory contraception coverage violated their sincerely held religious beliefs, and seek to enjoin their enforcement.  This case was dismissed for lack of ripeness on January 25, 2013, and refiled on September 20, 2013. 

On November 6, 2015, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the accommodation to the contraceptive services mandate violates the RFRA. This case was consolidated with six others, and is known as Zubik v. Burwell. After the case was argued in the Supreme Court on March 23, 2016, the Court issued a per curiam order on May 16, 2016 remanding all seven cases to their respective courts of appeals. The Court ordered that the parties be given time to come to agreement on ensuring contraceptive access without burdening religious freedom. 136 S.Ct 1557, 1560.

145,FA-MA-0001,"This case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts on May 16, 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiff claimed that the department's provision of more than a million dollars of public funds to a ministry called ""The Silver Ring Thing"" (SRT) that uses federal abstinence education funding to bring ""unchurched"" students to Jesus Christ constituted an unlawful establishment of religion and a governmental endorsement and preference for religion in general and specific tenets of the ministry in particular. 

The ministry developed a three hour presentation that was meant to occur directly following a mandatory abstinence education assembly in public schools and which, according to the plaintiff, was ""permeated with religion."" 

In a two-year settlement agreement entered on February 22, 2006, the defendants acknowleged that they had terminated the SRT grant effective January 31, 2006.  The agreement provided that defendants would not fund SRT's abstinence eduction as it had been structured and implemented during the fiscal year 2005, that strict requirements would be made before considering funding any future proposals from SRT, and that extensive monitoring of SRT's activities would occur if SRT was given a grant.

146,FA-MA-0002,"On February 1, 2010, a Massachusetts citizen arrested for videotaping police practices filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts against the City of Boston and several police officers. The plaintiff sought monetary relief, alleging that the City of Boston failed to properly supervise, discipline or train Boston police officers, which resulted in the plaintiff's being falsely arrested. He further claimed that the false arrest violated his rights under the First and the Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution. On June 8, 2010, the Court (Judge William G. Young) denied the defendant police officers' qualified immunity from the plaintiff's constitutional claims. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the First Circuit regarding this denial, and later the First Circuit affirmed the denial. On June 29, 2010, the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Leo T. Sorokin. On January 19, 2012, the parties requested a mediation and the case was referred to Alternative Dispute Resolution. On March 5, 2012, the parties settled the case through the mediation. The lawsuit was subsequently dismissed. This ended the case.

On February 6, 2009, the District Court (Judge Ann D.

152,FA-OK-0001,"In 2012, evangelical Christian business owners filed a RFRA challenge to rules adopted pursuant to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, arguing that the rules infringed on their religious freedom by requiring them to provide coverage for emergency contraception through their group health insurance plan.  In November 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the contraception mandate did not substantially burden the plaintiffs' religious freedom.  

The 10th Circuit granted expedited en banc review, and oral arguments occurred on May 23.  On June 27, 2013, the 10th Circuit reversed the District Court's injunction denial and sent the case back to the District Court, with instructions to consider two prongs of the injunction inquiry and to rule on the plaintiffs' injunction motion.  The next day, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' emergency motion for a temporary injunction pending the full injunction hearing.  The Supreme Court granted cert., and on June 30, 2014, affirmed the 10th Circuit.  The Court said other ways were open to the government to reach its asserted interest of ensuring the availability of contraception coverage.

The plaintiffs alleged the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employee and student health plans provide coverage of contraception violated their religious foundings. On November 6, 2015, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the accommodation to the contraceptive services mandate as applied to religious nonprofits violates the RFRA. This case was consolidated with six others. The Supreme Court issued a per curiam order remanding all seven cases to their respective courts of appeals, and ordered that the parties be given time to come to agreement on ensuring contraceptive access without burdening religious freedom. Following revised HHS policies, the District Court permanently enjoined the defendants from forcing religious organizations to provide contraceptive care.

The same day, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit (No. 13-6640). On June 11, 2013, the 6th Circuit affirmed, holding that the ACA did not unlawfully burden the plaintiffs' religion. The case was remanded back to the 6th Circuit in light of a Supreme Court case Zubik v. Burwell. Following the Zubik decision, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury adopted new rules on October 6, 2017 that allowed for religious and moral objections to providing contraceptives under the ACA.

157,FH-AL-0003,"The lawsuit was based on fair housing testing that DOJ had conducted between July 2008 and January 2009, in which rental agents made a series of racialized remarks, steering white testers away from certain locations, and implying that black applicants were more likely to fail criminal background checks.  On July 21, 2009, the United States Department of Justice filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3601, against operators of the Rolling Oaks Apartments, seeking injunctive and monetary relief for race discrimination.  After the court (Judge Mark Fuller) denied cross-motions for summary judgment, the matter settled.   In February 2011, the Court entered a four-year consent decree enjoining the Defendants from discriminating on the basis of race in the operation of the Rolling Oaks Apartments and ordering  $15,500 in civil penalties.

159,FH-AL-0008,"In November 2011, two undocumented Mexican immigrants and three fair housing groups filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama against the State of Alabama. The plaintiffs alleged that a state statute violated the Fair Housing Act and was preempted by federal immigration law because it required mobile home owners to pay for a government-issued registration while prohibiting undocumented residents from making payments to government officials. Because the law made it illegal to possess a mobile home without registration and because it was illegal for undocumented residents to obtain the registration, the law effectively made such persons homeless.  The District Court (Judge Myron H. Thompson) enjoined the State from enforcing the law. The State appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit rendered it moot because in May 2012 the Alabama legislature amended the statute to exclude mobile home registration.  The District Court dismissed the case in May 2014, upon stipulation of the parties.","Case 2:11-cv-00982-MHT-CSC Document 1 Filed 11/18/11 Page 1 of 37 C' - IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA NORTHERN DIVISION ic A ) -- CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR HOUSING CENTER; , C;U: ;L ⁇  FAIR HOUSING CENTER OF NORTHERN ALABAMA; CENTER FOR FAIRCase 2:11-cv-00982-MHT-CSC Document 31 Filed 11/21/11 Page 1 of 38 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA NORTHERN DIVISION CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR HOUSING CENTER; FAIR HOUSING CENTER OF NORTHERN ALABAMA; CENTER FOR FAIR HOUSING, INC.; and JOHN DOE #1 and JOHN DOE #2, on behalf ofCase 2:11-cv-00982-MHT-CSC Document 50 Filed 11/23/11 Page 1 of 10 IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHERN DIVISION CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR ) HOUSING CENTER, et al., ) ) Plaintiffs, ) ) v. ) ) JULIE MAGEE, in her )IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHERN DIVISION CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR ) HOUSING CENTER, et al., ) ) Plaintiffs, ) ) v. ) ) JULIE MAGEE, in her ) official capacity as ) Alabama Revenue ) Commissioner, and ) JIMMY STUBBS, inIN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHERN DIVISION CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR ) HOUSING CENTER, et al., ) ) Plaintiffs, ) ) v. ) ) JULIE MAGEE, in her ) official capacity as ) Alabama Revenue ) Commissioner, and ) JIMMY STUBBS, inIN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHERN DIVISION CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR ) HOUSING CENTER, et al., ) ) Plaintiffs, ) ) v. ) ) JULIE MAGEE, in her ) official capacity as ) Alabama Revenue ) Commissioner, and ) JIMMY STUBBS, inCase 2:11-cv-00982-MHT-CSC Document 154 Filed 05/17/13 Page 1 of 3 Case: 11-16114 Date Filed: 05/17/2013 Page: 1 of 2 Case 2:11-cv-00982-MHT-CSC Document 154 Filed 05/17/13 Page 2 of 3 Case: 11-16114 Date Filed: 05/17/2013 Page: 2 of 2 Case 2:11-cv-00IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA NORTHERN DIVISION CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR ) HOUSING CENTER, ET AL., ) ) Plaintiffs, ) ) v. ) ) JULIE MAGEE, in her official capacity as ) Alabama Revenue Commissioner, ) and ) JIMMY STUBBS, in his official capacity as Case 2:11-cv-00982-MHT-CSC Document 166 Filed 05/04/14 Page 1 of 3 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA NORTHERN DIVISION CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR ) HOUSING CENTER, et al., ) ) Plaintiffs, ) ) v. ) ) JULIE MAGEE, Revenue ) Commissioner for the StateCase 2:11-cv-00982-MHT-CSC Document 167 Filed 05/08/14 Page 1 of 2 IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHERN DIVISION CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR ) HOUSING CENTER, et al., ) ) Plaintiffs, ) ) v. ) ) JULIE MAGEE, in her )Case 2:11-cv-00982-MHT-CSC Document 88 Filed 12/12/11 Page 1 of 3 IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHERN DIVISION CENTRAL ALABAMA FAIR ) HOUSING CENTER, et al., ) ) Plaintiffs, ) ) v. ) ) JULIE MAGEE, in her )Case: 2:11-cv-982 As of: 06/12/2015 02:51 PM CDT 1 of 22 CLOSED,CSC_ClerkB,MHT ⁇ ClerkB U.S. District Court Alabama Middle District (Montgomery) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 2:11 ⁇ cv ⁇ 00982 ⁇ MHT ⁇ CSC Central Alabama Fair Housing Center et al v.

166,FH-NJ-0003,"An association of residents of a New Jersey neighborhood filled a lawsuit claiming that the defendants' redevelopment plan for the Gardens neighborhood represented a violation of the Fair Housing Act and the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants' redevelopment plan, which razed numerous homes in a minority neighborhood, was discriminatory.  The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's pretrial decision in favor of the town to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reversed, and found that the plaintiffs were entitled to a trial.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the question whether disparate impact claims were available under the Fair Housing Act.  About two weeks prior to the scheduled argument, the parties settled; the city will construct 44 new homes, 20 for current residents in exchange for allowing redevelopment.  Seven households that elected to relocate will be compensated.  ","Case 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS Document 73 Filed 12/03/08 Page 1 of 55 PageID: 3026 DOUGLAS E. GERSHUNY, EXEC. DIR.

The plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the defendants from proceeding with discriminatory zoning practices; to order Garden City to approve a proposed zoning that would allow for affordable housing; and to order the defendants to take all actions necessary to assure that the Social Service Site be redeveloped to maximize the availability of affordable and integrated housing. 

On February 15, 2012, Judge Arthur D. Spatt granted defendant County's motion for summary judgment dismissing all claims against it. 

On April 22, 2014, Judge Spatt issued a final order for the plaintiffs and ordered Defendant Garden City to take a number of steps to prevent discrimination and to increase access to affordable housing. After Judge Spatt's order, both parties appealed the decision. The Second Circuit affirmed in part and remanded in part. The case is back in the lower courts on remand. On remand, Judge Spatt found that the plaintiffs had met their burden at trial in demonstrating that the Garden City’s proffered reasons for its chosen zoning change could have been met by another practice, such as R-M zoning, that had a less discriminatory effect. Magistrate Judge Arlene R. Lindsay thereafter awarded plaintiffs $5,255,108.94 in attorneys fees and costs from Garden City. On March 15, 2019, Judge Spatt signed the parties’ stipulation of discontinuance with prejudice, except without prejudice as to the court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of interpretation or enforcement of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement required the County to pay $5,400,000 to the plaintiffs to be used for the purpose of furthering and promoting mixed-income affordable housing; $120,000 to NYCC to be used for activities related to fair and affordable housing; and $400,000 to plaintiffs’ counsel for attorneys’ fees. The case is now closed.","Case 2:05-cv-02301-ADS-WDW Document 1 Filed 05/12/05 Page 1 of 27 PageID #: 3 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK --- X ACORN (THE NEW YORK ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FOR REFORM NOW), DAPHNECase 2:05-cv-02301-ADS-WDW Document 24 Filed 11/30/05 Page 1 of 32 PageID #: 105 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ----------------------------------------- x ACORN (THE NEW YORK ASSOCIATION OF : COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FOR REFORMCase 2:05-cv-02301-ADS-ARL Document 246 Filed 06/15/10 Page 1 of 9 PageID #: 6943 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ---------------------------------------------------------X ACORN (The New York Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), MHCase 2:05-cv-02301-ADS-WDW Document 315 Filed 02/15/12 Page 1 of 101 PageID #: 8495 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ---------------------------------------------------------X MHANY Management Inc., Vic DeVita, and Francine McCray,Case 2:05-cv-02301-ADS-WDW Document 318 Filed 02/29/12 Page 1 of 29 PageID #: 8598 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK -----------------------------------------------------------)( MHANY MANAGEMENT INC., VIC DEVITA, AND FRANCINE MCCFILED CLERK UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ---------------------------------------------------------X MHANY MANAGEMENT INC., 12/6/2013 10:51 am U.S. DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK LONG ISLAND OFFICE -and- Plaintiff, NEW YORK COMMUNITIES FOR CHANGE,Case 2:05-cv-02301-ADS-WDW Document 431 Filed 04/22/14 Page 1 of 10 PageID #: 10973 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ---------------------------------------------------------X MHANY MANAGEMENT INC., -and- Plaintiff, NEW YORK COMCase 2:05-cv-02301-ADS-WDW Document 468 Filed 09/11/14 Page 1 of 6 PageID #: 12744 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ---------------------------------------------------------X MHANY MANAGEMENT INC., -and- Plaintiff, NEW YORK COMCase 2:05-cv-0C23a0s1e-A14D-S16-W34D,WDocDuomceunmt e1n-1t ,40356/09F/i2le0d140,51/0253/010429P,Case 14-1634, Document 219-1, 03/23/2016, 1734023, Page1 of 102 14-1634-cv(L) MHANY Mgmt., Inc. v.

176,FH-WI-0003,"On September 26, 2013, the United States of America filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Wisconsin against Southport Bank, under the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.  The plaintiff, represented by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, compensatory damages to all of the victims of the defendant's discriminatory policies, and a civil penalty, alleging that the defendant discriminated against African American and Hispanic borrowers because of race and national origin in its residential mortgage lending.  

On October 11, 2013, the District Court (Judge Joseph Peter Stadtmueller) entered a consent order between the parties.  The defendant did not admit to any pattern or practice of discrimination.  The order enjoined the defendant from engaging in any act or practice that discriminates on the basis of race or national origin in any aspect of a residential real estate-related transaction in violation of the Fair Housing Act or any credit transaction in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.  Among other things, the defendant's employees will have to participate in a fair lending training program and will be subject to monitoring and reporting requirements.  The defendant also has to place $687,000 into a settlement fund to compensate for monetary damages that aggrieved persons may have suffered.  The order terminates after three years if the defendant has complied during that time period.","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v.

177,ID-CT-0005,"Following an investigation by the United States Department of Justice, the U.S. filed this lawsuit against the State of Connecticut, its Department of Mental Retardation, and the Director of Southbury Training School (Southbury) on July 25, 1986, alleging that living conditions at Southbury placed residents in grave danger of bodily harm and death. On the same day, the parties also entered into a consent decree that required Southbury to provide better programming, disciplinary procedures, medical care, recordkeeping, and increase staffing. After some problems with compliance and placing the state in contempt, the Court assigned a special master to monitor Southbury. After making significant progress, on March 25, 2006, the court ended judicial oversight, but retained jurisdiction over the consent decree and remedial plan. On November 2, 2009, the Court granted a joint motion to dismiss the case because the parties agreed that the consent decree and remedial plan were fully implemented.","Case 3:86-cv-00252-EBB Document 1373 Filed 01/17/2006 Page 1 of 14 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, : : Plaintiff, : : C.

182,IM-AZ-0016,"On May 17, 2010, a group of organizations and individuals filed a lawsuit against the Sheriff and Attorney of each of the 15 counties in Arizona, in their official capacities, in the U.S. District Court of Arizona, Phoenix Division.  The plaintiff, represented by organizations such as the ACLU and the National Immigration Law Center along with private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the recently enacted S.B. 1070 was a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Specifically, the plaintiff contends that S.B. 1070 conflicts with federal law and procedures and that local law enforcement agencies are ill equipped to deal with the complexities of immigration law.

The district court granted a preliminary injunction in February 2012, which the defendants appealed.  In a related case, Arizona v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down most of S.B. 1070.  The plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction against the remaining provisions of S.B. 1070 and while the parties were going through discovery disputes, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on March 17, 2015. The plaintiff filed a response to the defendant's summary judgment and on September 4, 2015, the district court ruled in favor of the defendant with regard to plaintiff's claims under the Supremacy Clause, Equal Protection Clause, the Fourth Amendment, Article II, Section 8 of the Arizona Constitution, the Due Process Clause, and 42 U.S.C. §1981. Notably, the court also entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on count three claim which was appealed.

183,IM-AZ-0021,"On June 8, 2015, civil detainees confined in the Tucson Sector of the U.S. Border Patrol filed a class action lawsuit, alleging violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the APA due to inhumane and punitive conditions while they were detained in holding cells. The district court granted a PI mandating that defendants must maintain conditions of confinement adequate for the detainees' physical needs and provide detainees with mats and blankets after 12 hours. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the PI order. In 2018 the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of defendants' obligation to provide raised beds for detainees held for any period requiring sleep; the district court denied this motion. After a 7-day trial in January 2020, the district court held that these extended confinement conditions violated the Constitution and issued an order enjoining the defendants from holding detainees for longer than 48 unless they provided conditions of confinement that meet basic human needs. This permanent injunction was ordered and has been in effect since April 2020.","Case 4:15-cv-00250-DCB Document 1 Filed 06/08/15 Page 1 of 56 1 Harold J. McElhinny* Kevin M.

188,IM-CA-0120,"Two San Francisco Bay Area fathers filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California after being detained for over 6 months in ICE custody without a bond hearing. The court granted a preliminary injunction and class certification ordering that individuals detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(6) pending a determination as to whether they can remain in the United States with “live claims”  before an adjudicative body cannot be detained for more than 180 days without a bond hearing. The government appealed both orders to the Ninth Circuit, and on April 7, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's order.

194,IM-CA-0165,"This lawsuit was filed in response to a July 6, 2020 ICE directive that would effectively force out of the country many international students studying remotely during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The University of California filed suit claiming that the directive was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and an order vacating and setting aside the policy. They also sought declarative relief and attorney's fees.

In a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, the plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance and as a result, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs in this case continued to monitor the alterations ICE made to its website between July and September and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on October 6, 2020.","1/14/2021 CAND-ECF ADRMOP,CLOSED,RELATE U.S. District Court California Northern District (Oakland) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 4:20-cv-04621-JST The Regents of the University of California v.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Muslim Advocates is a not-for-profit legal advocacy and educational organization. On January 11, 2018, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA Request (the “Request”) for materials related to denaturalization efforts by the federal government, including but not limited to “Operation Janus,” a joint initiative between DOJ and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), where 1 Case 1:18-cv-01967-RC Document 1 Filed 08/23/18 Page 2 of 15 federal agencies reviewed the files of naturalized citizens for the purpose of identifying misrepresentations in their naturalization applications that could render American citizens eligible for denaturalization. The Request was sent to the DOJ’s National Security Division (“NSD”), DOJ’s Civil Division (“Civil Division”), DHS, and DHS’s component agency, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). See Ex. A. On January 25, 2018 DHS referred the Request to its component agency, ICE. On February 13, 2018, Muslim Advocates submitted a revised FOIA request to ICE after the agency requested clarification on the scope of the request (hereinafter, the “Second ICE Request”). See Ex. C. 2. As of this filing, Defendants have wholly failed to comply with their obligations under FOIA: Defendant DOJ wrongfully denied Plaintiff’s Request and has thereafter failed to adjudicate Plaintiff’s administrative appeal of the Civil Division’s denial within the time limit.

204,IM-DC-0070,"37 families detained at three ICE-managed family residential centers sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security alleging violations of their Fifth Amendment constitutional rights, violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, and violations of the Flores Settlement Agreement. The plaintiffs alleged that the congregate environment and unsanitary conditions of the detention centers make them a tinderbox for a COVID-19 outbreak. They sought immediate release until proper protocols could be implemented. The plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order which was granted in part and denied in part on March 30. The court ordered ICE to provide appropriate infection protocols for the adults (a similar order from another case, <i>Flores</i>, applies to the children), to comply with CDC guidelines for congregate institutions, and to file a report regarding FRC capacity, implementation of the CDC guidelines, the number of detainees released, and videotape of the living conditions at the FRCs. On May 26, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and a motion in opposition to the temporary restraining order. The court denied the plaintiffs' later motion for a preliminary injunction demanding wholesale release of detainees on July 22. On December 10, the court dismissed the claim under the APA and the writs of mandamus. A hearing is scheduled for February 16, 2021.

213,IM-MA-0015,"In February 2018, an undocumented immigrant who was married to a U.S. citizen filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiff alleged that her unexpected arrest and detainment without notice or a hearing violated her due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). In April 2018, nine more plaintiffs were added, and they sought class certification, which was approved on May 17, 2019. On June 27, the district court instructed the defendants to begin providing monthly reports to class counsel regarding class members. On March 24, 2020 the plaintiffs filed a motion for immediate release of that class member because he was detained in a facility where an employee tested positive for COVID-19. On April 16, the parties filed a joint status report that altered the terms of release for the class member and the court lifted the stay on the class member's removal by ICE. ICE imposed conditions of supervision pursuant to the parties' agreement. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on November 18, 2020.

223,IM-NY-0049,"On May 18, 2010, two organizations comprised of day laborers and/or predominately Latino immigrant workers filed a class action lawsuit in the Eastern District Court of New York under the First and Fourteenth Amendments against the Town of Oyster Bay.  The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and LatinoJustice PRLDEF, sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees and costs, claiming that the defendants, through the passage of an ordinance prohibiting the solicitation of labor from the town's streets and sidewalks, unlawfully prohibited speech related to employment and had a discriminatory animus against predominately Latino immigrant day laborers. After defeating the defendant's partial motion for summary judgment due to lack of standing, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was successful. On September 3, 2015, the District Court enjoined the ordinance and declared it unconstitutional as it violated the first amendment. On August 22, 2017, the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. In July 2019, the court assessed attorney fees against the defendants, and the case closed later that year.

INTRODUCTION 1. This action seeks to compel the Department of Homeland Security (""DHS"") and its component agencies to disclose documents under the Freedom ofInformation Act(""FOIA""). The Plaintiffs plan to use those documents to enhance public understanding of recent government policies with respect to the implementation of ""expedited removal""—a truncated deportation process—against families with minor children, including those detained by DHS at the Artesia Family Residential Center in New Mexico. 2.

225,IM-NY-0055,"Sixteen states filed this lawsuit against the federal government on September 6, 2017 in response to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memorandum issued on Sept. 5 ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The states sought to enjoin the federal government from carrying out portions of the DHS memorandum and from using information about DACA grantees gathered in their applications to enforce immigration policy. While the district court granted in part the government’s motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction. On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that DHS's decision to rescind DACA was subject to judicial review under the APA and that the rescission was unlawful. Shortly thereafter, the Acting DHS Secretary issued a memorandum suspending DACA while DHS reviewed it. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that the Acting Secretary lacked the authority to issue the memorandum because he had not been lawfully appointed to his position. The district court agreed. Accordingly, the court vacated the memorandum and ordered DHS to resume processing DACA applications. This case is ongoing.

The plaintiffs alleged that the immigration-related conditions being placed on funding disbursed by the Department of Justice violated the Separation of Powers, the APA and the Tenth Amendment Anti-Commandeering. In 2018, a judge granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. In 2019, the defendants appealed this judgment. And later, the plaintiffs made a motion for summary judgment on the 2018 immigration-related conditions. In February 2020, a Second Circuit panel reversed the district court's order granting partial summary judgment, vacated the mandate and injunction, and remanded the case to the district court, concluding that the Attorney General was statutorily authorized to impose the challenged conditions and that the imposition of these conditions was not arbitrary and capricious.

228,IM-OK-0003,"On February 1, 2008, national, state and local chambers of commerce and other nonprofit organizations advocating for their members' business interests filed a lawsuit against the State of Oklahoma, claiming that Sections 7 and 9 of the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act, which impose tax penalties on businesses that don't check the work eligibility of all of their employees in a federal database and allow discharged employees to bring discrimination suits against their employers for employing unauthorized workers, were preempted by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act.
The Court granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on June 4, 2008, and on appeal to the Tenth Circuit the injunction was upheld except for as to the verification requirement. On remand to the District Court, the case was stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Whiting, which Supreme Court later held that an Arizona law requiring employers to use E-Verify was not preempted by federal law. Pursuant to this decision, the district court entered in a judgment on December 19th, 2012, holding that Oklahoma can require persons to contract with the State to use the employment authorization system. However, the provision creating a cause of action for discrimination against employers who terminate an authorized employee while retaining an unauthorized employee and the provision requiring businesses to verify individual independent contractors’ authorization status and creating a withholding for work performed by individual independent contractors, were both struck down.

230,IM-TX-0032,"On August 23, 2012, ICE Agents and the State of Mississippi filed claims alleging that deferred action Directive commands ICE officers to violate federal law, compels them to violate their oaths of office, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (""APA""), unconstitutionally usurps and encroaches upon the legislative powers of Congress, as defined in Article I of the United States Constitution, and violates the obligation of the executive branch to faithfully execute the law, as required by Article II, Section 3, of the United States Constitution. On January 24, 2013, the Court found that ICE Agent Plaintiffs had standing to proceed, but the State of Mississippi did not. On July 31, 2013, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's claims without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, finding that the dispute must be governed by the Civil Service Reform Act. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court.","Case 3:12-cv-03247-O Document 1 Filed 08/23/12 Page 1 of 25 PageID 1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS DALLAS DIVISION CHRISTOPHER L.

That is particularly true when the statute is as broadly written as section 1313(c)(4)(B). Moreover, when a statute sets out competing considerations, agencies are generally given discretion to choose how to best give effect to those mandates.93 Nonetheless,Case: 3:12-cv-3247 As of: 09/27/2015 09:58 PM CDT 1 of 13 CLOSED,EXH ⁇ ADM U.S. District Court Northern District of Texas (Dallas) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 3:12 ⁇ cv ⁇ 03247 ⁇ O Crane et al v.

232,IM-TX-0043,"On October 26, 2015, sixteen undocumented immigrants formerly detained in Dallas County, Texas, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiffs sued Dallas County and the Dallas County Sheriff under 42 USC §1983 for violations of the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought damages and an injunction preventing the defendants from detaining the plaintiffs solely based on a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an immigration hold, or an immigration detainer. Over time, the case was consolidated with two other lawsuits with identical claims. The state of Texas also intervened as a defendant. The district court initially granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but allowed the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint. The court then dismissed the plaintiffs' due process claims, allowing them to move forward only with their Fourth Amendment claims. By October 18, 2018, only one plaintiff was still represented by counsel and pursuing a claim (26 had dismissed their claims with prejudice, and 18 had fallen out of contact with counsel and were designated as pro se; their claims were later dismissed). That plaintiff reached a private settlement with the defendants and the court ordered entry of the final judgment on December 4, 2018. The plaintiff was to be paid $9,500. The case is closed.","Case 3:15-cv-03481-D Document 1 Filed 10/26/15 Page 1 of 13 PageID 1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS DALLAS DIVISON ARTURO MERCADO, PABLO CARRANZA, SERGIO DIAZ, JOSE ARTURO GALVAN RESENDIZ, JOSE GUTIERREZ, HEYDYIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS DALLAS DIVISION ARTURO MERCADO, et al., Plaintiffs, VS.

Senate Bill 4 (“SB 4”), also known as the “Show Me Your Papers Bill,” is an unprecedented, cruel, and vague law that is aimed at the heart of Texas. It violates the Constitution of the United States, the Texas Constitution, and federal law and should be immediately and permanently enjoined. 2. There are many legal flaws with SB 4. Racial animus fueled SB 4’s enactment, tainting the entire law with an impermissible legislative purpose. The law’s language is unconstitutionally vague, chills policy dissent in violation of the First Amendment and leaves those potentially subject to its mandates without meaningful notice of what acts are forbidden. 1 Case 5:17-cv-00459-OLG Document 1 Filed 05/22/17 Page 2 of 29 SB 4 will make all Texans less safe by eroding the discretion of our local law enforcement and law enforcement on college campuses, interfering with the chain of command and the existing decision-making processes of local officials, and preventing the reporting of crimes. Finally, SB 4 invites racial profiling, permitting local officers to demand “papers” from virtually any person in Texas at any time. History and logic supports that all Texans will not be equally subject to this harassment: Texans of Hispanic heritage and immigrants and their families, particularly those from Mexico, Central American and other Spanish-speaking countries, will be targeted. 3. This historic and unconstitutional attack on the core values and identity of Texas is especially harmful to the County of El Paso — comprised of residents, employees, and visitors — and to the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund (TOPEF) the population it serves. 4.

235,IM-UT-0002,"This is one in a series of cases challenging comprehensive state immigration laws. In this case, a coalition of immigrant rights groups and individual immigrants challenged Utah's law, HB 497, on preemption grounds and as a violation of equal protection, the right to travel, and the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. A preemption case brought by the Department of Justice was later consolidated with this case. In 2011, the District Court for the District of Utah has issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the statute. Following the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Arizona, the Court ruled on the motions for preliminary injunctions in June 2014 and ruled against the key provisions of HB 497. In November 2014, the parties filed a joint report, in which the State of Utah agreed to permanently scrap the key problematic provisions of HB 497. On December 4, 2014, the Court entered a judgment per the parties' proposed final agreement and dismissed the remaining claims without prejudice. The parties settled on attorney fees and costs and the case closed. ","Case 2:11-cv-00401-CW Document 2 Filed 05/03/11 Page 1 of 44 1 Linton Joaquin* Karen C. Tumlin* 2 Shiu-Ming Cheer* Melissa S.

236,IM-VT-0002,"In 2018, Migrant Justice and four individual members of the organization filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont. Plaintiffs alleged that the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) implemented retaliatory policies in response to their activism on behalf of immigrant farm workers, including extensive surveillance and false imprisonment, in violation of their First Amendment Rights and that the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) aided these practices by consistently and intentionally sharing personally identifying information about the plaintiffs with ICE in a manner that violated their Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection rights. On January 21, 2020, the plaintiffs and the DMV settled, and the DMV agreed to implement new protocols to protect against disclosing immigration and citizenship information with ICE. The plaintiffs then settled with the remaining defendants on October 28, 2020. The settlement agreement included $100,000 in damages, deferred action for the plaintiffs so they would not be deported, and ICE informing its employees that all immigrants are protected by the First Amendment.","Create an Alert for This Case on RECAP U.S. District Court District of Vermont (Rutland) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 5:18-cv-00192-gwc CLOSED,ENE0 Migrant Justice et al v.

248,JC-CA-0142,"On January 4, 2018, six women prisoners filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging systematic, misogynistic mistreatment of women prisoners at the Alameda County Jail in Santa Rita, California.  The plaintiffs sued Alameda County and the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for violations of their rights under the U.S. Constitution and state law.  On April 12, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint.  The plaintiffs elaborated on the allegations in the original complaint of the mistreatment against pregnant women prisoners and discrimination against women prisoners in general.  The second amended complaint also added additional causes of action under California state law and identified additional named defendants beyond the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office and individuals employed therein, including the California Forensic Medical Group, retained to provide medical services to prisoners and Aramark Correctional Services, a for-profit food services provider at the Jail.

The plaintiffs requested that the court certify a plaintiff class of women prisoners and the subclass of pregnant women prisoners, and that the court issue emergency remedy, by decree, to ensure that the women prisoners receive the medical care and other accommodations they needed to be safe while in custody at the Alameda County Jail.  Finally, in addition to the injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages requested in the original complaint, the plaintiffs requested that the court affirmatively direct the defendants to fully comply with all state statutes and regulations regarding medical treatment, nutrition, activities, and personal hygiene for women prisoners.  

The parties began engaging in settlement negotiations and entered an agreement in principle on May 14, 2018.  On May 7, 2019, one named plaintiff moved to relate the case to Gonzalez v. Ahern.  Though opposed by the defendants, on May 15, 2020, the court related this case to Gonzalez v. Ahern.

249,JC-CA-0143,"This putative class-action lawsuit, brought by inmates in Orange County Jail, argued that county and the sheriff violated the U.S. Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in failing to provide adequate care amidst the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Plaintiffs sought habeas corpus, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. 

The district court granted class certification and partially granted a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which mandated more social distancing, providing for more PPE, and improved sanitation policies. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, and applied in both the district court and the Ninth Circuit to stay the case in the lower court until the appeals court had ruled. Both denied these applications, however the Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court saying that the defendants could try to modify the injunction if there were any changed circumstances. Defendants did so, but the district court denied any modifications once again. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which likewise rejected the defendants' motion. Finally, the defendants went to the Supreme Court and asked them to stay the injunction while the Ninth Circuit heard the case on the merits. The Supreme Court obliged on August 5, staying the injunction.

258,JC-KY-0006,"Built in 1991, the Campbell County Detention Center was designed to hold 135 prisoners. It quickly became overcrowded. In the weeks before this lawsuit was filed in the district court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, on April 29, 2005, the jail's population reached a high of 276 prisoners, many of whom were forced to sleep on the floor.  Many of the inmates were awaiting transfer to the Kentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC), which was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.  The KDOC addressed overcrowding at the jail by simply reducing the required floor space for each prisoner from 50 to 40 square feet. This lawsuit, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by attorney Robert B. Newman of the Cincinnati, Ohio, law firm Newman & Meeks, alleged the overcrowding violated the prisoners' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs, the class of inmates at the detention center, sought injunctive relief and nominal damages.

The DOJ concluded that the conditions and practices at the Detention Center violated the constitutional rights of convicted inmates and pre-trial detainees. On November 11, 2004, the DOJ and Sante Fe County entered into a Memorandum of Agreement, which detailed the agreed reforms and set forth timetables for completion.  By its terms, the Agreement was to last for a period of three years, and remedy unconstitutional practices relating to: (1) medical and mental health care; (2) suicide prevention; (3) protection of inmates from harm; (4) fire safety; (5) sanitation; and (6) inmate grievance procedures (including court access).

281,MH-MA-0005,"This was a class-action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs alleged that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had failed to provide medically necessary services as required under the federal Medicaid Act, and that it had failed to inform parents and children that they were entitled to these covered services. The district court found that the Commonwealth violated provisions of the federal Medicaid Act by failing to provide home-based services to thousands of children across the state. In 2007, the district court approved a remedial plan intended to restructure the children’s mental health system by incorporating intensive home-based services, including behavioral health screenings, assessments, case management, crisis intervention and in-home therapeutic supports. It also appointed a monitor to oversee implementation and compliance. The parties agreed to extend the monitor’s appointment several times, with the final extension expiring on December 31, 2018. In July 2019, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to again extend the monitor’s appointment; the First Circuit overturned this ruling on May 4, 2020.

Defendants. This action seeks to enhance public understanding of an urgent concern: discrimination in immigration enforcement against Muslims, Latinos, and other members of disfavored groups by the U.S. Department of State (“DOS”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The contemporary importance of this issue is no accident. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald J. Trump asserted he would ban all Muslims, including refugees fleeing war-torn regions of the world, from entering the United States. Candidate Trump also perpetuated harmful and racially charged stereotypes about Mexican and other Latino immigrants, to whom he referred as murderers, rapists, and “bad hombres.” He subsequently called for “extreme vetting” of immigrants. In his first week in office, President Trump continued his anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric and moved promptly to issue a thinly veiled “Muslim Ban” executive order that indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugeeCase 3:17-cv-01061-RMS Document 101 Filed 05/21/20 Page 1 of 4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT COUNCIL ON AMERICAN-ISLAMIC RELATIONS – CONNECTICUT and MAKE THE ROAD NEW YORK, Plaintiffs, v.

In this Freedom of Information Act matter, pursuant to the parties’ stipulation of November 15, 2019, ECF No. 88, and this Court’s Order of November 18, 2019, ECF No. 89, Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”) is required to process 1,500 pages of potentially responsive documents every six weeks and produce those non-exempt records which have been fully processed. 2. CBP has now largely completed processing potentially responsive records in this matter, and after the next production of May 22, 2020, less than 1,500 potentially responsive pages will remain for review and potential production. 3. Of the remaining potentially responsive pages, multiple documents may require referral or consultation with outside agencies or entities within the Government, and CBP cannot Case 3:17-cv-01061-RMS Document 101 Filed 05/21/20 Page 2 of 4 currently predict when such referrals or consultations will be completed and when all such documents will be fully processed. 4.

INTRODUCTION 1. Defendants, Carnival Corporation (""Carnival"") and Fathom Travel Ltd., Corporation, (""Fathom"") (hereinafter collectively referred to as ""Defendants"") are refusing to allow Cuban-born persons to board its Fathom cruise line to Cuba, the first American cruise line to cruise to Cuba in over 50 years. 2.

Defendants have adopted Cuba's policy to disallow Cuban-born persons from traveling to Cuba by ship. Case 1:16-cv-21319-MGC Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/12/2016 Page 2 of 11 4.

Defendants' conduct including its refusal to allow any Cuban-born on the Fathom cruise line to Cuba is uniform among all passengers.

310,PB-AL-0006,"In June 2014, a same-sex couple who had been lawfully married outside the State of Alabama filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against the State of Alabama. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that Alabama's refusal to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples validly entered into outside of the State violated the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Subsequent to the Obergefell decision in June 2015 by the Supreme Court, Judge R. David Proctor dismissed this case without prejudice in October 2015, and costs were to be taxed against the defendants. The plaintiffs’ appealed to the Eleventh Circuit in January 2016, but in February 2017, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court’s ruling that there was no judicially sanctioned change in the relationship of the parties that would justify an award of attorney’s fees. Parties submitted informal notice that counsel no longer sought to pursue costs in this case in May 2017, and there has been no further action in this case.

312,PB-CA-0012,"In March and November of 2003, two separate cases (Clayworth v. Bonta and Cal. Med. Assoc. v. Bonta) were filed by Medicaid service providers and recipients seeking to enjoin California from reducing its disbursement rate to Medicaid providers by 5%. The cases were both filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, and the Court found that the issues in the cases were substantially similar and therefore chose to relate them, assigning them to the same Judge. The Judge at the District Court granted a preliminary injunction preventing California from implementing the rate reduction, finding that to do so would violate the federally guaranteed right to equal access to quality medical services for Medicaid beneficiaries. The Defendant appealed, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that their was no cause of action that would allow Medicaid providers or recipients to challenge a State's compliance with the equal access provisions of Medicaid. The cases were later dismissed.","2003 WL 24891765 (E.D.Cal.) (Trial Pleading) United States District Court, E.D. California.

On August 26, 2020, the court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the interim final rule. On November 9, the court approved a permanent injunction that prevented the defendants from implementing the April 30 guidance and July 1 rule and from taking any action inconsistent with the proportional share formula in Section 1117 or other restrictions or penalties on the use of CARES Act funds.

315,PB-DC-0009,"In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (“Obamacare”) that expanded Medicare coverage to include additional groups of beneficiaries. Arkansas approved a work requirement in Medicaid as a requirement for health coverage in its amendments on March 5, 2018.

On August 14, 2018, three individuals filed a suit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as administrators involved in implementing the Arkansas Works Amendments (AMA) in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the SSA and the Constitution in approving the AWA in March 2018. All three plaintiffs were beneficiaries of Medicaid who lost or risked losing medical coverage due to changes in the AWA. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the AWA and attorney fees. 

On March 27, 2019, the court held that the AWA work requirement does not advance the purpose of the SSA. The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and vacated the approval for Arkansas’s program. On April 10, 2019, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 

On February 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment vacating the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas Works Amendments. The court emphasized that providing healthcare coverage is the primary purpose of Medicaid. The defendants' alternative objectives of better health outcomes, financial independence, and transition to commercial coverage, on the other hand, were not consistent with Medicaid. The court found the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas program to be arbitrary and capricious due to the failure to consider whether the program would result in loss of coverage, an important aspect of the approval analysis.","STAYED,TYPE ⁇ C U.S. District Court District of Columbia (Washington, DC) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 1:18 ⁇ cv ⁇ 01900 ⁇ JEB GRESHAM et al v.

317,PB-DC-0013,"In June 2020, the Trump Administration's Department of Health and Human Services issued a revised regulation under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act that limited protections for discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. A group of LGBTQ-focused private healthcare providers, organizations providing community services, health professional associations, and individual providers filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the revised rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act, First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. On September 2, the court found that the plaintiffs had standing for most of their claims, and enjoined the Administration from implementing two provisions: (1) the 2020 Rule's elimination of ""sex stereotyping"" from the 2016 Rule's definition of ""discrimination on the basis of sex"" and (2) the 2020 Rule's use of Title IX's exemption of certain religious organizations from the statute’s nondiscrimination mandate. It denied relief for the 2020 Rule's elimination of the 2016 Rule’s prohibition on categorical coverage exclusions for gender-affirming care, repeal of the 2020 Rule's notice requirements, and alleged violation of Section 1554, in addition to the plaintiffs' constitutional claims.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al., Defendants. Civil Action No. 20-1630 (JEB) MEMORANDUM OPINION In an effort to improve access to health care for LGBTQ individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services in 2016 promulgated a Rule that offered a bevy of protections for such patients. Those included explicit prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sex stereotyping, limits on exemptions from providing treatment that certain religious entities could invoke, proscriptions of categorical coverage exclusions, and a number of others. Believing that many of these protections were either unnecessary or misguided, the current administration has recently issued a Rule that revises or repeals the 2016 Rule in significant respects. Concerned by this change in policy, private health-care facilities that provide services to LGBTQ people, LGBTQ-services organizations, national associations of health professionals, and individual physicians and behavioral-health providers have joined forces to bring suit challenging the new Rule under both the Administrative Procedure Act and various constitutional provisions.

They all had been receiving medically necessary therapies paid for by the State's Medicaid program, administered by the FSAA, for several years. These therapies were necessary to ensure the plaintiffs' conditions would not deteriorate and that they would not lose functional ability. The FSSA had denied the named plaintiffs and others similarly situated continuing access to these therapies, citing two provisions of the Indiana Administrative Code. On February 10, 2011, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs, issuing a permanent injunction preventing the Defendants and their successors from limiting or denying coverage for prescribed physical, occupational, or respiratory therapy, and/or speech pathology, for any person under 21 enrolled in the State's Medicaid program when such denial or limitation was based upon the two disputed provisions.","Case 1:10-cv-00358-JMS-TAB Document 1 Filed 03/25/10 Page 1 of 19 PageID #: 1 F ⁇ U;;O IN THE IU""t ⁇ JI ⁇ ""  ⁇  D,,',!'.I.'i1 ⁇ ,1 ⁇  (1 ⁇ :i (Case 1:10-cv-00358-JMS-TAB Document 12 Filed 03/25/10 Page 1 of 3 PageID #: 67 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION A.M.T., et al., ) ) Plaintiffs, ) ) vsCase 1:10-cv-00358-JMS-TAB Document 23 Filed 04/16/10 Page 1 of 27 PageID #: 114 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION A.M.T., by his mother and next friend Karla ) T., et al.Case 1:10-cv-00358-JMS-TAB Document 36 Filed 05/21/10 Page 1 of 1 PageID #: 190 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION A.M.T., by his mother and next friend Karla ) T., et al.Case 1:10-cv-00358-JMS-TAB Document 55 Filed 09/20/10 Page 1 of 1 PageID #: 633 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION A.M.T., by his mother and next friend Karla ) T., et alCase 1:10-cv-00358-JMS-TAB Document 57 Filed 09/28/10 Page 1 of 3 PageID #: 636 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION A.M.T., BY HIS MOTHER AND NEXT FRIEND ) KARLA T., ETCase 1:10-cv-00358-JMS-TAB Document 58 Filed 10/01/10 Page 1 of 4 PageID #: 639 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION A.M.T., by his mother and next friend Karla ) T., et alCase 1:10-cv-00358-JMS-TAB Document 84 Filed 11/12/10 Page 1 of 3 PageID #: 822 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION A.M.T., et al., ) Plaintiffs, ) ) vs. )UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION A.M.T., by his mother and next friend Karla ) T., et al., ) Plaintiffs, ) ) vs. ) ) MICHAEL A.

327,PB-MD-0004,"On March 28, 2018, the NAACP and Prince George’s County, Maryland filed a claim against the U.S. Census Bureau and President Donald Trump for neglecting their constitutional duty to administer a fair and accurate census of the US population. The plaintiffs alleged that underfunding and the flawed design of the 2020 Census might lead to undercounts of the US population in violation of the Enumeration Clause and to the detriment of minority populations, as the census count is tied to both public funding and governmental representation. The plaintiffs requested an injunction to require the US to develop a plan to ensure a fair and accurate count. The court dismissed the claim for injunctive relief as unripe because census preparations were ongoing, but allowed the claim on underfunding to continue. The court also allowed the plaintiffs to add two claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. On April 16, 2020, the court granted the government’s motion to dismiss; the case is closed.

328,PB-ME-0002,"On December 18, 2009 three young adult residents of Maine who were Medicaid recipients and who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, filed a lawsuit against the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services in her official capacity. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs alleged that DHHS had violated Title II of the ADA and other federal laws. The Plaintiffs alleged that the State had failed to accommodate Plaintiffs' disabilities and to provide medically necessary treatment in the most integrated setting possible, instead forcing them into nursing homes where they were functionally segregated from the outside world. In August, 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint reframing the case as a class action on behalf of all similarly situated Maine residents. The parties began settlement discussions shortly thereafter. On May 2, 2012, the Court (Judge Nancy Torresen) approved the settlement. The settlement agreement required the State to establish a Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW) program, which would provide a limited number of qualifying class-members the opportunity to live in community-based settings. The case is presumably closed.","Settlement Agreement Plaintiffs, Jacob Van Meter, Gail Fletcher as guardian of Adam Fletcher, and Eric Reeves, and Defendant, Mary Mayhew, Commissioner, Maine Department of Health and Human Services, by and through the undersigned counsel, hereby agree as follows: WHEREAS, the parties have agreed to settle Civil Action Docket No. 1:09-cv-00633, Van Meter, et. al. v.

337,PB-PA-0022,"Polk Center and White Haven Center were Pennsylvania state facilities that cared for individuals with severe mental and disabilities. The centers represented a type of care facility that function by providing intense care for their residents in isolation from the rest of society. In August of 2019, Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Wolf announced a plan to move residents from these two centers to ""community"" residences, which are not isolated and whose treatment is not as intense. The lawsuit alleged that this switch was in violation of the residents' rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Medicaid Act, and that the switch violated residents' substantive due process rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.","Case: 3:20-cv-148 As of: 05/21/2020 09:48 PM EDT 1 of 3 SCR United States District Court Middle District of Pennsylvania (Scranton) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 3:20 ⁇ cv ⁇ 00148 ⁇ MEM Jennings et al v.

341,PB-TX-0012,"In 2016, states and religiously affiliated healthcare providers filed this lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiffs alleged that the Affordable Care Act's regulation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex (which included gender identity and termination of pregnancy) violated the Administrative Procedure Act, Religious Freedom Restoration Act and constitutional rights. In October 2016, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of this regulation, which was granted on December 31, 2016. Defendants' motion to stay the preliminary injunction was denied in January 2017. In May 2017, the defendants filed a motion for voluntary remand and stay, arguing that HHS should be given the opportunity to reconsider the regulation at issue in this case, which would conserve the resources of both parties and the court. In July 2017, Judge O’Connor declined to remand the case, but imposed a stay of all proceedings while HHS reconsidered the regulation. He clarified that the December 31, 2016 preliminary injunction order would be unaffected by the stay and would remain in full force and effect throughout the stay. In December 2018, the stay was lifted, and the parties resumed litigating the case. In September 2019, Judge O'Connor vacated the rule's challenged provisions. An appeal is pending before the Fifth Circuit.

The parties reached a settlement, which was filed on March 11, 1999.

345,PC-CA-0056,"In 2008, a California inmate filed a lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, alleging that the CDCR acted unconstitutionally by segregating the prisoners by race and locking down an entire race of prisoners due to the actions of certain prisoners of that race. The case survived the defendants' motion to dismiss and class certification was granted. 

In October 2014, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the CDCR agreed to a number of terms, including to cease implementation of race-based modified programs or lockdowns; to provide outdoor activity to prisoners in a modified program or lockdown for longer than fourteen days; to revise its policies concerning modified programs and lockdowns, and to train its staff on modified programs and lockdowns. The defendants also agreed to pay attorneys fees and costs. The court retained jurisdiction for 18 months to enforce compliance with the agreement, and on December 20, 2016, the parties filed notice that the court’s jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement had terminated and that the case was dismissed with prejudice in its entirety.

The plaintiffs proposed a class of all current and future people in post-conviction custody at Lompoc, and sought enlargement of custody to include home confinement, and if the conditions of confinement violated constitutional rights, for prisoners to be released. The plaintiffs also sought a TRO (temporary restraining order), and a preliminary injunction requiring Lompoc to undertake health and safety measures, and attorney fees. On September 18, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case and on October 8, the court granted plaintiff's motion to enforce compliance with the preliminary injunction.

347,PC-CT-0003,"On August 22, 1980, inmates filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Connecticut Corrections Department.  This case was consolidated and named lead case with five other cases filed against the defendant in 1981 and 1982. The plaintiffs were represented by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union and Legal Assistance to Prisoners. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff's rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated because the facility was overcrowded, unsanitary, lacking in security, and unable to provide adequately the basics of general human living needs. Judgments were reached that required screening of all admitted inmates, individualized health care summaries for HIV-positive inmates, routine health examinations, and the use of drug therapies for HIV-positive inmates; as well as requiring that the prison not increase its inmate population, continue operating as a medium security facility, and allow plaintiffs' lawyers access to the facility.","J3CM rr-.Ol I Bartkus v.

The plaintiffs brought suit individually and as a class on behalf of all those incarcerated in a DDOC facility as of October 1, 2008 or later who were not or will not be released within 12 hours of the expiration of their sentence or the forwarding of a court order for release. In 2015, the district court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment because the plaintiffs' failed to demonstrate that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the overdetention problem. On appeal, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the defendants.

In fact, the TTY is becoming increasingly obsolete and useless. In light of this, Plaintiff requested that he be provided the use of a videophone. A videophone would allow him to communicate with an increased number of people using his primary language. The request for a videophone was denied.

The case settled in 2011, and the defendants agreed to make sure that mentally ill prisoners were not placed in isolation or segregation without a full evaluation and determination that such placement would not cause further injury; they also agreed to pay attorney fees. The case was closed in 2015 as no one had requested to reopen the case since the settlement monitoring date ended.

368,PC-NJ-0015,"This was a prison medical care case filed in 2002 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking damages and an injunction against contract medical care providers and New Jersey corrections officials.  The plaintiffs that the New Jersey prison system was failing to treat them for Hepatitis C.  By the time the court adjudicated the class action issue, in May 2008, the New Jersey Department of Corrections had adopted major changes in how prisoners with HCV were treated; it updated its procedures to match those of the federal Bureau of Prisons, and ""backscreened"" all the prisoners willing to be screened for the virus.  Given that the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs was this same set of reforms, Judge Hillman denied the request for injunctive relief as moot.  As to two individual class members who had HCV, the court held there was sufficient evidence in the record to go to trial on their constitutional claims (though not on their Americans with Disabilities Act claims), and denied the state's motion for summary judgment.  In October 2009, the case settled for money damages.  (However, it seems from some papers filed by one of the plaintiffs that he may never actually have received  his money.  But when he sought the assistance of the court in enforcing the settlement against his lawyer, Judge Hillman ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction, and directed him to file a collection action in state court.  )",", • Case 1:02-cv-04993-NLH-AMD  ⁇ .

(""RLUIPA"") against the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections and the Administrator at the New Jersey State Prison (NJSP). Specifically, plaintiff claimed that defendants violated plaintiff's First Amendment right by implementing a policy banning all prisoners from preaching in the prison.  During the litigation, the state changed its policy to allow the plaintiff to preach to groups of six or fewer prisoners, and on November 25, 2009, the parties filed a Stipulation of Dismissal, as the claims in the action had been resolved by the parties.","Edward Barocas Nadia Seeratan ACLU ofNew Jersey Foundation P.O.

The case was consolidated to include the complaints of two other prisoners. The prisoners won both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to provide them a Kosher diet at no personal cost.

376,PC-PA-0035,"On July 27, 2012, plaintiff, a male prisoner, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Pennsylvania under Bivens against the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants violated plaintiff's right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution by forcing him to share a cell with a hostile prisoner, which caused a threat of violence, and by placing him in painful restraints that caused injury for prolonged periods on multiple occasions for refusing dangerous cell assignments with hostile prisoners; and that defendants violated his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution by depriving him of any meaningful process prior to and during their use of punitive measures against him. On April 9, 2013, the U.S. District Court (Judge William B. Nealon) granted in part and denied in part defendant's motion to dismiss, declining to certify the class. The Third Circuit reversed and remanded the district court's denial of class action certification on June 15, 2016, but the district court again denied certification.

380,PC-TX-0022,"On May 21, 2012, a Native American prisoner incarcerated at the McConnell Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) filed this pro se federal civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. He sued multiple TDCJ employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. He alleged that TDJC policies that prevented his smoking a prayer pipe during Native American pipe ceremonies, limited his ability to wear a religiously significant medicine bag, and prevented him from growing long hair violated his rights under RLUIPA and the First Amendment. He sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief as well as attorney's fees and costs. An additional Native American prisoner plaintiff joined the suit shortly after filing. 

In February 2013, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, consented to proceedings before a Magistrate Judge, and voluntarily dismissed all of their claims except their three RLUIPA challenges against the TDCJ Director in his official capacity and their First Amendment claim seeking damages against the Program Analyst in his individual capacity. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. On February 27, 2014, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment was granted and a final judgment entered in their favor. The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit and were successful in getting judgement on the RLUIPA grooming policy claim vacated and remanded. On remand, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the RLUIPA grooming claim was denied. As the RLUIPA grooming policy claim moved towards trial, the initial prisoner plaintiff in the case was released and his claims were dismissed. The Court ordered the consolidation of cases Casey v. Davis (2:14-cv-13) and Cobb v. Morris (2:14-cv-22) with this case, as the two cases also were brought by Native American prisoner incarcerated at the McConnell Unit and involved RLUIPA grooming policy claims moving towards trial. After a bench trial, Judge Ramos granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief permitting them to grow their hair long, consistent with their Native American religious beliefs and entered a final judgment on February 26, 2019. The defendant appealed, but moved to dismiss the appeal shortly after. The Fifth Circuit granted the motion to dismiss the appeal on July 9, 2019. This case is closed.","Case: 2:12-cv-166 As of: 07/21/2019 01:39 PM CDT 1 of 27 CLOSED,LEAD,PRIS U.S. District Court SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS (Case 2:12-cv-00166 Document 1 Filed on 05/21/12 in TXSD Page 1 of 9 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF TEXAS _ _ _ _ Case 2:12-cv-00166 Document 16 Filed on 06/22/12 in TXSD Page 1 of 2 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS CORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION TEDIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS CORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION TEDDY NORRIS GREY HAWK DAVIS,  ⁇  ET AL.,  ⁇  Plaintiffs  ⁇ Case 2:12-cv-00166 Document 41 Filed on 09/17/12 in TXSD Page 1 of 4 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS CORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION TEDDY NORRIS DAIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS CORPUS CHRISTI DIVISION TEDDY NORRIS DAVIS, ET AL., Plaintiffs v.

382,PC-VA-0022,"On December 19, 2014, three Virginia prisoners placed in administrative segregation at Red Onion State Prison, filed this pro-se lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. They brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Eighth Amendment. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as money damages. The plaintiffs claimed that the VDOC Operating Procedure 830.A, (a self-described Segregation Reduction Step-Down Program designed to help prisoners progress in stages toward a return to the general prison population), violated plaintiffs’ rights.

On October 6, 2016, the plaintiff appealed the district court’s September 28th ruling to the Fourth Circuit.

384,PC-VA-0025,"In 2016, the plaintiff filed a pro se complaint in the District Court for the Western District of Virginia against the Virginia Department of Corrections alleging that their policies for beards, halal food, and television access for religious services for inmates in solitary confinement violated the Free Exercise Clause and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. Judge John P. Jones denied the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief in 2017 and initially granted summary judgment in favor of VDOC in 2018, but the Fourth Circuit overturned him on appeal in late 2019, saying that VDOC's use of access to television for religious services as an incentive program unduly burdens the plaintiff's rights to practice a bona fide religious belief. The panel stated that religious practice should be a right, not a privilege that can be taken away through an incentive program.

387,PC-WA-0026,"Washington state prisoners with serious medical problems sued the Washington Department of Corrections for failing to provide adequate medical care. The plaintiffs believed that the DOC applied the term ""medically necessary"" too narrowly and denied immediate care and that decisions to provide outside treatment are decided arbitrarily, without medical justification. The plaintiffs sought class action certification but Judge Richard A. Jones denied the certification on September 18, 2017 on the grounds that the proposed class lacked commonality. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an appeal by the plaintiffs later that year. Between June 2018 and March 2019, each remaining plaintiff filed to dismiss himself as a party. As a result, the court closed the case on March 27, 2019 when no plaintiffs remained.","Case 2:15-cv-01810-RAJ Document 1 Filed 11/17/15 Page 1 of 17 1 2 3 r;1 4  ⁇  5  ⁇  6  ⁇  7 8 '* 9  ⁇  10 11  ⁇  12 - ⁇  13 14 'J ⁇  15  ⁇  16  ⁇  ':S 17  ⁇  18 19 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON AT SEATTLE DANIEL HALDANE, WENDEL JOHNf>fi TIMOTHY MARTIN, and LEESHAwti'- REDIC, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, CV-1810 No. CLASS ACTION vs. G.

On June 15, 2016 the parties filed a joint motion for judgment granting final declaratory and partial injunctive relief. On October 27, 2016 the court sua sponte raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, giving both parties a chance to submit briefs addressing the issue.

On September 25, 2017 plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On October 4, 2018 the Fifth Circuit dismissed the case as moot because it found that since the appeal was filed, Louisiana lawmakers had reallocated funding for appointed counsel sufficient to render the waitlists for non-capital defendants nonexistent.

OF ALABAMA COMPLAINT 1 Case 4:13-cv-01701-JHE Document 1 Filed 09/12/13 Page 2 of 23 INTRODUCTION 1. The Etowah County Sheriffs Office operates a program of unannounced, random and suspicionless compliance investigations of every individual in the county who is subject to the registration requirements of the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Community Notification Act. Essential to the Sheriffs Office's program is that officers search the home of each registrant. Officers must also question the registrant about his or her registration information. 2. The Sheriffs Office conducts this program without regard to such factors as whether an individual was convicted as an adult or adjudicated as a juvenile; whether the individual presents a substantial risk of reoffending; whether the individual is on probation or parole; or whether the individual is fully compliant with his or her registration requirements. Under the Sheriffs Office's program, officers have unfettered discretion as to how often and when they conduct these unannounced inspections, so long as the officers make personal contact with every registrant at least once per month. 3. Plaintiff James Doe is an Etowah County resident who, under the Act, is required to register as a juvenile. To do so, he must appear in person at the office of Etowah County Sheriffs' Office four times per year. Nonetheless, the Sheriffs Office has conducted at least nine separate inspections at James' home, where he resides with his parents, Plaintiffs John Doe and Jane Doe. Sheriffs' Office officers routinely search Plaintiffs' home without consent during these inspections. Officers also interrogate Plaintiffs about James' registration information. Defendants have threatened to arrest Plaintiffs if they fail to cooperate. 4. Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C.  ⁇  1983 to vindicate their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and10/24/2017 CM/ECF - U.S. District Court Northern District of Alabama CLOSED,CONMAG U.S. District Court Northern District of Alabama (Middle) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 4:13-cv-01701-JHE Doe et al v.

393,PN-CA-0018,"On June 26, 2003, two separate suits were filed against the City of Oakland and the Oakland Police Department (OPD), and related defendants, in federal court. The suits were filed in response to the OPD's actions on April 7 at a peaceful antiwar demonstration at the Port of Oakland. The Police, without giving sufficient notice to disperse and without provocation, barraged demonstrators with a variety of ""less-lethal"" munitions, while blocking the main exit routes. Police pursued demonstrators and others present when they attempted to disperse, while continuing to fire at them and intentionally strike them with motorcycles. On August 11, 2003, the Court ordered that the cases be officially related and heard before the same judge. One of the two cases, Local 10 ILWU v. City of Oakland, was filed as a class-action on behalf of all persons who attended the April 7 demonstration. The suit also named as plaintiffs Local 10 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, plus nine of its members who were ""standing by"" in the vicinity of the demonstration but not active participants in it. The other suit, Coles v. City of Oakland, sought relieve for several individual demonstrators who were allegedly injured by the OPD. In both cases, Plaintiffs sought compensatory, exemplary, and punitive damages, as well as to recover legal costs. They also sought declaratory judgments holding the Defendants' actions to be unlawful violations of the Plaintiffs' rights under the Constitutions of the U.S. and of California and of statutory law. They sought injunctions that among other things would prohibit the Defendants from unlawfully interference with the constitutional and statutory rights of participants in public demonstrations and protests.

On December 24, 2004, the parties entered a court-approved partial settlement addressing the Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief to the extent that those claims related to the Defendants' crowd control policies. Oakland adopted a new official Crowd Control Policy that forbade the police from dispersing crowds that had not behaved illegally or that did not pose a clear and present danger of imminent violence. It also forbade the indiscriminate use of less-lethal weapons directly against crowds, even when specific individuals in the group were violent. The remaining issues eventually settled, with awards of damages and attorneys' fees well in excess of $1,000,000.","Case3:03-cv-02961-TEH Document1 Filed06/26/03 Page1 of 16 MICHAEL J.

394,PN-CA-0020,"The plaintiff filed the lawsuit on November 29, 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff, a demonstrator involved in the Occupy Oakland protest movement, alleged that when he was returning home from a protest, two Oakland police officers brutally beat him with clubs, sprayed painful chemicals in his face, and arrested him. The suit was filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and alleged that the polices' actions violated his First Amendment right to free speech, his Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process, and the Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.

The parties reached a settlement requiring the police department to reform its policies. However, after the judgment, the plaintiffs filed for sanctions twice because the police department had not implemented the policies. 

In response to a joint motion by the parties, the Court ordered the appointment of a special master on June 22, 2016 to monitor the Atlanta Police Department's compliance with court orders and assist the parties in addressing any obstacles with compliance or relevant discovery. After some time, the special master noted several disputes between the parties. The Court ordered the police department to show cause why it should not be held in contempt for violating the court order.

401,PN-IL-0007,"In November 1974, several individuals and groups filed a civil rights action against Chicago's mayor and police officials, claiming that they had engaged in unlawful intelligence gathering and electronic surveillance. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants had violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and they sought both damages and injunctive relief.

After the case was consolidated with a number of related cases, in August 1981, the parties entered into a consent decree settlement. The consent decree barred the City from political spying, harassment, and investigation of certain activities protected by the First Amendment. Despite the settlement, decades of litigation addressing enforcement of the decree followed.

In April 2011, the district court granted the City's motion to dismiss the case. The court's order permitted the plaintiffs to file a motion to reinstate the consent decree within 45 days if the City did not conduct an audit showing compliance with the terms of the agreement. There was no further legal action taken by either party.","IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS EASTERN DMSION J rVAlliance to End Repression v.

413,PN-OR-0003,"This class-action lawsuit was filed on June 28, 2020 in response to Portland Police Bureau's allegedly illegal tactics in quelling the protests in that city after the police killing of George Floyd in May of 2020. The plaintiffs, who were members of media and legal observers of the protests, argued that their First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the PPB's use of pepper spray and rubber bullets, among other weapons. They sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief. 

The court granted a TRO against the city, prohibiting the police from arresting or seizing the equipment of reporters or legal observers of the protests. The court later granted a preliminary injunction against the city.  

By July 16, President Trump had sent in federal officers from the DHS and USMS as reinforcement. The plaintiffs added those two organizations as defendants and filed a motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction. 

The motion for temporary restraining order and the motion for preliminary injunction were both granted. These decisions were appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has yet to rule on them. However, on October 9, the Ninth Circut declined to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The federal defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which remains pending.

425,PR-WA-0001,"On March 5, 2019, the State of Washington filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for violating Title X’s “Nondirective Mandate,” the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Title X generally, and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706). On March 4, 2019, HHS published a Final Rule, scheduled to go into effect on May 3, 2019, which would alter longstanding regulations governing Title X grants for family planning services. Washington sought declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate the Final Rule and prohibit HHS from implementing or enforcing it, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. On March 18, 2019, this case was consolidated for pretrial proceedings with a separate case filed by the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA; a national membership organization of Title X providers that operate or administer more than 3,500 health centers providing family planning services to more than 3.7 million patients each year), a Washington-based NFPRHA member organization, and two health care professionals, challenging the same HHS Rule on behalf of themselves and their patients.

Washington and the NFPRHA parties filed preliminary injunctions on March 22, 2019, seeking to prohibit HHS from implementing the Final Rule. Judge Bastian granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Final Rule nationwide until further order of the court. On May 3, 2019, defendants filed a notice of appeal and motion to stay the preliminary injunction, as well as a notice of interlocutory and preliminary injunction appeal regarding plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction.

On June 20, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a three-judge panel per curiam decision granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit noted that the Final Rule was challenged in federal court in California, Oregon, and Washington (this case), and district courts in each case granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. HHS appealed in each case and sought to stay the injunctions pending a decision of the merits of its appeals. The panel found that HHS was likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and that the remaining factors also favored a stay pending appeal. 

On June 25, 2019, plaintiffs in the Oregon and Washington cases filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc regarding the stay. On July 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that the three cases (California, Oregon, and Washington) be reheard en banc, and that the motions for stay pending appeal granted by the Ninth Circuit panel would not be cited as precedent by or to any court of the Ninth Circuit. 

On July 11, 2019, the Ninth Circuit en banc court denied the motions for administrative stay of the three-judge panel’s order granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The en banc court stated they would proceed expeditiously to rehear and reconsider the merits of Defendant-Appellants’ motions for stay of the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders pending consideration of the appeals on the merits. This case is ongoing.","STAYED,9CCA REMAND,CONSOLIDATED,LC01 Eastern District of Washington U.S. District Court (Yakima) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 1:19-cv-03040-SAB State of Washington v.

426,SD-LA-0013,"In 1964, a group of African American families filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant Jefferson Parish School Board had violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by continuing to segregate the school system. The Court granted injunctive relief, mandated desegregation of the school system, and required that the defendants use busing to speed up the integration process. The injunction remained in place for several decades. In 2007, the School Board sought to implement a magnet school program in the hopes of boosting academics and increasing school diversity. The parties jointly moved to supplement the desegregation plan to include the magnet school program, and the Court issued Consent Orders in 2008-2009 that enabled the School Board's plans. However, issues arose in the following years with the School Board's implementation of the plan. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants were using the Consent Orders as a pretext to conceal attempts to continue a system of racially segregated schools. After the Consent Orders expired, the parties reached a settlement agreement and the Court declared Jefferson Parish Schools unitary in 2011.

The case went to the Supreme Court, which held that the school's admission policy that automatically awarded 20 points out of a possible 150 to underrepresented minorities was not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest of diversity in education and so violated the Equal Protection Clause.","Case 2:97-cv-75231-PJD Document 285 Filed 01/31/2007 Page 1 of 11 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN SOUTHERN DIVISION JENNIFER GRATZ and PATRICK HAMACHER, for themselves and all others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, vs.2:97-cv-75231-PJD Doc # 1 Filed 10/14/97 Pg 1 of 9 Pg ID 1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN JENNIFER GRATZ and PATRICK HAMACHER, for themselves and all others similarly2:97-cv-75231-PJD Doc # 48 Filed 10/27/98 Pg 1 of 13 Pg ID 262 JENNIFER GRATZ and PATRICK HAMACHER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN SOUTHERN DIVISION -, CASE NO__ 972:97-cv-75231-PJD Doc # 62 Filed 12/23/98 Pg 1 of 2 Pg ID 340 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN SOUTHERN DIVISION ..------- ⁇ -- ⁇ - ⁇ ..;: ⁇ '-'::2:97-cv-75231-PJD Doc # 144 Filed 05/02/00 Pg 1 of 9 Pg ID 549 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN SOUTHERN DIVISION JENNIFER ORATZ and PATRICK HAMACHER, Plaintiffs, v.

The plaintiffs alleged that the absence of live televised American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation in Governor Cuomo’s daily televised briefings on COVID-19 discriminated against populations with disabilities residing in New York by failing to provide a live ASL interpreter.

On April 9, 2014, the District Court approved a Consent Decree where Rhode Island agreed to, among other things, provide employment planning services to individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities designed to encourage and assist them in working in integrated working environments, provide state support and services for those working in integrated settings and those making the transition to those settings, programs to educate relevant individuals about the programs and benefits that the Rhode Island offers to those working in integrated settings. Rhode Island must also implement policies regarding the services required by the Consent Decree, train its personnel in the new procedures and working with individuals with disabilities, and Rhode Island must help sheltered workshops change their structure to become integrated working environments.","Case 1:14-cv-00175-L-PAS Document 1 Filed 04/08/14 Page 1 of 30 PageID #: 1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND IOIq f ⁇ P ⁇ iCase 1:14-cv-00175-L-PAS Document 5 Filed 04/09/14 Page 1 of 36 PageID #: 82 Case 1:14-cv-00175-L-PAS Document 3-2 Filed 04/08/Case 1:14-cv-00175-JJM-PAS Document 35 Filed 05/18/16 Page 1 of 8 PageID #: 2106 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND ) UNITED STATESCase 1:14-cv-00175-JJM-PAS Document 7 Filed 09/17/15 Page 1 of 66 PageID #: 119 Report of the Court Monitor Progress on the Consent Decree United States v.

451,EE-AR-0062,"On August 11, 2005 a group of African-Americans filed a consolidated amended complaint Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in United States District Court of the Eastern District of Arkansas.  The plaintiffs alleged that Wal-Mart discriminated against African-Americans in hiring of over-the-road truck drivers.  On May 16, 2007, the court certified a class of African Americans who had not been hired or had been deterred from applying for these jobs.  Discovery continued in preparation for trial and on January 13, 2009 the court denied the defendant's motions for decertification and summary judgment.    The parties thereafter reached a settlement that was approved by the court on March 5, 2009.  In the settlement Wal-Mart agreed to damages in the amount of $17,500,000 to be distributed to the named representatives, class members, and their attorneys.  It also agreed to provide EEO training, actively recruit minorities, impose benchmarks for hiring minority drivers, make specific job opportunities open to minorities, and engage in recordkeeping and reporting."," ⁇ r ⁇ l-i ',I !; t""r-!.. ⁇ .> ' IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COUR'I'I ⁇ STi ,;, .( ,""I' ,,' ⁇ ''.dJA5 EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS HELENA DIVISION  ⁇  1 1 1 ' ⁇ COS "" .

456,EE-IL-0330,"The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit against Yellow Transportation, Inc., and YRC, Inc., for discriminatory employment practices on behalf of 14 current or former black employees and the class of similarly situated black employees. The EEOC alleged that Yellow Transportation (later merged into YRC) had violated §703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) by subjecting black employees to greater scrutiny, more frequent and greater discipline, lower paying and less favorable job assignments, more difficult and time-consuming work, and a hostile work environment. The EEOC sought injunctive and monetary relief, including economic and noneconomic harm to the employees, punitive damages, development of policies and programs to provide equal employment opportunity and eradicate the effects of its past discrimination. The EEOC also sought to recover its costs. The charging parties later intervened as plaintiffs on their own behalf, adding claims for retaliation. The parties reached a settlement, which was entered as a consent decree. The decree resolved this case and the related case <i>Brown v. Yellow Transportation, Inc.</i> , linked below (Clearinghouse code: EE-IL-0329).  The decree awarded a total of $11 million ($1.1 million in attorney's fees) and no significant injunctive relief because of a consent decree in other litigation.

They claimed that the executive order violated freedom of speech under the First Amendment by denying benefits to private entities that express ideas the Trump Administration doesn't like. The plaintiffs also argued that the executive order violated the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause because the order was too vague and created with an intent to discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, sex, and/or gender.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Every nation’s history includes unsettling truths that many would prefer to forget or deny. But true patriotism demands confronting the truths of our history—no matter how embarrassing or dishonorable—and undertaking the difficult work of learning from the lessons of our past in order to move forward. For the United States, that work requires reckoning with our shameful legacy of racial subjugation of Black people in this country— from slavery and Jim Crow to mass incarceration and police violence—as well as our long history of express discrimination against other people of color, women, and LGBTQ persons. 2. Without uninhibited discussion and examination of that legacy, we are ill-equipped as a nation to address its ongoing manifestations in present-day forms of discrimination and bias. The First Amendment protection of free speech in the United States Constitution ensures that all Americans are empowered to engage freely in an exchange of ideas, truth-telling, and difficult conversations about this history. This protection extends equally to those who engage with the federal government, where the policies that affect the lives of all Americans are developed, enacted, and","The National Urban League and National Fair Housing Alliance bring this civil rights class action for in and declaratory relief against Defendants President Donald J.

467,FA-IL-0012,"On April 22, 2010, homecare providers who did not wish to support the designated labor union filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking an injunction against enforcement of the agency-fee provision of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA) and a declaration that the law violated the personal assistants' fundamental rights. On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court held that the clearest case on point, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. 431 U. S. 209 (1977), did not apply because the public employees at issue there were distinct from the care providers here. Accordingly, the Court stated the agency-fee provision must serve a compelling state interest that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms. The Court found insufficient the interests contended by Defendants and held the Illinois PLRA unconstitutional.","Case: 1:10-cv-02477 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/22/10 Page 1 of 19 PageID #:1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS P AME LA J .

477,IM-CA-0146,"On July 16, 2019, the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, Al Otro Lado, Innovation Law Lab, and the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles brought this suit against the U.S. Attorney General and  Secretary of Homeland Security. Plaintiffs challenged the federal immigration rule restricting eligibility for asylum for noncitizens who transited through another country prior to reaching the southern U.S. border. Plaintiffs claimed the rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Plaintiffs successfully sought a preliminary nationwide injunction.  However, defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit and the nationwide scope of the injunction was stayed. Then the District Court restored the nationwide scope of the injunction on September 9, 2019, but the government again appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay pending disposition of the appeal in the 9th Circuit. The District Court issued a separate preliminary injunction against another rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in the closing days of the Trump Administration which was substantially similar to the one already enjoined. The Ninth Circuit upheld the original injunction in April, 2021. The case is ongoing but is likely to terminate soon given the change in presidential administrations.","U.S. District Court California Northern District (Oakland) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 4:19-cv-04073-JST East Bay Sanctuary Covenant et al v.

478,IM-CA-0149,"On August 16, 2019, several health care providers and nonprofit organizations serving immigrant communities filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs challenged the Department of Homeland Security's Final Public Charge Rule (the Rule), which added non-cash benefits to the factors considered in determining whether a person applying for legal permanent residence is likely to become a public charge. The plaintiffs alleged that the Government violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding its statutory authority, claimed that the Rule was ""arbitrary and capricious,"" and asserted that the Rule violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In October 2019, a district court judge denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining the government from implementing the Rule, but issued an order for preliminary injunction in a related case that would enjoin the implementation of the rule in California, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Maine, and Pennsylvania. This preliminary injunction was stayed by the Ninth Circuit in December 2019. It was affirmed a year later in December 2020, but the order was stayed pending petitions to the Supreme Court in the Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits. The Rule was abandoned by DHS on March 9, 2021. As of April 15, 2021, the case is ongoing.","ADRMOPTERM U.S. District Court California Northern District (Oakland) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 4:19-cv-04980-PJH La Clinica De La Raza et al v.

The Administration’s action is unconscionable. It is also illegal. For decades, the United States Customs and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) has operated a small but vital humanitarian program that allows immigrant families battling serious illnesses to request immigration relief in the form of “deferred action.” The program recognizes that deporting seriously ill individuals and their families is in many cases tantamount to a death sentence. Deferred action does not grant immigration status to beneficiaries; it confers other benefits, including an opportunity to apply for work authorization, the tolling of any accrual of “unlawful presence” that could bar future entry into the United States, and a measure of protection against removal proceedings by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). Those protected by this program are in dire straits. They include the mother of a U.S. citizen baby that has spent eight of the last ten months in the hospital; a ten-year-old girl with eye cancer; and a partially-immobilized 18-year-old boy with burns over 70% of his body.

Specifically, they alleged that their Fifth and First Amendment rights had been violated by preventing communication with counsel, denying their right to legal representation, and other resources critical to support their cases.

487,IM-OR-0010,"A group of immigration legal service providers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon on December 18, 2019, alleging the federal government had manipulated the immigration adjudication system in a way making it virtually impossible for asylum seekers to succeed. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Take Care Clause of the U.S. Constitution, as well as provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief. After the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs moved for a Temporary Restraining Order due to the COVID-19 pandemic, alleging that the immigration courts had failed to take adequate public health measures to protect judges, respondents, attorneys, and staff. On April 1, 2020, the District Court denied the plaintiffs' motion. On July 31, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion to dismiss. The defendants sought reconsideration, which was denied on September 10. ","Case 3:19-cv-02051-SB Document 28 Filed 03/27/20 Page 1 of 41 Stephen Manning, OSB No. 013373 Bryan D.

488,IM-PA-0009,"On April 15, 2009, two longtime permanent residents of the United States who had been detained in Pennsylvania prisons for periods exceeding six months while they pursued challenges to decisions to deport them filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the prisons that held them, claiming that their prolonged detention without a hearing to determine whether such detention was justified violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. On August 10, 2009, the Court (Judge John E. Jones III) declined to certify a class action or grant habeas class relief but granted the plaintiffs' individual habeas petitions. Alli v. Decker, 644 F. Supp. 2d 535 (M.D. Pa. 2009). Rather than present evidence on the reasonableness of the plaintiffs' detention at a bail hearing, the parties came to an agreement whereby defendants would release the plaintiffs without requiring that they post bail. One plaintiff was released in late January of 2010 under minimal reporting requirements, and the other was released in late March of the same year, subject to electronic monitoring.<br />","UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA ALEXANDER ALLI (A 074 983 378) : ELECTRONICALLY FILED ELLIOT GRENADE (A 36 479 546), : on behalf of themselves and all others : similarly situated, : : Petitioners- Plaintiffs : : Civil Action No: 4:09-cv- vs. : 00698-JEJ-SF : THOMAS R.

489,IM-SC-0001,"This is a class action lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a South Carolina immigration law which requires state and local law enforcement officers to investigate the immigration status of any individual they stop, detain, or arrest whenever they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the individual lacks immigration status, allows law enforcement officers to arrest individuals solely for failing to carry registration documents, makes it a crime to harbor or transport an undocumented immigrant or to be harbored or transported by others if one is an undocumented immigrant, and imposes civil liability on the police for failing to enforce its provisions to the maximum extent possible. The law was patterned after Arizona's SB 1070. The District Court has issued a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the law, and this injunction has been appealed to the Fourth Circuit; in the meantime, the case, along with several others like it from different states, are stayed at the District Court or U.S. Appellate level pending the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Arizona.

After Arizona v. United States was decided the issue was remanded to the District Court. The district court left in place most of its original preliminary injunction, enjoining the state from enforcing Sections 4, 5, and 6 (B)(2). The 4th Circuit per Judge Davis agreed and affirmed the order on July 13, 2013. In March of 2014 Judge Gergel permanently enjoined South Carolina from enforcing Sections 4, 5, and 6(B)(2). Furthermore the state agreed to more favorable interpretations of Section 7, and the remainder of Section, encouraging the Plaintiffs to dismiss their claims on those sections without prejudice.

492,JC-AR-0009,"In August 2018, an inmate filed a civil class action lawsuit against the Pulaski County Jail (PCJ) and six PCJ officials in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. The plaintiff, on behalf of himself and twenty-two other inmates, asked the court for monetary and injunctive relief, claiming that he and other inmates were being kept locked in their cells because the jail was not properly staffed. On September 12, 2018, U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr. entered an initial order providing guidelines for proceeding pro se and finding that a request for class certification at this stage was premature; accordingly, he severed the case as twenty-three separate lawsuits. Twenty-one of the other cases were eventually all dismissed without prejudice due to lack of prosecution by the other inmates. This instant case and one other case (docket no. 4:18-cv-00552), which was also dismissed without prejudice due to lack of prosecution and reopened, are the only two ongoing cases out of the total twenty-three cases initially filed on this matter.","Case 4:18-cv-00541-JM-JTR Document 2 Filed 08/20/18 Page 1 of 9 4:18-cv-00541-JM-JTR Moody Ray Case 4:18-cv-00541-JM-JTR Document 2 Filed 08/20/18 Page 2 of 9 Address: Address: ---+-=;.c:::;;: ⁇ _---:...W..:..• ⁇ -4l&...:...= ⁇ ---==-: ⁇ _,__...L.,;;. ⁇ C' ⁇  II.

On February 22, 2012, the District Court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff, holding that the application of DOMA to deny spousal health benefits in this case did not have a rational basis and thus constituted a Fifth Amendment violation. It entered a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from interfering with the enrollment of the plaintiff's wife in her family health benefits plan.

519,PC-NJ-0023,"On October 23, 2009, an individual plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the District of New Jersey under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Hackensack Police Department, Hackensack Municipal Court, Bergen County Jail in the City of Hackensack, Bergen County Municipal Court, and Bergen County Prosecutor. The plaintiff, bringing suit pro se, sought compensatory and punitive damages plus special damages for future legal fees. The plaintiff specifically claimed that the defendants violated his Second and Fourteenth Amendment rights by attempting to break in and enter his home, threatening to imprison him, fabricating stories to have him incarcerated, and asserting false criminal charges, which led to plaintiff spending three months and five days in county jail. The district court denied the defendant’s and plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment. In Dec. 2014, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to deny summary judgment. Settlement discussions have since been unsuccessful and the case is ongoing in the district court, pending trial once public health conditions allow.","Case 2:09-cv-05429-JLL-JAD Document 5 Filed 02/16/10 Page 1 of 38 PageID: 223 DONELL L.

520,PC-OR-0011,"A deaf prison inmate who primarily communicates in American Sign Language filed a lawsuit under the Americans with Disabilities Act against the Oregon Department of Corrections, claiming they failed to communicate with him for over 14 years. The lawsuit claimed that, instead of providing interpreters, the prison made him train other inmates as his interpreters and they were not qualified to help him and were also privy to confidential information. In May 2016, the Court granted partial summary judgment for the defendant. Following a jury trial on the remaining claims, the Court dismissed the plaintiff's ADA claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the PLRA. The jury awarded the plaintiff $400,000 in noneconomic damages. The Court awarded the plaintiff $683,873.13 in attorneys' fees, $18,155.19 in costs, and $3,924.79 in litigation expenses. Although both parties appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, they agreed to voluntarily dismiss their appeals in September 2017. The case is now closed.

522,PC-PA-0031,"The Disability Rights Network (DRN), a Pennsylvania non-profit, filed this Eighth Amendment suit against the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (PDOC) for the PDOC's use of solitary confinement with severely mentally ill prisoners. On January 5, 2015, the parties executed a settlement agreement for dismissal of the matter, in which the PDOC agreed to implement certain improvements and to pay $750,000 to DRN.  In particular, the PDOC will evaluate all incoming prisoners for serious mental illness, and will place prisoners with serious mental illness in solitary confinement only in ""exceptional"" circumstances; even then, a prisoner with serious mental illness can be kept in solitary confinement for no longer than 30 days and must be allowed out of their cells for 20 hours per week. The settlement also provided for a monitor to report on compliance, and will remain in effect for 3 years (less if the defendant demonstrates substantial compliance for a period of 18 months). There has been no activity on the docket since May 2015 and the case is presumably closed since the three year time period set in the agreement has lapsed.

530,PN-NY-0012,"Individuals issued summonses by the NYPD without probable cause brought a class action suit against the City of New York. They alleged that the NYPD's 'quota' policy is linked to officer promotion and demotion, and as a result, leads to commanding officers ordering police officers to arrest and issue summonses to individuals without probable cause, in contravention of the federal and state constitutions. Judge Sweet, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, granted the case class action status in April 2012.  On January 24, 2017, Judge Sweet preliminary approved the parties' settlement agreement, in which the parties agreed to settlement benefits of up to seventy-five million dollars. On April 18, 2017, the court granted final approval. The case is ongoing for compliance purposes.","Case 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 8 Filed 08/31/10 Page 1 of 66 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK -------------------------------------------------------------------X SHARIF STINSON, MARIAM FARNUM, CHARLEAN FINLEY, RYBURN WALKES, JAMEL TOWE, CHRISTIAN DUDLEY, JOCELEY FERDINUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK  ⁇ "" ⁇ -'-""-""""'-""-'--."" --x SHARIF STINSON, et al., against ­ Plaintiffs, 10 Civ. 4228 (RWS) OPINION CITY OF NEW YORK, et al., Defendants. - -x A P PEACase 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 1 Filed 05/25/10 Page 1 of 31 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK -------------------------------------------------------------------X SHARIF STINSON, MARIAM FARNUM, CHARLENE FINLEY, RYBURN WALKES, JAMEL TOWE, CHRISTIAN DUDLEY, JOCELEY FERDINUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SHARIF STINSON, et . , Plaintiffs, against CITY OF NEW YORK, et al., Defendants. -- X 10 Civ. 4228 OPINION X A P PEA RAN C E S: At Plaintiff COHEN & FITCH LLP 225 Broadway, Suite 2700 New York, NY 10007 JoshuaCCaasese: 112:1-300-c6v9-042D2o8c-uRmWeSnt: D35ocumPeangte4: 71 F1ile2d/1122/2/1021/212 P79a3g0e811of 11 MANDATE United States Court of Appeals FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT SUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK -----------------------------------X SHARIF STINSON, et al., Plaintiffs, - against CITY OF NEW YORK, et al., 10 Civ. 4228 (RWS ⁇  OPINION Defendants. -----------------------------------X A P P E A R A N C E S: Attorneys for the Plaintiffs COHEN & FITCHCase 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 297 Filed 04/01/16 Page 1 of 3 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ------- ---------------------------X SHARIF STINSON, et al., Plaintiffs, - against CITY OF NEW YORK, et al., Defendants. ---------- --------------- -- -- --X Sweet, DCase 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 319 Filed 01/23/17 Page 1 of 5 auinneifianuel 51 Madison Avenue, 22nd Floor New York, New York looio TEL (212) 849-7000 Cohen & Fitch LLP THE WOOLWORTH BUILDING 233 Broadway, Suite 1800 New York, NY 10279 tel: 212.374.9Case 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 319-1 Filed 01/23/17 Page 1 of 35 EXHIBIT A 44 55 Case 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 319-1 Filed 01/23/17 Page 2 of 35 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SHARIF STINSON, etal, Individually andCase 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 320 Filed 01/24/17 Page 1 of 4 Case 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 319-2 Filed 01/23/17 Page 2 of 5 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK --------------------------------------------------------------)( SHARIF STINSON, et al., on Behalf of ThemCase 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 329 Filed 04/18/17 Page 1 of 1 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ----------------------------------------x SHARIF STINSON, et al., - against - Plaintiffs, 10 Civ. 4228 (RWS) 0 RDE R THE CITY OF NEW YORK , et al.Case 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 338 Filed 06/12/17 Page 1 of 31 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ------------------------------------------x SHARIF STINSON, et al., Plaintiffs, - against - 10 Civ. 4228 (RWS) OPINION THE CITY OF NEW YORK , et al., ---------------------Case 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 343 Filed 06/19/17 Page 1 of 4 Case 1:10-cv-04228-RWS Document 340-1 Filed 06/13/17 Page 1 of 4 r.

They claimed that law enforcement officials in and around the City of Tenaha have developed an illegal practice of targeting, stopping, detaining, searching, and often seizing property from people who appeared to be non-white or who were traveling with non-white passengers.  The plaintiffs claimed that they had been victims of such stops and seizures of amounts up to $50,000, as well as false prosecution or detention. The parties reached a preliminary settlement in August 2012.  Their proposed consent decree included: video and audio recordings of all stops; written documentation with details of the stop; no more dog searches in routine traffic stops; written and oral consent for a search; all asset forfeiture revenue must be donated to nonprofits or used for audio/video equipment or training; and use of an impartial monitor.  The court approved the consent decree, which it later extended to early 2021 after the plaintiffs alleged noncompliance by the City.

The defendants' plan was approved and parties then settled on the attorneys' fees.","Case 4:15-cv-00131-MW-CAS Document 1 Filed 03/09/15 Page 1 of 11 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA TALLAHASSEE DIVISION * KATE CALVIN, JOHN NELSON, * CHARLES J.

560,EE-VA-0141,"On December 19, 2018 two US Airmen under pseudonym and OutServe-SLDN, a network of LGBTQ military service-people, filed suit against the U.S. Department of Defense, James Mattis, and Heather Wilson in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Plaintiffs argued that the U.S had violated equal protection under the fifth amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs represented by Winston and Strawn LLP, LAMBDA Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Outserve-SLDN (now known as the Modern Military Association of America) sought declaratory and injunctive relief allowing HIV positive service members to continue to serve and damages. The Plaintiffs allege that they were discharged from their duties in the Air Force due to their HIV status. The case was assigned to Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.  On January 11, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to  prevent the defendants from restricting Roe and Voe and others similarly situated from being promoted, changing duty station, or re-training on the same terms as other service members living with HIV who are not being separated.  A hearing was held before Judge Brinkema on February 15, 2019. The same day, Judge Brinkema issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.  The order enjoined the defendants from separating or dicharging from military service Richard Roe, Victor Voe, and any other similarly situated active-duty member of the Air Force because they are classified as ineligible for worldwide deployment or deployment to the United States Central Command area due to their HIV-positive status.  The defendants appealed to the decision on the preliminary injunction to the Fourth Circuit.  Oral argument was held on September 18, 2019 before a panel of Fourth Circuit Judges comprised of Judges James A. Wynn Jr, Albert Diaz, and Henry F. Floyd.  In January 2020, the Fourth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the district court's decision.  In the district court, both parties have filed motions for summary judgment, and oral argument is set for August 4, 2020.

562,FA-MO-0007,"Private citizens sought an exception to the Affordable Care Act mandate requiring employers to provide contraception coverage on that basis that paying for this insurance plan violated their Catholic religious beliefs. On October 16, 2013, the Eastern District of Missouri (Judge Jean C. Hamilton) dismissed the claim for want of standing, but on July 20, 2015, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for merits decision. Judge Hamilton dismissed all but one of the plaintiff's claims but granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff on that claim, enjoining the defendants from requiring the plaintiffs to pay for contraception through their insurance. The government appealed this determination, but following President Trump's May 4, 2017 executive order directing a change in regulations to allow for conscience-based exceptions to the contraceptive-care mandate, the parties agreed to have the case dismissed.

The plaintiffs alleged that the City's decision to stop referring foster care discriminated against them for their religious beliefs and violated their contract, constitutional rights, and state law. On June 13, 2018, Judge Petrese B.

573,IM-CA-0127,"On July 10, 2018, the ACLU of Northern California filed this FOIA suit against U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The plaintiff sought records pursuant to a FOIA request about the defendant's use of a contractor to process and transport immigration detainees, some of whom had allegedly suffered injury and death due to the contractor's malfeasance. The plaintiff sought an order from the court that the defendant provide the records. This case was combined with a suit from a private plaintiff alleging mistreatment in ICE and G4S custody in July 2019. Document production appears to be continuing smoothly at a rate of 750 pages per month, but shifting production online due to COVID-19 has yielded some issues in getting documents over to the plaintiff.

574,IM-CA-0167,"This case was filed in response to the July 6, 2020 directive by ICE that would effectively force international students studying under F-1 and M-1 visas to attend in-person classes or risk deportation. The state of California filed this suit against ICE and DHS on July 9, arguing that the directive was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in two ways. First, the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to take into account students' and universities' reliance interests and the defendants gave no reasoned basis for the new order. Second, the defendants were in violation of procedural elements of the APA, because they failed to use proper notice-and-comment rule-making when issuing the new order.

On July 15, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance and as a result, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. California continued to monitor the alterations ICE made to its website between July and September and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on October 19, 2020.

577,IM-DC-0053,"On June 20, 2018, three immigrant parents separated from their children filed a civil action against various federal agencies and officials in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for immediate reunification with their children.The plaintiffs were detained after crossing the United States-Mexico border without inspection with young accompanying children, seeking asylum. After plaintiffs were apprehended at the border, the children were separated under the “zero-tolerance” immigration policy announced April 6, 2018, which criminally prosecuted adult entrants crossing the border illegally and placed accompanying minors in custody of the government. All three plaintiffs crossed the border prior to the Executive Order issued on June 20, 2018, which allowed immigrant parents and children apprehended at the border to remain together during the pendency of their proceedings. The plaintiffs alleged interference of family integrity in violation of Due Process, and sought preliminary and permanent injunctions to immediately reunite plaintiffs with their children. The plaintiffs obtained preliminary relief and were (along with another parent who joined the case later to prevent separation from her daughter) ultimately re-united with their children.

578,IM-IL-0019,"This action, filed Jan. 31, 2017, challenges President Trump’s Jan. 27, 2017 Executive Order ban on admission to the U.S. of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The complaint alleges that in preventing a Syrian national with a valid U.S. visa from returning to the U.S. pursuant to the EO, the defendants violated the First Amendment Establishment Clause, Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and international law. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. 

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and Bernard Harcourt of Columbia Law School, is a resident in the University of Illinois Chicago/Advocate Christ Hospital. He returned to the United Arab Emirates to get married on Jan. 23, and upon returning to the U.S. to continue his residency, he was detained at Abu Dhabi International Airport on Jan 29. Despite his valid visa, he was detained pursuant to the EO. If the plaintiff cannot return to the U.S., he faces the risk of being deported to Syria, where he is a citizen but has never been a resident. 

That same day, the plaintiff also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.

The case was assigned to Judge Elaine Bucklo.  At a status hearing on February 1, the parties told the judge they had reached a ""settlement in principle.""

On February 2, the plaintiff successfully entered the United States at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. On February 8, the plaintiff filed a motion for voluntary dismissal and leave to reinstate on or before August 1, 2017. Judge Bucklo granted this motion and terminated the case.

Unlike the <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=46"">suits that seek to challenge President Trump's ""Sanctuary City"" Executive Order</a>, this suit aims to support the work of federal immigration officials. There are, so far, four cases addressing SB4. 

On May 7, 2017, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed this suit seeking a declaratory judgment approving SB4. Defendants are Travis County, City of Austin, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF). The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on May 24, 2017. The court dismissed the case without prejudice to refiling on August 9, 2017, finding that Texas lacked actual or imminent injury, which was required for Article III standing to seek declaratory judgment. Texas appealed to the Fifth Circuit, who affirmed the district court's dismissal of the claim on December 12, 2018. The case is closed.","Case 1:17-cv-00425-SS Document 16 Filed 05/24/17 Page 1 of 8 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AUSTIN DIVISION TEXAS,  ⁇  Plaintiff,  ⁇   ⁇  v.  ⁇  Case 1:17-cv-00425-SS Document 18 Filed 05/26/17 Page 1 of 10 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AUSTIN DIVISION TEXAS,  ⁇  Plaintiff,  ⁇   ⁇  v.  ⁇  Case 1:17-cv-00425-SS Document 19 Filed 05/26/17 Page 1 of 12 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AUSTIN DIVISION TEXAS,  ⁇  Plaintiff,  ⁇   ⁇  v.  ⁇  Case 1:17-cv-00425-SS Document 23 Filed 05/31/17 Page 1 of 60 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AUSTIN DIVISION TEXAS; and KEN PAXTON, in his official capacity as Texas AttorneyCase 1:17-cv-00425-SS Document 26 Filed 06/02/17 Page 1 of 13 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AUSTIN DIVISION TEXAS,  ⁇  Plaintiff,  ⁇   ⁇  v.  ⁇  Case 1:17-cv-00425-SS Document 27 Filed 06/02/17 Page 1 of 9 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AUSTIN DIVISION TEXAS,  ⁇  Plaintiff,  ⁇   ⁇  v.  ⁇  Case 1:17-cv-00425-SS Document 53 Filed 06/16/17 Page 1 of 5 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AUSTIN DIVISION TEXAS; and KEN PAXTON, in his official capacity as Texas AttorneyCase 1:17-cv-00425-SS Document 60 Filed 06/28/17 Page 1 of 3 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AUSTIN DIVISION Texas, et al. v.

584,JC-MS-0013,"On May 3, 1993, the U.S. Department of Justice investigated the Harrison County, MI jail. The DOJ found violations of inadequate staffing and medical care. Apparently after negotiation, the Attorney General filed an action under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. 1997 et seq., against the jail in 1995.  Six days later, Judge Walter J. Gex III approved a consent decree.

The consent decree mandated doubling the number of officers, increased training, and hiring of medical professionals for the physical and mental health of the patients. The decree was enforced sporadically throughout the next ten years. On August 11, 2015, the parties filed a joint motion for dismissal, with the county agreeing to continue to use its best efforts to improve its mental health and medical care. The case was dismissed on August 12, 1995.

586,JC-TN-0012,"Two detainees in Shelby County Jail in Tennessee filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus. They claimed that failure to take sufficient COVID-19 precautions violated the Fourteenth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and they sought release. The court appointed an ""Independent Inspector"" to assess conditions at the jail and, based on his report, denied preliminary relief. The court also denied defendants' motion to dismiss, and a trial is scheduled for May 2021. 

An Independent Inspector was tasked with inspecting the jail to evaluate the conditions. While praising defendants' professionalism, he wrote that several adjustments needed to be made in order for the jail to be a safe place for detainees. 

After attending mediation and filing a joint motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement, the court preliminarily granted the consent decree requiring monthly reports on the status of COVID-19 in the Jail and unannounced, periodic inspections by the Inspector.

588,NS-CA-0001,"In early 2011, an electronic communication service provider that had received a National Security Letter (NSL) from the federal government filed a petition to set aside the NSL in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The recipient asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that a nondisclosure provision of the NSL Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2709, violated the First Amendment. On March 14, 2013, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston granted the petition to set aside the NSL, declaring that § 2709 violated the First Amendment. The government was therefore enjoined from issuing NSLs under § 2709 or from enforcing the nondisclosure provision in this or any other case. The government appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, but while the appeal was pending, Congress amended § 2709 and 18 U.S.C. § 3511 as part of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. The district court and Ninth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the revised § 2709 and § 3511. But the district court held that the government failed to justify nondisclosure in one case involving the recipient, and the government found that nondisclosure was no longer required in another case involving the recipient. As a result, the recipient could reveal itself as CREDO Mobile. ","T ABLE OF AUTHORITIES 2 CASES PAGE(s) 3 Board ofDirs. ofRotary Int'l v.

Both agencies indicated they had no records responsive to Leopold’s requests. Defendants have filed a motion for summary judgment; Leopold opposes the motion because he claims the agencies failed to perform adequate searches for a variety of reasons. While the court agrees with Defendants on most of the issues raised by Leopold, the court finds that on a small number of issues, Defendants have failed to conduct an adequate search or failed to adequately explain the basis for their search. As a result, Defendants’ motion is granted in part and denied in part. I. BACKGROUND In March 2014, Leopold submitted two similar FOIA requests to NSA and OLC.

Both agencies indicated that they had no records responsive to the FOIA requests, prompting Plaintiff to initiate this litigation. In July 2015, this court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ first motion for summary judgment, finding that Defendants had failed to conduct an adequate search and to adequately explain the basis for their search in certain limited respects. Among other things, the court ordered OLC to reprocess Plaintiff’s FOIA request by searching for draft memoranda and legal opinions related to surveillance of federal and state judges.

593,NS-WA-0002,"On May 8, 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union (""ACLU"") of Washington filed this lawsuit in the District Court for the Western District of Washington. The ACLU sued the United States Department of Justice (""DOJ"") under the Freedom of Information Act (""FOIA""). The ACLU asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the DOJ to disclose and release records it was improperly withholding from the ACLU regarding the National Crime Information Center Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File (""CVGTOF""), which contains entries on suspected terrorist organizations and individuals. Though the DOJ moved to dismiss the case, on March 10, 2011, U.S. District Court Judge Robert S. Lasnik only granted the motion to dismiss in part, and ordered the DOJ to edit any inappropriate redactions and provide the Court with more facts that would justify a claimed exemption.

The results of the census help determine the balance of political power among and within the States and the distribution of day-to-day government services. The federal government uses Census data to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, draw legislative districts, enforce voting rights, build schools, and allocate more than $400 billion in federal funds. The critical task of conducting the decennial census falls to the Census Bureau (“the Bureau”), a unit within the Defendant U.S. Department of Commerce. The Bureau has six regional offices and dozens of temporary processing facilities, and employs more than half a million temporary workers. The scale of the census is reflected by its cost: more than $12 billion in 2010.

She defined marriage, granted it, and declared dissolutions when warranted; the sovereigns meanwhile deferred to the Church in these matters. This changed with Henry VIII, who, having become the head of the Church of England chipped away at the Church’s authority to define---or recognize, as the Church would view it---what marriage is. As the Sovereign and the Supreme Head of the Church of England became one, so did the state and church. With the growth of new governments in the continent and the unified church and state becoming the norm, marriage, in additional to its original attributes, began to be viewed as the good of the state. (And when, as was in the case of French revolution, the church and the state were separated, the state retained its authority11/4/2017 CM/ECF USDC-INND Version 6.1 Live DB CASREF,CSSTAY,TERMED U.S. District Court Northern District of Indiana [LIVE] USDC Northern Indiana (Hammond) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 2:14-cv-00325-JVB-PRC Romero et al v.

601,PB-NY-0003,"This class action was about whether the City of New York improperly denied federally sponsored cash assistance to qualified New York City residents under a program implemented by the city in the late 1990s. The plaintiffs each claimed to be qualified welfare beneficiaries who had been improperly denied assistance by one of New York City’s new job centers in violation of the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process, the city’s obligations under 7 U.S.C. §2020 (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—then referred to as Food Stamps) and 42 U.S.C. §1396 (Medicaid), in addition to violating state law; the plaintiffs sought class certification for all similarly situated New York City residents, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 16, 1998, with Judge William H. Pauley presiding. The court entered a temporary restraining order on the same day directing the city to provide emergency food stamps and cash assistance to the named plaintiffs. The court granted a preliminary injunction in-part to the plaintiffs on January 21, 1999. The court ordered the city to (1) allow applicants for public assistance to apply for benefits the first day they visit a job center, (2) cease conversion of income support centers to job centers without a formal hearing, (3) make eligibility requirements for food stamps and Medicaid separately from the eligibility determination from cash assistance, (4) send applicants timely notice of the city’s decision on whether they qualify for benefits, and (5) form a corrective plan for achieving its policy goals while also meeting the needs of public assistance applicants. The city moved to vacate the preliminary injunction on December 10, 1999, after procuring more evidence surrounding the efficacy of the job centers in achieving their welfare obligations. Meanwhile, the State of New York moved to dismiss the complaint against them for failure to state a claim. Judge Pauley denied both motions and granted the plaintiff’s motion for class certification on July 21, 2000. 

The court entered a permanent injunction in favor of the plaintiffs on December 30, 2004. The permanent injunction directed both the city and state to: (i) provide expedited food stamp service to eligible applications within 7 days; (ii) separately process applications for food stamps when the applications for cash assistance are denied or withdrawn; (iii) send notices to applicants confirming voluntary withdrawals for Medicaid in accord with 42 C.F.R. 435.913 and document such withdrawals pursuant to 7 C.F.R. 273.2(c)(6); and (iv) provide adequate and timely notice by correctly completing certain documentation. The injunction also required the state to supervise the city and make sure it met the obligations of the injunction. On January 13, 2005, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the part of the December order in which the court concluded that 8 N.Y.C.R.R. § 387.8(a)(2)(i)(a) did not confer a privately enforceable right of action and that plaintiffs’ claim under New York Social Services Law § 133 was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court granted the motion on February 14, 2005. Final judgement was entered on December 14, 2005; the court also granted the plaintiffs declaratory judgment.

Both the state and the city appealed the permanent injunction to the Second Circuit on January 12, 2006, but the city dropped its appeal. On October 31, 2007, the Second Circuit reversed the district court, ruling that the state did not have a non-delegable duty to administer the decentralized Medicaid and Food Stamp programs, the state’s efforts in supervising the city since the permanent injunction was issued were adequate, and the district court exceeded its authority by issuing a permanent injunction in light of New York State’s affirmative supervisory steps it had taken to assure compliance. In a series of stipulations and orders from January 31, 2007 to July 22, 2011, the City of New York agreed to pay a total of $2,920,675.94 to plaintiffs for attorney fees and costs sought; the state agreed to pay a further $639,918.98.

603,PB-OK-0001,"Plaintiffs are lesbian couples who filed suit on November 3, 2004 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against the United States and the State of Oklahoma, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Article 2 § 35 of the Oklahoma Constitution (the ""Oklahoma Amendment"") violate the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs alleged that DOMA and the Oklahoma Amendment violates the Due Process, Equal Protection, Full Faith and Credit, and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The court found for the plaintiffs, holding on Jan. 14, 2014 that the ban on same-sex marriage violated the Equal Protection Clause.  

The Tenth Circuit found for the plaintiffs on July 18, 2014, and after the Supreme Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari (on October 6, 2014), the Court lifted the stay on its original mandate and enjoined the Defendant from enforcing the Oklahoma Amendment and denying same-sex couples marriage licenses. The Court awarded $309,485.27 in attorney's fees to the plaintiffs. The case is now closed.","Case 4:04-cv-00848-TCK-TLW Document 1 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 11/03/04 Page 1 of 6 '.  ⁇ , IN THE UNITEDOSTFATTHEESS ⁇ T::AOTUEROt'OFFOTKHLEANlIt""jO""iR ⁇ 'tXfCase 4:04-cv-00848-TCK-TLW Document 211 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/19/11 Page 1 of 4 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA MARY BISHOP and SHARON BALDWIN, ) et al., ) )Case 4:04-cv-00848-TCK-TLW Document 214 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 10/19/11 Page 1 of 3 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA __________________________________________ ) MARY BISHOP, et al., ) ) Plaintiffs,Case 4:04-cv-00848-TCK-TLW Document 197 Filed in USDC ND/OK on 09/28/11 Page 1 of 52 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA MARY BISHOP, ) SHARON BALDWIN, ) SUSAN G.

607,PC-FL-0021,"In 2014, Disability Rights Florida filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The plaintiff alleged that certain inmates with mental illness at Dade Correctional Institution had been subject to torture, beatings, verbal harassment and food deprivation in violation of their Eighth Amendment Rights. They also alleged that these inmates had received insufficient care in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Federal Rehabilitation Act. Disability Rights Florida requested declaratory and injunctive relief to deem these practices unlawful and unconstitutional, and assurance that such practices would not continue. The parties reached a settlement agreement which required improved conditions for prisoners and ran through November 2017. Subsequent litigation in this case resulted from its consolidation with a related civil rights case seeking monetary damages. That portion of the litigation settled for $4.5 million in 2018. As of July 2020, the court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement.","Case 1:14-cv-23323-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/09/2014 Page 1 of 21 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA MIAMI DIVISION DISABILITY RIGHTS FLORIDA, INC., on Behalf of its Clients and Constituents, Plaintiff, vs. Case No. MICHAEL D.

The district court found that a Detroit-only remedy would be insufficient, and ordered a busing plan that would have affected students in city schools and 53 largely white suburban school districts, but the Supreme Court rejected this plan and a Detroit-only remedy was implemented.","Nos. 73-434, 73-435, 73-436 4n tit ,Oupuntt elourt of tht 1:1 Wiled Obits OCTOBER TERM, 1973 WILLIAM G.
