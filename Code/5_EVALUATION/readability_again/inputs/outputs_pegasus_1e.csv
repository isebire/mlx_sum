0,CJ-AL-0007,"The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit on March 8, 2014, alleging that the City of Montgomery, Alabama, improperly imprisoned them for failing to pay traffic fines. They alleged that they did not have an ability to pay the fines due to their financial circumstances and that the city did not consider their ability to pay. On May 1, 2014, the District Court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the city from collecting more money from traffic tickets of plaintiffs'. On October 31, 2014 the parties filed to dismiss the case pursuant to a settlement agreement, which included numerous changes to Municipal Court proceedings. The case is now closed.","COMPLAINT Introduction The Plaintiffs in this case are each impowrished people who were jailed by the City of Montgomery because they were unable to pay a debt owed to the City from traffic tickets. In each case, the City ordered the Plamtiff either to pay the City immediately or to ""sit out"" his or her debt in the City jail at a rate of $50 per day. Although the Plaintiffs pleaded that they were Unable to pay due to their poverty, each was sent to jail for nonpayment and none was afforded the inquiry into their ability to pay that the United States and Alabama Constitutions require. Once locked in the City's jail, the Plaintiffs were told that they could reduce their time in jail by working off their debts for an additional $25 per day if they agreed to perform janitorial tasks assigned by City employees, including cleaning feces and blood from jail floors and wiping the jail bars inside their overcrowded cells.
4. It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to contract with a private for-profit corporation, Judicial Correction Services, Inc. (""JCS, Inc""), to perform what the City calls ""probation"" services, which consists of collecting City debts in exchange for fees added to the debts owed by people who cannot afford to pay their traffic ticket fees, costs, and surcharges immediately. It is the policy and practice of the City of Montgomery to rely on the discretionary recommendations and factual representations of this private entity to make decisions about Whether to arrest a person, what disposition to enter in a person's case, and whether to put the person on ""probation"" or to require immediate payment or jail despite the fact that the private entity has a significant personal financial stake in these judicial enforcement proceedings.
52. JCS, Inc. and the City enforce a policy and practice of initiating and issuing arrest warrants when a person misses a payment or fails to make sufficient payments without considering the person's ability to pay—even when they have knowledge that the person is indigent—and without providing notice and summoning the person to court for a hearing. Instead, City policy allows the City to issue and serve arrest warrants, and City officers go to the homes of traffic debtors to arrest them.
76. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses have long prohibited imprisoning a person for the failure to pay money owed to the government if that person is indigent and unable to pay. Defendant violated Plaintiffs' rights by imprisoning them when they could not afford to pay the debt allegedly owed. Defendant violated Plaintiff's rights by imprisoning them, and by threatening to imprison them, without conducting any inquiry into their ability to pay and without conducting any inquiry into alternatives to imprisonment as required by the United States Constitution.
85. The City unlawfully imprisoned Plaintiffs for a monetary debt owed to the City. On top of being unlawfully imprisoned for failure to pay debts owed to the City, Plaintiffs Mitchell and Williams were, pursuant to City policy, coerced with longer unlawful prison terms by City officials if they did not ""volunteer"" to labor in the City jail under disgusting conditions for an extra credit of $25 per day toward their debts.. This amounts to peonage and forced labor, whereby a person is coerced by threat of legal sanction—i.e. imprisonment—to work off a debt to.a master. It is also an abuse of the legal process that exploited Defendant's unlawful incarceration of Plaintiffs to force them to accept, in their desperation to end their unlawful incarceration more quickly, the conditions of forced labor, performing janitorial tasks that even City employees did not want to perform, such as cleaning significant amounts of blood and feces in an overcrowded jail environment.
2. A Public Defender will represent all defendants not otherwise represented by counsel at all compliance and indigence/ability-to-pay hearings. At said hearings, the judge will require that the Public Defender appear with the Defendant in front of the judge, and the Court will note the Public Defender’s appearance in the record.
ii. If able to pay the fine and court costs on the same day, the defendant may be directed to the pay window or otherwise informed how to make payment. The full amount is paid and the case is closed.
COME NOW, the Parties to the above-styled action and stipulate to the dismissal of all portions of the First Amended Class Action Complaint (Doc. 26) in this case which seek class- wide relief. To the extent that the Plaintiffs seek class-wide relief in connection with any count pled in the First Amended Class Action Complaint (Doc. 26), the Parties stipulate that the Plaintiffs’ request for class-wide relief is dismissed with prejudice. The parties therefore stipulate and agree that the Plaintiffs will not hereafter file a Motion for Class Certification.

Defendant The City of Montgomery","On January 26, 2014, a group of citizens brought this lawsuit against the City of Montgomery, Alabama in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.

The parties entered into a settlement agreement in which the City agreed to cease its unconstitutional practice of detaining people without cause for failure to pay traffic ticket debt. The agreement also required the City to designate at least two days within the six months following the execution of this agreement during which individuals who have outstanding arrest warrants for having failed to appear for compliance hearings or for initial appearances for scheduled or nonscheduled offenses, or who otherwise owe outstanding payments, can appear at the window of the Municipal Court, receive a compliance hearing date and the formal notice thereof, and clear any warrants related to their nonpayment or failure to appear rather than being arrested.","A class action lawsuit was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama against the City of Montgomery and Judicial Correction Services, Inc.

The Mitchell case raises similar claims to the instant cases, but additionally sought injunctive relief and monetary damages. In the Mitchell case a preliminary injunction order was entered, in which the Court enjoined the City of Montgomery from collecting fees from the Mitchell plaintiffs, and ordered the City of Montgomery to submit to the Court a comprehensive plan listing the current or proposed policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations of an individual’s ability to pay, the policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations as to reasons for an individual’s failure to pay, the policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations of any alternative measures of punishment other than imprisonment for the non-payment of fines, and the policies and procedures the City follows or intends to follow in making future determinations of whether these alternative measures are adequate to meet the City’s interests in punishing and deterring the non-payment of fines, which shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.

2,CJ-AR-0001,"A prisoner facing the death penalty in Arkansas sued over the form of lethal injection used by the state. The case was dismissed because of a lack of evidence that Arkansas's use of lethal injections subjected prisoners to a significant risk of pain. The case is closed, and one of the three plaintiffs was executed in 2017.","884.

Don William Davis, a death row inmate, is scheduled to be executed by the Arkansas Department of Correction by means of lethal injection. A rapidly growing body of evidence, including medical evidence, eyewitness observation and veterinary studies, persuasively demonstrates that the particular lethal injection protocol chosen by Defendant Norris risks, and has repeatedly resulted in, inmates failing to receive adequate anesthesia and remaining conscious during the administration of the lethal drugs. Without adequate anesthesia, the inmate experiences first slow suffocation and then the extraordinarily painful activation of the sensory nerve fibers in the walls of the veins that is caused by potassium chloride. Given the significant danger under the current protocol that he will be subjected to this excruciating pain and torture, Mr. Davis seeks to prevent the Defendants from executing him in this manner.
2. Arkansas’ Lethal Injection Protocol Violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments Because it Carries a Tremendous Risk of Unnecessary Pain During Executions The Eighth Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the imposition of cruel and unusual punishments.

The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that the defendants had violated the constitutional rights of the press and the public to attend, meaningfully observe, and gather and report on important information at executions being carried out by the defendants at the California State Prison at San Quentin. On May 30, 2013, the issue in this case became moot due to a state court decision. In Sims v. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), the California Court of Appeals held that CDCR’s lethal injection regulations were invalid for failure to comply with the APA. The court permanently enjoined CDCR from carrying out the execution of any condemned inmate by lethal injection until their new regulations complied with the Administrative Procedure Act. This case closed after a voluntary dismissal filed by the plaintiff organization.","4. Plaintiff Pacific News Service (""PNS"") is a non-profit media organization, 5 founded in 1969, that reports on, among other things, the application of the death penalty in 6 California. PNS syndicates daily stories through the AssocÍated Press wire to subscribing 7 mainstream and community newspapers across the United States. PNS stories include feature- 8 length commentary, news analysis, and investigative reporting. PNS also sponsors magazine 9 aricles, books, TV segments and films. Additionally, PNS owns and operates New America 10 Media, an association of hundreds of independent news organzations that cover, at least in part, 11 issues pertaining to ethnic or minority communties. New America Media publishes content 12 generated both internally and from its member organzations. Pacific News Service is interested 13 in disseminating information on what eyewitnesses to Californa executions observe durng the 14 lethal injection process, including but notlimited to whether executed inmates manfest indicia 15 of pain prior to death. PNS is a Californa non-profit corporation based in San Francisco, 16 Califorriia.
22. On information and belief, defendants therefore intentionally administer 27 pancuronium bromide to conceal important information from the press and the public. This 28 would not be the first time that defendants and their predecessors incorporated into the lethal 1 injection process procedures intentionally aimed at concealing important information from those 2 viewing the execution. Specifically, in California First Amendment Coalition v. Woodford, 299 3 F.3d 868 (9th Cir. 2002)i the plaintiff media organization challenged the.

Plaintiff Pacific News Service alleges that the use of 16 i pancuropju.""l bromide, the second drug ad.-linistered uiider Procedure 770, f.ictIons solely as a 17 ""chemical curain"" whose purpose is to conceal important information about the execution (such 18 as whether the inmate is or is not experiencing substantial pain) from the members ofthe press 19 and the public viewing the execution.

[Docket No. 4] On January 13, 2006, Plaintiff Michael Angelo Morales filed an action, Morales v. 27 Woodford, No. C 06 219 JF RS, challenging California’s lethal-injection protocol as violating the 28 Eighth Amendment; on February 10, 2006, he filed a second action, Morales v. Woodford, No. C 1 06 926 JF RS, which was substantially identical to the first action, for exhaustion purposes; the 2 Court consolidated the two cases on February 13, 2006.
18 Given that the First Amendment access right attaches to executions, the only remaining 19 question is whether the particular challenged restriction survives First Amendment scrutiny. The 20 restriction at issue here is San Quentin's use of pancuronium bromide to paralyze the inmate's 21 body so as to conceal from the public possible manifestations of pain or other important information.
6. Defendant Robert L. Ayers, Jr. is the Warden of the California State Prison at San 23 Quentin (“San Quentin Prison”). California death row inmates are incarcerated and executed at 24 San Quentin Prison. Ayers or those under his control developed the most recent version of 25 California’s execution protocol.

The Lethal Injection Regulations are the latest version of California’s lethal injection 25 procedure—formerly known as San Quentin Operational Procedure No. 770 (“Procedure 26 770”)—which has evolved since it was first adopted in the mid-1990’s.

The parties disagreed about the reliability of the instruments for use with California’s life 26 inmate population, but the parties agreed that no evidence was presented to support the claim that the board intentionally chose 28 flawed risk instruments.","On April 20, 2012, a prisoner at San Quentin State Prison filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California against the California Board of Parole Hearings (Board) and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) alleging that the Board's forensic assessment protocols violated the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. The class consisted of California state prisoners who are serving life 27 sentences and are eligible for parole consideration after having served their minimum terms. The court granted the class certification on June 12, 2014, and the parties filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On September 26, 2014, defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the order 18 granting class certification. The parties jointly moved the court to approve the settlement agreement, 18 which was reached after “extensive arms-length negotiation. The settlement does not require use of different risk assessment tools for 15 use with California’s life inmate population. It does incorporate several mechanisms that address 16 concerns of possible bias in the risk assessment process and parole decisions based on such risk 17 assessments."

3. The events or omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in the District of Colorado, and at all relevant times the parties reside in the District. Venue is therefore proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).
8. Denver assesses the bond fee for all pretrial monetary bonds.
10. Denver commonly charges many other fees to criminal defendants, including, when applicable, court costs, a public defender fee, and pretrial supervision fees. Upon information and belief, inability to pay these fees does not cause the defendant to be jailed. Instead, Denver generally bills the defendant for these fees after release. If the defendant fails to pay by a specified time, Denver sends these debts to collections but does not jail the defendant for nonpayment.2 Denver selected only one fee – the bond fee – for mandatory payment in order for a defendant to secure release from jail.
21. Denver, however, refused to release Mr. Howard on the conditions set by the court. Instead, pursuant to Denver’s policy and practice, it required Mr. Howard to pay an additional $50 bond fee in order to be released.
34. Denver seeks a $504 payment for Mr. Howard’s GPS monitoring. Absent payment, Denver’s practice is to send such debts to collections.
35. Additionally, two days after the case was dismissed, on August 10, 2018, Denver assessed a $25 public defender fee against Mr Howard. On September 10, precisely one month after the public defender fee was assessed, Denver added a $50 failure-to-pay fee to Mr. Howard’s bill, as well as a $30 collection fee. Denver sent this $105 “debt” to collections. Thus, Denver now seeks $105 from Mr. Howard for a public defender fee that was originally $25.
41. These alternatives would not only have prevented the unconstitutional wealthbased detention that occurred in Mr. Howard’s case, they would also make fiscal sense. It costs Denver $70.20 per day to house an inmate in the jail. Thus, each day Denver detains a defendant because of failure to pay the $50 bonding fee or because Denver took $30 from the defendant for the booking fee, Denver loses money. In Mr. Howard’s case, Denver spent $350 to detain him for five days because he could not pay a $50 fee. This math underscores the irrationality of the policies at issue in this case.
53. Defendant denied Plaintiff his pretrial liberty after bail was set solely because he was unable to pay a fee.

7,CJ-DC-0002,"In 2012, U.S. District Court of D.C. found that the policy of seizing and retaining private vehicles pending civil forfeiture proceedings without providing a post-deprivation hearing was unconstitutional.","Mr. Simms seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Jurisdiction and Venue
24. Civil forfeiture in the District of Columbia is governed by the procedures set forth in D.C. Code § 48-905.02. 1
Simms has been unable to challenge the validity of the initial seizure and continuing retention of his vehicle prior to judgment in the forfeiture proceeding, nor will he have any opportunity to do so for the next year while those proceedings are pending. He contends that the District’s failure to provide him with the opportunity for a prompt post-deprivation hearing to challenge the seizure and subsequent retention of his car, prior to judgment in his civil forfeiture case, violates his Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights. He seeks an order enjoining the MPD from holding his vehicle, pending the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings, without providing him notice and an opportunity to be heard.
Upon consideration of the plaintiff’s motion, the opposition and reply, the parties’ arguments during the June 13, 2012 motions hearing, the supplemental briefs submitted by the parties both before and after the hearing, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the District’s failure to provide Mr. Simms with a post-seizure hearing to challenge the deprivation of his vehicle pending the conclusion of civil forfeiture proceedings violates his constitutionally-protected due process rights. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED.
Plaintiff filed this action on May 1, 2012, and simultaneously filed a motion for preliminary injunction. Apparently in response to the litigation, on May 15, 2012, Lieutenant Gray waived the bond on Mr. Simms’s vehicle. Opp’n at 6, see also Gray Decl.
Writing for the panel, then-Judge Sotomayor found unconstitutional New York City’s continued retention of private vehicles seized incident to arrests, without providing vehicle owners a prompt post-seizure hearing at which the owners could challenge the legitimacy of the initial seizure and the City’s continued retention of the vehicle pending forfeiture proceedings. The Krimstock court relied on Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), and Good. Mathews holds that the Due Process Clause requires, in general, that when the government seeks to deprive an individual of property, it must provide a hearing before an impartial decision maker where the individual may be heard “at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” 424 U.S. at 333 (citations omitted). In order to determine what process is required, three factors must be weighed: (1) the nature and weight of the private interest affected by the challenged official action; (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation given the procedures currently employed, and the probable value of additional safeguards; and (3) the government’s interest in avoiding additional procedural safeguards Id. at
335. In Good, the Court applied Mathews to the realm of civil forfeiture. Property owner James Daniel Good challenged the government’s attempt to seize his house, which had been used in connection with a drug offense, for civil forfeiture without prior notice and a hearing. The Supreme Court invalidated the seizure, holding that, absent exigent circumstances, “individuals must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the government deprives them of property.” 510 U.S. at 48 (emphasis added). When the forfeitable property is a vehicle connected with suspected criminal activity, however, the Court recognized that the property’s mobility combined with the Government’s interest in the property may create a “special need for very prompt action that justifie[s] the postponement of notice and hearing until after the seizure.” Id. at 52 (citations omitted).

9,CJ-ID-0001,"On May 22, 2012, several national and local news agencies filed a § 1983 lawsuit against the state of Idaho, alleging that the policy of the Idaho Department of Correction to prohibit public viewing of the preparatory phase of the execution process, during which the inmate is restrained and the IV is inserted, violates the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. The District Court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on June 5, 2012, but the Ninth Circuit reversed the denial, on June 8, in time for the injunction to apply to the scheduled execution of Richard Leavitt.  On July 10, the District Court entered a permanent injunction ordering the Idaho Department of Corrections to modify their execution procedures to allow witnesses to the execution throughout the entire execution process. ","A. Execution Protocol Paul Ezra Rhoades was executed by the State of Idaho on November 18, 2011.
2012. The Court granted the request for expedited briefing and also ordered the parties to participate in mediation with Chief United States Magistrate Judge Candy W Dale. The mediation was unsuccessful. The Defendants filed their response to the motion on May 29, 2012 and a supplement on May 30,
FACTUAL BACKGROUND The Plaintiffs are comprised of a number of newspaper publishing companies located throughout the State of Idaho, the Associated Press, and Idahoans for Openness in Government, Inc., an Idaho non-profit corporation. The Defendants are the Governor of the State of Idaho, C L. “Butch’ Otter; the individual members of the Idaho Board of ORDER 2 Corrections, Robin Sandy, Howard G. “J.R.” Van Tassel and Jay L. Nielsen; the Director of the Idaho Department of Corrections (“IDOC”), Brent Reinke; and the Division Chief of Operations of the IDOC, Kevin Kempf. The Defendants are sued in their official capacities. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction and declaratory relief in response to alleged First Amendment violations by the IDOC via the procedures or protocol used by IDOC for death penalty executions. Plaintiffs specifically seek a preliminary injunction regarding the procedures used for the execution of Mr. Richard Leavitt currently scheduled for June 12, 2012.
Society has a strong interest in having the most serious of criminal penalties implemented in a professional, humane manner with the rights of privacy of all involved considered and respected. Prison officials have a legitimate interest in conducting an execution such that it does not impact the safety and security of prison officials and other inmates. IDOC’s current protocol to effectuate a death warrant is lethal injection. Plaintiffs have presented strong arguments based on binding Ninth Circuit case law that IDOC’s objectives may not justify restricting the viewing of the execution process until after the inmate has been restrained and IVs are placed. However, the Court cannot find based on the current record, that Plaintiffs have provided “substantial evidence” that IDOC’s Protocol 135 is an “exaggerated response” to the security concerns presented.
D. Public Interest Plaintiffs must establish that an injunction is in the public’s interest. The public has an interest in witnessing the implementation of a death warrant. As a society, we cannot have the death penalty carried out behind closed doors with only prison officials as witnesses. In this case, Protocol 135 provides for numerous witnesses including four media witnesses to the view process wherein the lethal drug is administered. Plaintiff’s interest in allowing the public to more fully view the execution process does not outweigh the public’s interest in proceeding with a scheduled execution. In this case, the condemned inmate, Mr. Leavitt, was originally sentenced to death in 1985.

10,CJ-IL-0013,"In 2016, prisoners that had completed their sentences but remained incarcerated by the Illinois Department of Corrections filed this class action against the state in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs alleged that the Illinois statutory scheme governing mandatory supervised release (MSR) for sex offenders and the requirement for offenders to have an approved “host site” in order to be released from custody violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court awarded the plaintiffs summary judgment on the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims.  The court entered a permanent injunction on January 15, 2020,  requiring IDOC to present a plan for releasing class members from custody, and quarterly reports outlining steps that were being taken to ensure that all class members would be properly released by January 2, 2021.  As of July 2020, the court's supervision of IDOC's progress is ongoing.","1. This case, which arises under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenges the constitutionality of a legal scheme whereby individuals who have been convicted of certain sex-related crimes end up serving life sentences behind prison bars as the result of the interactions of various state laws and state agency regulations promulgated by three distinct entities—the Illinois legislature, the Prison Review Board (“PRB”), and the Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”). In particular, individuals convicted of sex-related crimes who are sentenced to three years to life of mandatory supervised release (“MSR”) find themselves stuck in prison for life as a result of the imposition of unmeetable restrictions on where they can live that must be satisfied in order for such individuals to be released on MSR. The challenged scheme results in what amounts to a Kafkaesque nightmare whereby these individuals are denied any semblance of proportionality in their prison sentences and due process of law.
3. As of the filing of this complaint, there are approximately 4,000 people imprisoned in the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been convicted of sex-related offenses for which state law imposes an indeterminate term of “three years to life” of Mandatory Supervised Release (“MSR”) (formerly known as parole).
4. As set forth below, Illinois laws severely restrict where individuals deemed sex offenders may live while on MSR. As a result, the vast majority of such prisoners are unable to find approved “host sites” at which to serve their MSR terms. Because of the unavailability of compliant housing, such prisoners are detained in the Illinois Department of Corrections long after they have served the term of imprisonment to which they have been sentenced. For individuals with indeterminate MSR sentences, their prison terms are in effect converted to sentences of lifetime imprisonment without any possibility of release.
5. The named Plaintiffs are individuals currently being held in the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been sentenced to serve “three years to life” MSR terms and are unable to find “host sites.” Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of two classes of similarly situated individuals (identified below), challenge the constitutionality of the statutory schemes that cause this severe deprivation of their constitutional right to liberty.
43. There are no halfway houses in the State of Illinois that accept parolees classified as sex offenders.
56. There are no homeless shelters in Illinois that accept sex offenders.
12. Plaintiffs allege that the terms “near” and “other places where minor children congregate” are void for vagueness.
Date: August 18, 2017 Virginia M. Kendall United States District Court Judge Northern District of Illinois
17. The plaintiffs dispute this contention because the written policies, by their count, indicate the opposite. (Dkt. 107 22–24.) The defendants claim that the Department recently promogulated new guidelines that proscribe internet-related sex offenders from living in an internet-accessible home while individuals convicted of offenses not relating to the internet (and with no history of misusing computers or the internet) may be allowed to reside in a home with internet access. (Dkt. 91 14, 17.) The plaintiffs see it the other way and contend that it fails to address the residency restrictions dealing with internet access. (Dkt. 107 22–24.) Moreover, as a practical matter, the plaintiffs say the IDOC does not let any sex offender live in a host site with computers or other devices. (Dkt. 91 14–17; Dkt. 107 22–24.) To illustrate, Daniel Barron’s conviction for criminal sexual assault did not involve the use of a computer or the internet but he still may not access it Dkt. 108 148, 158; Dkt. 128
Instead, the plaintiffs in this case dispute the procedures used in host site review. As in Richmond v. Scibana, the wrong perspective to take is “to... question whether differences between... prison... and community confinement are sufficiently great that [the plaintiffs] can be deemed to challenge the fact of custody, rather than simply conditions of confinement acknowledged to be lawful.” 387 F.3d 602, 605 (7th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). A favorable result for the plaintiffs in this litigation would not entitle them:

The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment, permanent injunction of the practice, and monetary damages. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss and dismissed all claims alleged in the complaint with prejudice, and all pending motions were denied moot. In 2016, the plaintiffs appealed but the appeals court affirmed the judgment of the district court. ","May a municipal jail, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, withhold a portion of an inmate’s canteen-account in order to cover the costs of booking, room and board without providing the inmate with a hearing before it withholds the money. Yes, we hold, and accordingly we affirm the district court’s rejection of this claim and two others.
Looking to the second prong, as in Sickles, there is a minor risk of erroneous deprivation as the withholding of funds involves elementary accounting with little risk of error Id. at 730-31. As Plaintiff alleges, the Jail’s incarceration fee policy is nondiscretionary as it applies to all persons confined in the Jail. Moreover, because Plaintiff was billed after being released, the risk of erroneous deprivation is arguably less than in Sickles where the plaintiffs were automatically debited while confined. The Court also finds the process set forth in KRS 441.265(3), which states that counties may file a civil action against a released prisoner to collect any amount owed which remains unpaid, to constitute an adequate safeguard given the nature and weight of the private interests at stake. An additional protection, per KRS 441.265(7), is the opportunity for prisoners to negotiate with the jailer to be released from all or part of the repayment obligation, exist.

BEFORE: MERRITT, ROGERS, and KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judges. ROGERS, Circuit Judge. This case presents a federal procedural due process challenge to the practice of Kentucky jailers of sending a bill for incarceration costs to jailed prisoners who have subsequently been discharged without any sentence. After arrest, David Jones was admitted to the Clark County Detention Center. He spent fourteen months in jail, then left, and, five months thereafter, the accusations against him were dismissed. Clark County then billed Jones $4,000 for the costs of his incarceration. Jones paid $20, stopped paying, and sued Clark County and its jailor, asserting § 1983 and state claims both individually and on behalf of a class. The district court dismissed the federal claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims. Jones appeals, arguing once again that he has been deprived of procedural due process by the County and the County Jailor. Because Kentucky allowed Jones to challenge Case: 16-5295 Document: 34-2 Filed: 12/19/2016 Page: 2 the bill by refusing to pay it, Jones’s procedural due process rights have not been violated. We do not have before us the separate question of whether federal substantive due process principles permit the state to legislate the reimbursement obligation for which Jones was billed.
Defendants Clark County and Boyle moved to dismiss all claims. As a part of that motion, the defendants argued that Jones had not alleged a viable claim of violation of the Fourth Amendment. Jones responded, opposing the motion to dismiss, but “not object[ing]” to the dismissal of his Fourth Amendment claims.
The district court granted the motion to dismiss, dismissing the federal claims with prejudice, and dismissing the state claims without prejudice. Jones v. Clark Cty., No. 5:15-cv-

The plaintiff objected to the three-drug cocktail (sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in Maryland's lethal injections.

The Fourth Amendment mandates that [t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. U.S Const. amend IV. Accordingly, the Fourth Amendment only prohibits “unreasonable” searches and seizures. United States v. Katzin, 769 F.3d 163, 169 (3d Cir. 2014). “Reasonableness” is analyzed by a “totality of the circumstances” test, “assessing on the one hand, the degree to which [the search or seizure] intrudes upon an individual’s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.” Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 848 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court agrees that, under normal circumstances, 24-hour electronic monitoring would likely constitute an intrusion upon an individual’s reasonable expectation to privacy. However, as the Supreme Court has explained, “[o]nce an individual has been arrested on probable cause for a dangerous offense that may require detention before trial, his or her expectations of privacy... are reduced.” Maryland v. King, 133 S Ct. 1958, 1978 (2013). Moreover, the state’s interest in ensuring a potentially-dangerous defendant’s appearance at trial is strong. Salerno, 481 U.S. at 749 (“The government’s interest in preventing crime by arrestees is both legitimate and compelling.”). Thus, in the pretrial-release context, electronic monitoring and home arrest may be well “reasonable.” The Fourth Amendment generally interposes the determination of a judicial officer in determining the reasonableness of significant intrusions into the liberty or property of an individual. Thus, absent exigent circumstances or other limited exceptions, a judicial officer must determine whether probable cause exists to search a home under a search warrant or to arrest a suspect under an arrest warrant. Likewise, cases too numerous to fully list have held that the judicial officer’s determination of reasonableness under all the circumstances is deemed to protect the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures that the Fourth Amendment protects. See, e.g., Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 704-05 (1981); Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 15 (1948).

Appeals from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that because plaintiffs’ constitutional rights were not “clearly established” at the time that those rights were allegedly violated, state officials were entitled to qualified immunity for their actions. On February 10, 2012, I held that though some New York state courts were in disagreement over the reach of the Earley decision, there was never any disagreement or confusion about the core constitutional holding announced by Earley: terms of PRS imposed by the executive branch were nullified and if the State wished to re-impose them, it could seek resentencing before a judge. Therefore the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. Defendants appealed this ruling, and the Second Circuit affirmed.4 Plaintiffs now move to certify a class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) on behalf of individuals who were convicted of various crimes in New York State courts on or after September 1, 1998; were sentenced to 4 See Bentley v.

Finally, the Smith action was dismissed based on qualified immunity and the injunctive relief bar the court had earlier applied in the Gabriel/Hardy action.

Stokes explained that she believed that RealPage had improperly reported to Greenway Presbyterian Apartments (“Greenway”), a prospective landlord,5 that she was a defendant in several criminal cases, the records of which had been previously expunged.6 (Id.) RealPage understood this discussion to be a dispute under Section 5 Stokes alleges that after separating from her husband, and under threat of losing her home to foreclosure, she actively sought senior housing.

On or about October 20, 2014, in connection with her application, RealPage prepared and sold a consumer report about Stokes to Greenway. (Id. 28.) 6 The Complaint also alleges that, in September of 2008, Stokes was arrested in connection with a domestic dispute and charged with aggravated assault and other lesser charges. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. In June of 2010, she was arrested for theft offenses after taking her husband’s ATM card from their joint bank account. The charges were subsequently withdrawn. The records of both offenses appeared under her married name of Helen Marie Davis; Plaintiff resumed her maiden name of Stokes after her divorce. These two cases were her only arrests, and she has never been convicted of a crime. (Compl. 16-19.)

As a result of the inaccurate report, Greenway denied Stokes’s rental application. (Id. 43.) Thereafter, she learned from Greenway that RealPage was the source of the report. (Id. 44.) Shortly after Stokes requested her consumer report from RealPage, she applied for a residential lease at Scottish Rite Tower (“SRT”), another senior housing facility in Philadelphia. (Id. 48.)

2005. In an effort to encourage settlement discussions, the Court directed plaintiffs to make a settlement offer within 30 days. On July 30, 2004, the Court entered an Order establishing a schedule for the parties to update discovery previously obtained, for plaintiffs to conduct updated case record and investigative file reviews, and for production of supplemental expert reports and related discovery. The Court also directed the parties to report on the progress of settlement discussions. Finally, the Court pushed the trial date back to February 14, 2005, and directed the parties to file their proposed consolidated pretrial order by January 31, 2005.

Delaware Valley I, 478 U.S. at 555, 106 S.Ct. at 3093 (quotation omitted). As it had done in Blum, the Delaware Valley I Court reviewed the district court's reasons for enhancing the fee award and found all of them wanting.

The plaintiffs returned to court in January 2001, seeking an order directing the state to comply with specific terms of the state settlement agreement. The court found that the state had acted with insufficient diligence in implementing the information management system, and therefore extended the terms of the agreement in this area and directed that the plaintiffs receive semi-annual reports. The defendants provided a January 2017 report to show that they were continuing to develop, implement, and update their information systems for child welfare needs. A year later, the court ended its supervision of the portions of the settlement that it had retained jurisdiction to enforce. ","248. Indeed, defendants argue that plaintiffs waived their objections to recertification of the order because, after plaintiffs' initial objection in the district court, they failed to either raise this issue before the panel of this court that in early September 1996 granted defendants' petition for leave to appeal or move for reargument before that panel. While not determinative, plaintiffs' tardiness in raising this jurisdictional challenge reinforces defendants' argument that plaintiffs were not prejudiced by recertification in this case. Balancing all of these considerations, we denied plaintiffs' motion to dismiss.

The FSA reflects DSS’s agreement to address long-standing problems experienced by children in foster care custody and in the operation of South Carolina’s child welfare system. It includes a broad range of provisions governing: caseworker caseloads; visits between children in foster care and their caseworkers and family members; investigations of allegations of abuse and neglect of children in foster care; appropriate and timely foster care and therapeutic placements; and access to physical and mental health care for children in DSS custody.

Plaintiffs have encountered various accessibility barriers throughout Steamboat Springs. There are numerous issues related to SST, the city’s public transportation system, as well as several of the city’s other programs and facilities.
Other aspects of Steamboat Springs’ public transportation system are inaccessible to Mr. Richardson and Mr Steele. For example, some of the bus stops have shelters inside of which patrons of the bus system may shield themselves from the winter wind and cold as they wait. Some of these shelters are inaccessible to persons who use wheelchairs.
In addition to the accessibility barriers to Steamboat Springs’ public transportation system, there are several other facilities in Steamboat Springs that are inaccessible to individuals with disabilities, particularly persons who use wheelchairs. For example:
The parking lot at Spring Creek Reservoir, a city-owned and -operated park that Mr. Steele frequents, is almost exclusively reserved for persons with disabilities. Steamboat Springs, however, removed a wheelchair-accessible portable restroom from this location, leaving only an inaccessible, standard portable restroom.
Mr. Steele has attended the Chariot Races held in the winter at Romick Rodeo Arena, part of the City’s Howelsen Hill Complex. These races are inaccessible to persons who use wheelchairs.
Defendant’s violations of the Rehabilitation Act have harmed Plaintiffs.
I. INTRODUCTION On July 1, 1999, Timothy Richardson and Jonathan Steele (“Individual Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against the City of Steamboat Springs, Colorado (“City”), alleging that the City had discriminated against them on the basis of disability in connection with the provision of transit service and certain other City services, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12149 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehabilitation Act”), 29 U.S.C. § 794.
G. The City shall continue to provide comprehensive training for all bus and van operators, dispatchers, and mechanics. The City shall also provide said training upon hiring of any new operator or mechanic, whether or not said employee previously worked for the City. The City shall also provide timely refresher training for any operator or mechanic if and when said employee demonstrates a lack of knowledge of proper wheelchair lift operation, maintenance, and repair. Refresher training for operators shall also be provided at or about the beginning of winter. The training shall include courses available from wheelchair lift and/or bus manufacturers to cover the proper operation, maintenance, and repair of lifts. The training shall also include hands-on training for all operators that includes proper deployment and stowing of wheelchair lifts utilizing both hydraulic and manual systems, if they exist; proper operation of lifts during inclement weather; procedures in compliance with paragraph F, above, for dispatching of alternate transportation when disabled individuals using wheelchairs cannot board a City vehicle; and the provision of adequate time in operating the lifts to allow individuals with disabilities to safely complete boarding and disembarking from the vehicle. The training shall also include general information about applicable Department of Transportation regulations under Title II of the ADA and appropriate behavior in interacting with individuals with disabilities. To insure the effectiveness of its training, the City shall utilize a self-evaluation program to establish criteria and test each trainee's competency at the conclusion of the training. The City shall make and maintain for the duration of this Consent Decree records showing the dates and hours of training, names of instructors and students, and the subject matter covered.
J. By agreeing to and voluntarily entering into this section (II(J)) of the Consent Decree, there is no admission or concession by the City, express or implied, that it has in any way violated the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, or any other federal, state, or local law, regulation, order, or rule. The City denies and continues to deny that it has violated any such laws pertaining to the access issues addressed in this section (II(J)) of the Consent Decree. The City denies and continues to deny any and all liability to Individual Plaintiffs for any such claims. As part of this Consent Decree, the City agrees to the following: 1.

Richardson, et al v. Steamboat Spgs, City Assigned to: Judge Zita L. Weinshienk Referred to: Magistrate Judge Michael J. Watanabe Demand: $0 Cause: 42:12101 Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA)
V. Defendant Steamboat Springs, City of
CONSENT DECREE by Judge Zita L. Weinshienk (cc: all counsel) entry date 12/12/00 (former empl) (Entered: 12/12/2000)","The City of Steamboat Springs is a public entity under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (R.A. 1973) and receives federal financial assistance for the operation of its public transportation system through Steamboat Springs Transit (SST) which operates a fixed route bus system. The plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Colorado on January 12, 2001 against the City and SST. The complaint alleged that the defendants had violated the ADA by failing to properly train and supervise its drivers and failing to provide the plaintiffs with reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to extend the deadline for plaintiffs to move for an award of their fees and fees. The case was closed on January 11, 2002.","On July 1, 1999, two individuals with disabilities filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against the City of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The plaintiffs alleged that the city had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by denying them access to the city's public transportation system and other facilities. The court entered a consent decree between the plaintiffs and the city. The decree required the city to provide comprehensive accessibility training for all bus and van operators, dispatchers, and mechanics. The city also agreed to provide timely refresher training for any operator or mechanic who demonstrates a lack of knowledge of proper wheelchair lift operation, maintenance, and repair."

4. This action may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) because the discriminatory conduct at issue failure to provide appropriate wheelchair and companion seating at Fiddler’s Green is applicable to all members of the class and therefore an injunction requiring such seating is appropriate. In addition, the injunctive relief is the predominant relief sought by the class.
c. Defendants also offer a “Premier Ticket Program” for nondisabled concert-goers. According to Defendants’ promotional materials, “[t]he same outstanding seats can be yours all season long! Premier seating is available to every event held at Fiddler's Green Amphitheatre.” Because Defendants continuously permit the only available wheelchair seating to be blocked at Fiddler’s Green, this ticket program is also unavailable to persons who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids and their companions.
d. Defendants offer a “Group Sales Program” for nondisabled concert-goers. According to Defendants’ promotional materials, “[t]hrough Fiddler's special group savings package, your firm or organization can save on regular admission prices! Perfect for ‘company days’ or a special summer outing! Groups of 20 or more can get blocks of tickets in reserved sections, or on the lawn (general admission).” Because the only designated seating available for persons who use wheelchairs or mobility aids and their companions is in the often unusable wheelchair seating section which will not seat more than approximately 21 persons, and because there exists no appropriate wheelchair seating in the general admission seating area at Fiddler’s Green, persons who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids are denied this ticket option as well.
2. Nature of litigation. Plaintiffs filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado as Civil Action No. 97-Z-1586 (the ""Litigation"") alleging both individual and class action claims. In the complaint, Plaintiffs allege that in connection with the operation of Fiddler's Green Amphitheater (""Fiddler's Green""), Defendants have violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (""CADA"") as to the class, and that Fey, Universal and Every Dog have violated the Colorado Consumer Protection Act and engaged in common law negligent misrepresentation, fraud and fraudulent concealment as to the individually named Plaintiffs.

39,DR-DC-0009,"On December 2, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (“Amtrak”) for allegedly violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165, by failing to make its intercity rail stations accessible to individuals with disabilities by July 26, 2020, as required by the Act. The case was never properly docketed or assigned to a judge, however, because the government announced its settlement with Amtrak on the same day. The settlement agreement required Amtrak to design at least 135 accessible stations, complete construction at 90 stations, and be in the process of constructing at least 45 stations within 10 years of the settlement date. The agreement also required Amtrak to train staff on ADA compliance, establish a monitor-approved process for managing ADA complaints, and create a settlement fund to compensate individuals who were harmed by Amtrak’s most inaccessible stations. The settlement was monitored by the Federal Railroad Administration and the Department of Justice. ","1. The United States brings this action against Defendant, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), to enforce Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12165, and its implementing regulation, 49 C.F.R Pt. 37.
5. In commencing this action under the ADA, the United States seeks to end Amtrak’s decades-long failure to make its stations accessible to individuals with disabilities so that they can fully participate in and benefit from Amtrak’s transportation services. See 42 U.S.C. § 12133.
10. Defendant Amtrak is a provider of intercity rail transportation service.
18. The Department also received a complaint in 2013 from the National Disability Rights Network (NDRN), the nonprofit membership organization for the federally mandated Protection and Advocacy (P&A) Systems and Client Assistance Programs (CAP) for individuals with disabilities. P&As and CAPs work to improve the lives of people with disabilities, including by ensuring access and accountability in health care, education, employment, housing, transportation, voting, and within the juvenile and criminal justice systems. The complaint included an NDRN-generated report alleging that Amtrak stations across the country were inaccessible in violation of the ADA. NDRN based its report on more than 100 on-site surveys conducted in the summer of 2013 of Amtrak stations across the country. NDRN alleged ADA violations of the DOT Standards at stations for which Amtrak was responsible.
Settlement Agreement between the United States and National Passenger Railroad Corporation Amtrak 21.
1. The United States of America (“United States”) intends to bring an action against the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (“Amtrak”) to enforce Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1213112165, and its implementing regulation, 49 C.F.R. Part 37, United States v. Amtrak (the “Civil Action”). The United States alleges Amtrak violated Title II of the ADA by failing to make the existing stations1 for which it is responsible in its intercity rail transportation system readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, per the U.S. Department of Transportation Standards for Accessible Transportation Facilities (“DOT Standards”), 49 C.F.R. §§ 37.9 and 37.43, and 49 C.F.R. Part 37, Appendix A. The United States further alleges this has harmed passengers with disabilities using or seeking to use Amtrak’s services. Amtrak denies these allegations and asserts that it is, and has been, committed to complying with the ADA and to accommodating individuals with disabilities, but it enters into this Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) voluntarily in order to continue in good faith to devote significant resources to improve transportation services to passengers with disabilities as it has for several years, rather than in litigation.
10. Amtrak alleges it has expended hundreds of millions of dollars improving access to its trains in a variety of ways. Beginning in 2009, Amtrak implemented the ADA Stations Program (“ADASP”), through which Amtrak plans for the design and construction of ADA-compliant station facilities, including buildings, passenger platforms, and parking. Under the current ADASP, Amtrak prioritizes projects as follows:
C. Within 60 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, Amtrak will place at least a ¼-page advertisements of the Notice in USA Today (Friday circulation; display) the text of which is attached as Exhibit 4.
56. This Agreement will remain in effect for three years from the Effective Date of this Agreement, except for the terms related to station accessibility (Paragraphs 8-19, 29-31, 34, 36 (A) and (B), and 38). The terms on station accessibility, to the extent that the Parties do not mutually agree to change them and/or the law changes such that the provision is not required, will remain in effect for 10 years from the Effective Date of this Agreement. However, this Agreement will terminate earlier, by consent of the Parties, if all existing stations for which Amtrak is responsible are made readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, per the DOT Standards.
Exhibit 4 Notice of Amtrak Claims Fund Under the ADA Amtrak has entered into a Settlement Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve a lawsuit brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). The Settlement Agreement resolves alleged violations of the ADA.

40,DR-FL-0004,"On July 22, 2013, attorneys from United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the State of Florida. The DOJ alleged that nearly two hundred children with disabilities were unnecessarily segregated from their communities and the general population by the State, which had placed them in nursing homes. The DOJ sought an injunction requiring the State to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12131-12134, which, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of disabled individuals, and mandates that their rehabilitative and medical needs be provided in a manner that enables disabled individuals to be independent and integrated members of the community. In June 2014, the case was consolidated with another pending case, which is in the Clearinghouse as PB-FL-0007.","On December 20, 2011, we sent your office a letter providing notice that the Department of Justice (the “Department”) had opened an investigation of the State with respect to the services it provides to children with disabilities under the age of twenty-one, including children who have medically fragile or medically complex conditions. We stated that the focus of our investigation was whether the State’s policies and practices regarding the services it provides these individuals violate federal law, including Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12132, and its implementing regulations, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). We further explained that the investigation was opened in response to information we received alleging that the State relies inappropriately and unnecessarily on nursing facilities, including those serving elderly individuals, as settings in which to provide services to children. In the same letter, we requested certain documents and other information related to our investigation. To date, and despite a number of requests, counsel from your office has declined to produce any information to the Department voluntarily.5 We have conducted a thorough investigation of the State’s system of services for children with disabilities—and particularly those who have developmental disabilities or who have medically complex or medically fragile conditions. We retained the services of an expert consultant with extensive experience arranging community-based services for children and youth in this population. With our expert, we visited a number of large nursing facilities that collectively serve more than two hundred children in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa, and St. Petersburg.
The educational opportunities available to children and young adults who are placed in these facilities are also quite limited. A large number of children participate in public school districts’ hospital/homebound programs, which serve children who are deemed ineligible to participate in an integrated classroom environment for medical or other reasons. For these students, the facilities offer a room or area in the facility where children are given classroom instruction in small groups or one-to-one for short periods of time. From our review, it appeared that many children were offered only forty-five minutes of educational activities per day, several days per week.35 A substantial number of children and young adults in these facilities have families who visit often and who offer undeniable levels of care and support. Many families, however, live far from the institutions and for that reason it is difficult to visit regularly. Other children and young adults are in the custody of the State and do not have active familial involvement. For these individuals, their interaction with other individuals without disabilities appears limited to infrequent community outings or in-facility visits from community volunteers.
Additionally, there are numerous children in other states, with needs similar to those of the children institutionalized in Florida nursing homes, who are being served successfully in community-based settings through those states’ Medicaid waiver programs for persons who are medically fragile or technologically dependent. With the supports provided through these waivers and other Medicaid services, hundreds, and in some states thousands, of families are able to stay united and children and young adults are able to participate in educational, social, and recreational activities in their own communities. The children in Florida’s nursing facilities and their families are no different.
Apr. 20, 2012) (“I am convinced that the real reason for reducing [plaintiff’s] nursing care hours was an unreasonable application of the [defendant’s] policy to wean nursing care and shift more of the burden to her caregiver”). And in another case, the court found that such practices also violate the ADA. See Royal ex rel. Royal v. Moore, 2012 WL 2326115, at *9 (N.D Ga
1. Nearly two hundred children with disabilities in Florida are segregated unnecessarily in nursing facilities. Many young adults, who entered nursing facilities as children and grew up in these institutions, remain unnecessarily segregated from their communities.1 As a result of limitations on community-based services and deficient assessment and transition planning processes, the Institutionalized Children have spent their formative years separated from their families and apart from their communities, often very far from home.

When evaluating whether to grant a TRO, the court must consider “(1) whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits, (2) whether the movant would suffer irreparable injury absent a[TRO], (3) whether granting the [TRO] would cause substantial harm to others, and (4) whether the public interest would be served by granting the [TRO].” N.E.

Each intersection also contains a number of ramp s that were “omitted” from being installed at that intersection. The list sets forth 1,809 curb ramps that were omitted at these intersections. 2) The Parties’ Negotiations Regarding these Ramps. Pursuant to the Court’s September 24, 2010 Order (document 58), wit h the assistance of the Special Master, the parties negotiated a compromise as to these 397 intersections. Plaintiffs reviewed in detail the City’s financial s ituation, to determine a time frame for retrofitting curb ramps and the extent of retrofitting at these intersections. 3) General Principal of Retrofitting. The parties have agreed, given the City’s financial condition, and solely f or purposes of amicable settlement of this particular issue at these specific 397 intersections, on the following retrofit. At each intersection on the attached list, the City will install or otherwise ens ure that there are ADA-compliant curb ramps so that pe rsons with mobility impairments can cross vi a the ADA-compliant curb ramps both intersecting str eets, roads or highways.

One such segregated setting is a day treatment program, isolated from other mainstream schools within JPS, that would serve only students with emotional disabilities. Students in this day treatment program would not even have the benefit of receiving live instmction and would not have a real, much less a highly qualified, teacher in their classroom. Instead, JPS intends to provide some of its most academically vulnerable students with instmction via video streaming from other classrooms. In its June 4, 2012 Weekly Report, the District also proposed creating a separate alternative school program to serve only students with disabilities.

Further, JPS informed MDE that it plans to place full time psychologists and behavioral support specialists in the alternative school and day treatment program to provide students with disabilities with more intensive behavioral interventions Id. at
The balance of equities strongly favors the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs are a class of students with significant disabilities who attend Jackson Public Schools who have been subjected to multiple disciplinary removals and who have been denied meaningful educational benefit from their IEPs. MDE has documented that for years, class members have been denied the educational and supportive services they need to achieve and have been forced into substandard segregated settings. As noted above, fewer than 10% of JPS’ students with disabilities graduate, and Plaintiffs E.H., J.P., and R.T. have made very little academic progress over the course of many school years. The representative plaintiffs, and many others similarly situated, have suffered repeated suspensions and are at risk of removal from their neighborhood schools to selfcontained classrooms and segregated day programs.15 The Defendant has long been aware of the problems in JPS, yet has abdicated its responsibility to correct them. As set forth in detail above, in September 2010, class members filed a state administrative complaint with MDE against JPS alleging various systemic violations of the IDEA. Following a thorough investigation, MDE substantiated all of the allegations contained in Plaintiffs’ administrative complaint. In its November Follow-up Monitoring Report, MDE confirmed that the violations of the IDEA it had identified were systemic 15 The importance of education is without question. As the Supreme Court noted, “education provides the basic tools by which individuals might lead economically productive lives to the benefit of us all [and] has a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society.” Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221 (1982). These considerations are all the more critical for students with disabilities who have been hampered by low expectations and social misconceptions. 20 U.S.C. §1400(c).
4. This litigation arises from a formal state complaint filed with MDE in September 2010 on behalf of Plaintiff E.H. and a class of similarly situated Jackson Public School District (""JPS"") students alleging systemic violations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (""IDEA""). MDE investigated the complaint and determined JPS to be in noncompliance with federal law. MDE thereafter placed JPS on a corrective action plan and monitored the District's compliance.

This action involves allegations of discrimination on the basis of disability by the New York City Human Resources Administration (“HRA”) at “hub centers” and Job Centers in New York City operated by HRA. The case arises out of HRA’s WeCARE (“Wellness, Comprehensive Assessment, Rehabilitation and Employment”) program. As WeCARE was originally conceived, public assistance recipients who have a mental or physical impairment had their public assistance cases transferred from their local Job Center to one of three “hub centers” in the Bronx, Brooklyn, or Manhattan. They are assigned to one of two WeCARE vendors, which were charged with assessing their medical and physical impairments and either providing appropriate rehabilitative services or assisting in obtaining permanent disability benefits.

The parents claimed that their son was unfairly discriminated against due to his disability and was deprived of an appropriate education. In 2004, the Eastern District of Arkansas Court held that neither defendant had violated the federal statutes and found for state and the school district.","Appeals from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
The text of the Eleventh Amendment reads: ""The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one ofthe United States by Citizens ofanother State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."" U.S Const. amend XI. The Amendment's text, however, does not accurately define the bounds of the immunity that the Amendment reflects. See Alden v. Maine, 119 S Ct. 2240, 2246 (1999) (stating that ""Eleventh Amendment immunity,"" while a convenient shorthand, is ""something ofa misnomer, for the sovereign immunity ofthe States neither derives from nor is limited by the terms of the Eleventh Amendment""). Rather, Eleventh Amendment immunity generally prevents an unwilling state from being sued in federal court. See Flori(ia Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd v. College Sav.

2000. These cases have been consolidated hy the District Court. The suit has been brought both on behalf of their son and as a class action. The Bradleys' son is no longer in school (the record does not show why), and therefore the Bradleys' request for injunctive relief as to their son is now moot. Their case thus remains viable as to their son only as an action for a money judgment. Meanwhile, the class action, in which only injunctive relief is sought on behalf ofthe class, remains pending in the District Court.
JUDGMENT Pursuant to the Order entered on this date containing the Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Judgment is hereby entered for the Defendants and Plaintiffs' complaint is dismissed with prejudice.
31. In light of the hostile environment, David refused to go to school. The Bradleys requested home schooling based on a recommendation from Dr Hartman. Williford refused to provide the requested schooling.
74. Williford provided appropriate training for its personnel in the implementation of the IEP's.
1996. Among the charges: the School District hired an aide for David without consulting the IEP team and failed to give her intensive training (although the evidence showed that the aide was trained by Padgett, the consultant chosen by the Bradleys), the software the District agreed to purchase for David's use at home was more than sixty days late, and there were problems with the integrated speech therapy and the occupational therapy the District was to provide for David. The state employees who conducted the investigation reviewed the case file; the IEP; the notes from weekly meetings held with David's teachers and others, including his parents; and David's school records. They interviewed the Bradleys and others who were involved in David's education. The investigative team found that the only charge with merit concerned David's occupational therapy. The Bradleys had located the occupational therapist for David when it was the School District's responsibility to do so. By the time the School District contacted the therapist and arranged for payment and transportation to the therapist's office in Jonesboro (about an hour and a half away from Williford), the implementation of this IEP service was six days late. The School District was directed to provide two hours ofcompensatory occupational therapy.
In February and March 2004, the District Court held a bench trial on the Bradleys' claims and issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court determined that none of the defendants violated federal law. The Bradleys appeal, raising three issues under the IDEA and one under § 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act.
We hold that the District Court properly dismissed all ofthe Bradleys' claims. The judgment is affirmed.

The case settled for a consent decree entered August 15, 2002, which required the defendants to implement a mandatory staff training program, revise its policies, select compliance coordinators, develop systems for reporting harassment and discrimination, allow students to form a gay-straight alliance, and create a community advisory group.  The decree implementation period was 6 months.  ","27. This harassment that students who are gay or lesbian or perceived as gay or 12 lesbian suffer is not limited to verbal harassment, but has often escalated to physical assault 13 and intimidation both on and off campus. Students who are gay or lesbian or who are 14 perceived as gay or lesbian have been spit upon by other students on the campus of Golden 15 West while these same students hurl anti-gay epithets at them. Plaintiffs are informed and 16 believe that former students who were perceived to be gay have had food, pencils, erasers, 17 and textbooks and other objects thrown at them. While in the parking lot at Golden West, 18 one gay student was almost hit by a car driven by another student who was actively trying to 19 run him down. As another example, Plaintiffs are informed and believe that a student 20 directed a death threat to a gay student at Golden West. On or about November 2000, 21 Plaintiffs are informed and believe that students at Golden West spray painted “Fag” on a 22 pickup truck driven by another student.
63. The hostile environment towards gays and lesbians at Golden West 9 discourages students from questioning or confronting their own sexual orientation or forming 10 or joining support groups such as GSAs for fear that doing so could subject them to verbal 11 and physical harassment. GSAs and other support groups have not yet organized in the 12 VUSD due to the fact that students may face retaliatory harassment in the event that they 13 would be discovered as participating in such an organization.
70. VUSD promotes and fosters this hostile environment. Defendants and other VUSD officials do not fund, sponsor, endorse, or promote any organization within the district to provide support to students who are the victims of anti-gay harassment. VUSD has no formal or informal policy to ensure that its schools are safe for students who are gay or lesbian or who are perceived as gay or lesbian. Teachers, counselors, and administrators are not trained how to assist student victims of anti-gay harassment at VUSD schools. Further, VUSD has no adequate formal or informal policy for preventing or responding to such harassment; the absence of such a policy has the effect of promoting and perpetuating

After negotiations, the court approved a Consent Decree in March 2015. An Independent Monitor continues to file periodical assessments as the State works toward full compliance under court supervision. ","100. The discipline policies in effect in New Orleans public schools demonstrate the Defendants' failure to ensure that local education agencies comply with federal law regarding the disciplinary procedural protections. For example, the discipline policy for Arise Academy Charter School states that if a child's individualized education program does not contain ""disciplinary guidelines"" then the child with a disability is subject to the same disciplinary removals as non-disabled children. The discipline policy for Pride College Prep Charter School states that students with disabilities may be subject to the same discipline rules as non-disabled students. Neither policy makes any mention of a manifestation detennination review or due process protections. Similarly, Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School's discipline policy states that disciplinary action for a child with a disability may consist of the same consequences for regular education students, but if the child is expelled, the parent must sign a manifestation determination form. These policies directly contradict federal law and demonstrate the schools' failure to understand and implement the procedural protections of IDEA related to manifestation determination reviews (MDRs).

Both Proposal 2 and the University of Michigan's announcement that it would comply triggered litigation.  On November 15, 2012, the en banc Sixth Circuit held that Proposal 2 created a comparative structural burden that undermined the Equal Protection Clause (which the court called the ""political process"" argument).  Accordingly, the court found Proposal 2 unconstitutional.  On March 24, 2013, the Supreme Court granted review of the case.  Argument will be after the Court's summer break.  

On October 15, 2013 the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case.  In an opinion written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, the court reversed the Sixth Circuit.  There were two concurring opinions and a single dissent.  In his opinion Kennedy asserts that this is not a case about resolving the debate about racial preferences, but rather about whether it is constitutional for Michigan to allow its voters to decide the issue.  The court holds that there is no authority in the Federal Constitution or in this Court’s precedents for the Judiciary to set aside Michigan laws that commit to the voters the determination whether racial preferences may be considered in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school admissions.   ","On November 8, 2006, one day after the election, the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and Immigrant Rights, and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary, along with other organizations and individuals opposed to Proposal 2 (collectively, the ""plaintiffs""), filed a lawsuit against (1) Jennifer Granholm, the Governor of Michigan, and (2) the Regents of the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University and the Board of Governors of Wayne State University (collectively, the ""Universities""), seeking a declaratory judgment that the amendment was invalid and a permanent injunction against its enforcement. They filed the lawsuit in the Southern Division of the Eastern District of Michigan. In their amended complaint, plaintiffs contended that Proposal 2 violates two federal constitutional provisions (the First and Fourteenth Amendments), three federal civil rights statutes (Title VI, Title VII and Title IX) and one presidential order (Executive Order 11246). To date, plaintiffs have not independently filed a motion for a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order against enforcement of Proposal 2.

The injunctive relief included a provision for the appointment of an independent auditor to monitor DOE’s success in improving the implementation of IHO orders. On March 26, 2008, the Court appointed Daylight Forensic and Advisory LLC (“Daylight”) to serve as the independent auditor.
DISCUSSION The parties have agreed that plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. (See Stip. 41, 42.) It is plaintiffs’ burden to establish “with satisfactory evidence—in addition to the attorney’s own affidavits”—why their requested fee is appropriate. Chambless v. Masters, Mates Pilots Pension Plan, 885 F.2d 1053, 1059 (2d Cir. 1989). The “starting point” for calculating a reasonable attorneys’ fee is “the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.” Imbeault v. Rick’s Cabaret Int’l Inc., RCI, No. 08-5458, 2009 WL 2482134, at *1 (S.D.N.Y Aug. 13, 2009) (Lynch, J.) (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhard, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)). The resulting figure is the “presumptively reasonable fee,” Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass’n v. County of Albany, 522 F.3d 182, 183 (2d Cir. 2008), although it evidently “can be further adjusted as circumstances warrant,” McDow v. Rosado, 657 F. Supp.

I. INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs commenced this putative class action alleging, among other things, that Defendants’ policies and procedures with respect to educationally disabled children attending school in the Buffalo City School District violate the rights of those children and their parents under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. Presently before this Court is Plaintiffs’ motion to certify class pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Also before this Court is Defendants’ cross-motion to stay class certification pending resolution of an as yet unfiled summary judgment motion. For the reasons that follow, Defendants’ motion is denied and Plaintiffs’ motion is granted.
N.Y Educ. Law § 4404(1)-(2). Any party aggrieved after utilizing these procedures may “bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented” in state or district court. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A) B. Factual Background Plaintiff R. A-G. is a student in the Defendant Buffalo City School District (“the District”) and is classified by the District as learning disabled. (Compl. 2, 20, Docket No. 1.) The District’s CSE prepared the Plaintiff student’s IEP for the 2011-2012 school year in May
2012. (Compl. 14, 43.) Plaintiffs allege that “Defendants maintain and implement a policy by which the District does not provide the related services to be provided via students’ IEPs during the first two weeks of the school year (or longer), irrespective of any individual student’s need for such related services at the inception of the school year.” (Compl. 5.) They claim that, as a result of this policy, the District substantially failed to provide the student class with a FAPE; failed to make individual assessments of students’ needs; denied parents meaningful participation in the decision-making regarding their children; and failed to implement students’ related services as required by IEPs, all in contravention of the mandates of IDEA. (Compl. 61-70.) Plaintiffs further allege that, in failing to provide services to disabled students when services for non-disabled students were provided, the District discriminated against the student members of the class in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.
Here, Plaintiffs’ administrative complaint alleged a failure to implement the Plaintiff student’s IEP where: (1) her speech and therapy services were not provided until three weeks after the start of the school year; (2) the Plaintiff was not consistently receiving class notes daily as required by her IEP; and (3) the CSE failed to recommend occupational therapy services as required by a prior agreement. (Weiss Affirm Ex. A.) As Defendants note, of these assertions only the alleged failure to timely provide related speech and therapy services appears in the present civil complaint, and although Plaintiffs’ counsel raised the issue of the improper policy at the hearing, it was not considered by either the impartial hearing officer or the state review officer. Defendants therefore argue that only the individual claim of delay in providing related services to the Plaintiff student may be considered by this Court. (Def’s Mem of Law at 8-13.) Plaintiffs respond that all claims have been exhausted to the extent possible and, in any event, their allegations of Defendants’ systemic violations fall within an exception to the exhaustion requirement. (Pl’s Reply Mem of Law at 4-6, Docket No. 28-1.) As the party asserting that an exception to this exhaustion requirement applies, Plaintiffs bear the burden of proof. J.S. ex rel.

On October 2, 1996, the Court entered a consent decree, which settled each of the claims stated in the Complaint and resolved all claims asserted against individuals who were named in their official and individual capacities, dismissing claims for damages.  ","12. Plaintiff Ron Randolph is the father of Mimi Randolph, a 15-year-old 10th grade student at Owasso High School. Mimi is a talented athlete who participates in interscholastic softball. She has thus endured the unequal treatment and benefits directed by Owasso toward their female athletes. In addition, her opportunities to participate in interscholastic and other school-sponsored athletics are not comparable to the opportunities afforded to boys who are similarly situated. The Randolphs are residents of Owasso, Oklahoma, which is within the jurisdiction of this Court.

9. Owasso shall construct an on-campus softball field which is comparable in quality to the existing baseball field. The on-campus softball field shall be made competition-ready, if possible, by August 1,
10. Owasso is a public school district. In order to obtain money to construct a softball field, and related facilities, it must pass a bond issue and access funds available through its building fund. Accordingly, the district shall commit to placing before eligible voters a spring 1997 bond issue which shall include a proposition for a softball field. Additionally, the District shall commit, for the school year 1996-97, Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) from its building fund toward the construction of a softball field to be located on the high school campus. The district shall continue to present bond issues, when feasible, to its voters until such time as all phases of the softball field are complete. The District is dependent, absent an infusion of funds from outside the school district, on its ability to pass bond issues in order to fund the construction of a softball field. If funds are not available to complete the softball field, due to voters' failure to pass one or more bond issues proposing the construction of the softball field, in accordance with the phases for construction laid out in paragraph 9 above, the District shall, notwithstanding failure of a bond issue, commit a minimum of $75,000 per year from the District's building fund until all phases are completed.
The Owasso School District tenders this Report to the Court in support of its compliance with the Consent Decree entered on October 2, 1996, in the class action lawsuit brought by parents of female students attending Owasso School District.

In a settlement agreement, the school district agreed to take steps to remedy the discriminatory actions by, among many things, providing coaching, facilities and equipment to both male and female athletic teams on a gender-neutral basis. ","(2) Chouteau Public Schools provides male athletes with newer equipment and supplies that are of better quality than those provided to female athletes. Chouteau Public Schools also provides male athletes with newer uniforms of better quality on a more frequent basis than those provided to female athletes. (3) Chouteau Public Schools unfairly discriminates against female athletes in the scheduling of their game and practice times. (4) Female athletes have fewer opportunities to receive coaching because several of Chouteau Public Schools' female teams share the same coach, even though the seasons for the sports overlap. (5) Chouteau Public Schools selects coaches for female athletic teams with less care and attention than for male athletic teams. As a result, the coaches of the female athletic teams often have less expertise than the coaches of the male athletic teams. (6) Chouteau Public Schools supplies superior locker rooms, practice facilities, and competition facilities to boys as compared to girls. (7) The provision of medical and training facilities and services are inequitable in that the male athletes have superior access to these facilities and services, while the female athletes have very limited access to these facilities and services. (8) Chouteau Public Schools consistently provides less publicity for its female athletic teams than for its male athletic teams.
1. The School District agrees to take affirmative steps to increase the participation of female students in the District's athletic program. The District shall, by May 20, conduct a sports interest survey for the specific purpose of determining the interest of female students in grades 5 thru 11 in the addition of and participation in volleyball and soccer atthe high school level and volleyball, soccer, and fast and slow pitch softball at the middle school level. Based on the results of the student interest survey, specific to those sports, and in combination with other factors related to the assessment of interest, the District shall add girls' sports for the 2000-2001 school year if necessary to accommodate girls' interest in school sponsored sports. The District agrees to engage in the active promotion of sports participation opportunities available to girls and active promotion of the dates for try-outs for various sports. The District's addition of new sports shall include the assignment of coaching salaries in a gender neutral fashion.
16. The parties agree that athletes in all sports benefit from the attention and publicity that may accompany participation and competition. Attention may be focused on a particular sport or individual athletes based on media interest in sports or athletes which the District may have little or no influence over. Likewise, the attention may be based on o District efforts to recognize sports and athletes such as the introduction of athletes at opportune times during football games or other sporting events prominent in the school district, through pep assemblies, through announcements made over a school's intercom system, or through school or school-related publications that publicize school sports or individual athletes. The District agrees to afford female athletes with publicity that, to the best of its effort, is equivalent to the opportunities for publicity available to male athletes. The parties recognize that teams, male or female, may receive more publicity both inside the District and outside the District, based on fan support for a particular sport, achievement in a given year such as advancement to regional or state competition, or based on the extraordinary accomplishments of a particular team or individual athlete. This extra attention, when not tied to gender, neither violates the District's obligations under Title IX nor creates a special obligation of the District with respect to those athletes or teams who do not receive as much attention as another team or athlete.","The plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oklahoma against the Chouteau Public Schools, alleging that the district violated Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by denying female students an equal opportunity to participate in interscholastic and other school-sponsored athletics.

In April, 1993, Dr. Carol Mills, a psychologist from Johns Hopkins University, evaluated Sam and concluded that he could not receive an appropriate education in the Conrad Weiser Area School District. Nevertheless the Luckinbills continued to try to work with the school district. In the summer of 1993, the district conducted a new MDE and held an IEP conference. The Luckinbills asked that an outside psychologist with a strong understanding of Sam's combination of needs consult with the school district on a monthly basis for the purpose of integrating the psychologist's recommendations into the regular classroom activity. The school district refused.
240. PDE has failed to require adequate individualized education programs for students with disabilities who are, or could be, educated in regular classes with supplementary aids and services. Missing from many IEPs are such essential components as present levels of performance, annual goals and measurable shortterm objectives. Without adequate individualized planning, a disabled child's unique educational needs cannot be met nor can success or failure be measured.
(b) Section 504 and its accompanying regulations protect otherwise qualified handicapped students who have physical, mental or health impairments from discrimination because of those impairments. The law and its regulations require public educational agencies to ensure that these students have equal opportunity to participate in the school program and extracurricular activities to the maximum extent appropriate to the ability of the protected handicapped student in question. School districts are required to provide these students with the aids, services and accommodations that are designed to meet the educational needs of protected handicapped students as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped students are met. These aids, services and accommodations may include, but are not limited to, special transportation, modified equipment, adjustments in the student's all specially designed instruction, accommodations, or other support identified by the IEP team. (Id. at Provision IV.1(C).) Fourth, PDE agrees to create readily available, informational materials about the types of supplementary aids and services that children with disabilities can receive in a regular education classroom and how parents can seek assistance in obtaining these aids and services for their children. PDE will seek input from the Advisory Panel (see Part II.A below) for this initiative. (Id. at Provision IV.1(D).) Finally, PDE agrees to create materials representing that all children, including those children with disabilities, are welcome in school. These materials will be displayed in school buildings. PDE also agrees to seek input from the Advisory Panel (see Part II.A below) for this initiative. (Id. at Provision IV.1(E).) B. Advisory Panel PDE agrees to establish a special advocacy group, known as the “Bureau Director’s Advisory Panel on Least Restrictive roster or the administration of needed medication.

62,ED-VA-0002,"In 2015, a transgender boy filed a lawsuit against his school district because they would not allow him to use the boys' bathroom. The court granted the school district's motion to dismiss, but the appeals court reversed and remanded, and the district court has since granted a preliminary injunction allowing plaintiff access to the boy's bathroom. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the school district's appeal in 2016, but later remanded the case after the Department of Education and Department of Justice withdrew their prior guidance on the issue. The case was remanded to the district court to determine whether the plaintiff's graduation from high school rendered the case moot. On May 22, 2018, the district court denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss. The plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on February 15, 2019, and a motion for summary judgment on March 26, 2019. On August 9, 2019, the court granted the summary judgment; the defendant appealed the case. The case is ongoing. ","The School Board’s policy does not discriminate against any class of students. Instead, the policy was developed to treat all students and situations the same. To respect the safety and privacy of all students, the School Board has had a long-standing practice of limiting the use of restroom and locker room facilities to the corresponding biological sex of the students. The School Board also provides three singlestall bathrooms for any student to use regardless of his or her biological sex. Under the School Board’s restroom policy, G.G. is being treated like every other student in the Gloucester Schools. All students have two choices. Every student can use a restroom associated with their anatomical sex, whether they are boys or girls. If students choose not to use the restroom associated with their anatomical sex, the students can use a private, single-stall restroom. No student is permitted to use the restroom of the opposite sex. As a result, all students, including female to male transgender and male to female transgender students, are treated the same.

If it tenders a ruling out of harmony with our prior decisions, or questions of transcending public importance, or issues which would likely induce this Court to grant certiorari, the stay should be granted.”). Because it is impossible to know the precise issue(s) that prompted the Supreme Court to grant the stay, it is difficult to conclude that G.G. would control the outcome here.

Fourteen current and former African American employees at Tyson's Ashland, Alabama plant filed a lawsuit over the same issues, and the cases were consolidated. Plaintiffs claimed that Tyson had maintained racially segregated facilities and had subjected African American employees to a racially hostile work environment and retaliation and threats.

The Commission alleges that the Defendant discriminated against Henry Adams, Leon Walker, and a class of employees because of their race, black, by establishing and maintaining a racially segregated bathroom facility, designated for ""Whites Only"", at its Ashland, Alabama plant. In addition, Defendant retaliated against Henry Adams and Leon Walker after they complained about the existence ofthis racially segregated facility.

The EEOC's suit, EEOC v. Tyson Foods, Inc., CV-05-BE-1704-E (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama), alleges that Tyson's violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating against Henry Adams, Leon Walker, and other black employees, by establishing and maintaining a locked bathroom facility, which on occasion had signs posted on it stating ""Out of Order"" and ""Whites Only"". Keys to the facility were distributed to white employees only.

Best Buy's treatment of women and 5 minority employees and job applicants, however, remains outdated and obsolete. Best Buy 6 discriminates against African Americans by refusing to hire them for entry-level positions, and 7 when it does hire them, discriminates against its African-American employees with respect to job 8 assignments, promotions/transfers, and exempt compensation. Best Buy similarly discriminates 9 against its Latino employees with respect to job assignments and promotions/transfers. Best Buy 10 also discriminates against its female employees with respect to job assignments, promotions/ 11 transfers, and exempt compensation.
35. Best Buy generally does not permit its female and minority employees to 12 work on the sales floor. Instead, it segregates them in operations, stock room, cashier, and minor 13 sales positions, denying them assignment to major sales positions, including the Magnolia home 14 theater ""store within a store.""

G. Jurisdiction The District Court of the Northern District of California has jurisdiction over the Parties 3 and subject matter of this action. The Third Amended Complaint in this action asserts claims 4 that, if proved, would authorize the Court to grant the injunctive relief set forth in this Consent 5 Decree. Venue is proper in this Court. The Court shall retain jurisdiction of this action during 6 the Term of the Decree for the purpose of entering all orders authorized by the Decree, which 7 may be necessary to implement the relief provided in the Decree or to enforce the provisions of 8 the Decree.
1. Upon hire, all employees will continue to be required to receive training on 3 Best Buy’s non-discrimination, anti-harassment, and anti-retaliation policies.
4. Best Buy will offer training to all employees in how to use the registration 10 of interest and the internal job posting systems.

The plaintiffs alleged that Best Buy disproportionately assigned white men to sales positions and disproportionately assigns women 15 and minorities to non-sales positions.

72,EE-CO-0063,"This case was brought by employees of El Paso Corporation against their employer alleging violations of ERISA and the ADEA as a result of the conversion of their pension plans to a cash balance formula. However, the Tenth Circuit ruled that the defendant’s conversion to a cash balance plan was legal, as were the means the company utilized to transition to the new pension plan.","4. Defendant El Paso Pension Plan (the “Pension Plan”) is an employee benefit plan, as defined at § 3(3) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1002(3). More particularly, the Pension Plan is an “employee pension benefit plan”, as defined at ERISA § 3(2)(A), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(2)(A), and a “defined benefit plan” within the meaning of ERISA § 3(35), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(35). The administrative offices of the Defendant Pension Plan are in Houston, Texas.
Plaintiffs’ request for certification of ERISA and ADEA classes is consistent with the case law. Courts have allowed certification of overlapping ERISA and ADEA classes and representation of both classes by the same named plaintiffs, finding that the ERISA and ADEA claims do not necessarily conflict. See, e.g., Vaszlavik v. Storage Tech. Corp., 175 F.R.D. 672, 681 (D Colo. 1997) (“Plaintiffs’ ADEA and ERISA claims are complimentary and do not conflict so as to preclude the same named plaintiffs from representing each class); Krueger v. New York Tel. Co., 163 F.R.D. 433, 446 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (certifying ERISA and ADEA classes with same named plaintiffs; finding each ERISA subclass “identical to and coextensive with the ADEA class”).

In Thiessen v. GE Capital Corp., 267 F.3d 1095, 1105 (10th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 934 (2002), a district court’s decision to decertify a collective action was reversed because the court failed to recognize that “plaintiffs were asserting a pattern or practice claim.” The plaintiffs “alleged it was defendants’ standard operating procedure, implemented through the [Management Development Program] and the blocker policy to discriminate against employees... on the basis of age.” 267 F.3d at
All three named Plaintiffs were employed by a company known as EPNG. The dates referred to in this Declaration refer to the transition that pertained to EPNG employees. However, I used the correct transition dates for the Sonat and Coastal employees in my calculations.
Most critically, however, this Court’s January 21, 2009 decision did not rely on Morgan. It relied on Ledbetter. This Court found that Ledbetter had distinguished Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385 (1986), on the basis that the perpetuation of the individual decisions about Ms. Ledbetter’s compensation occurred pursuant to a “facially nondiscriminatory and neutrally applied” pay structure, and not a “facially discriminatory pay structure that put[] some employees on a lower scale because of race” as was at issue in Bazemore. 127 S.Ct. 2173-74. By contrast, Morgan describes Bazemore as “a pattern-or-practice case” and in footnote 9 states that “[w]e have no occasion here to consider the timely filing question with respect to ‘pattern-or-practice’ claims brought by private litigants as none are at issue here.” 536 U.S. at 112 and 115 n.9. For these reasons, this Court believed that Ledbetter, and not Morgan, had implicitly overturned the Tenth Circuit’s precedents on pattern-or-practice cases, including Thiessen v. GE Capital Corp, 267 F.3d 1095, 1105 (10th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 934 (2002), and Furr v. AT&T Technologies, 824 F.2d 1537, 1543-44 (10th Cir. 1987).

V. Defendant El Paso Corporation","A class action was brought against El Paso Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of employees who were over 50 years old when the company switched from a pension plan to a cash balance plan. The plaintiffs alleged that the switch violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) by reducing the rate of accrual because of age. The court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and the case is now closed.","The plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant, El Paso Pension Plan, violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) by failing to promote older employees to supervisory positions. The district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for certification of a class, and the case was transferred to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. The 10th Cir. ruled that the district court's decision to decertify the collective action was not consistent with the Tenth Circuit's precedents on pattern-or-practice cases."
73,EE-CO-0069,"On September 29, 2011, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC"") brought this lawsuit against Beverage Distributors Company, LLC (""BDC"") on behalf of a visually impaired company employee in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (""ADA""). The EEOC claimed that BDC discriminated against the employee in violation of the ADA when it conditioned his employment on the results of a medical exam and subsequently refused to hire him as a night warehouse loader upon learning that he had a disability. The jury initially awarded the employee $132,347 in back pay, but it found that his damages should be reduced by $102,803 because he could have mitigated those damages by finding a comparable position. On December 9, 2013, the District Court vacated these findings and awarded injunctive relief, only to be reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit because of erroneous jury instructions. The 10th Circuit denied the EEOC's petition for rehearing in May 2015. The parties entered into a consent decree in December 2015, and the matter appears to be closed. ","NATURE OF THE ACTION This is a public enforcement action under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (“ADA”), and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, to correct unlawful employment practices on the basis of disability and to provide appropriate relief to Mike Sungaila, a disabled individual as defined by the ADA. As alleged with greater particularity below, after eliminating Mr. Sungaila’s position as a Driver Helper, Defendant offered Mr. Sungaila a position as a Night Warehouse Loader, conditioned on the results of a medical exam. Defendant withdrew its offer of the Night Warehouse Loader position to Mr. Sungaila after obtaining the results of a medical exam because of his disability. Defendant refused to hire Mr. Sungaila because of his disability and terminated his employment.
2. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.
The EEOC filed the lawsuit (EEOC v. Beverage Distributors Company., Case No. 11-cv-02557) in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The suit seeks monetary damages, including back pay, compensation for emotional distress and punitive damages. The EEOC also seeks injunctive relief prohibiting further discrimination by the employer and mandating corrective action, including hiring Sungalia into a night warehouse loader position.

If any candidate was not hired by Defendant within the applicable six (6) month period due to his or her disability or the results of a pre-employment medical screen, Defendant will provide the name, address and telephone number of the candidate and an explanation of why the results of the medical screen precluded employment. 27.2. Reports of Disability Discrimination. If any candidate or employee has made either a verbal complaint of alleged disability discrimination (to include any complaints regarding the witnessing of alleged disability discrimination) to Defendant’s managerial or human resources personnel or a written complaint of alleged disability discrimination (to include any complaints regarding the witnessing of alleged disability discrimination) to Defendant’s managerial or human resources personnel or to a federal, state or local government agency within the applicable six (6) month period, Defendant will provide the following information: the name, address and telephone number of the complainant; the name, address and telephone number of each person identified as a potential witness; a brief summary of the complaint, to include the date of the complaint and the names of the individual(s) alleged to have engaged in the discriminatory conduct; a copy of the complaint, if applicable; a summary of Defendant’s investigation and response to the complaint, including the name of the person(s) who investigated and responded to the complaint; and the resolution reached, if any.

The EEOC alleged that the defendant discriminated against a blind employee by denying him a conditional offer of employment as a Night Warehouse Loader. The jury awarded back pay in the amount of $132,347.00, but reduced that award by $102,803.75, because it determined that Mr. Sungaila failed to make reasonable efforts to reduce his damages for loss of back pay.

74,EE-DC-0033,"Female financial advisers employed by Morgan Stanley sued under Title VII and the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, alleging that Morgan Stanley had a systemic pattern and practice of discriminating against female employees in compensation, promotions, and other areas. The parties settled, with Morgan Stanley paying $46m in damages, fees, and costs of administration, and agreeing to injunctive relief. This case was later consolidated with Amochaev v. Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","14. Since at least August 5, 2003, Morgan Stanley has systematically denied equal employment opportunities to its female financial advisors and female registered financial advisor trainees. Morgan Stanley has engaged in a pattern and practice of gender discrimination with respect to compensating and promoting women from the positions of financial advisor and/or registered financial advisor trainee to other more prestigious roles or positions such as, for financial advisors, branch/sales management positions, and, for registered financial advisor trainees, the position of financial advisor. Morgan Stanley has also engaged in a pattern and practice of gender discrimination with respect to other terms and conditions of employment of female financial advisors and registered financial advisor trainees that affect compensation and promotion opportunities including but not limited to: training and mentoring; account assignments; and participation in company-approved ""partnership"" arrangements with other financial advisors.
B. Programmatic Relief The programmatic relief agreed to in the Settlement consists of changes in company policies and practices that plaintiffs alleged were the source of the sex discrimination that they and other women experienced. Among other things, Morgan Stanley has agreed to revise the “Power Rankings” used to allocate accounts and other business opportunities to ensure equitable and fair account distribution without regard to gender. Morgan Stanley will also implement account distribution policies to ensure equitable and fair distribution of the accounts of departing Financial Advisors, retiring Financial Advisors, departing Financial Advisor partners, and leads, call-ins, and walk-ins, and will computer-automate the account distribution process. (Settlement Agreement, § VII.C). The company will maintain the Branch Management Mobility project and develop and implement a comprehensive management and assessment and development program to provide candidates a path to assessment and selection as branch managers. (Id., § VII.B). The company will provide bi-annual diversity training to all management-level field personnel and include a diversity component to branch manager compensation designed to measure and reward efforts at recruiting, training and retaining women Financial Advisors. (Id.).
Finally, Ms. Grant misunderstands the enforcement provisions of this Settlement Agreement. The provision limiting enforcement of the Agreement to Class Counsel is typical of class settlements like this one, and any Class Member who believes Morgan Stanley is not abiding by the terms of the Agreement may contact Class Counsel at any time during the term of the Agreement to discuss her concerns. The arbitration provision is related to enforcing the Settlement Agreement itself. (Settlement Agreement, § X.B). Morgan Stanley does not have a mandatory arbitration policy. (Dichter Decl., 23). The Settlement Agreement provides that disputes related to account distributions shall initially go through Morgan Stanley’s alternative dispute resolution mechanism, but nothing in the Settlement Agreement prevents a Class Member from “pursuing any legal claim not released under the Settlement through any applicable governmental agency or court of law if she is otherwise entitled to do so.” (Settlement Agreement, § VII.C.8).

75,EE-DC-0051,"This case was brought by several African-American current or former U.S. Capitol Police Officers against the United States Capitol Police Board. Plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and injunctive relief, alleging that Defendant engaged in a pattern and practice of race discrimination in employment. On October 13, 2016, the court granted defendant's motion to dismiss most of plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider which the court denied, and the court reaffirmed its reasoning on July 30, 2019. The case is ongoing.","I. Introduction Plaintiffs Sharon Blackmon-Malloy, Dale Veal, Vernier Riggs, Luther Peterson, Duvall Phelps, Larry Ikard, and Frank Adams bring a class complaint on behalf of themselves and all current or retired African American United States Capitol Police Officers. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant has engaged in a pattern and practice of race discrimination in employment.
Spavone, a Hispanic Officer, have been subjected to a hostile work environment based on their known associations with African American officers.
In these appeals by United States Capitol Police officers from the dismissal of their discrimination complaint for failure to exhaust, three aspects of this regime are at issue: whether the three-step process is jurisdictional, whether in-person attendance by the employee is required at counseling or mediation, and whether receipt of end of counseling and mediation notices demonstrates completion of counseling and mediation. We hold the three-step process is jurisdictional and thus affirm the district court ruling that equitable doctrines, such as vicarious exhaustion, do not apply to excuse compliance with it. We reverse, however, the district court’s in-person ruling, holding that neither the CAA nor the procedural rules of the Office of Compliance require in-person attendance by the employee at counseling or mediation. Finally, we hold that receipt of written notice of the end of mediation from the Office of Compliance triggered the CAA’s 30 to 90-day period for electing whether to pursue judicial or administrative relief and demonstrated the employee’s completion of counseling and mediation. Accordingly, we remand the cases to the district court.
59. Luther Peterson, an African American Officer, was discriminated against on the basis of his race when he was unfairly disciplined. Officer Peterson had been with the U.S. Capitol Police since October 10,

D. The Court Grants the Second Motion to Dismiss. On September 30, 2004, the Court granted the Capitol Police Board’s motion to dismiss. See Blackmon-Malloy v. U.S. Capitol Police Bd., 338 F. Supp.

remedies regarding some of their claims; each individual also appears on the list of those as to whom exhaustion is disputed because the defendant argues that these individuals failed to exhaust regarding certain claims. See id. at 1 n.1, 4–10. The parties also agreed that sixty plaintiffs did not properly exhaust their administrative remedies and thus should be dismissed from this case, id. at 2–3,5 and that seven more had indicated to counsel their intent to withdraw from the case. Id.
1. The Court agrees with the defendants.
278. Accordingly, plaintiffs’ contention that he should be able to proceed on additional hostile work environment claims is unavailing. The Court agrees with plaintiffs that Sgt. Ikard may proceed on his retaliation claim based on not being promoted to a K-9 officer position. Magistrate Judge Facciola found that Sgt. Ikard exhausted his administrative remedies for a hostile work environment claim arising out of those facts and Officer Ikard has asserted a retaliation claim in the Fourth Amended Complaint. The Court rejects the plaintiffs’ argument that Sgt. Ikard can proceed with his claims in Civil Action No. 04-320 because he is not a named plaintiff in that case. Accordingly, the Court will ADOPT IN PART and REJECT IN PART the recommendation and Sgt. Ikard may proceed on his two claims as listed in Appendix II to this Memorandum Opinion Sgt. Ikard’s remaining claims will be DISMISSED.

The EEOC sought injunctive and monetary relief as well reinstatement of the affected individual. The parties agreed upon a settlement agreement on November 12, 2013. ","2. The alleged unla\\ful employment practices were committed within the Jurisdiction ofthe United States District Court for the Southern District ofF1orida. Fort Pierce Division.
The EEOC's suit charged that Bay State Milling Company discriminated against Gary Legore, a qualified applicant, when the hiring manager for the Indiantown, Fla., miller vacancy rejected him for the position because of his age. The hiring manager informed Legore of the company's desire to hire a younger individual for the job. The company ultimately hired a 22-year-old with less experience than Legore.
The settlement agreement will be for both cases combined. The defendant will be paying $150,000 which will include attorneys’ fees and costs. And, in addition, the defendant will be agreeing to a consent decree.
3. The Consent Decree is Resolved On November 22, 2013, the EEOC and Bay State submitted a joint motion for approval of a consent decree. [Case No. 12‐14439, ECF No. 69]. As noted, an agreement to a consent decree was the only contingency of the $150,000 settlement. The District Court entered the party‐proposed consent decree. [Case No. 12‐14439, ECF No. 70]. Among other things, the consent decree provided that Bay State would pay Mr. Legore $80,185.66, in two payments of $40,092.83, to settle the EEOC’s lawsuit. [Id. at pp. 4‐5]. The party‐drafted consent decree, however, neither mentioned Mr. Legore’s private lawsuit nor the $150,000 settlement reached at the settlement conference. Stated another way, there is nothing in the consent decree that indicates that the $80,185.66 due under the consent decree was to be offset against the overall $150,000 settlement reached at the settlement conference.","The EEOC filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Fort Pierce Division, in January 2013 against the Florida Department of Labor. The complaint alleged that the agency violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), which prohibits discrimination based on an individual's age.

Plaintiffs alleged that they were coerced into adopting Scientology religious views and practices.  In December of 2013, the case was settled for $170,000 and a series of anti-discrimination measures on the part of Dynamic. ","NATURE OF ACTION This is an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq.

(“Dynamic”), who were victims of such unlawful employment practices. As alleged with greater specificity below, Sanchez, Rodriguez, Capote, Ruz and a class of current and/or former employees of Dynamic were subjected to disparate treatment based on religion when Dynamic coerced them to adopt Scientology religious views and practices as a condition of continued employment. Sanchez, Rodriguez, Capote, Ruz and a class of current and/or former employees of Dynamic were also subjected to a hostile work environment based on religion by Dynamic’s unwelcome imposition upon them of Scientology religious views and practices. Dynamic also terminated Sanchez and Rodriguez in retaliation for opposing Dynamic’s unlawful practices. Further, Dynamic failed to accommodate the religious beliefs of Rodriguez.
2. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful herein were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division.
24. Dynamic requires employees to attend courses that involve participating in Scientology religious practices (“Course(s)”).
The EEOC charged in its suit that Dynamic Medical Services, Inc. (""DMS"") required Norma Rodriguez, Maykel Ruz, RommySanchez, Yanileydis Capote and other employees to spend at least half their work days in courses that involved Scientologyreligious practices, such as screaming at ashtrays or staring at someone for eight hours without moving. The companyalso instructed employees to attend courses at the Church of Scientology. Additionally, the company required Sanchezto undergo an ""audit"" byconnect​ing herself to an ""E-meter,"" which Scientologists believe is a religious artifact, and required her to undergo ""purification"" treatment at the Church of Scientology.
Such alleged practices violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion-which includes forcing employees to conform to a particular religion.

Specifically, the EEOC alleged that the defendant maintained policies on leave and part-time status availability precluding reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA, terminated complainant based on her disability, and disciplined complainant's manager for providing complainant with a reasonable accommodation.

The EEOC further alleges that Sears discriminated against a class of disabled employees by unlawfully maintaining an inflexible worker's compensation leave policy, which provides for discharge of employment after a year instead of ""reasonable accommodation of employees with disabilities."" (Id. '1112.) In its motion to dismiss, Sears argues that the complaint fails to allege the essential elements of an ADA claim. It argues that the EEOC has failed to allege that any member of the class on whose behalf it brings this action suffered from a disability as its defined in the ADA or could perform the essential functions of the job. In particular, Sears argues the complaint does not reveal the nature or scope ofBava's alleged disabilities, nor does it allege that his disabilities fall within the scope of the ADA or substantially limit one or more of his major life activities.

They alleged DaimlerChrysler engaged in age discrimination, gender discrimination, race discrimination, and violations of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA).  As discovery progressed various plaintiffs were added and some were dismissed from the case.  Settlement negations concerning the remaining plaintiffs resulted in individual settlement agreements.  The exact terms of these settlements are not available.  The case was completely dismissed on October 29th, 2002.","1. This Court has original jurisdiction to hear this Complaint and adjudicate the claims stated herein under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343 (a) (4), 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f), for actions arising under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, (“Title VII”), and the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub L. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071 (Nov. 21, 1991), 42 U.S.C. § 12117, for actions arising under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C.A. § 621 et seq. (“ADEA”), to redress and enjoin the employment practices of DaimlerChrysler. All of the plaintiffs have filed timely Title VII administrative charges of discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, (“EEOC”). Plaintiffs Diana Chapman, Doris Heibner, Minnie Isom, and Mary J. Spence have received Notices of Right to Sue letters from the EEOC.
7. Plaintiffs and class members have been subjected to a continuous pattern and practice of sex and race discrimination by DaimlerChrysler. DaimlerChrysler’s supervisor’s and managers have created and condoned a work environment that is hostile to women and African-American employees including the plaintiffs.
9. DaimlerChrysler has followed a general practice of discriminating against women and African-Americans with regard to promotion, training, and skills qualification. Women and African-Americans, including the plaintiffs, are expressly and impliedly discouraged from seeking higher paying positions and higher responsibility positions, and are maintained in lower paying subordinate positions, and are denied training and opportunities to demonstrate the qualifications necessary to obtain higher paying jobs and higher responsibility positions, and the opportunity to apply for those jobs and positions. The result has been a significantly segregated work force.
19. Plaintiff Diana Chapman has herself experienced or observed discrimination on the basis of her disability, i.e., diabetes. She has been exposed to a discriminatory hostile work environment because of her disability.
21. The Defendant failed to accommodate Ms. Chapman’s diabetic condition by refusing to allow her to take ten-minute breaks to perform a blood sugar test and administer any needed medication prior to the Defendant’s own scheduled breaks.
29. Consequently, this created a hostile or abusive work environment for Ms. Chapman because the Defendant has refused to give her another place to check her blood sugar levels except the common bathroom during defendant’s scheduled break periods. Therefore, the Defendant has failed to make an effective and reasonable accommodation for Ms. Chapman’s disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 30.
39. On February 22, 2000, Ms. Heibner amended her Charge of Discrimination to allege that DaimlerChrysler’s conduct towards her was a pattern and practice of sex and age discrimination which constituted class-wide discrimination against other similarly situated individuals.
Ms. Isom alleges, that DaimlerChrysler discriminated against her on the basis of her sex in promoting her into the Skilled Trade Apprentice Program.
53. DaimlerChrysler has discriminated against plaintiffs and all members of the proposed class with respect to the terms and conditions of employment because of their race and sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
Americans with Disabilities Act 42 U.S.C. § 12101

V. Defendant Daimler−Chrysler Corporation","On July 12, 2000, four female employees of the International Union of the United Auto Workers Local Union 1268 filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Daimler-Chrysler Corporation and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to provide employees with breaks to check their blood sugar levels. On September 23, 1999, a notice of work schedule adjustment was posted. The adjustment was to go into effect on September 27, 1999. On September 27, 1999, the complaint was dismissed.","On July 12, 2000, four female employees of DaimlerChrysler filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant violated Title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by creating and condoned a work environment hostile to women and African-Americans.

86,EE-IL-0326,"Financial advisors who sued their employer, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., for race and gender discrimination in compensation did not state a plausible claim, so their complaint was dismissed pursuant to Title VII Section 703(h), which allows employers to compensate employees differently on the basis of seniority, merit, or quality or quantity of production.  The differences in compensation are only unlawful when they result from an intention to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.","11. According to public documents, in 1974, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Merrill Lynch based on its refusal to employ women, African Americans and Latinos as brokers. To resolve the lawsuit, Merrill Lynch agreed to the entry of a Consent Decree (the “O’Bannon Consent Decree”) that required Merrill Lynch to increase its representation of African-American brokers to 6.5%. On information and belief, Merrill Lynch has never met the goals to which it agreed in the O’Bannon Consent Decree. Indeed, more than 30 years later when this suit was filed, only 2% of the tenured brokers employed by Merrill Lynch are African-American. The representation of African-American brokers at Merrill Lynch is greater than 20 standard deviations below the goal in the 1978 EEOC Consent Decree and more than 10 standard deviations below the percentage representation in the industry, as reflected in EEOC census data. The probability of these disparities in representation occurring in a race-neutral or random selection is zero. Because of the high attrition resulting from Merrill Lynch’s systemic discrimination, the percentage of Merrill Lynch brokers with tenure in excess of ten years who are African-American is approximately 0.5%.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.
Before POSNER, WOOD, and HAMILTON, Circuit Judges. POSNER, Circuit Judge. The plaintiffs have filed a class action suit that charges Merrill Lynch with racial discrimination in employment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith, Inc., No. 05-cv-6583 (N.D Ill. filed Nov. 18, 2005) (“McReynolds I”). The suit was originally brought by McReynolds as the lone named plaintiff and alleged claims of racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, but it was amended in November 2006 to add 16 additional named plaintiffs and a discrimination claim under Title VII, 1 The parties refer to Merrill Lynch’s financial advisors as “FAs,” but we find that acronym awkward, so we’ll call them “brokers” instead.","In 2010, a group of African-American and female financial advisors sued Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, alleging discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(h) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' retention bonus procedure discriminated against African-Americans and women. The district court dismissed the case, holding that the plaintiffs had not adequately alleged intentional discrimination in the first place. The 7th Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal of the case.","In 2005, a black broker filed a class action discrimination lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith, Inc., alleging racial discrimination in employment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiffs alleged that Merrill Lynch refused to employ women, African Americans and Latinos as brokers, and that the company failed to meet its obligations under the O'Bannon Consent Decree it entered in 1978 to increase its representation of African-American brokers to 6.5%. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings. The case is now closed."

ARM entered into an agreement with Professional Risk Management and its parent company, MMI Companies, Inc. (PRM/MMI) for the sale of all of ARM’s assets. Under the terms of that agreement, most ARM employees would automatically transfer to PRM/MMI at the time of the sale and would continue to receive benefits under a similar plan.

After the conclusion of the arbitration, which yielded monetary relief for the individual plaintiff, the EEOC continued to litigate the case to obtain injunctive relief. Judge Barbier entered an 18-month consent decree which required the defendant retrain its employees and post notice of what constitutes a violation of equal employment opportunity policies.","1. This suit arises from Tower Loan’s decision to terminate Plaintiff Tristan Broussard because of his sex, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq. (“Title VII”).
5. Tower Loan’s decision to terminate Mr. Broussard because he is a transgender man, and because of his inability to conform to Tower Loan’s stereotypical expectations of gender and its requirements that he should agree to be treated as female, including by dressing and conducting himself as female, violates Title VII’s prohibition on employment discrimination because of sex. Title VII makes it unlawful for employers to discriminate against their employees or applicants for employment because of their sex, which includes discrimination based on a person’s gender identity or transgender status; because a person has undergone, is undergoing, or intends to undergo a gender transition; or because a person fails to conform to gender- or gender-based stereotypes. In terminating Mr. Broussard for these reasons, Tower Loan violated Title VII.
40. On August 27, 2013, Mr. Broussard’s counsel at the National Center for Lesbian Rights and Delaney Robb Attorneys at Law LLC filed a charge of discrimination with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC” or “Commission”) on Mr. Broussard’s behalf. The Charge alleged that Mr. Broussard’s termination from Tower Loan constituted unlawful discrimination on the basis of his sex, change of sex, sex stereotypes, and gender identity, in violation of Title VII and the Louisiana Employment Discrimination Law. A true and correct copy of the EEOC charge is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
Thus, the Eastern District of Louisiana is a proper venue for Broussard’s suit. Tower’s arguments for dismissal are unavailing.1 B. Whether the Court Should Transfer to a More Appropriate Venue Even when the plaintiff files suit in a proper venue, the court may exercise its discretion to transfer the case to another district or division where the action might have been brought “[f]or the convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the interest *546 of justice.” 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a); Norman v.

CONSENT DECREE This action was instituted by Plaintiff-Intervenor, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC” or “Commission”), against First Tower Loan, LLC (“Defendant”). The Commission alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq. (“Title VII”). The complaint alleged that Defendant terminated the employment of Tristan Broussard (“Broussard”), who is transgender, because of sex, based on perceived nonconformity with gender stereotypes and/or his gender identity. Defendant has not admitted and specifically denies that it engaged in any unlawful employment practices. The EEOC and Defendant now wish to settle all claims or controversies encompassed by or which could have been brought in this action, without the burden, expense, or delay of further litigation, pursuant to the terms delineated in this Decree.

The EEOC sought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and other forms of affirmative relief claiming that the defendant did not promote the plaintiff-intervenor because of his race, African American.

The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were and are now being committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division.
NATURE OF THE ACTION This is an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), Title 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and 42 U.S.C. Section 1981 as a private action to seek redress and remedies for unlawful employment practices on the basis of race as to the Plaintiff, Mark Mason, who was adversely affected by the practices.

The named plaintiffs and class members received over a million dollars for costs with a portion to cover attorneys' fees.","1981. The Company's nearly allwhite supervisory and management personnel use a subjective and race-biased system for selecting employees for hire, promotion, advancement and career development. This system of subjective decision-making has resulted in the Company’s disparate treatment of its African American employees including Representative Plaintiffs and the class as a whole. The Company’s well-known reputation for discrimination against African Americans also deters African American employees from applying for jobs, seeking promotions, desirable job assignments, management positions, and other terms and conditions of employment. The Company’s discriminatory treatment of African American employees has created a hostile environment and has been ongoing. These continuing policies and/or patterns or practices of disparate treatment are common to and typical of the claims of all Plaintiffs and class members and satisfy Rule 23(b)(2)’s requirement that the Company has acted or refused to act in a manner generally applicable to the class.

95,EE-MD-0151,"On August 28, 2017, six transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland Maryland contesting the President's ban on transgender service in the U.S. military. Judge Garbis initially granted a motion for a preliminary injunction in September, but this was later stayed in 2019 when the Supreme Court issued a stay of this nationwide injunction in two factually similar cases contesting the ban. 

This case changed dramatically in 2018 when the government altered its policy on transgender service in the military, eliminating an outright ban and instead putting new guidance on transgender men and women entering the service. Judge Russell, reassigned to the case in 2018, dissolved the preliminary injunction, saying that it was only meant to stay a complete ban on transgender service in the military. This also dismissed all claims against the 2017 outright ban as moot, and removed all plaintiffs that were already in the service and not seeking to join. Discovery is ongoing in the case.","For reasons as stated herein, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction [ECF No. 40], and GRANTS IN Doe 1 v. Trump, No. 17-cv-0159-CKK, filed Aug. 9, 2017 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia; Karnoski v. Trump, No. 17-cv-01297-MJP, filed Aug. 28, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle; Stockman v. Trump, No. 17-cv-1799-JGB-KK, filed on Sept. 5, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
Proceedings continued in the district court. On April 19, 2018, the district court struck Defendants’ motion for a protective order precluding discovery pending the resolution of Defendants’ appeal. On July 27, 2018, the district court issued an order denying Defendants’ motion for a protective order of discovery directed at President Trump and granting Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the production of documents withheld solely under the deliberative process privilege within ten days. Defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus with this Court challenging the discovery order. Subsequent orders have stayed further discovery until after we decide the petition.
On April 13, 2018, the district court granted in part and denied in part the cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court first determined that the 2018 Policy had not rendered Plaintiffs’ challenges moot. It observed that the burden of demonstrating mootness “is a heavy one,” citing County of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979). The district court found “that the 2018 Memorandum and the Implementation Plan do not substantively rescind or revoke the Ban, but instead threaten the very same violations that caused it and other courts to enjoin the Ban in the first place.”8 8 The district court rejected Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiffs lacked standing because the 2018 Policy had significantly changed the analysis. Specifically, the district court opined that even if each of the individual plaintiffs serving in the armed forces came within the reliance exception, they would still have standing because “the Ban already has denied them the opportunity to serve in the military on the same terms as others; has deprived them of dignity; and has subjected them to stigmatization.” The district court determined that Washington had standing because the Ban diminished the number of eligible members for (24 of 62)
The district court also addressed Defendants’ contention that the district court was without jurisdiction to impose injunctive or declaratory relief against the President in his official capacity. The district court granted Defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment with regard to injunctive relief and denied it with regard to declaratory relief. It opined that this was an appropriate instance for declaratory relief.10 The district court did not rule on the merits of Defendants’ motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction, and instead ordered the motion stricken. It stated:
The district court’s striking of Defendants’ motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction is vacated, the preliminary injunction is stayed pending the district court’s reconsideration of that motion, Defendants’ petition for writ of mandamus is granted, the district court’s July 27, 2018 discovery order is vacated, and this case is remanded to the district court.23 Following the Supreme Court’s January 22, 2019 decision, Plaintiffs informed this court that they no longer oppose the remedy of vacatur of the preliminary injunction and remand sought by Defendants. Plaintiffs asked this court to “enter a summary order vacating the preliminary injunction and remanding to the district court for further proceedings.” In response, Defendants urged us to “issue a reasoned decision vacating the district court’s preliminary injunction.” We have adopted neither of these paths. Our decision remands for the district court to consider the merits of Defendants’ motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction.
On January 4, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated without prejudice the preliminary injunction the district court had entered. Doe 2, 2019 WL 102309, at *1. On January 22, 2019, the United States Supreme Court issued an order staying the preliminary injunctions in Karnoski and Stockman. Trump v.

On June 14, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the Karnoski court’s order striking the defendants’ motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction and remanded for further proceedings. Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1207 (9th Cir. 2019).

I. Introduction Pursuant to Rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 105, the United States of America (“United States”) respectfully submits this memorandum in support of its motion to intervene as a plaintiff in Savage, et al v. Pocomoke City, et al. On September 29, 2016, Plaintiffs Franklin Savage, Kelvin Sewell, and Lynell Green filed their second amended complaint against, among other Defendants, Pocomoke City, Sheriff Reggie T. Mason, in his official capacity, and the State of Maryland, raising violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. (“Title VII”). The United States should be permitted to intervene in this litigation pursuant to Rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. First, the United States satisfies the requirements of Rule 24(b) because it possesses a conditional right to intervene in this case under Section 706(f)(1) of Title VII. Second, the United States’ motion to intervene is timely filed, and its joining the litigation at this time will not prejudice the existing parties or cause any undue delay. Finally, the United States’ complaint in intervention shares common questions of law and fact with Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint and provides an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction. For these reasons, the Court, in its discretion, should grant the United States’ motion to intervene II. Background In July 2014, former Pocomoke City Police Officer Franklin Savage filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) against the Worcester County Sheriff’s Office (“WCSO”). In his charge, Officer Savage alleged that he was subjected to a racially hostile work environment during his tenure on the Worcester County Criminal Enforcement Team (“CET”), a regional drug enforcement taskforce. He also alleged that he was subject to retaliation for complaining of racial harassment. Officer Savage filed a charge of discrimination against the Pocomoke City Police Department in October 2014, which he later amended, making allegations of retaliation for engaging in protected activity. This retaliation included Officer Savage’s termination in October
2015. In his charge, Lt. Green alleges that he was subject to retaliation, including a loss of overtime and the smearing of his reputation, because of his support of Officer Savage in his complaints of discrimination. The EEOC conducted an investigation of these charges and on April 29, 2016, issued findings of reasonable cause that violations of Title VII had occurred Ex. A, EEOC Letters of Determination. The EEOC attempted conciliation, which failed, and these charges were referred to the Department of Justice.

Factual Background Based on financial projections in 2004, Seagate announced anticipated reduced earnings due to weakened demand and adverse market characteristics. In response to these projections, Seagate’s executive council concluded the company needed to take cost‐reduction measures to address the revenue shortfall. (Fitzke Dec. [Doc No. 33], Ex. 10 (Pope Dep. at 20‐21); Ex. 8 (Dexheimer Dep. at 23‐24); Ex. 12 (Watkins Dep. at 77‐78).) The executive council thereafter identified an overall cost‐reduction target, which was then relayed to Seagate’s Corporate Management Committee (“CMC”). (Id., Ex. 8 (Dexheimer Dep. at 24‐ 27).) The CMC determined that employee headcount needed to be reduced. The CMC members were given cost‐reduction targets, which they in turn brought to their organizations to determine the next steps. (Id., Ex. 7 (Davidson Dep. at 22).) The CMC issued broad guidelines as to how to achieve the cost‐reduction target, through the adoption of the Special Incentive Retirement Plan (“SIRP”) and dissemination of general guidelines regarding employee selection for a company‐ wide reduction in force (the “RIF”). (Id. at 21‐22; Def Ex. 35 (Hall Decl. 22‐28, Ex. A).) Plaintiffs are former employees of Seagate who were terminated either by participating in the SIRP or through the RIF. Plaintiffs were all over the age of forty at the time their employment was terminated, and have brought this collective action under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. In the Complaint, Plaintiffs assert the following causes of action: Count I, Age Discrimination under the ADEA (Disparate Treatment) Collective Action; Count II, Age Discrimination under the ADEA (Disparate Impact) Collective Action; Count III, Age Discrimination (Disparate Treatment) Individual Claims; and Count IV, Declaratory Relief that the Releases Are Invalid.

101,EE-MO-0087,"In December 2004 plaintiff, a quadriplegic who was not hired by defendant, alleged that defendant's employment practices were discriminatory under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and under Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The case went to trial and the jury found in favor of the defendant and awarded $11,478.87 in costs against the plaintiff. Plaintiff appealed the judgment to the 11th Circuit and on March 13, 2009 the appellate court issued an opinion affirming the lower court. The case is now closed. ","NATURE OF THE ACTION This is an action under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to correct unlawful employment practices on the basis of disability and to provide appropriate relief to Rodney Graves who was adversely affected by such practices. The Commission alleges that UMB Financial Corporation failed and refused to hire Graves because of his disability.
2. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were being committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.
8. Since at least January 2001, Defendant has engaged in unlawful employment practices at its facility in Kansas City, Missouri, in violation of Section 102(a) of Title I of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §12112(a). Defendant failed and refused to hire Graves because of his disability, quadriplegia.
(Doc. #61). The EEOC moves the Court for summary judgment on the issue of whether it made a good faith effort to conciliate Plaintiff-Intervenor Rodney Graves’ (“Graves”) charge of employment discrimination as required under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq (“Title VII”) Id.
DISCUSSION I. Facts This case arises from the EEOC’s allegations that UMB discriminated against Graves in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) by refusing to hire him for a Customer Service Representative1 position based on his disability2. (Doc. #1). In its complaint, the EEOC asserts that “all conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.” Id. UMB denied this averment in its answer. (Doc. #7). The issue presented in the instant Motion is whether the EEOC engaged in good faith efforts to conciliate Graves’ charge of employment discrimination prior to filing suit, as required by Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000(e)-5(b). (Doc. #61-1).
1991. Having said that, the EEOC is willing to conciliate this charge now for backpay for Mr. Graves in the amount of $43,680.00 ($480 per week from November 1, 2002 to July 31, 2004) plus the weekly cost to [UMB] for the same period for any and all fringe benefits that Charging Party would have been entitled to if he had been hired. In addition, the EEOC is seeking $300,000.00 in compensatory damages, the maximum allowedbythe applicable statutory cap. The Commission also asks [UMB] to hire [Graves] as a Customer Support Sales Agent and to provide ADA training to all of its managers and supervisors. Please understand, however, that Mr. Graves continues to demand $3,000,000 to resolve this case and that [UMB’s] unilateral conciliation with the EEOC would not effect his right to pursue private litigation.
On November 10, 2004, Granat sent a letter to Johnson, again conveying UMB’s willingness to conciliate and UMB’s request for a face to face meeting. (Doc. #61-22). Johnson responded on November 19, 2004 indicating that the EEOC would still consider any further settlement offers that UMB wished to make, but noted that “the time for a confidential settlement grows ever shorter.” (Doc. #61-23). The EEOC filed suit on December 1, 2004.
In the instant case, the EEOC argues that the undisputed facts establish that, as a matter of law, the EEOC made good faith efforts to conciliate. UMB argues that, in light of UMB’s repeated requests for a face-to-face meeting, the EEOC’s refusal to conduct a face-to-face meeting is evidence of the EEOC’s unreasonableness and lack of good faith. Indeed, the EEOC’s efforts to conciliate have been found to be inadequate where the EEOC has refused to meet with the employer. See, e.g., EEOC v. Pacific Maritime Assoc., 188 F.R.D. 379, 380-81 (D Or. 1999) (no good faith conciliation where the EEOC failed to explain the basis for its damages calculation and refused several requests by the employer to schedule a face-to-face meeting); EEOC v. First Midwest Bank, N.A., 14 F.Supp.
CONCLUSION The Court finds that the EEOC’s refusal to meet with UMB regarding Graves’ claim and his ability to perform the essential functions of the position for which he applied was not reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, the EEOC’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED and this case is hereby STAYED for a period of sixty (60) days from the entry of this Order.

The EEOC alleged that Defendant, Bodega Bars, engaged in unlawful employment practices on the basis of sex. In 2008, the parties entered into a consent decree that

Despite their complaints, Defendant failed to take appropriate corrective action following the sexual harassment and otherwise condoned the sexual harassment of Boss and Hagedon by Gladney. The Complaint further alleges that the sexual comments, propositions and touchings by Gladney created a sexually hostile environment that was so oppressive that Boss and Hagedon were forced to resign their employment when Defendant unreasonably failed to take prompt and effective action to end the sexual harassment, but rather allowed the harassment to continue unabated knowing that it would force Boss and Hagedon to resign.

New York, New York 10017 Tel: (212) 338-9188 Attorneys for Plaintiffs Preliminary Statement Plaintiff now requests Court approval of the settlement of this class action under Fed R. Civ P. 23(e). The class consists of all Hispanic and non-white employees of defendants Restaurant Associates, Inc., and RA Tennis Corp. who worked at the US Open Tennis Tournament in 2003.
2003. Notice of the settlement has been sent to each of the 279 members of the class. Declaration of Laurence B. Jones, 3-4. A total of 101 claim forms have been submitted, of which 97 have been determined by the parties to be eligible for participation in the class action settlement. This memorandum of law is submitted in support of approval of the proposed settlement.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND Defendant Restaurant Associates, Inc. (“RA”) operates and manages the facilities at the US Open for providing food and beverages, both inside and outside the Arthur Ashe stadium. Each summer RA hires several hundred persons to staff these facilities for approximately a three-week period. Plaintiff alleges that RA has given the higher-paying concession stand jobs to white employees and that he and all Hispanic and non-white employees are shunted off to lower-paying positions, in violation of the federal, state and City employment non-discrimination statutes. Amended Complaint, 15-16. Defendant has denied these allegations and denies any liability to plaintiff or to the proposed class. In discovery the RA payroll records for concession stand vendors at the US Open in 2003 have been produced and exhaustively reviewed by counsel for the parties. While plaintiff contends that these records demonstrate that the pay of non-whites working at food and beverage stands is systematically lower than that of whites working at those stands, defendant has identified instances where the pay of a black employee is higher than that of white employees. Given the conflicting evidence, establishment of discrimination against non-whites therefore remains uncertain.
As the Court is aware, extensive settlement negotiations took place during 2004-2005 that were supervised by the Court. These negotiations did not result in a settlement. In December of 2005 plaintiff served a motion for class certification on defendant as well as a motion to amend the complaint. Settlement negotiations resumed in January of 2006 before the full briefing and filing of these motions; plaintiff and an executive of defendant, in addition to their respective counsel, participated in these negotiations.
Eventually the negotiations resulted in a settlement which calls for defendant to establish a $90,000 settlement fund to be divided pro rata among non-white employees and employees of non-U.S. national origin who file claims. Counsel fees of $50,000 and an incentive award to the named plaintiff of $7,500 are provided for separately in the settlement agreement, and these payments are not charged against the $90,000 class member fund. Reference is made to the attached settlement agreement for a complete statement of the settlement terms. Approximately 100 class members have filed claim forms. Therefore the payment to each class member will be approximately $900.
The factors governing approval of class action settlements are well-established in this Circuit. In City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448 (2d Cir. 1974), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that the following factors are to be considered in evaluating a proposed class action settlement:

The case was dismissed on appeal.,"The case, Davis, et al y. Eastman Kodak Company, Civil Action No. 6:04-cv-06098, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York on July 30, 2004, and originated from complaints of racial discrimination filed with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the EEOC) in the late 1990's. The complaint alleged that Kodak discriminated against African American current and former employees of the company based on their race and that the company's policy of hiring and firing based on the color of their skin violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title VII of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The case was settled in 2005 by a consent decree between Kodak and the EEOC.

113,EE-NY-0293,"This 2017 lawsuit was brought by three detectives of the NYPD in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs claimed that the City of New York and various agents of the NYPD had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by implementing a secretive policy of refusing to promote deserving African American detectives solely based on race. The parties reached a confidential settlement that was reported to include $700,000 in damages to cover backpay and loss of reputation.","8. After investigating the case for five years, the EEOC found that “black detectives do not receive equal treatment in promotion.” Specifically, the EEOC found that Named Plaintiffs “and black detectives in general, received lesser and later opportunities for promotion consistent with their qualifications.” That is, African-American detectives waited years longer than their white counterparts to be promoted.
24. The EEOC attempted conciliation thereafter. After conciliation failed, the EEOC referred the complaint to the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which reviewed the matter and determined not to file suit.
62. After the Named Plaintiffs filed with the EEOC, the NYPD began working on a new promotion policy.
Det. McCollum was promised promotions because of his outstanding performance repeatedly. In 2001, Det. McCollum was told that if he continued with his excellent work, he could expect to “retire as a First Grade Detective.” But over the next several years, Det. McCollum witnessed several white detectives who were junior to him be promoted—including detectives he helped train—while he was repeatedly ignored Det. McCollum never received any explanation for his repeated denials of promotion, even though he was recommended for promotion several times.
Det. McCollum’s supervisor also advised that detective that he was being put forward against Det. McCollum and that Det. McCollum would receive the promotion, given his superior record and experience.
124. The Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the other members of the Rule 23 Class. The Named Plaintiffs and all other members of the Rule 23 Class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ conduct in violation of Title VII and state and city human rights laws.

114,EE-NY-0298,"Current and former Black FDNY employees sued the City of New York alleging racial discrimination in their hiring, promotion, and compensation practices. Plaintiffs sought to represent a class of individuals similarly situated who suffered from FDNY's policies that afforded too much discretion to higher-level individuals and fostered a culture of favoritism that harmed Black candidates for hiring and advancement.  The City filed a motion to dismiss and the Court partially granted the motion, but sustained the plaintiffs' claims related to the hiring and promotion practices with the FDNY. The City moved for partial summary judgment in May 2020, arguing that the retired class representatives could not seek relief. At the same time, the plaintiffs moved to certify the class. Both motions were pending as of February 11, 2021.","49. FDNY is fully aware from litigation of the difficulty that African Americans (and women) experience in attaining the rank of EMS captain. In 2006, five female EMS lieutenants sued FDNY for discrimination because of repeated denials of promotion to the EMS Captain position. The suit ultimately was settled, supposedly for multimillions of dollars. Additionally, in 2011, a black female EMS Lieutenant filed a discrimination lawsuit charging that the FDNY repeatedly denied her promotion to the EMS Captain's position. The City also settled that case.
3 The complaint also briefly alleges that even within any given civilian job category at FDNY, African American representation tends to be concentrated in that category’s lowestpaying jobs. (Compl. 46–47.) (Id.) Similarly, Liza Horsley, who is African American, started as a civilian employee in 1998 but in 2014 was denied a higher-paying position for which she was qualified; the position instead went to a white woman who had thirteen years’ less experience at FDNY than Horsley did. (Compl. 54.) These and other instances, the complaint alleges, exemplify FDNY’s practice of concentrating its African American civilian employees in lower-paying positions.
African American employees in the same position. (Compl. 112, 115.) In doing so, Plaintiffs make no effort to demonstrate that the white and African American employees being compared are similarly situated with respect to anything other than their job titles, and Plaintiffs further provide no indication of how many employees holding these job titles are of unknown race and are therefore not reflected in the data. (See id.) Such sparse and decontextualized data points fail to plausibly suggest systemic disparity in the first place, let alone that “non-discriminatory explanations” for those disparities that do exist are “very unlikely.” Burgis, 798 F.3d at 69.
J. PAUL OETKEN, District Judge: In December 2017, a group of African American employees of the Fire Department of New York (“FDNY”) filed a lawsuit against the City of New York (the “City”), raising claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 and the New York City Human Rights Law (“NYCHRL”), N.Y.C Admin. Code § 8-101 et seq., and alleging that FDNY discriminates against African Americans in its hiring, promotion, and compensation practices. (Dkt No. 4.) In a prior opinion and order, this Court held that Plaintiffs’ complaint plausibly alleged discrimination in FDNY’s hiring and promotion practices but that it lacked sufficient factual allegations to raise a plausible inference that FDNY’s compensation practices are similarly flawed. (Dkt No. 26.) Plaintiffs now move to amend their complaint in order to, among other things, bolster their allegations of pay discrimination. (Dkt No. 33.)

The defendant appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in September 2004.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment in October 2006.

Although the Separation Agreement at issue in this case came to the EEOC’s attention via the charge filed by Elizabeth Salisbury, the EEOC challenges the Separation Agreement as facially retaliatory as to all those who entered into the agreement. (Docket #1, p. 1). Such a claim need not be based on conduct directed at a particular person when the basis of the complaint is a policy applicable to a large group, as is the case here. “It would be inappropriate to suggest that each member of the protected class file an individual disparate treatment claim pursuant to the McDonnell Douglas Corp V. Green burden shifting method because the adverse employment action stemmed from a discriminatory policy, not an individual decision. EEOC v. Board of Governors of State Colleges and Universities, 957 F.2d 424, 431 (7th Cir. 1992) (discussed infra p. 12) (citation omitted). The EEOC seeks injunctive relief to prohibit SunDance from enforcing its Separation Agreement and to provide reformed agreements to Elizabeth Salisbury and other similarly situated employees.

Kraft’s Human Resources Department usually becomes involved in the discipline process when a suspension is warranted. (Pl.Ex. 10, Campbell Dep. at 215). Kraft’s department heads-and sometimes the Plant Manager-also become involved if termination is considered. (Id. at 217-18). Kraft maintains “zero tolerance” of harassment in the workplace.

Kraft never determined who had assaulted Ms Naulty. (Def Ex. A, Dep. of Kelly Wojakowski, p. 208-210). Consequently, Kraft permitted both Ms. Price and Ms. Dunston to return to work with back pay.

Id. at 191 n.3. It further noted that ""we may have been willing to hold that a policy against beards simply cannot constitute a Title VII violation."" Id. Consistent with the Third Circuit's invitation, LSS contends that a truly neutral work rule of not sending inappropriate emails, like a no-beard policy, cannot form the basis of disparate impact claim Id.

In their effort to establish pretext, Plaintiffs intend to introduce testimony from a former LSS employee, Gene F. Zurawsky, regarding the conduct in which the alleged comparators engaged and the discipline meted to them. Plaintiffs apparently also propose to introduce other statements allegedly made by LSS executives to Zurawsky regarding personnel decisions. Defendant‟s motion for summary judgment is pending.
1979. In 2006, Watermill Group and Hicks Holdings acquired the company and renamed it Latrobe Specialty Steel. At the time of the acquisition, Appellants initially chose to retire, but were subsequently offered and accepted employment with LSS. In October 2007, during the course of an investigation into a sexual harassment complaint against Magdic, LSS discovered that Appellants, as well as two other employees, Thomas Everett and David Conrad, regularly exchanged emails containing sexually explicit photographs. LSS’s Electronic Communications Policy (“EC Policy”) expressly prohibits employees from sending such materials. As such, LSS executives decided to preliminarily suspend all six employees pending further inquiry. In deciding the appropriate level of discipline for each employee, LSS considered the nature and volume of the emails exchanged, whether they were sent to individuals inside or outside the company, and whether they were sent to customers or vendors. Approximately one week after they were suspended, Appellants were informed that their employment was being terminated. Neither Everett nor Conrad was terminated. At the time they were fired, Appellants were all in their late fifties or early sixties.
Appellants subsequently filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging that LSS discriminated against them because of their age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. On December 29, 2010, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of LSS, concluding that Appellants had failed to demonstrate that “but for” their ages, LSS would not have terminated their employment.

122,EE-PA-0250,"On April 30, 2010, the plaintiff, an African American job applicant with a felony criminal record, filed this class action lawsuit against the defendants, a company and its affiliates which specialized in training truck drivers and placing them with trucking companies. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants refused to procure placement for applicants with a felony conviction, and because of this practice, disparately impacted African American and Latino applicants. The parties settled on August 17, 2012.","33. The parties reached agreement on the material terms of a settlement, including the monetary amount, at the conclusion of the mediation. Id.
2. What is this lawsuit about? The Plaintiff – the person who brought the lawsuit – sued Driver Solutions for allegedly rejecting his application for an entry-level truck driver position because of his past criminal conviction. The lawsuit alleges that Driver Solutions’ policy of rejecting applicants with criminal histories has a disparate impact on African American and Latino applicants in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
1964. The lawsuit seeks recovery of backpay, attorneys’ fees, and costs, and an injunction preventing Driver Solutions from continuing to enforce its criminal background policy. Driver Solutions denies that it did anything wrong and says that opportunities for hiring and job referral are equally available to all applicants, regardless of applicants’ race, national origin or ethnicity. Driver Solutions says that its policies are clear and that they neither allow, nor condone, discrimination.
4. Why is there a settlement? The Court did not decide in favor of the Plaintiff or Driver Solutions. Both sides believe they would have prevailed at trial, but there was no trial. Instead, both sides agreed to a settlement. That way they avoid the cost of a trial, the risk of an uncertain outcome at trial, and the risk that Driver Solutions would not have been able to pay a judgment if the Plaintiff had prevailed at trial; nevertheless, the people affected will get compensation. The Plaintiff and the attorneys for the Class Members think the settlement is best for all involved.
15. How will the lawyers be paid? The Plaintiff has entered into a retainer agreement with Class Counsel. Under the agreement, Class Counsel will ask the Court to approve up to one-third of the settlement amount as their attorneys’ fees. The fees will pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the case, and negotiating the settlement. Class Counsel will also ask the Court to approve the reimbursement of their out-of-pocket costs in the amount of $10,000. You may ask for a copy of the retainer agreement by calling or writing Class Counsel at the telephone number or address below.
Prior to settling the lawsuit, the parties engaged in motion practice and significant informal and formal discovery. The parties reached a settlement on January 17, 2012, involving monetary relief of $475,000 and injunctive relief. The injunctive relief requires Defendants to modify the criminal background hiring policy that they apply to applicants. Under the revised policy, Defendants cannot bar applicants with felonies that are more than 10 years old or misdemeanors that are more than 5 years old, unless they are for certain specific crimes, which are identified in Exhibit B to the Settlement Agreement. For those specifically designated crimes, as well as for all felony and misdemeanor convictions that are less than 10 years old or less than 5 years old, respectively, Defendants must consider mitigating factors in addition to the criminal history.

Saturn Corp., 251 F.3d 573, 581 (6th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, but is not limited to (i) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; (ii) Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job; (iii) The amount of time spent on the job performing the function; (iv) The consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; (v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement; (vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or (vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(3).

130,EE-TX-0434,"This class action suit was filed on January 12, 2006, under 38 U.S.C. § 4301, et seq. (""USERRA"") in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiff class consisted of all past and present pilots of American Airlines who are or were members of the United States Armed Services and who took military leave from January 2001 to 2006. They asked the court for injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that American Airlines had violated USERRA by discriminating against pilots who took military leaves of absence. They claimed that they were unfairly charged fewer ""in service"" days which prevented them from bidding on a number of benefits including flight schedules, paid vacation time, and earned sick leave. Pilots who had taken comparable types of non-military leave were not similarly penalized. After filing two amended complaints, and the court denying the defendants' second motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs motion to certify class, preliminarily approve settlement agreement, and approve forms of class notice. This motion was granted by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara M.G. Lynn in a final order on August 1, 2008. ","9. Pursuant to the 1997 and 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreements between American Airlines and the Allied Pilots Association (the ""Collective Bargaining Agreements""), American Airlines has calculated earned vacation time for pilots based on their accumulated service time with American Airlines, as well the pilots' service time during the previous calendar year. Pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreements, American Airlines has calculated earned sick leave time based on the pilots' service time during the previous calendar year. The Collective Bargaining Agreements have required that a pilot be ""in service"" for fifteen (15) days in a calendar month in order for that month to be counted in figuring the pilot's service time. 10.. Pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreements. American Airlines has allowed pilots who are ""in service"" to bid on flight schedules for the upcoming month based on their seniority status. Pilots who are considered to be on ""leaves of absence"" may not bid for flight schedules.
11. Pursuant to the 1997 Collective Bargaining Agreement, American Airlines was required to credit each pilot with 1.33 days of sick leave for each month the pilot was ""in service"" during the year. Pursuant to the 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreemerit, American Airlines must credit each pilot with five (5) hours of sick leave for each month the pilot is ""in service"" during the year.
Slip Copy Slip Copy, 2006 WL 2914135 (N.D.Tex.) (Cite as: Slip Copy) Woodall, McMahon and Madson seek injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated persons for alleged violations by American of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38 U.S.C. § § 4301 et seq. (“USERRA”). Plaintiffs seek all the employment benefits allegedly denied them, including lost pay due to the inability to bid on flights (the “Trip Bidding Claim”), and lost earned vacation time and lost earned sick leave (the “Vacation and Sick Leave Accrual Claim”).
FN2. Section 4303(12) of USERRA defines “seniority” as “longevity in employment together with any benefits of employment which accrue with, or are determined by, longevity in employment.” In its Motion and Reply, American repeats its contention that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because both the 1997 CBA and the 2003 CBA clearly delineate different types of leave. American argues that military leave that falls under the “leave of absence” umbrella is not comparable to other types of leave (e.g., sick leave) that fall within the ambit of “relieved of flying duties.” American points to a number of ways in which leave for military duty differs from leave during which pilots continue to accrue benefits. For example, a pilot who is relieved of flying duties for the purpose of participating in union activities continues to accrue vacation benefits. The union must reimburse American for that pilot's salary, etc. during his absence. American urges the Court to follow settled law under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. § 181, which provides that courts are not to disturb the terms of a collectively bargained labor agreement.
10. Pursuant to the 1997 Collective Bargaining Agreement, American Airlines has allowed pilots who are ""in service"" to bid on flight schedules for the upcoming month based on their seniority status. Pilots who are considered to be on ""leaves of absence"" may not bid for flight schedules.
11. Pursuant to the 1997 Collective Bargaining Agreement, American Airlines was required to credit each pilot with 1.33 days of sick leave for each month the pilot was ""in service"" during the year. Pursuant to the 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreement, American Airlines must credit each pilot with five (5) hours of sick leave for each month the pilot is ""in service"" during the year.

U.S. Government Defendant
Plaintiff Maurice and Jane Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice TERMINATED: 01/07/2016","The plaintiffs filed this suit against the EPA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the EPA had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by failing to issue preliminary findings on 28 Title VI complaints. The parties engaged in extensive settlement discussions, which 21 were ultimately unsuccessful. The plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on all six of their APA claims. The district court granted the EPA's motion to dismiss. The Ninth Circuit reversed, citing the voluntary cessation exception to the ADA.","On January 7, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted summary judgment in the case of Californians For Renewable Energy, Inc. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 4:15cv03292. The plaintiffs alleged that the EPA had violated 40 C.F.R.  7.115 by failing to issue preliminary findings or recommendations within the timeframes prescribed by the court. The parties engaged in extensive settlement discussions, which 21 were ultimately unsuccessful. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for declaratory judgment and remanded the case to the EPA."
135,EJ-DC-0001,"This 2016 lawsuit was brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff, later joined by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the Yankton Sioux Tribe, and the Oglala Sioux Tribe, sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, alleging that they had violated the NHPA, the CWA, and NEPA by authorizing the construction of a pipeline over tribal land. Dakota Access, LLC later intervened as a defendant. On July 6, 2020, the court ordered the pipeline closed until the Corps could complete an Environmental Impact Statement, expected to take until 2021; on August 5, the D.C. Circuit stayed that decision, and remanded to the district court for further consideration.","4. Sufficiency of Consultations Plaintiff’s last point on the merits is that the Corps failed to offer it a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Section 106 process as to the narrow scope of the construction activity that the Corps did consider to be an effect of the permitted waterway activities. The factual proceedings recited in exhaustive detail in Section I.D., supra, tell a different story. The Corps has documented dozens of attempts to engage Standing Rock in consultations to identify historical resources at Lake Oahe and other PCN crossings. To the reader’s relief, the Court need not repeat them here. Suffice it to say that the Tribe largely refused to engage in consultations. It chose instead to hold out for more – namely, the chance to conduct its own cultural surveys over the entire length of the pipeline. In fact, on this record, it appears that the Corps exceeded its NHPA obligations at many of the PCN sites. For example, in response to the Tribe’s concerns about burial sites at the James River crossing, the Corps verified that cultural resources indeed were present and instructed Dakota Access to move the pipeline to avoid them. Dakota Access did so. See Ames Decl.,
7. Plaintiff Oglala Sioux Tribe initially filed a complaint challenging the Corps’ approval of the DAPL crossing on February 11, 2017, three days after the Corps granted the easement at Lake Oahe to Dakota Access, LLC. (case no. 17-cv-00267) That case was later consolidated with this case which was brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and in which Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe had intervened. The Court granted Dakota Access leave to intervene as Defendant in the Oglala case.
After the remand in this case was completed, the parties again cross-moved for summary judgment. Realizing that Semonite guided both “the nature and scope of [this Court’s] review,” Standing Rock VI, 2020 WL 1441923, at *8; see id. at *6–8 (detailing reasons for following Semonite), the Court conducted a detailed analysis of some of the many expert critiques of the environmental effects of the proposed project Id. at *8–16 (discussing leak-detection system, operator safety record, winter conditions, and worst-case discharge). Ultimately, “even this nonextensive selection suffice[d] to show the necessity of an EIS.” Id. at *9. The Court found that “the Corps ha[d] not ‘succeeded’ in ‘resolv[ing] the controversy’ created by ‘consistent and strenuous opposition, often in the form of concrete objections to the Corps’ analytical process and findings,’ by ‘organizations with subject-matter expertise.’” Id. at *16 (second alteration in original) (quoting Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1086). As in Semonite, “[t]his demonstrate[d] the ‘something more’ needed to show that the ‘effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial.’” Id. (first alteration in original) (quoting Semonite, 916 F.3d at 1086). “The Corps ha[d] thus violated NEPA by determining that an EIS was unnecessary even though one of the EIS-triggering factors was met.” Id.

V. Intervenor Defendant DAKOTA ACCESS LLC","In 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the Army Corps of Engineers had violated the National Environmental Policy Act when it granted an easement to Defendant-Intervenor Dakota Access, LLC to construct and operate a segment of the crude-oil pipeline running beneath the lake. The Tribe argued that the Corps had failed to properly analyze whether the current placement of the pipeline could disproportionately affect low-income, minority communities. The Court remanded the case back to the Corps and ordered the Corps to complete oil spill response plans, complete a third-party audit of the project, complete public reporting, and complete an Environmental Impact Statement. The case is now closed.","The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe sued the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Dakota Access LLC in the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota, alleging that the Corps violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to conduct an environmental impact assessment ( EIS) for the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) project. The parties agreed to a settlement in which the Corps agreed to pay the Tribe $1 million to cover the cost of legal fees and costs associated with the case. The case was dismissed by the Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit."

[F]or this second basis of Burford abstention to apply, the mere existence of a statewide regulatory regime is not sufficient. The state must “offer some forum in which claims may be litigated,” and this forum must “stand in a special relationship of technical oversight or concentrated review to the evaluation of those claims.” Property Casualty Insurance Ltd. [v Cent. Nat’l Ins Co. of Omaha], 936 F.2d [319,] 323 [(7th Cir. 1991)]. In other words, judicial review by state courts with specialized expertise is a prerequisite to Burford abstention. See International College of Surgeons [v. City of Chicago], 153 F.3d [356,] 364 [(7th Cir. 1998)] (Burford abstention was not appropriate because any court of general jurisdiction could review final administrative decisions).

137,FA-CA-0004,"On October 16, 2009, the Freedom From Religion Foundation and several individuals filed a complaint in the Eastern District of California against the U.S. Treasury, IRS, and California Franchise Tax Board for violating the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  Plaintiffs sought a declaration under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 that 26 U.S.C. §§107 and 265(a)(6) violated the Establishment Clause by providing preferential tax benefits to ministers of the gospel.  In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn, 131 S.Ct. 1436 (2011), holding that taxpayers lacked standing to bring an Establishment Clause claim on Arizona's tuition tax credit, the parties submitted a joint Stipulation of Dismissal and the case was dismissed without prejudice on June 20, 2011.","5. Venue is appropriate in the District Court for the Eastern District of 23 California, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(e).
58. FFRF, a non-profit organization, competes with churches and religious 7 organizations, but the competition is unfair. The tax subsidies available to churches, 8 religious organizations, and ministers of the gospel are not available to FFRF and its employees. FFRF is thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to churches 11 and other organizations whose employees receive tax subsidies.
Plaintiffs allege that all of the above tax provisions violate the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution, which provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” U.S Const. amend I. Plaintiffs further allege that the California Constitution contains a similarly worded Establishment Clause which is violated by the California Revenue and Taxation Code provisions. See Cal Const
2. Under the same facts, was permissive intervention properly denied on the basis that the proposed Defendants-Intervenors, who have no counter-claims or cross-claims, lacked “independent grounds for jurisdiction”? STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Freedom From Religion Foundation (“FFRF”) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on October 16, 2009.
STATEMENT OF THE FACTS The material facts are not in dispute. On October 16, 2009 the Freedom From Religion Foundation and several of its individually named members (collectively, “FFRF”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that 26 U.S.C. §§ 107 and 265(a)(6) violate the Establishment Clause of the U.S Constitution. Excerpts of Record (“E.R.”) at 108-109, B, D. Sections 107 and 265(a)(6) provide tax exemptions to “ministers of the gospel” and are administered by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”). Plaintiffs-appellees also sought a declaration that §§ 17131.6 and 17280(d)(2) of the California Revenue and Taxation Code violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution as well as the California Constitution as administered by the California Franchise Tax Board (“Tax Board”). E.R. at 103, 109, 37-38, E. On October 22, 2009, Pastor Michael Rodgers (“Pastor Rodgers”) and Does 1-100 (“Pastor Rodgers”) moved to intervene as defendants in this action. E.R. at 94-96. Pastor Rodgers is a minister of the gospel in the Sacramento area who, from 1995 to the present, has claimed both the federal and state tax exemptions.
346. Pastor Warren appealed the IRS’ decision and the tax court reversed, finding that nothing supported the IRS’ narrow interpretation of § 107(2). The IRS then appealed to this Court where the parties filed stipulations to dismiss and the appeal was dismissed. Warren v. C.I.R., 302 F.3d 1012 (9th Cir. 2002).
Accordingly, the instant matter is dismissed without prejudice, and the parties will bear 4 their own respective costs, including attorney fees and other litigation expenses.

138,FA-DC-0001,"In 2012, the Catholic Archbishop of Washington and several affiliated Catholic organizations filed a lawsuit in the District of DC against the Federal Government under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment.  The plaintiffs contended that this mandatory contraception coverage violated their sincerely held religious beliefs, and seek to enjoin their enforcement.  This case was dismissed for lack of ripeness on January 25, 2013, and refiled on September 20, 2013. 

On November 6, 2015, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the accommodation to the contraceptive services mandate violates the RFRA. This case was consolidated with six others, and is known as Zubik v. Burwell. After the case was argued in the Supreme Court on March 23, 2016, the Court issued a per curiam order on May 16, 2016 remanding all seven cases to their respective courts of appeals. The Court ordered that the parties be given time to come to agreement on ensuring contraceptive access without burdening religious freedom. 136 S.Ct 1557, 1560. The Court took no position on the merits of these cases.","129. On March 16,2012, Defendants issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""ANPRM"") seeking comment on various ways to structure the proposed accommodation. Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act, 77 Fed Reg. 16,501 (Mar. 21, 2012). The proposed scenarios require an ""independent entity"" to provide coverage for the objectionable services at no cost to the participants. But private entities do not provide insurance coverage ""for free."" Moreover, even if these proposals were adopted, they would still require religious organizations to provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to the objectionable services. Finally, it is also unclear whether the Government has statutory authority to implement each of the possibilities referenced in the ANPRM.
II. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the Free Exercise Clause claim in Count II.25 The Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that “Congress shall make no law... prohibiting the free exercise” of religion. U.S Const. amend I. The Supreme Court has made clear that this constitutional right “does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes 24 There are additional grounds why, even if the Court found that the church plan plaintiffs sufficiently alleged an injury to satisfy standing, Catholic Information Center and Don Bosco do not have a successful RFRA claim.

But, consistent with its religious commitments, the University’s contract for employee health coverage states that emergency contraceptives, such as ella and Plan B, and IUDs which can and sometimes do act after fertilization has occurred, are excluded.
Plaintiffs, as eligible organizations, are not required to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage. To the contrary, they are free to continue to refuse to do so, to voice their disapproval of contraception, and to encourage their employees to refrain from using contraceptive services. Plaintiffs need only fulfill the self-certification requirement and provide the completed self-certification to their issuers/TPAs. They need not provide payments for contraceptive services to their employees. Instead, third parties—plaintiffs’ issuers/TPAs— provide payments for contraceptive services, at no cost to plaintiffs. In short, with respect to contraceptive coverage, plaintiffs need not do anything more than they did prior to the promulgation of the challenged regulations—that is, to inform their issuers/TPAs that they object to providing contraceptive coverage in order to ensure that they are not responsible for contracting, arranging, paying, or referring for such coverage. Thus, the regulations do not require plaintiffs “to modify [their] religious behavior in any way.” Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at

interests furthered by the contraceptive coverage requirement. Houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under the plan. “Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act,” 78 Fed Reg. 39,870, 39,874 (July 2, 2013). In essence, the government is conceding that the Mandate does not advance any compelling interest when applied to employers who employ employees who share their religious convictions – a category that includes the Schools.5 Denying them the exemption is thus arbitrary, capricious, irrational, unjustified, and discriminatory. They are denied the exemption’s protection simply because they are not structured as integrated auxiliaries to a denomination or convention or association of churches. Discriminating against them because of incidental religious structural choices cannot survive scrutiny under either the Establishment Clause or the Administrative Procedure Act.

145,FA-MA-0001,"This case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts on May 16, 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiff claimed that the department's provision of more than a million dollars of public funds to a ministry called ""The Silver Ring Thing"" (SRT) that uses federal abstinence education funding to bring ""unchurched"" students to Jesus Christ constituted an unlawful establishment of religion and a governmental endorsement and preference for religion in general and specific tenets of the ministry in particular. 

The ministry developed a three hour presentation that was meant to occur directly following a mandatory abstinence education assembly in public schools and which, according to the plaintiff, was ""permeated with religion."" 

In a two-year settlement agreement entered on February 22, 2006, the defendants acknowleged that they had terminated the SRT grant effective January 31, 2006.  The agreement provided that defendants would not fund SRT's abstinence eduction as it had been structured and implemented during the fiscal year 2005, that strict requirements would be made before considering funding any future proposals from SRT, and that extensive monitoring of SRT's activities would occur if SRT was given a grant.

The Silver Ring Thing is a ministry that uses abstinence education as a means to bring ""unchurched"" students to Jesus Christ. Federal dollars support the Silver Ring Thing’s religious activities and religious content. Both because the federal funding of the Silver Ring Thing constitutes a direct government grant to a pervasively sectarian institution and because the federal dollars are demonstrably underwriting religious activities and religious content, the funding violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Furthermore, the federal grant to the SRT impermissibly communicates a message of governmental endorsement of and preference for religion in general and the specific religious tenets of SRT in particular. Plaintiff- whose members include taxpayers whose tax dollars are used to finance the Silver Ring Thing program seeks, among other relief, an injunction barring the Defendants from continuing to fund the Silver Ring Thing.

CNS and HCC submit that their religious beliefs prohibit them from providing healthcare coverage for certain contraceptives. They further assert that the government’s purported accommodation of their religious beliefs—the requirement that they submit Form 700 or HHS Notice so that their TPA can provide the objectionable contraceptives—is no accommodation at all because it, too, substantially burdens their exercise of religion. The government does not dispute the sincerity of CNS and HCC’s religious beliefs. When sincerity is not in dispute, we must consider the religious belief or exercise at issue and determine whether the government has placed substantial pressure, i.e., a substantial burden, on the religious objector to engage in conduct that violates the religious belief or to abstain from engaging in conduct that is required by that belief. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S Ct. at 2775-76 (concluding that substantial burden arises when the government “demands” that a religious objector either “engage in conduct that seriously violates [his] religious beliefs” or suffer “substantial” “consequences”); Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 703 (1986) (suggesting that substantial burden may exist when the government compels a religious objector “by threat of sanctions, to refrain from religiously motivated conduct or to engage in conduct that [he] find[s] objectionable for religious reasons”) (footnote omitted).
Opinion *1 The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgments is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in light of Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U S. (2016). Nothing in the Zubik opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that women covered by respondent’ health plans ‘obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives.‘ Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U S. (2014) (slip op., at 1). Through this litigation, respondent have made the Government awis of their view that they meet ‘the requirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds.‘ Id., at (slip op., at 2). Nothing in the Zubik opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, ‘precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage‘ going forward Ibid. Because the Government may rely on this notice, the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on respondent for failure to provide the relevant notice. Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurs in the decision to grant, vacate, and remand in this case for the reasons expressed in Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U S.

152,FA-OK-0001,"In 2012, evangelical Christian business owners filed a RFRA challenge to rules adopted pursuant to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, arguing that the rules infringed on their religious freedom by requiring them to provide coverage for emergency contraception through their group health insurance plan.  In November 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the contraception mandate did not substantially burden the plaintiffs' religious freedom.  

The 10th Circuit granted expedited en banc review, and oral arguments occurred on May 23.  On June 27, 2013, the 10th Circuit reversed the District Court's injunction denial and sent the case back to the District Court, with instructions to consider two prongs of the injunction inquiry and to rule on the plaintiffs' injunction motion.  The next day, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' emergency motion for a temporary injunction pending the full injunction hearing.  The Supreme Court granted cert., and on June 30, 2014, affirmed the 10th Circuit.  The Court said other ways were open to the government to reach its asserted interest of ensuring the availability of contraception coverage. ","The relaxed standard does not apply if the injunction “is one that alters the status quo and therefore is disfavored.” Northern Natural Gas Co v. L.D. Drilling, Inc,.___ F.3d 2012 WL 4902833 at *4 (10th Cir. 2012). Defendants argue that plaintiffs are not seeking to maintain the status quo because, prior to the enactment of the mandate, Hobby Lobby provided coverage for emergency contraceptives that could cause an abortion. The court is not persuaded that the coverage was due to anything other than a m istake. Upon discovery of the coverage, Hobby Lobby immediately excluded the two drugs, Plan B and Ella, from its prescription drug policy. Defendants do not dispute that the com pany’s policies have otherwise long excluded abortion-inducing drugs. Here plaintiffs are not seeking a disfavored injunction, but rather ask the court to preserve the status quo.
In addition, to the extent the individual plaintiffs in this case are involved in the corporate decisionmaking of Hobby Lobby and Mardel, I am not persuaded that the contraceptive-coverage regulation imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of their religion. The contraceptive-coverage regulation requires employers such as Hobby Lobby and Mardel to provide to their employees health insurance coverage for the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive drugs and devices Period. Although the plaintiffs, and in turn Judge Matheson, artfully suggest that compliance with the regulation “would assist others in using particular contraceptives,” Matheson Op. at 15, the fact of the matter is that the regulation is drug/device-neutral. And the decision of a female employee as to which contraceptive drug or device to use remains a private matter of individual choice. Thus, neither an employer, nor its officers and directors, by choosing to comply with the contraceptive-coverage regulation, become a party to, or otherwise encourage, an individual employee’s decision to use a particular drug or device. See Grote, 708 F.3d at 865 (Rovner, J., dissenting) (“No individual decision by an employeer and her physician—be it to sue contraception, treat an infection, or have a hip replaced—is in any meaningful sense the [employer’s or company owner’s] decision or action.”); cf. Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, 652 (2002) (upholding a state school voucher programon the ground that “[t]he incidental advancement of a religious mission... is reasonably attributable to the individual [voucher] recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits.”). But, by recognizing a new “management standing” rule applicable to the individual plaintiffs, Judge Gorsuch and Judge Matheson “upend th[is] traditional understanding” and effectively conclude “that when a company insures its employees’ health care, a company owner indeed is a party to that care, with a cognizable religious interest in what services are made available to the employee.” Grote, 708 F.3d at 865 (Rovner, J., dissenting). In my view, “[h]olding that a company [owner]’s religious beliefs and practices are implicated by the autonomous health care decisions of company employees, such that the obligation to insure those decisions, when objected to by [the owner], represents a substantial burden on that [owner]’s religious liberties [is] an [unduly] expansive understanding of what acts in the commercial sphere meaningfully interfere with an individual’s religious beliefs and practices.” Id.at 866.
In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point. In separate actions, they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives. In No. 13–356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their company—Conestoga Wood Specialties—a preliminary injunction. Affirming, the Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not “engage in religious exercise” under RFRA or the First Amendment, and that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their personal capacity. In No. 13–354, the Greens, their children, and their companies—Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel—were also denied a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. It held that the Greens’ businesses are “persons” under RFRA, and that the corporations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their exercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the “least restrictive means” of furthering a compelling governmental interest.","The plaintiffs filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma on November 16, 2012 against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Secretary of the HHS. The plaintiffs alleged that HHS's mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which prohibits the government from burdening a person's religious exercise. The district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.

On November 6, 2015, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the accommodation to the contraceptive services mandate as applied to religious nonprofits violates the RFRA. This case was consolidated with six others. The Supreme Court issued a per curiam order remanding all seven cases to their respective courts of appeals, and ordered that the parties be given time to come to agreement on ensuring contraceptive access without burdening religious freedom.

I. Introduction Presently before the Court are two cases which challenge the application of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). These cases present the Court with the issue of whether the Dioceses of Pittsburgh and Erie, which are exempt from provisions of the ACA requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraceptive products, services, and counseling (“the contraceptive mandate”), are divisible from their nonprofit, religious affiliated/related charitable and educational organizations which, under the current provisions, will be compelled to facilitate/initiate coverage of contraceptive products, services, and counseling, beginning January 1, 2014, in violation of their sincerely-held religious beliefs.1 On October 8, 2013, in the Pittsburgh division of the United States District Court of the Western District of Pennsylvania, Plaintiffs: Most Reverend David A. Zubik, as Trustee of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, a charitable trust; the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, as the Beneficial Owner of the Pittsburgh series of the Catholic Benefits Trust; and Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Inc.

Pittsburgh Plaintiffs simultaneously filed a Motion for Expedited Preliminary Injunction, asking this Court to issue a preliminary 1 Generally, the three most relevant sincerely-held religious beliefs of the Catholic faith at issue in these cases are: (1) the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death; (2) unity of worship, faith, and good works (“faith without good works is dead”); and (3) the facilitation of evil is as morally odious as the proliferation of evil. See Hearing testimony: Bishop Zubik, pg. 21, lines 12-14, pg. 28, lines 17-20, pg. 35, lines 17-18, pg. 42, lines 21-25; Bishop Persico, pg. 73, lines 7-9, pg. 75, lines 16-19, pg. 79, lines 24-25, pg. 80, lines 6-8, pg. 83, lines 6-9.

156,FA-TX-0006,"On February 1, 2012, Criswell College, an evangelical Protestant college located in Dallas, filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of Texas against the Federal Government seeking to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage. Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their sincerely held religious beliefs. On April 9, 2013, the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because it was not ripe for review.","49. Criswell College’s group health plan is not grandfathered under the ACA. Criswell has made changes to its health plan that have caused it to lose any grandfathered status it may have had. For example, Criswell implemented certain women’s preventative health initiatives except for certain contraceptives. Moreover, Criswell will significantly increase the deductible required in its health plan starting on January 1, 2013, and Criswell has not certified or sent any notification stating that its health plan has grandfathered status.
89. The Mandate coerces Criswell College to provide coverage for and otherwise facilitate the provision of Plan B, Ella, other abortifacient drugs, and related counseling in violation of its religious beliefs.
105. The Mandate makes it unclear whether Criswell will be able to offer health insurance as a benefit to its employees, and if so, the terms upon which it will be offered. Criswell is considering whether to forgo health insurance completely for its employees if it means having to violate its firmly held beliefs. This unconstitutional choice that has been BDDB01 9417814v1 imposed on Criswell is not the only harm inflicted on it by the Mandate A. The Uncertainty Surrounding the Mandate Has Hindered Criswell’s ability to plan for the future.
113. Moreover, health insurance is critical to Criswell’s ability to hire qualified faculty and retain such faculty. Health insurance is included in the employment contracts for Criswell’s faculty. Employment contracts are offered in March of each year, and the contracts run from August 1 to July 31 of each year. At this time, until the issue of whether the Mandate applies to Criswell is resolved, Criswell cannot state with certainty whether it will include health insurance in the employments contracts it will offer in March 2013, and without such certainty Criswell will likely be unable to hire any potential faculty members, as such faculty members will require health insurance to be included in their employment contracts. Moreover, Criswell will lose current faculty who will choose to leave the school rather than take the risk of having no insurance.
125. When Criswell complies with the Sixth Commandment of the Bible and other sincerely held religious beliefs, it exercises religion within the meaning of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).
126. The Mandate imposes a substantial burden on Criswell’s religious exercise and coerces it to change or violate its religious beliefs. The Mandate penalizes Criswell for offering health insurance plans that do not cover abortion, abortifacients, embryo-harming pharmaceuticals, and related education and counseling, or that cause access to the same through its insurance company. Defendants substantially burden Criswell’s religious exercise when they force it to choose between either following its religious commitments and suffering debilitating punishments or violating its conscience in order to avoid those punishments.
136. The Mandate is not neutral and is not generally applicable. It does not apply to the enormous number of health insurance plans that enjoy “grandfathered” status. It does not apply to religious employers that qualify for the Mandate’s extraordinarily narrow religious exemption. It does not apply to the employers to whom the Defendants have given waivers from the Affordable Care Act. 137.
139. The Mandate coerces Criswell College to change or violate its religious beliefs.
140. The Mandate chills Criswell’s religious exercise.
177. In promulgating the Mandate, Defendants failed to consider the constitutional and statutory implications of the mandate on Criswell College and similar organizations.
4. The Court Declines to Hold the Case in Abeyance. –Finally, Criswell notes that the District of Columbia Circuit, after finding two similar cases unripe, elected to hold them
Jan. 7, 2013) (declining to hold case in abeyance and noting that “if a necessary component of jurisdiction, such as ripeness, is found to belacking, the court has no choice but to dismiss the action”) (citing 15 JAMES MOORE ET AL., MOORE’S FEDERAL PRACTICE § 108.81 (3d ed. 2011)). Nor is there any particular advantage to doing so: if Defendants do not resolve this issue to Criswell’s satisfaction, Criswell may simply refile its case. The Court thus declines to hold the case in abeyance and dismisses it instead.
CONCLUSION The Court concludes that this case is not ripe for judicial consideration. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Criswell’s complaint without prejudice.

The plaintiffs alleged that a state statute violated the Fair Housing Act and was preempted by federal immigration law because it required mobile home owners to pay for a government-issued registration while prohibiting undocumented residents from making payments to government officials. Because the law made it illegal to possess a mobile home without registration and because it was illegal for undocumented residents to obtain the registration, the law effectively made such persons homeless.  The District Court (Judge Myron H. Thompson) enjoined the State from enforcing the law. The State appealed, but the Eleventh Circuit rendered it moot because in May 2012 the Alabama legislature amended the statute to exclude mobile home registration.  The District Court dismissed the case in May 2014, upon stipulation of the parties.","This is a civil rights action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought by Plaintiffs Central Alabama Fair Housing Center, Fair Housing Center of Northern Alabama, Center for Fair Housing, Inc., John Doe #1, and John Doe #2 for violations of the federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., and the Supremacy Clause and Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

160,FH-CA-0007,"This case resulted in the largest residential fair lending settlement in U.S. history, with $335 million being paid to compensate African-American and Hispanic borrowers who were allegedly charged more based on their race or national origin. ","INTRODUCTION The United States brings this action against Countrywide Financial Corporation, acting through its various divisions and subsidiaries (collectively, ""Countrywide"") for discriminating against more than 200,000 Hispanic and African-American borrowers in its residential mortgage lending. The action to enforce the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (""FHA""), and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f(""ECOA""), is brought to redress the discrimination based on race and national origin that Countrywide engaged in from 2004 to 2008 during the mortgage boom. Countrywide was one of the largest single-family mortgage lenders in the United States, if not the largest, between 2004 and
7. For each residential loan that Countrywide retail mortgage loan officers originated, information about each borrower's race and national origin and the amount of overage or shortage paid was available to, and was known by, Countrywide. Countrywide was required to collect, maintain, and report data with respect to certain loan terms and borrower information for residential loans, including the race and national origin of each retail home loan borrower, pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), 12 U.S.C. § 2803.
02. Countrywide's residential lending-related policies and practices as alleged herein constitute: IO a.
The settlement, which is subject to court approval, was filed today in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in conjunction with the department’s complaint which alleges that Countrywide discriminated by charging more than 200,000 African-American and Hispanic borrowers higher fees and interest rates than non-Hispanic white borrowers in both its retail and wholesale lending. The complaint alleges that these borrowers were charged higher fees and interest rates because of their race or national origin, and not because of the borrowers’ creditworthiness or other objective criteria related to borrower risk.
This is the first time that the Justice Department has alleged and obtained relief for borrowers who were steered into loans based on race or national origin, a practice that systematically placed borrowers of color into subprime mortgage loan products while placing non-Hispanic white borrowers with similar creditworthiness in prime loans. By steering borrowers into subprime loans from 2004 to 2007, the complaint alleges, Countrywide harmed those qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers. Subprime loans generally carried higher-cost terms, such as prepayment penalties and exploding adjustable interest rates that increased suddenly after two or three years, making the payments unaffordable and leaving the borrowers at a much higher risk of foreclosure.
In addition, the settlement requires Countrywide to implement policies and practices to prevent discrimination if it returns to the lending business during the next four years. Countrywide currently operates as a subsidiary of Bank of America but does not originate new loans.
BAC has represented to the United States that BAC and its subsidiaries do not 10 originate and price loans employing policies and procedures that the United States 11 alleges resulted in the discriminatory practices at issue in its Complaint. BAC has 13 organizations which provide education counseling and other assistance to low income 14 and minority borrowers in connection with obtaining credit, loan modifications and 15 other retention activities. This Consent Order does not contain any injunctive measures 16 against the current operations of BAC or any of its subsidiaries.
Defendants represent that Countrywide Financial Corporation and Countrywide 23 Home Loans, Inc. (collectively, ""Countrywide Defendants"") no longer originate 24 residential loans. In the event that either Countrywide Defendant reenters the business 25 of originating residential loans, Defendants shall notify the United States at the earlier 26 of sixty (60) days before it intends to reenter this line of business or the time that they 27 notify their federal regulators of either Countrywide Defendant's intent to reenter this 28 line of business. Countrywide Defendants shall also implement policies, practices and 1 monitoring designed to prevent and detect potential fair lending violations in their 2 origination of residential loans, and shall provide the United States with the details of 3 these policies, practices, and monitoring, forty-five (45) days prior to implementing 4 such reentry. The United States shall have thirty (30) days to review and agree or object 5 to the proposed policies. The parties shall utilize the dispute resolution procedures set 6 forth in Paragraph 24 to resolve any objections by the United States.

Statute of Limitations The FHA provides that a plaintiff must file suit within two years after “the occurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice.” 42 U.S.C. § 3613(a)(1)(A). Actions under ECOA similarly have a two-year statute of limitations. 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(f) (“No such action shall be brought later than two years from the date of the occurrence of the violation....”). Defendants argue that plaintiffs’ claims must be dismissed to the extent they are based on alleged conduct which occurred more than two years before the complaint was filed. Plaintiffs respond that various tolling doctrines, including the continuing violations doctrine, the discovery rule and fraudulent concealment by defendants, apply to preserve claims based on conduct extending beyond the two-year period. Plaintiffs, seven minority homeowners, filed their complaint in February 2008.
ZOBEL, D.J. Now pending before the court is Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. Plaintiffs are African-American homeowners who bring suit on behalf of themselves and similarly situated homeowners against H&R Block, Inc. (“H&R Block”), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, San Canyon Corp., f/k/a Option One Mortgage Corporation (“Option One”) and Ada Services Corporation, f/k/a H&R Block Mortgage Corporation (“H&R Block Mortgage”) (collectively, “Option One” or “Defendants”).2 The gravamen of Plaintiffs’ complaint is that H&R Block and Option One violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f (“ECOA”), and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (“FHA”),3 by giving its authorized brokers discretion to impose additional charges to the borrower’s wholesale mortgage loans unrelated to a borrower’s creditworthiness, a policy that had a disparate impact on African-American borrowers in that it resulted in their being charged higher rates than similarly situated whites.4 Plaintiffs now move to certify a class of “[a]ll African-American borrowers who obtained a mortgage loan from one of the Defendants between January 1, 2001 and the [d]ate of [j]udgment” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). See Docket 74, Pl.’s Mem. in Support of Mot. for Class Certification at 17.
Plaintiffs allege that “by design,” the Discretionary Pricing Policy “caused persons with identical or similar credit scores to pay different amounts for the cost of credit.” (Id. 68.) Although facially neutral, the policy had an adverse effect on African-Americans in that they paid higher discretionary charges on their home loans than did similarly situated white borrowers. Plaintiffs bring these claims under a disparate impact theory, challenging “practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity.” Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v.

Now pending before the court is Option One’s motion to decertify the class in light of that case I. Background The factual background of this case is detailed in the certification order. Briefly, plaintiffs are a number of African-American individuals who obtained home mortgage loans from Option One through mortgage brokers. They allege that defendants’ loan pricing policy violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f (“ECOA”), and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (“FHA”), by giving authorized brokers the discretion to impose additional charges unrelated to a borrower’s creditworthiness. Plaintiffs claim this policy had a disparate impact on African-American borrowers by resulting in higher mortgage rates for African-American borrowers than similarly situated white borrowers.

Defendant ADA Services Corportaion","On August 19, 2005, seven minority homeowners filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Option One Mortgage Corporation and H&R Block Mortgage Corp. (collectively, ""Defendants""), under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' home financing policies and practices discriminated against African-American borrowers by granting brokers discretion to set higher rates, which resulted in a disparate impact on African-Americans. On March 21, 2013, the court certified the case as a class. The court found that the plaintiffs had commonality because the claims shared a legal factual and factual question: whether the defendants’ pricing policy, by granting broker discretion, resulted in an impact on black borrowers. The case is now closed.","African-American homeowners brought suit against H&R Block, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, San Canyon Corp., f/k/a Option One Mortgage Corporation and Ada Services Corporation, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in February 2008 under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.

165,FH-NE-0001,"The defendant to this 2008 family-status discrimination lawsuit brought by the United States in the District of Nebraska, was a condominium association whose ""Amended Master Deed and Declaration"" stated that no unit should be ""sold or leased to a person who has a child under the age of 16 who will occupy or reside in the unit 180 days or more a year.""  The suit's complainants alleged that this clause posed an obstacle to their intended sale of their condo units.  After discovery, the parties entered mediation, and on March 3, 2010, District Judge Warren K. Urbom approved a three-year consent decree.  In addition to a general prohibition against discrimination in the sale or rental of the condominium units, the decree required the defendants to develop and post a non-discrimination policy and to amend the master deed to excise  the prohibition against families with children.

The United States alleges that the Defendants violated the FHA by adopting and enforcing a Master Deed and By-Laws that prohibited children under the age of sixteen (16) from occupying or residing in a condominium unit in Latvian Towers. The United States further alleges that the conduct of Defendants constitutes a refusal to allow the sale of or negotiations for the sale of, or otherwise making unavailable, a dw elling because of familial status, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); the making, printing, or publishing of statements with respect to the sale of a dwelling that indicate a preference, limitation, or discrimination based on familial status, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(c); and representation that, because of familial status, a dwelling is not available for inspection or sale when such dwelling is in fact so available, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(d). The United States further alleges that Defendants' conduct as described above constitutes a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights granted by the Act, and a de nial to a g roup of persons of rights granted by the Act, which denial raises an issue of general public importance, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a).

166,FH-NJ-0003,"An association of residents of a New Jersey neighborhood filled a lawsuit claiming that the defendants' redevelopment plan for the Gardens neighborhood represented a violation of the Fair Housing Act and the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants' redevelopment plan, which razed numerous homes in a minority neighborhood, was discriminatory.  The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's pretrial decision in favor of the town to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reversed, and found that the plaintiffs were entitled to a trial.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the question whether disparate impact claims were available under the Fair Housing Act.

NATURE OF SUIT (Place an “X” in One Box Only)
This Consent Order (Order) is submitted jointly by the parties for the approval of and entry by the Court simultaneously with the filing of the United States' Complaint in this action. This Order resolves the claims of the United States that Nixon State Bank (""Nixon"" or ""the bank"") has engaged in a pattern or practice of lending discrimination on the basis of national origin in the pricing of unsecured consumer loans in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f.
Under the provisions of the Order, Nixon agrees to develop and establish uniform pricing policies and procedures designed to ensure that the prices it charges for the loans covered by this Order, including the portion of the price that reflects the discretion of the loan officer or any company employee, are set in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with the requirements of ECOA. Nixon also will compensate its Hispanic borrowers of unsecured consumer loans.
2009. The Complaint alleges that prior to 2010, the higher rates of interest that Nixon charged to Hispanic borrowers for unsecured consumer loans are a result of Nixon's policy or practice of giving its employees broad subjective discretion in every aspect of the unsecured consumer loan transaction, from the information collected at the application stage to setting the interest rate. Information as to each applicant's national origin was available and known to the bank's loan officers, who personally handled each loan transaction at one of Nixon's three branch offices. The Complaint alleges that prior to 2010, Nixon did not properly instruct its loan officers regarding their obligation to treat prospective customers without regard to national origin, and the bank has failed to supervise or monitor the performance of its loan officers effectively to ensure compliance with fair lending laws. The Complaint alleges that prior to 2010, Nixon's policy or practice of giving its employees broad subjective discretion in handling every aspect of the unsecured consumer loan transaction is not justified by business necessity or legitimate business interests
4. This Order requires the bank to take actions to remedy its alleged discrimination. Nixon retains the discretion to take any additional actions that it believes are appropriate to achieve the goals of this Order B. Pricing Policies and Procedures
14. Within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date of this Order, Nixon will provide equal credit opportunity training to its management officials, loan officers, and any other employees or agents who participate in the origination of the bank's loans covered by this Order. During this training, Nixon will provide to each participant: (a) access to a copy of this Order and the loan policies adopted pursuant to it; and (b) training on the terms of this Order, the loan policies adopted pursuant to it, the requirements of ECOA, and his or her responsibilities under each. During the term of this Order, Nixon will provide annual training to covered employees with respect to his or her responsibilities and obligations under ECOA and this Order.
16. The content of this training program will be approved in advance by the United States. Nixon will bear all costs associated with the training G. Satisfaction of the United States' Claims for Monetary Relief

The district court approved the plan in 1988, which was then modified by several stipulations filed by the parties in the late eighties. Two further stipulations and orders (primarily directed toward medical care at Southbury) were approved by the court in 1990 and 1991 respectively.

This Settlement Agreement (Agreement) is between Plaintiff Adam Dunakin, by his next friend and mother, Kimberlee Hollinger (Plaintiff) and Defendants, Patricia Lashway, in her official capacity as Secretary of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and Dorothy F. Teeter, in her official capacity as Director of the Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA). The Plaintiff and the State are hereinafter referred to collectively as ""the Parties."" This Agreement is a full expression of the agreements between the Parties.
1. Definitions I.I ""Action"" shall mean: Dunakin v. Lashway and Teeter, No. 2:14-cv-00567-JLR, a class action pending in the U.S. District Court Western District of Washington at Seattle.
6.2.1 Defendants will continue to provide annual PASRR training to PASRR Level I screeners, including but not limited to employees of hospitals and nursing facilities.
11.4 Venue. If any action is necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, venue shall be had in the Western District of Washington.
The parties have reached an agreement in this case to improve PASRR Level I screening and Level II evaluations, as well as to make sure residents can get recommended services in the right settings. The parties filed this agreement with the Court, which preliminarily approved the agreement. Before the agreement is final, you have an opportunity to review the agreement for yourself and let the court know what you think. The Court will hold a fairness hearing. In this hearing, the Court will consider the comments it receives from people who are interested in the agreement. The Court will then make a final decision about whether the agreement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.
Background About the Lawsuit The Dunakin lawsuit is a class action. In a class action, one individual represents many more people (referred to as the ""class"") who have the same legal issues. The case was filed in 2014 against the Secretary of the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and the Director of the Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA) by one individual (referred to as the ""class representative""). He is a resident at a privately-operated nursing facility who has a condition related to an intellectual disability.
2020. All obligations under the agreement will end if Defendants meet the agreed standards for all metrics. The metrics are the only measures that can show the state of Washington has met its obligations, and allow the Court to dismiss the case. If the state of Washington is in substantial compliance, the lawsuit will be dismissed.
2. This is significant. No 16 one objected to (1) the comprehensive reforms to the PASRR system proposed; (2) the 17 protections put in place to ensure community placement when a class member is willing 18 and able to live outside of a nursing facility; (3) the attorneys’ fees sought; (4) the 19 requested litigation costs; or (5) any other aspect of the settlement agreement. The lack 20 of objectors to the merits of the Settlement Agreement confirms that it is a good resolution 21 for all involved. Importantly, this resolution was reached without years of contentious 22 litigation, as has occurred in other states.
8. If defendants achieve full compliance with each and every 18 compliance metric in advance of September 30, 2020, the parties will jointly move the 19 Court for an order asking for early termination of the Agreement and dismissal of the 20 case. Id., 8.2.
1. The parties have reached a Settlement Agreement that provides for a 14 comprehensive reform of defendants' Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Referral 15 (PASRR) system, required under the Nursing Home Reform Act. The Settlement 16 Agreement establishes procedures for ensuring timely PASRR Level I screenings, Level 17 II evaluations, Post-PASRR Level II meetings and, ultimately, the provision of specialized 18 services to increase class members' independence and/ or discharge planning for class 19 members who are medically able and willing to live in an alternative placement in the 20 community.
3. The parties to the Settlement Agreement shall perform all of their obligations thereunder. The Court shall retain jurisdiction over this matter until the 13 Settlement Agreement is terminated, pursuant to Section 8 of the Settlement Agreement.

The 1993 questionnaire closely resembled the 1992 survey. with changes to clarify several questions. In particular. the primary contacts were asked to identify the programs providing services and their case manager. The 1992 survey only asked if their person was served in the community and if they had contact with an Independent Case Manager during the previous month. Additional questions were added to the Likert Scale concerning day and residential staff and act ivi ties. and the wording changed to reduce ambigui ty.

The district court held that the law was not preempted. The main argument on appeal is that the law is expressly preempted by the federal immigration law provision preempting state regulation ""other than through licensing and similar laws."" 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(2). The district court correctly determined that the Act was a ""licensing"" law within the meaning of the federal provision and therefore was not expressly preempted.
The matter proceeded to hearing, and the district court dismissed the Arizona Attorney General for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, because he lacks the authority to bring enforcement actions. The court ruled in favor of the remaining defendants on the merits. It held that the Act is not expressly preempted by IRCA because the Act is a licensing law within the meaning of the savings clause. It held that neither the Act's sanctions provisions, nor the provision mandating use of E-Verify, was inconsistent with federal policy, and thus they were not impliedly preempted. Finally, the court held that the Act did not, on its face, violate due process because employers' due process rights were adequately protected. Plaintiffs now appeal.
Ariz.Rev.Stat. § 23-212(B). Defendants explain that this section, like the first sentence of subsection (H), provides, somewhat inartfully, that the initial investigation and the basis for bringing an enforcement action must be limited to the federal response, thereby precluding independent state investigation. The employer would then have the opportunity to present evidence. The district court agreed. The district court persuasively reasoned that requiring the state or county to obtain a federal determination of an employee's work status before bringing proceedings may be intended to protect employees from direct investigation by the state.
The district court held that the Act was not preempted. With respect to express preemption, it acknowledged that the penalties imposed by the Act qualify as ""sanctions"" within the meaning of IRCA’s preemption provision Pet

On August 29, 2007, the Petitioners filed the first of two consolidated actions challenging the Act in the District of Arizona. JA 223-66; 267-85.

JA 291-344; 345-66.
The district court also found that the verification statute did not conflict with federal law. It noted that IIRIRA prohibited only the Attorney General (now the Secretary of DHS) from requiring the use of E-Verify and that without more, this prohibition does not “raise an inference that Congress intended to prevent the states from mandating use of the system in their licensing laws.” Pet App. 83a. The district court also concluded that A.R.S. § 23-214’s requirement of using E-Verify did not create an obstacle to Congress’s purposes and objectives because “[f]ederal policy encourages the utmost use of E-Verify” and the Act “effectively increases employer use of the system with no evidence of surpassing logistical limits.” Pet App. 85a.

Defendants cite A.R.S. § 31-122(A), which provides that “[t]he sheriff may 14 receive and keep in the county jail any prisoner committed thereto by process or order 15 issued under the authority of the United States.” This appears to be the most relevant 16 statute, but the Court needs further briefing on the scope of this statute and what is meant 17 by “process or order.” Defendants argue that they are authorized to hold inmates on ICE detainers 19 pursuant to their intergovernmental service agreement with the federal government 20 (“IGSA”), on which ICE is an authorized rider Doc. 28 at 10-11. The IGSA is an 21 agreement for housing federal inmates and receiving reimbursement from the federal 22 government, but Defendants point to nothing in it that purports to grant them authority to 23 make arrests on behalf of the federal government. Indeed, Defendants and the United 24 States appear to have different understandings of how the IGSA functions in the context 25 of ICE detainers. Compare Doc. 28 at 10-11 (“[O]nce the ICE detention period begins, 26 an inmate is no longer in Defendants’ custody, but the custody of the federal 27 government.”), with Doc. 41 at 5-6 (“Until an immigration officer – or a state or local 28 officer who has been delegated immigration officer authority under a 287(g) agreement – 1 arrests the detainee, the IGSA is not triggered, and the detainee remains in state 2 custody.”).

Holder, 638 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2011), Plaintiffs also sought for the Government to bear the burden of proof at such a hearing. Concluding that it remained bound by Diouf II, the district court granted the preliminary injunction. The Government appeals, urging us to reverse and vacate.

U.S. Government Defendant","On April 7, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (San Francisco) granted a preliminary injunction against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on behalf of noncitizens detained under section 1231(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act ( 1231) pending a determination as to whether they can remain in the United States. The plaintiffs alleged that the DHS was violating their constitutional rights by detaining them for more than 180 days without providing them with a bond hearing before an immigration judge. In November 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to expand the class definition to include individuals transferred outside the 10 jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit prior to their 180th day in detention, and to compel the Government to post notice of the June 2018 Order in all immigration detention facilities. The Court denied the motion, finding that Plaintiffs’ reading of the certified class was too 13 broad and that Plaintiffs had not alleged that Defendants had failed to schedule bond hearings in accordance with 15 of the Order.

Press Release: Groups File Class Action Challenge to Unprecedented Mass Denials of Iranian Refugees in the Lautenberg-­Specter Program • APRIL 19, 2018 PRESS CONTACT Henrike Dessaules, IRAP, hdessaules@refugeerights.org, 646-­459-­3081 GROUPS FILE CLASS ACTION CHALLENGE TO UNPRECEDENTED MASS DENIALS OF IRANIAN REFUGEES IN LAUTENBERG-­‐‑SPECTER PROGRAM (San Jose, CA) – Yesterday, Iranian individuals and their U.S. family members, represented by Latham & Watkins LLP and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) at the Urban Justice Center, challenged the mass denials they or their family members received in response to applying for refugee resettlement via the Vienna-­based Lautenberg-­Specter program. The Lautenberg Amendment, passed by Congress in 1989, was intended to facilitate the refugee admission of certain vulnerable groups, including persecuted religious minorities. Iranian religious minorities became eligible for the Amendment’s robust protections in 2004. Under this unique program, U.S. residents submit an application on behalf of refugee applicants in Iran. Applicants have to pass an initial screening and, if successful, travel to Austria to continue the processing of their refugee application to the United States from a safe location. However, in February 2018, nearly 90 Iranians who had already traveled with the program received notices of denial that stated only that they were being denied “as a matter of discretion.” Many of them had been waiting for nearly a year. These Iranians are now at risk of deportation back to Iran, where they could face even greater persecution for having sought refuge in the United States. Plaintiffs seek the Court’s intervention to enforce the requirements of the Lautenberg Amendment and the United States Constitution, so that they will have the fair opportunity to reunite with family members and the refugee applicants will be able to practice their religious beliefs in the safety of this country. The lawsuit charges that denying the Iranian individuals without stating anything beyond “as a matter of discretion” prevents them from requesting agency review, putting these Iranian refugees in great danger. Plaintiffs in the case are affected individuals, including U.S. citizens with family members who are impacted by this recent set of denials. They are a mother in San Jose, California, seeking to reunite with her diabetic daughter and young grandchild;; a son who is eager to bring his mother and developmentally disabled adult brother to the United States for access to treatment and caregiving support;; and a widow stranded in Vienna with her elderly father and disabled toddler. They are now faced with an uncertain future. Plaintiff Jane Doe 5 stated in the court filing: “The denial has had a terrible impact on me and my family. My son suffers from repeated epileptic attacks and congenital hydrocephalus, requiring regular medical attention which we do not have access to here in Austria. . . . Furthermore, because we had initially anticipated our stay in Austria to last only three to six months, we have run out of savings and are in dire financial straits. I am anxious to travel to the U.S. and be reunited with my in-­laws.” The Plaintiffs are being represented by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) at the Urban Justice Center and Latham & Watkins LLP. Mariko Hirose, Litigation Director of IRAP, said: “The U.S. government extended a helping hand to these Iranian Christians, Mandeans, and other persecuted religious minorities who wanted to join their family members in the United States, only to cruelly whip it away for no discernible reason at all. The government’s conduct betrays America’s long-­standing commitment to be a beacon of religious freedom, as embodied by the Lautenberg Amendment.” “Our clients include U.S. citizens and refugees (now stranded in Vienna) who long to be reunited as families and free from the risk of deportation back to Iran, where they would be at an even greater risk of persecution than before for having sought refuge in the U.S. as a religious minority,” said Latham & Watkins partner Belinda Lee. The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
143. The Government 16 requests the Court stay the case until funding is restored. The Government believes its attorneys 17 are barred from working, even on a voluntary basis, because this case does not involve “the safety 18 of human life or the protection of property” necessary to warrant providing voluntary services.

Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and an order vacating and setting aside the policy. They also sought declarative relief and attorney's fees.

The Directive announced a reversal of prior ICE policy regarding the status of international students holding F-1 nonimmigrant student visas during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Directive instructs, inter alia, that “schools adopting a hybrid model – that is, a mixture of online and in person classes” must by August 4, 2020, certify to SEVP for each F-1 visa student that “the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the Fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program.”1 Students for whom the school cannot so certify “must leave the country or take alternate steps to maintain their nonimmigrant status such as transfer to a school with in-person instruction ….” The University of California has adopted a “hybrid model” for the Fall 2020 semester and thus must comply with the above requirements in less than a month to evaluate literally tens of thousands of students’ courseloads and certify that each meets the Directive’s requirements.

I. INTRODUCTION The University of California—renowned as the nation’s premier public university system and as a world-class academic and research powerhouse and a key contributor to the California economy and social fabric—has long welcomed international students seeking to pursue unrivaled educational opportunities and, ultimately, their most cherished dreams. These students contribute to rich intellectual discourse across all disciplines, including in the University system’s prized science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments, thereby also contributing to the University’s mission of delivering and supporting world-class teaching and research, as well as to California’s vibrant economy. For decades, the United States’ “F-1” visa program for international, non-immigrant students has made all this possible. In March 2020, faced with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, The Regents moved swiftly to transition the University’s ten campuses to remote teaching to protect the health and safety of their students and faculty, while continuing to meet its core mission of providing a world-class education. Also recognizing the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, defendant United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), an agency within defendant the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), issued an exemption to a preexisting regulation that required international students on F-1 visas to attend classes in person if they wished to remain in this country. ICE’s March 13, 2020 Guidance (the “March 13 Guidance”) provided critical assurances that international students could maintain their F-1 visa status while attending classes on-line “for the duration of the [COVID-19] emergency.” See Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Ex.

The court granted the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction and granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The parties are currently negotiating a settlement. The case is ongoing.","On July 6, 2020, the University of California filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Departments of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seeking a temporary restraining order against ICE and the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) regarding the status of international students holding F-1 nonimmigrant student visas during the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 13, 2020, ICE issued an exemption to a preexisting regulation that required international students on F-1 visas to attend classes in person if they wished to remain in this country. On July 14, 2020, the Court granted the University's motion for a restraining order, and on July 14, 2020 the University filed a motion for an injunction against ICE. The Court will hold a hearing on the injunction on August 14, 2020."
195,IM-CA-0166,"Seven unnamed individuals sued ICE and DHS over their new directive that would effectively force international students to take in-person classes or risk deportation. The suit alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Due Process Clause. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief prohibiting the enforcement of the directive and an order vacating the directive. 

On July 15, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance, but the plaintiffs in this case filed an amended complaint that sought a formal declaration that the July 6 directive was improperly issued and an order that the government administer the student visa program in accordance with the March guidance for the duration of the emergency. The court found that the students' claims were mooted by the rescission and granted the government's motion to dismiss on October 1, 2020.","14. Plaintiff Z L. is a 25 year-old Chinese national who lives in Los Angeles 2 and is enrolled as a PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles (“UCLA”), 3 focusing on cinema and media studies. She enrolled at UCLA in 2017 and holds an F- 4 1 visa. After UCLA switched to online operations in late March, Z L. remained in the 5 United States because she did not want to risk her or her parents’ health and safety by 6 traveling to China during a pandemic. She worries about returning to China because 7 traveling will place her at risk of contracting COVID-19, as she will be exposed to 8 people who may be infected with the virus at airports and inside the plane. If she were 9 forced to return to China, Z L. would not be able to continue her studies for several 10 reasons. For instance, due to the 15-hour time difference between Los Angeles and 11 China, Z L. will have to attend her online classes at unconventional times. For 12 example, Z L. will have to call into a 1 p.m. Monday class at 4 a.m. on Tuesday, 13 Beijing time. Watching recorded classes is not an option for her because graduate- 14 level courses are designed to be centered around conversations and dialogue with 15 other students than lecture. Relying on class recordings would deprive her of 16 important opportunities to learn from and with her peers Z

2020. (Dkt. 1 [Complaint].) The July 6 Guidance barred student visa holders from remaining in the United States during the upcoming fall semester if their universities cancelled in-person classes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Four days after filing suit, Plaintiffs applied for a temporary restraining order that would enjoin Defendants from implementing the July 6 Guidance. (Dkt. 16 [TRO Application, hereinafter “TRO”].) Later that same day, however, Defendants rescinded the challenged Guidance. (Dkt. 18.) Defendants’ rescission of the July 6 Guidance was finalized on July 24, 2020 when the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) issued updated guidance confirming that it will “abide by SEVP guidance originally issued in March 2020” which “enables schools and students to engage in distance learning in excess of regulatory limits due to the public health emergency generated by COVID19.” (Dkt. 46-1 [July 24 Broadcast Message].) Now before the Court are Plaintiffs’ application for a temporary restraining order (TRO), Plaintiffs’ amended application for a temporary restraining order (Dkt. 36 [hereinafter “Amended TRO”].), and Defendants’ motion to dismiss, (Dkt. 45 [hereinafter “Mot.”].). Plaintiffs concede
In their motion to dismiss, Defendants contend the rescission of the July 6 Guidance moots this action in its entirety and that it should be dismissed altogether. (See Mot.) Plaintiffs oppose that motion and request leave to amend their Complaint so that they can clarify the relief they continue to seek. (Id. at 3.) The Court finds that such amendments are necessary so that the operative pleading aligns with the current state of affairs. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Plaintiffs are hereby ORDERED to file an amended pleading that sets forth the relief they continue to seek by August 14,

U.S. Government Defendant","On November 27, 2018, a group of asylum seekers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the President of the United States. The plaintiffs alleged that the DHS had violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide them with a notice to appear before an asylum officer. The parties disagreed about when DHS made final credible fear determinations as to plaintiffs D.R. and P.P.V., and whether, as a legal matter, aliens remain in expedited removal proceedings until they receive a credible fear interview. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for declaratory and injunctive relief, granted their motion for summary judgment, and denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case.","On June 26, 2018, the ACLU filed a class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Justice (DOJ) on behalf of asylum seekers who entered the United States from Mexico outside a port of entry after November 9, 2018 by crossing the southern border.

204,IM-DC-0070,"37 families detained at three ICE-managed family residential centers sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security alleging violations of their Fifth Amendment constitutional rights, violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, and violations of the Flores Settlement Agreement. The plaintiffs alleged that the congregate environment and unsanitary conditions of the detention centers make them a tinderbox for a COVID-19 outbreak. They sought immediate release until proper protocols could be implemented. The plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order which was granted in part and denied in part on March 30. The court ordered ICE to provide appropriate infection protocols for the adults (a similar order from another case, <i>Flores</i>, applies to the children), to comply with CDC guidelines for congregate institutions, and to file a report regarding FRC capacity, implementation of the CDC guidelines, the number of detainees released, and videotape of the living conditions at the FRCs. On May 26, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and a motion in opposition to the temporary restraining order. The court denied the plaintiffs' later motion for a preliminary injunction demanding wholesale release of detainees on July 22. On December 10, the court dismissed the claim under the APA and the writs of mandamus. A hearing is scheduled for February 16, 2021.

Even if all of the recommendations made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and that I have provided are followed, the conditions of detention are such that the detained families would still be at high risk. Because this virus is transmitted through droplets, through the air, and on surfaces, and because people who do not have symptoms but are infected transmit the virus to others, even one infected person in a facility, either a detainee or a staff member, can infect the majority of people in the facility. This is worsened by the crowded conditions in the facilities.

3. The Petitioners (the “families”) in this matter are mothers, fathers and minor children who have been placed in purportedly civil detention in a family residential center, a communal space for families seeking asylum in the United States. They are unfortunately in this placement as a pandemic spreads around them. The families are trapped and at risk of serious irreparable physical harm. Their placement in family detention has created a dangerous situation that imminently threatens their lives, the lives of those in the surrounding communities, and the general public should a COVID-19 crisis spark within family detention.

206,IM-DC-0079,"Three non-citizen soldiers in the U.S. military brought this class-action lawsuit against the Department of Defense in September 2017.  The Department was refusing to certify their honorable military service for purposes of expedited naturalization under the Immigration and Nationality Act.  The court issued a preliminary injunction in October 2017, requiring the Department to certify honorable service within 2 days of a soldier’s request, without imposing additional procedural or substantive requirements.  As of August 2020, the plaintiffs and the Department of Defense are in mediation.","BACKGROUND The issues in this case overlap with a related case before this Court, Nio v. United States Department of Homeland Security. See Nio v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 17-cv0998, 2017 WL 3917006 (D.D.C Sept. 6, 2017). That case involves MAVNI enlistees who have already received a completed Form N-426, but have brought similar challenges to DOD’s recent change in its N-426 policy. In addition, the Nio plaintiffs are challenging the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) and USCIS’s decision to put their naturalization applications on hold pending DOD’s completion of the enhanced security screening (“DHS/USCIS Security Screening Requirement”) it now requires for MAVNI enlistees prior to initial entry training (“IET”) or active-duty service. The parties concede that filings in both the instant suit and Nio bear on the preliminary injunction inquiry before the Court, and thus, the Court may rely on records in both cases I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND A. Military Service as a Path to Citizenship Since at least the Civil War, special naturalization provisions have applied to non-citizens who serve in the United States military. See USCIS Policy Manual, Vol. 12, Part I, Ch. 3, § A. Currently, the requirements for naturalization based on military service are found in Section 328 and 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. Section 328, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1439, applies during peacetime; Section 329, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1440, applies during designated “periods of military hostilities.” For present purposes, § 1440 is the only relevant statutory provision because on July 3, 2002, President George W. Bush signed an Executive Order declaring that a period of military hostilities had begun on September 11, 2001, and that Executive Order remains in effect as of today. See Exec. Order No. 13269, 67 Fed Reg. 45, 287 (July 3, 2002).
B. Due Process Clause The Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person shall be... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S Const. amend V. Plaintiffs claim that DOD’s October 13th Guidance “violates their Due Process rights by denying or impairing their statutory right to seek naturalization.” (Opp. at 36.) Plaintiff allege violations of procedural due process and substantive due process.
U.S. Government Defendant","On May 24, 2017, non-citizen soldiers serving in the U.S. military filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' refusal to certify their naturalization applications violated their constitutional rights. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction on September 19, 2017. On October 27, 2017, the court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining aspects of the New DoD N-426 Policy. The parties are continuing to negotiate a settlement agreement.","On October 13, 2017, a group of non-citizens who served in the U.S. military filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs challenged the DHS's policy requiring enlistees to undergo enhanced security screening prior to initial entry training (IET) or active-duty service. The case overlaps with a similar case before the Court in which the plaintiffs challenged a similar DHS policy on the same grounds. The parties agreed to a preliminary injunction, which the Court granted on September 6, 2017."
207,IM-DC-0080,"Non-citizen soldiers in the U.S. military brought this lawsuit in May 2017, challenging policies of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense that unlawfully delayed their naturalization applications. The court certified a class and granted a preliminary injunction against the agencies on October 27, 2017. On May 22, 2019, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that the agencies’ policy of delaying naturalization applications was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The court issued a permanent injunction on August 20, 2020, and retained jurisdiction to enforce the injunction.","Group 3: [Selected Reserve MAVNIs]...  Approx. 500 Group 3 MAVNIs have received command endorsement [i.e., N-426 “honorable service” certifications] and applied for naturalization based on having “performed creditable service” in the form of two weekend drills. These citizenship applications are under review by [USCIS].  Action: The heightened risk associated with Groups 1/2, and the application of resources needed to mitigate that risk, render it infeasible to continue to process [Group 3] MAVNIs. Except for individual cases deemed vital to the national interest, Group 3 will be separated by Secretarial plenary authority.
USCIS concerns over the prior year and a half, especially “circumstances and instances” of MAVNI enlistees becoming naturalized “before a DoD background check revealed derogatory information suggesting that [the applicant] lacked good moral character or attachment to the U.S. Constitution.” (July 7 Guidance (USCIS AR 5) (noting that investigations had subsequently identified such conduct as “immigration fraud, criminal acts, aggravated felonies, active membership and participation in the Communist Party, and national security concerns”); see also 7/7/17 Renaud Decl. 17 (USCIS AR 248) (noting the same concerns); 3/5/18 Renaud Decl. 3-4 (USCIS AR 2) (noting the same concerns and citing the OIG classified report and “other classified documents”).) The July 7 Guidance explained: “USCIS has determined that the completion of DOD background checks is relevant to a MAVNI recruit’s eligibility for naturalization.... USCIS must ensure that each MAVNI naturalization applicant demonstrates good moral character and attachment to the U.S. Constitution as required by the INA and 8 CFR.” (July 7 Guidance at 1-2 (USCIS AR 4-5).) II. MAVNI-RELATED LITIGATION A. Nio v. DHS This action was filed on May 24, 2017, before the July 7 Guidance was issued. (See Compl., May 24, 2017 (ECF No. 1).) Plaintiffs initially alleged that USCIS and DOD were unlawfully delaying the processing of MAVNI naturalization applications due to improper interference in the process by DOD. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction, asking the Court to enjoin DOD from interfering and USCIS from delaying the processing of MAVNI naturalization applications. (Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Injunction at 1, June 28, 2017 (ECF No. 17).) Shortly thereafter, USCIS issued the July 7 Guidance and plaintiffs sought to challenge it as part of this litigation. The Court ordered plaintiffs to amend their complaint and revise their request for preliminary relief. (See Order, July 19, 2017 (ECF No. 24).) Plaintiffs then amended their complaint to challenge the July 7 Guidance as unlawful. (1st Am. Compl., Aug. 4, 2017 (ECF No. 27).) They complained that DOD had unlawfully interfered in the naturalization process and USCIS had allowed DOD to do so by agreeing to wait until the “enhanced” checks were “complete” before processing naturalization applications. Plaintiffs also moved for class certification. (Pls.’ Mot. to Certify Class, Aug. 11, 2017 (ECF No. 30).) The Court certified the class and appointed class counsel. The class is defined as all persons who have (i) enlisted in the Selected Reserve through the MAVNI program prior to October 13, 2017; (ii) served honorably with a Selected Reserve unit through participation in at least one qualifying drill period or served in an active-duty status; (iii) submitted N-400 Applications for Naturalization; (iv) been issued Form N-426s certifying honorable service as a member of the Selected Reserve or in active-duty status; and (v) have had the processing or final adjudication of their naturalization applications (including naturalization itself) withheld or delayed because of (a) a final USCIS processing hold for MAVNIs, (b) a DOD N-426 policy review, (c) a DOD N-426 recall/decertification policy, (d) enhanced DOD security screenings, (e) a DOD CAF adjudication, (f) a national security determination, and/or (g) military service suitability vetting determination[.] (Order at 1-2, Oct. 27, 2017 (ECF No. 72).) The Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that although plaintiffs had shown irreparable harm, they had not shown that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. See Nio PI Op., 270 F. Supp.

As set forth in Plaintiff’s Motions for Preliminary Injunction and for Class Certification, and the accompanying declarations, this case involves unaccompanied children who are subject to swift expulsion pursuant to a novel invocation of the public health provisions of Title 42 of the U.S Code. The scheme challenged in this case is called the “Title 42 Process.” Defendants stated in June 2020 that, as of that time, they had expelled approximately 2,000 unaccompanied children pursuant to the Title 42 Process. Recent reports show that more such children are expelled every day. Due to the irreparable harm faced by the children subject to the Title 42 Process, Plaintiff believes expedited consideration is warranted.

Although at the hearing, the parties in JBBC anticipated an expedited schedule for summary judgment briefing (id. at 53–54 (“I will stress that I would like the merits briefing to move quickly.”); Order, JBBC, No. 20-cv-1509 (D.D.C. June 24, 2020), ECF No. 38 (giving the parties five days to propose a summary judgment briefing schedule)), such briefing was ultimately unnecessary. On June 29, 2020, the parties filed a document stating that the government had “transferred the custody of [J.B.B.C.] to the Office of Refugee Resettlement”—presumably pursuant to the TVPRA, which directs that “unaccompanied alien child[ren]” from non-contiguous countries who are in the custody of the federal government must be transferred to the custody of that office “not later than 72 hours after determining that such child is an unaccompanied alien child,” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(3); see also 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A) (describing the functions of the Office of Refugee Resettlement)—“for immigration processing under Title 8 of the U.S. Code.” Notice to the Court at 1, JBBC, No. 20-cv-1509 (D.D.C.

42. But that statute explicitly suspends the “operation of any provision of law,” much like a “notwithstanding” clause explicitly identifies “any other provision of law.” Similarly, the Suspension Clause of the Constitution specifically identifies the right suspended by stating that “[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” U.S Const. art I, § 9, cl. 2, quoted in ECF No. 44-2 at
Additionally, the government has failed to take into account the harm to the public interest in continuing its current practice of housing unaccompanied non-citizen minors in hotels while they await expulsion from the United States under the Title 42 Process—a practice that would end if an injunction issued requiring Plaintiff and the putative class to be excepted from expulsion from the United States under the Title 42 Process.

Federal courts reviewing similar suits in other districts granted a nationwide preliminary injunction that applied here, and the cases are pending review and revision by the Biden administration.","1. This case concerns the Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to abrogate the refugee protections codified in the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., through agency rulemaking.
6. The Trump Administration has done all it can, and much it cannot legally do, to gut the rights of refugees seeking protection in the United States as codified in the INA. Given the foundational place the Refugee Act occupies in the U.S. immigration system, it is unsurprising that human rights groups and individuals seeking protection have challenged such actions in court.
18. Human Rights First operates a Refugee Representation program, one of the largest programs for pro bono legal representation of asylum seekers in the nation, through which it works in partnership with volunteer lawyers at leading law firms to provide legal representation without charge to asylum applicants unable to afford paid counsel. Human Rights First’s in-house attorneys and legal services coordinators also represent asylum seekers in immigration-related proceedings focusing on asylum and other protection-based forms of immigration status. Over the last 40 years, Human Rights First has helped tens of thousands of individuals who came to the United States fleeing persecution, torture, and threats of death. In 2019, over 97 percent of Human Rights First’s clients were granted relief. Assisting non-citizens with asylum applications is a vital component of Human Rights First’s organizational mission and accounts for much of the services Human Rights First provides.

The list does not include noncitizens seeking asylum and other forms of relief.
211. The Agencies offer no real explanation for this shift. Historically, relief under CAT has been remarkably difficult to obtain, so it is unclear why the Agencies feel it necessary to make it even harder to obtain.213 Moreover, the Proposed Rule, signed by Attorney General William Barr on behalf of DOJ, contradicted A.G. Barr’s own Matter of O-F-A-S- opinion. In that case, the A.G. found that the “rogue official” standard “risks confusion” because it “suggests a standard different from ‘under color of law’” and “has been interpreted to have multiple meanings.”214 Although the final rule removed the term “rogue official”,215 it simply replaced it with another term meaning the same thing. In other words, in the name of seeking “clarity,” the Agencies 211 Cf. Screws v.

The Agencies violated the APA in numerous ways. They: (1) ignored serious concerns expressed in the comments; (2) failed to weigh the Rule’s cost and benefits; (3) failed to support the Rule’s purported rationales; (4) failed to address an important part of the problem, that the Rule will cost the U.S. economy and fisc; (5) failed to explore any alternatives; and (6) failed to provide sufficient time for the Rule to take effect.

The district court granted a preliminary injunction requiring Miami-Dade County to employ numerous safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as imposing extensive reporting requirements.

211,IM-IN-0002,"On May 25, 2011, three foreign residents of Indiana filed a class action lawsuit against the cities of Indianapolis and Franklin and the counties of Marion and Johnson, seeking to enjoin enforcement of Indiana's Senate Enrolled Act 590, which would allow local law enforcement officers to make warrantless arrests of people who were subject to a removal order issued by an immigration court or a detainer or notice of action issued by the Department of Homeland Security, or who had been indicted or convicted of an aggravated felony, and would make the use of consular identification cards for identification within the state a civil infraction punishable by fine.  On March 28, 2013, the District Court (Judge Barker) ruled in favor of plaintiffs, granting their motion for summary judgment, and permanently enjoining defendants from enforcing Sections 18 and 20 of SEA 590.  Because plaintiffs' suit was dependent upon enforcement of these sections, the matter was dismissed without prejudice.","In entering a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, this Court previously reached all issues presented by this case. There is no reason for these issues to be revisited, and these provisions of SEA 590 are every bit as illegal and unconstitutional now as they were five (5) months ago. The previously entered preliminary injunction should accordingly be made permanent.1 THE CHALLENGED STATUTES On July 1, 2011, the provisions of Senate Enrolled Act 590 (SEA 590) took effect in Indiana. Two (2) sections of SEA 590 are at issue in this case:
Defendant City of Indianapolis’s Response in Opposition to Summary Judgment and Brief in Support of its Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment Defendant City of Indianapolis, by counsel Justin F. Roebel, hereby requests that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ request for summary judgment against the City of Indianapolis. While Defendant City takes no position on the merits of the substantive claims as applied to other Defendants, Plaintiffs’ claims fail as a matter of law with regard to the City. As such, Defendant City cross-moves to request that this Court enter judgment in its favor. Plaintiffs have improperly sued the City pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 1983 based on the State of Indiana’s immigration law. Plaintiffs allege the City’s officers would be charged with enforcement of the immigration law. Plaintiff seeks from the City injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, and “all other proper relief.” However, a valid Section 1983 claim against a municipality requires evidence of a municipal custom, policy, or practice which violates federal law. Mere adherence—or, in this case, potential adherence—with a state policy or law is insufficient to support a claim. Because Plaintiffs have failed to identify an improper municipal custom, policy, or practice, all claims against the City of Indianapolis should be summarily denied.
Factual Background On May 25, 2011, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the recently enacted Senate Enrolled Act 590 (SEA 590), which was adopted by the Indiana General Assembly and originally scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2011.

After leaving Marion County, Adair stayed in a county jail in Chicago for three days and was transported to Wisconsin. Adair Dep. at 22:4-6. The jail in Wisconsin contained individuals detained for immigration issues and others confined for non-immigration issues. A dair Dep. at 22:16-25; 23:1. S ome of the individuals working in the Wisconsin jail were members of local law enforcement. Adair Dep. at 23:9-14.
Ultimately, Indiana Code § 34-28-8.2-1 is an internal regulation by the State of Indiana to ensure residents of the State have proper and valid forms of identification, and does not impermissibly tread on the powers of the federal government regarding immigration matters. The goal of ensuring that individuals have valid forms of identification assists not only state law enforcement in being able to effectively identify individuals F. There is no property interest in using a Consular Identification card; therefore, Indiana Code § 34-28-8.2-1 does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs assert Indiana Code § 34 -38-8.2-1 violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because there is allegedly no rational basis for the statutory provision. However, Plaintiffs fail to acknowledge a key step in proving a Fourteenth Amendment violation – a liberty or property interest. This failure dooms the Plaintiffs’ claim. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that the State cannot deprive “any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” U.S Const. Amend XIV. “The touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government.” Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 558 (1974). A property interest is “created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.” Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 1972). Defendants are aware of no court ever holding that a fundamental right exists to use CIDs. In a challenge to a similar law in Georgia, the court determined that “Plaintiffs cannot create a constitutionally protected property interest simply by showing that they have used Consular Identification Documents in the past.” Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights v. Deal, 793 F.Supp.2d 1317, 1339 (N.D Ga. 2011).

The plaintiffs alleged that the Presidential Memorandum titled “Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census” is unconstitutional and that any compliance violates §§ 706(2) of the APA because it is contrary to constitutional power, right, privilege, or immunity and in excess of statutory jurisdiction and authority, and without observance of procedure required by law. The case has been approved for a three-judge court and is awaiting the defendants' answer.","3. This direction is patently and unquestionably illegal. The fourth sentence of the Constitution, Article I, Section 2, as amended by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, makes clear that congressional representatives are to be apportioned among the states according to their respective numbers, “counting the whole number of persons in each State.” U.S Const. Amend XIV. Undocumented immigrants are now and have always been persons as a matter of fact, law, and basic human decency.
4. Plaintiffs are membership-based, non-profit organizations that serve immigrants of color across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. They seek immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to ameliorate the immense harm provoked by the July 21 Memorandum. Issued in the midst of census-taking for Census 2020 and with a national census selfresponse rate at just barely over 60%, the July 21 Memorandum has instilled considerable fear and confusion in immigrant communities; it has already imperiled and threatens to further derail efforts by Plaintiffs to encourage households in hard-to-count communities to complete Census
7. The July 21 Memorandum is also motivated by a racially discriminatory scheme to reduce the political representation of communities of color and increase the overrepresentation of white voters. By complying with the July 21 Memorandum and producing population tabulations excluding undocumented individuals for congressional apportionment, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Director Steven Dillingham, the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce (together, the “Agency Defendants”) will deny immigrants of color, foreign-born residents, undocumented residents, and non- citizens the political representation and census-linked federal funding to which they are entitled, on the basis of their race and national origin.
8. The Court should enjoin compliance with the July 21 Memorandum as violative of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) for multiple reasons. First, the July 21 Memorandum instructs the Secretary of Commerce to perform an unconstitutional task contrary to law: to exclude undocumented immigrants from the congressional apportionment base, in violation of Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, as amended by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. In addition and in the alternative, compliance with the July 21 Memorandum is intended to and will discriminate against immigrants of color, non-citizens, undocumented residents and foreign-born individuals because of their race, national origin, or alienage. Second, the Secretary of Commerce has exceeded his statutory authority over the conduct of the decennial census by declaring his intention to comply with the July 21 Memorandum, thus improperly allowing Defendant Trump to usurp the discretion delegated to the Secretary by Congress.

216,IM-MD-0016,"This is a habeas action seeking the release of immigration detainees housed in ICE facilities in Maryland. The court initially denied the detainees' TRO, but eventually granted two preliminary injunctions that ordered the release of several detainees from their respective detention centers. The court also granted the petitioners' motion for class certification.","Under these circumstances, release is the only meaningful way to mitigate the spread of the virus among immigration detainees. For individuals who are at high risk for serious illness or death from COVID-19, protection from the virus is a matter of life or death. As of March 24, there are over 240 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Maryland, and three deaths.4 In the United States, the most concentrated instance of death from the virus occurred in a confined institutional setting.5 2 Hamed Aleaziz, A Medical Worker At An ICE Detention Facility For Immigrants Has Tested Positive For The Coronavirus, BuzzFeed News (Mar. 19, 2020), available at https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/ice-medical-worker-coronavirus. 3 See Ex. 4 4-5 (Declaration of Eric Lopez); Ex. 5 4 (Declaration of Eleni Bakst); Ex. 6 4 (Declaration of Eleni Bakst). 4 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak, Maryland Department of Health (accessed Mar. 23, 2020), available at https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/. 5 Maria Sacchetti Jay Greene, As Coronavirus Quietly Spread, A Nondescript Nursing Home Became The Deadliest Hot Spot in the U.S., The Washington Post (Mar. 7, 2020), available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/as-coronavirus-quietly-spread-a-nondescript-nursing-home-became-thedeadliest-hot-spot-in-the-us/2020/03/06/5d788a26-5f47-11ea-9055-5fa12981bbbf_story.html, Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Plaintiffs”) are individuals detained in ICE custody in Maryland who, due to their pre-existing medical conditions, are particularly vulnerable to serious illness or death if infected by the coronavirus. Maryland has seen a significant coronavirus outbreak. The Governor has declared a State of Emergency and has put in place widespread social distancing measures, including shutting down all nonessential businesses and all public gatherings. These measures are impossible to implement in a crowded detention center. The danger posed by Plaintiffs’ continued detention during the COVID-19 pandemic is “so grave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk” and violates their constitutional right to safety in government custody. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993). Without this Court’s intervention, Plaintiffs will continue to face the imminent risk of severe illness or death. Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order directing their immediate release from custody.
In a published order, the Ninth Circuit sua sponte ordered release from immigration detention in light of the COVID-19 crisis. See, e.g., Xochihua-Jaimes v. Barr, No. 18-71460 (9th Cir Mar. 23, 2020) (Order) (“[I]n light of the rapidly escalating public health crisis, which public health authorities predict will especially impact immigration detention centers, the court sua sponte orders that Petitioner be immediately released from detention and that removal of Petitioner be stayed pending final disposition by this court.”). Several courts have also ordered the release of individuals in the federal criminal system. See, e.g., United States v. Stephens, 1:15-cr-00095 (AJN), Doc No. 2798 (S.D.N.Y. March 19, 2020) (explaining that “the unprecedented and extraordinarily dangerous nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has become apparent” and that “inmates may be at a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19 should an outbreak develop”); United States v.

BACKGROUND Petitioners here are being held by ICE at ACDC, a contract facility, pending removal proceedings. None of the petitioners has received a final order of removal, and their cases are at varying stages. Petitioners challenge their detention because of COVID-19, contending that the ACDC’s precautions are insufficient to protect their health and safety. However, ACDC has taken a number of precautions and steps to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in the facility A. Petitioners’ Status None of the Petitioners have received a final order of removal.
The facility has also ceased all social visits. Hagan Decl. II Id.
When this action was filed, on April 16, 2020, ICE was reporting five cases of COVID-19 in Adams County Detention Center (“Adams”). That number has since tripled, and Respondents’ declarations show that 100% of those tested at Adams have tested positive. The actions the facility has taken have not stopped the spread of this uniquely dangerous disease. In these circumstances, only release can prevent irreparable harm. As courts in this Circuit and nationally have found,2 this court has authority via habeas to find a Due Process violation and order their release.
2241. Having carefully considered the parties’ submission, the record, and the applicable law, the Court finds as follows:
Petitioners filed their habeas petition alleging that their continued civil immigration detention violates their right to substantive and procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. [ECF No. 1] at 31–33. The petitioners are being held in the Adams County Detention Center (“ACDC”). Six petitioners remain in this suit1, and the Habeas Petition describes them as follows:

The case settled with the MHP agreeing to reform its operations, and the consent decree is ended on April 3, 2020","3. Montana Highway Patrol has a custom, pattern, policy, and practice of seizing drivers and passengers it suspects of being in the country without authorization for a prolonged period, often between forty minutes to two hours, while attempting to make contact with DHS to ascertain their immigration status and determine if an immigration enforcement officer wishes to assume custody of them. These drivers and passengers are seized, at least initially, upon the prerogative of the Montana Highway Patrol and not at the direction ofDHS.

Hickithier [sp] would be pulling me aside to talk later and to just let him have his say. During the first speakers session he pulled me out in to the lobby and said we needed to talk. He told me I needed to work on not being so Bullheaded. He also stated that I needed to read the emails I was sent and follow the procedures in them. I told him I believed I had. The night before when I got back to my room I double checked to make sure I had the email. I did. I had been following the procedures ICE had put out with the associated numbers to be called. At no time did he admit to being any way at fault for the incident. After his reaction the night before I just let him talk and went back to the training.
66. On information and belief, Montana Highway Patrol has a policy and practice of detaining Latino passengers in a vehicle to investigate their immigration status absent particularized reasonable suspicion that the passenger is committing a criminal violation. In these instances, the Montana Highway Patrol prolongs the detention of the passenger significantly longer than necessary to resolve the matter for which the driver is seized.
The vehicle was driven by a Latino male.

Esmor Correctional Services, Inc., No. 98-1282(DRD) [IM-NJ-0003]., which was also pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Plaintiffs were undocumented aliens who were detained at a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey pending a determination of their asylum status. In 2007, the jury returned a verdict, finding for plaintiffs on their Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims, as well as their claims for negligent hiring, training, supervision and/or retention, and awarded plaintiffs $100,001.00 in damages.","5. A subsequent report issued by the I.N.S. acknowledges that the events of June 18, 1995 (""Event?) were sparked by the inhuman conditions at the Esmor Elizabeth facility. After the Events, the I.N.S. closed Esmor Elizabeth and discontinued its Contract with Defendant Esmor Corporation. Subsequently, the men and women detained there were transferred to other detention facilities throughout the United States. Some of the men and women have received political asylum, some stifi are detained by the LN.S., while others have been deported.
1997. In May of 1997, the LN.S. deported Nanteza, in violation of an order issued by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. A motion is pending before that court that will determine whether the I.N.S. will be required to bring Nanteza back to the United States.
41. Prior to the Events, Defendant I.N.S. investigated Defendant Esmor Corporation's performance under the Contract. Defendant I.N.S. found that Defendant Esmor Corporation materially breached the Contract in numerous ways, and decided not to renew the Contract, (These breaches are documented by the I.N.S. in an interim report it published on July 20, 1995, hereinafter the ""Interim Report,"" attached hereto as Exhibit A.) These breaches led to the I.N,S.'s decision not to renew the Contract. As discussed in detail throughout this complaint, each of these breaches of contract by Defendant Esmor Corporation caused harm to Plaintiffs. Among these breaches of contract were the following:
g. The Contract required that a written, itemized inventory of the asylum seekers' personal property be kept and that all property be returned to asylum seekers upon release. (S Contract, subsection 14, p. 53.) In violation of the Contract, Defendant Esmor Corporation failed to . Filed 06/16/1997 reimburse Plaintiffs for personal property, money, or valuables for which Plaintiffs had receipts.

A divided panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed the award of fees, holding that the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties, and were thus ineligible for fees under § 1988.

The plaintiffs alleged that they were forced to work in conditions that violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 8(2) and the Convention Concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour, Article 1(1).

2. Efforts by USCIS and FBI to Reduce Current Processing Times Faced with increased numbers of naturalization applications, increased emphasis on security concerns, and increased application processing times, USCIS and FBI have worked consistently since 2002 to develop more efficient and effective processes, to minimize processing times while continuing to allow for a full background check of each naturalization applicant. USCIS and FBI have adopted technological changes to facilitate the prompt requesting of FBI name checks when USCIS receives a naturalization applicant, and the prompt dissemination of the results of the FBI name check to USCIS adjudicators. Among other things, USCIS has modified its computer processing system so that it automatically requests a name check on every naturalization application, to avoid delays associated with manual requests. (CIS003221). USCIS has also implemented procedures enabling adjudicators to have immediate access to FBI name check results to facilitate prompt resolution of applications after FBI provides a response. (CIS002581-82). Similarly, FBI has made numerous improvements in NNCP’s software to make the name check process more efficient and limit the amount of manual review of files required.5 The NNCP is also working with Information Technology to improve search techniques with existing technology to increase quality of searches. (FBI000177). Further, FBI is working towards automating the Name Check program by scanning paper files to provide machine-readable documents to reduce time spent locating files. (FBI 000066-67; FBI 000176; FBI000450). FBI has requested a $4.2 million budget for fiscal year 2008 to initiate additional technology upgrades. (FBI 000177).
E. Members of the Kaplan Class Should be Excluded from Any Class in this Case Further, to the extent that, notwithstanding the above, the Court deems it appropriate to certify a class in this case, the class should be defined to exclude any individual who released his or her claims as a class-member participating in the settlement of Kaplan v.

The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and LatinoJustice PRLDEF, sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees and costs, claiming that the defendants, through the passage of an ordinance prohibiting the solicitation of labor from the town's streets and sidewalks, unlawfully prohibited speech related to employment and had a discriminatory animus against predominately Latino immigrant day laborers. After defeating the defendant's partial motion for summary judgment due to lack of standing, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was successful. On September 3, 2015, the District Court enjoined the ordinance and declared it unconstitutional as it violated the first amendment.

Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Denis R. Hurley, Judge).
In 2009, the Town of Oyster Bay passed an ordinance prohibiting day laborers standing near a public right-of-way from stopping or attempting to stop vehicles to solicit work, and drivers frompicking up such laborers. On May 18, 2010, two organizations of day laborers sued the Town and its Supervisor (together, “the Town”) in the district court, seeking to enjoin the town from enforcing the ordinance on the ground that the ordinance violated their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection of the laws. They immediately moved, on free-speech grounds only, for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) that would bar enforcement “until the hearing on [their]motion for preliminary injunction.” The next day, the district court heard argument but neither side presented evidence.
1. The Town then appealed.
8. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) in that Plaintiffs’ claims arise in the Eastern District of New York.
The plaintiffs, two organizations that advocate on behalf of immigrant workers and day laborers, commenced this lawsuit on May 17, 2010, alleging that the Town of Oyster Bay Ordinance prohibiting day laborers, standing near a public right-of-way, from stopping or attempting to stop vehicles to solicit work, and drivers from picking up such laborers, violated their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection of the laws. The plaintiffs simultaneously moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction on free speech grounds. The following day, the district court entered a TRO based on the limited information before it.
Thereafter, the court scheduled the preliminary injunction hearing, but before the hearing took place, the defendants asked the court to bypass the hearing and convert the TRO into an appealable preliminary injunction. On consent, the court entered the preliminary injunction as stipulated by the parties. The Town then appealed to the Second Circuit. Although the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision, the Second Circuit emphasized that the district court retained the power to reconsider its order granting the preliminary injunction or to leave the preliminary injunction in place and proceed to trial.

224,IM-NY-0050,"On October 21, 2014, the American Immigration Council, National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild and American Civil Liberties Union filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants failed to disclose documents regarding information and practices concerning the expedited removal of families from an Artesia, New Mexico immigration detention center. The production of the requested documents was ordered. The parties settled on June 6, 2017.","Artesia, on July 29, 2014, the American Immigration Council, the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, and the American Civil Liberties Union (collectively, ""the Plaintiffs"") submitted a FOIA request addressed to DHS as well as its component agencies, Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (collectively, ""the Defendants"").

80. Four of the Defendants, DHS, CRCL, ICE, and USCIS, denied the Plaintiffs' request for expedited processing. Upon the Plaintiffs' administrative appeals,DHS,CRCL,ICE, and USCIS affirmed those denials. By administratively appealing the adverse decisions on expedited processing by DHS, CRCL, ICE, and USCIS, the Plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies with respect to those agencies.

225,IM-NY-0055,"Sixteen states filed this lawsuit against the federal government on September 6, 2017 in response to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memorandum issued on Sept. 5 ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The states sought to enjoin the federal government from carrying out portions of the DHS memorandum and from using information about DACA grantees gathered in their applications to enforce immigration policy. While the district court granted in part the government’s motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction. On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that DHS's decision to rescind DACA was subject to judicial review under the APA and that the rescission was unlawful. Shortly thereafter, the Acting DHS Secretary issued a memorandum suspending DACA while DHS reviewed it. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that the Acting Secretary lacked the authority to issue the memorandum because he had not been lawfully appointed to his position. The district court agreed. Accordingly, the court vacated the memorandum and ordered DHS to resume processing DACA applications. This case is ongoing. ","Any of these flaws would support invalidating the DACA rescission as arbitrary and capricious. Before this court, Defendants have attempted to reframe their decision as motivated by ""litigation risk."" They contend that the decision to end the DACA program was reasonable in light ofthe prospect that Texas and several other states would seek to amend their complaint in Texas v. United States, No. 14-CV-254 (S.D. Tex.), to challenge the DACA program; that the U.S. District Court for the Southem District of Texas would issue a nationwide injunction ending the program; and that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Comt would affirm that injunction. (Defs. Opp'n to Pis Mots. for Prelim Inj. (Dkt. 239) at I, 10-11, 21-24.) The Administrative Record does not support Defendants' contention that they decided to end the DACA program for this reason. Even if it did, reliance on this ""litigation risk"" rationale would have been arbitrary and capricious, in light of Defendants' failure to explain their decision or to consider any factors that might have weighed against ending the DACA program. And even if this ""litigation risk"" rationale were both suppotted by the Administrative Record and a reasonable basis for rescinding the DACA program, the comt would neve1theless likely set Defendants' decision aside, as the court cannot say that any ofthe aforementioned errors were harmless, for purposes of review under the APA. Accordingly, the comt concludes that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their substantive APA claims. Because Plaintiffs also satisfy the remaining requirements for the court to issue a preliminary injunction, the court ENJOINS Defendants from rescinding the DACA program, pending a decision on the merits of these cases. Defendants thus must continue processing DACA renewal requests under the same terms and conditions that applied before September 5, 2017, subject to the limitations described below. The scope of this preliminary injunction conforms to that previously issued by the U.S. District Court of the Northem District of Califomia. See Order Denying Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction and Granting Provisional Relief(Dkt. 234), Regents of the Univ. of Calif v.

(Sessions Ltr.; DACA Rescission Memo at 3.) This premise is flatly incorrect. The Southem District of Texas enjoined the implementation of DAPA, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed that injunction, on the grounds that DAPA violated the APA. 809 F.3d at 170-86; 86 F. Supp.

Since 2012, nearly 800,000 DACA recipients have relied on this program to work, study, and keep building lives in the U.S.<n>The Department's Acting Secretary issued a memorandum terminating the program on that basis.

The parties argued that the decision to end the DACA program was arbitrary and capricious because it was based on a ""litigation risk"" rationale.

And later, the plaintiffs made a motion for summary judgment on the 2018 immigration-related conditions. In February 2020, a Second Circuit panel reversed the district court's order granting partial summary judgment, vacated the mandate and injunction, and remanded the case to the district court, concluding that the Attorney General was statutorily authorized to impose the challenged conditions and that the imposition of these conditions was not arbitrary and capricious.

On Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ARGUED: JUNE 18, 2019 DECIDED: FEBRUARY 26, 2020 Before: WINTER, CABRANES, and RAGGI, Circuit Judges.
Intertwined with these issues is a foundational legal question: how, if at all, should federal, State, and local governments coordinate in carrying out the nation’s immigration policy? There is also a corollary question: to what extent may States and localities seeking federal grant money to facilitate the enforcement of their own laws adopt policies to extricate themselves from, hinder, or even frustrate the enforcement of federal immigration laws? At its core, this appeal presents questions of statutory construction. In proceedings below, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Edgardo Ramos, Judge) determined that the Attorney General was not statutorily authorized to impose the challenged conditions and, therefore, enjoined their application. See New York v. Dep’t of Justice, 343 F. Supp.
See U.S CONST. Amend X. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly observed, in the realm of immigration policy, it is the federal government that maintains “broad,” Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 394 (2012), and “preeminent,” power, Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 10 (1982), which is codified in an “extensive and complex” statutory scheme, Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. at
V. The Award of Summary Judgment to Plaintiffs On the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted partial judgment to plaintiffs, enjoining the enforcement of the challenged conditions as to them and mandating the release of 2017 Byrne grant funds to plaintiffs.
In the absence of any such Tenth Amendment concern, and in light of our holding that the challenged Certification Condition is statutorily authorized by 34 U.S.C. § 10153(a)(5)(D), we conclude that the condition does not violate either the APA or the Constitution. Accordingly, we vacate the district court’s injunction prohibiting application of the Certification Condition.
But unlike that court, we think the release information required by the Notice Condition is “programmatic,” at least for Byrne‐funded programs that relate in any way to the criminal prosecution, incarceration, or release of persons, some of whom will inevitably be aliens subject to removal.31 This includes most, if not all, of the programs for which plaintiffs seek Byrne funding, for example, (1) programs for task forces targeting certain crimes, the object of which is undoubtedly the arrest, prosecution, and eventual incarceration of perpetrators; (2) programs for prosecutors’ offices, whose attorneys decide when to pursue (or forego) the prosecution and incarceration 31 As this court observed in Cuomo v. Barr, 7 F.3d 17 (2d Cir. 1993), plaintiff “New York houses many illegal aliens in its prison system. As of March 1992, New York held approximately 60,000 prisoners in state correctional facilities, 8% of whom were known to be aliens and an additional 4% of whom were suspected to be aliens. Of this number, 6,096 had been convicted of aggravated felonies, making them subject to deportation.” Id. at

The plaintiffs alleged that the federal government violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by discriminating on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, and citizenship by denying them equal protection under the law.

228,IM-OK-0003,"On February 1, 2008, national, state and local chambers of commerce and other nonprofit organizations advocating for their members' business interests filed a lawsuit against the State of Oklahoma, claiming that Sections 7 and 9 of the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act, which impose tax penalties on businesses that don't check the work eligibility of all of their employees in a federal database and allow discharged employees to bring discrimination suits against their employers for employing unauthorized workers, were preempted by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act.
The Court granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on June 4, 2008, and on appeal to the Tenth Circuit the injunction was upheld except for as to the verification requirement. On remand to the District Court, the case was stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Whiting, which Supreme Court later held that an Arizona law requiring employers to use E-Verify was not preempted by federal law. Pursuant to this decision, the district court entered in a judgment on December 19th, 2012, holding that Oklahoma can require persons to contract with the State to use the employment authorization system. However, the provision creating a cause of action for discrimination against employers who terminate an authorized employee while retaining an unauthorized employee and the provision requiring businesses to verify individual independent contractors’ authorization status and creating a withholding for work performed by individual independent contractors, were both struck down.  ","Plaintiffs the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce and Associated Industries (d/b/a The State Chamber of Oklahoma), the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce, the Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce (d/b/a the Tulsa Metro Chamber), the Oklahoma Restaurant Association, and the Oklahoma Hotel and Lodging Association (collectively ""Plaintiffs""), by the undersigned attorneys, bring this civil action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and allege as follows:
Plaintiffs’ (varies Chamber of Commerce and business associations) have filed their Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against several State officials, all named only in their “official capacities.” Plaintiffs seek this Court’ s assistance to enjoin two sections of the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007 (“H.B. 1904"" or “the Act”) from being implemented. They allege section 7 (codified at 25 O.S. § 1313) and section 9 (codified at 68 O.S. § 2385.32) of that Act are preempted by federal law.
The “federalism” principles expressed in the Tax Injunction Act are merely an acknowledgment of a State's self- governing rights reflected in the Tenth Amendment. That Amendment prohibits the national government from exercising non-delegated powers that will infringe on the lawmaking autonomy of the states; it provides that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” U.S Const. amend X. “The Tenth Amendment was intended to confirm the understanding of the people at the time the Constitution was adopted, that powers not granted to the United States were reserved to the States or to the people.” United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716, 733 (1931).
9. The district court denied the motions to dismiss and granted the preliminary injunction. All defendants, save the Governor, appeal.
We have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to consider the district court’s denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity, P.R. Aqueduct Sewer Auth v. Metcalf Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147 (1993), and under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) to review the grant of a preliminary injunction. The panel dismisses in part, reverses in part, and affirms in part.
I This case requires us to consider the interplay between the federal employment verification regime and that of the Oklahoma Act. We begin by outlining these potentially-conflicting systems.
C Plaintiffs are various national, state, and local chambers of commerce and trade associations that represent businesses in Oklahoma. The Chambers filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging that Sections 7(B), 7(C), and 9 of the Oklahoma Act were expressly and impliedly preempted by federal law and thus unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. See U.S Const
867. The court stated: Congress could have, but did not, expressly forbid state laws from requiring [Basic Pilot Program] participation. It certainly knew how to do so because, at the same time, it did expressly forbid any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens Id. (quotation omitted). This is problematic because it implies that the presence of an express preemption provision precludes the possibility of implied preemption. But that is emphatically not the case. Geier, 529 U.S. at 869 (“We now conclude that the saving clause (like the express pre-emption provision) does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-emption principles.”). On the one hand, because Oklahoma has waived any argument that its Act is a licensing or other similar law, 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(h)(1); supra note 23, the Ninth Circuit’s opinion is distinguishable. On the other, we are unpersuaded by its reasoning.
9. The district court’s grant of summary judgment against the enforcement of Section 7(B) is REVERSED. In all other respects, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Plaintiffs’ motion to strike is GRANTED.

The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of sections 7(b), 7(c), and 9 of the Act. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion to strike, and the district court's grant of summary judgment against the enforcement of Sections 7(B) and 7(C) is overturned.","The Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007 (H.B. 1904) was passed in 2007 by the Oklahoma legislature and signed into law by the Governor of Oklahoma. The plaintiffs filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on behalf of the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce and the Oklahoma City and Tulsa chambers of commerce and trade associations. They alleged that sections 7(B), 7(C), and 9 of the Act were preempted by federal law and thus unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. The district court denied the defendants' motions to dismiss and granted the preliminary injunction. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's denial of summary judgment against the enforcement of the sections of the act. The case is now closed."

230,IM-TX-0032,"On August 23, 2012, ICE Agents and the State of Mississippi filed claims alleging that deferred action Directive commands ICE officers to violate federal law, compels them to violate their oaths of office, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (""APA""), unconstitutionally usurps and encroaches upon the legislative powers of Congress, as defined in Article I of the United States Constitution, and violates the obligation of the executive branch to faithfully execute the law, as required by Article II, Section 3, of the United States Constitution. On January 24, 2013, the Court found that ICE Agent Plaintiffs had standing to proceed, but the State of Mississippi did not. On July 31, 2013, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's claims without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, finding that the dispute must be governed by the Civil Service Reform Act. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court.","H.R. 1275, 110th Cong. (2007); S.
In sum, the Court finds that Mississippi’s asserted fiscal injury is purely speculative because there is no concrete evidence that the costs associated with the presence of illegal aliens in the state of Mississippi have increased or will increase as a result of the Directive or the Morton Memorandum. See Wyoming, 674 F.3d at 1231–35 (Wyoming’s alleged loss of tax revenue from a reduced number of snowmobiles in parks was conclusory and based on “speculative economic data,” and therefore insufficient to confer standing. Wyoming did not present any “concrete evidence” that “revenues have decreased or will decrease” with the challenged rule in place.). Accordingly, the Court finds that Mississippi has failed to allege an injury-in-fact sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirements of standing. The state of Mississippi’s claims are therefore DISMISSED without prejudice to refiling.
30. The Court concludes that venue is appropriate in the Northern District of Texas. In civil actions against “an officer or employee of the United States or an agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal authority,” venue is appropriate in the district where “the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.” 28 U.S.C. § 2391(e)(1)(C).
Appeals from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.
Plaintiffs–Appellants are several Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and deportation officers (collectively referred to as ‘‘Agents’’) and the State of Mississippi. They filed this suit against the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the directors of departments within that agency (collectively referred to as ‘‘DHS’’), in their official capacities, challenging DHS’s 2012 directive, which requires its officials to use ‘‘deferred action’’ as to a certain class of aliens in immigration removal proceedings. The Agents allege that exercising deferred action violates federal law, because the law requires them to detain all illegal aliens for the purpose of placing the aliens in removal proceedings. The State of Mississippi alleges that the deferred action has caused additional aliens to remain in the state and, thus, causes the state to spend money on providing social services. The district court dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We conclude that neither the Agents nor the State of Mississippi has demonstrated the concrete and particularized injury required to give them standing to maintain this suit. We therefore affirm the district court’s judgment.
Next, the district court proceeded with the Agents’ remaining claims and conducted an evidentiary hearing on their petition for a preliminary injunction. The court did not rule on the preliminary injunction because an outstanding jurisdictional question existed as to whether the Agents had exhausted their administrative remedies before proceeding to federal court. Ultimately, the district court determined that the Agents had not pursued their remedies under the Civil Service Reform Act, and, thus, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over these claims. The court dismissed the remainder of the Agents’ claims. This appeal followed.

The plaintiffs sought damages and an injunction preventing the defendants from detaining the plaintiffs solely based on a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an immigration hold, or an immigration detainer. Over time, the case was consolidated with two other lawsuits with identical claims. The state of Texas also intervened as a defendant.

It is insulting to the people and leaders of El Paso that the Texas Legislature continues to erode the policy decision-making and sovereignty of local communities based on irrational, unfounded “fears” of immigrants.

It is for these reasons and more, that El Paso files this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
6. TOPEF is an education organization based in San Antonio, Houston and Dallas. More than half of TOPEF’s employees and the people they serve identify as Latino; many are from immigrant, mixed-status families. As an organization, TOPEF will be particularly injured by SB 4’s unconstitutional provisions and harms, including racial profiling.
15. Uniquely, El Paso is under a federal court settlement agreement where it created a policy prohibiting the enforcement of civil immigration laws. El Paso also has adopted policies, which may violate SB 4’s unconstitutional mandates. Specifically, the El Paso County Attorney’s office has adopted a policy that prohibits its investigators from making inquiries into the citizenship or residency status for the purpose of determining whether an individual has violated civil immigration law or for the purpose of enforcing those laws.

58. In El Paso, residents have suffered from illegal intrusions into their lives. One example is referred to locally as “the Bowie High School incident.” During the morning of November 9, 1991, Benjamin Murillo, Coach of the Bowie High School football team, and Isaac Villalva and Cesar Soto, members of the Bowie High School varsity football team, drove to neighboring high school to watch the junior varsity football game between Bowie High School and Jefferson High School. Two El Paso Border Patrol Agents stopped their vehicle. One of the El Paso Border Patrol Agents approached the car and pointed a pistol at the head of Coach Murillo. The agents searched the car without probable cause or consent. The students were questioned about their national origin and immigration status. These children and their coach were stopped solely because of their Hispanic descent. The subsequent lawsuit found that the agents violated the civil rights of the students and their coach.
59. This case and many others have typified the relationship between immigration enforcement and Mexican Americans in Texas, and in El Paso County specifically. This unequal enforcement is based on racial classification or national origin animus.
88. The State of Texas has sued several public officials and a non-profit organization, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), seemingly based on their public statements that SB 4 is unconstitutional. MALDEF is not a policy maker nor has any governmental control of any policy or procedure that would be implicated by SB 4’s mandates or prohibitions. Instead, MALDEF was sued based by the State of Texas based solely on their policy advocacy against SB

However, ICE regularly exceeds its statutory authority in issuing detainers without a warrant, without a notice to appear, without a final order of removal, and without providing the affected individual notice about the immigration detainer. ICE's detainer practice exceeds the authority granted to it under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).

235,IM-UT-0002,"This is one in a series of cases challenging comprehensive state immigration laws. In this case, a coalition of immigrant rights groups and individual immigrants challenged Utah's law, HB 497, on preemption grounds and as a violation of equal protection, the right to travel, and the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. A preemption case brought by the Department of Justice was later consolidated with this case. In 2011, the District Court for the District of Utah has issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the statute. Following the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Arizona, the Court ruled on the motions for preliminary injunctions in June 2014 and ruled against the key provisions of HB 497. In November 2014, the parties filed a joint report, in which the State of Utah agreed to permanently scrap the key problematic provisions of HB 497. On December 4, 2014, the Court entered a judgment per the parties' proposed final agreement and dismissed the remaining claims without prejudice. The parties settled on attorney fees and costs and the case closed. ","1. This action challenges Utah’s immigration enforcement law, House 4 Bill (“HB”) 497.
18. Plaintiff Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) is one of 24 the largest labor organizations in the world, representing 2.2 million working men 25 and women employed primarily in the public sector and in the janitorial, health 26 services, long-term care, and security industries. Many of SEIU’s members are 1 2 recent immigrants to the United States and many of its members are racial 3 minorities. SEIU has long called for and worked toward comprehensive reform of 4 U.S. immigration laws. Another priority for SEIU is fighting discrimination 5 against minorities, women, and other groups in the workplace and in society. In 6 Utah, SEIU has a local affiliate, Workers’ United Rocky Mountain Joint Board 7 (“Rocky Mountain Joint Board”) (see 19, infra). This affiliate has approximately 8 70 members in the state, over 50 percent of whom are Latino. SEIU works in 9 partnership with Workers’ United Rocky Mountain Joint Board and other groups 10 to combat discrimination and advocate for immigration reform at the national 11 level. Because so many of SEIU members are public sector employees, the impact 12 of HB 497 on already distressed county and municipal budgets will harm SEIU’s 13 members to the extent that it will result in further pay cuts, furloughs, and layoffs. 14 Furthermore, some of SEIU’s Latino members and their families have already 15 been subjected to stops by local law enforcement, during which they have been 16 asked to produce proof of immigration status. SEIU is concerned that its minority 17 members in Utah, including U.S. citizens and lawful immigrants as well as 18 undocumented immigrants, will be even more likely to be stopped, detained, 19 arrested, and questioned by state and local police after HB 497 goes into effect. 20 This will cause hardship for members of SEIU. In addition, SEIU is concerned 21 that members and potential members, regardless of nationality and immigration 22 status, will refrain from exercising their rights to attend rallies, demonstrations, 23 and union meetings or to engage in leafleting or other traditional labor activities 24 because of the possibility of being stopped by police under HB
20. Plaintiff Centro Civico Mexicano (“Centro”) is the oldest nonprofit 25 Latino organization in Utah. Centro serves the Latino community in the Salt Lake 26 Valley by offering educational, cultural, social, and athletic activities and by 2 fostering greater appreciation and awareness of the rich heritage and history of 3 Mexican and other Latino cultures. Centro has a community center where 4 educational, cultural, social, and athletic activities are held. The large majority of 5 individuals who use Centro’s facilities are Latino immigrants. Since HB 497 was 6 first introduced in the Utah legislature, Centro has had to divert significant 7 organizational resources to respond to its members’ concerns about the law. This 8 has taken valuable staff time away from other priority issues and work for Centro.
81.

This case arises out of the death of Martin Harrison while he was in the custody of the 3 Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. Plaintiffs Joseph, Krystle, Martin, Jr., and Tiffany Harrison are 4 Mr. Harrison’s adult children. They assert claims for violation of Mr. Harrison’s civil rights 5 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and California’s Bane Act, Cal Civ. Code § 52.1, as well as 6 common law claims against: the County of Alameda; Sheriff Gregory J. Ahern in his official 7 capacity; Sheriff’s Deputies Matthew Ahlf, Alejandro Valverde, Joshua Swetnam, Roberto 8 Martinez, Zachary Litvinchuk, Ryan Madigan, Michael Bareno, Fernando Rojas-Castaneda, 9 Shawn Sobrero, and Solomon Unubun; Megan Hast, A.S.W., a social worker employed by 10 Criminal Justice Mental Health (“CJMH”), an Alameda County employer; Corizon Health, Inc.
5 Id. 52:9–18. Ahlf testified that he could typically find out about an inmate’s medical history by 6 “calling the charge nurse and having his file pulled.” Id. 52:23–25. During this encounter, 7 Harrison asked for medications, and the pill call nurse did not find that any were prescribed for 8 him. Deputy Ahlf issued Harrison a sick call slip and told Harrison he could fill it out and provide 9 it to the nurse for follow-up Id. 53:8–15. Harrison did so. His sick call slip states only “I was 10 told to” as the reason for a visit. Sherwin Decl., Ex. 19 at PLF
The parties also agree that a viable excessive force claim precludes summary judgment 11 with respect to Plaintiffs’ assault and battery claims against the Sheriff’s Deputies. For the same United States District Court Northern District of California 12 reason, the Court will deny summary judgment on those claims. See, e.g., id. at 1166–67; The County also argues that it is immune from vicarious liability for the Sheriff’s 14 Deputies’ conduct. That is not the case. Under the California Tort Claims Act, Cal. Gov’t Code, 15 § 810 et seq., a public entity is not liable for injury arising from an act or omission except as 16 provided by statute. Section 815.2(a) provides that “[a] public entity is liable for injury 17 proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of 18 his employment if the act or omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of 19 action against that employee[.]” Cal.

245,JC-CA-0132,"In 2016, prisoners in the Santa Clara County Jail System filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs alleged that the jail facilities were not accessible to inmates with mobility disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and state law. In 2019, the parties jointly settled the case under a consent decree which would force Santa Clara County to make its jails accessible. The case is ongoing","87. Elmwood’s recreational facilities are also inaccessible for inmates with mobility 2 disabilities. For example, Plaintiff COLE could not wheel himself to Elmwood’s large yard 3 because the path of travel was too uneven and the pavement was broken in places, requiring him 4 to ask a fellow inmate to push him. The yard itself was not accessible to him because it is one 5 big grassy area with bumpy and uneven dirt paths. Additionally, a curb leading to the yard and 6 the absence of ramps prevented safe access to the yard. The inmate helping him tried to back 7 Plaintiff COLE’s wheelchair over the curb into the grass and dirt, causing Plaintiff COLE to 8 nearly fall out of his wheelchair. Ultimately, Plaintiff COLE had to stay in his wheelchair on the 9 grass. Plaintiff WILLIAMS has experienced similar barriers. Plaintiff WILLIAMS has also 10 experienced barriers accessing the special housing unit yard due to lack of an accessible path of 11 travel and lack of accessible exercise equipment.
90. The Elmwood Women’s Facility is also not accessible. According to the Report, 21 typical barriers found at the Elmwood Women’s Facility include: (1) showers that are 22 inaccessible due to curbs, lack of grab bars, lack of shower seats, and lack of spray hose; (2) 23 inaccessible toilets and lavatories due to lack of grab bars, the improper positioning of toilets in a 24 manner that fails to provide adequate clearance for a person with a mobility disability, and 25 toilets and lavatories which are not provided at the correct height; (3) inaccessible faucets at 26 lavatories; and (4) lack of knee space at tables in the day room to allow for a wheelchair user.

County of Santa Clara, United States District Court, Northern District of California, Case Number 3:16-cv-06594 LHK (hereinafter, “Action”) alleging that Defendant has discriminated against individuals with mobility disabilities incarcerated in Santa Clara County's (“the County”) Main Jail North, Main Jail South, and Elmwood Correctional Facility (collectively, “the Jails”) in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Rehabilitation Act”); 29 U.S.C. § 794; and California Government Code Section 11135 (“Section 11135”) (collectively, “State and Federal Disability Laws”).

246,JC-CA-0133,"In 2018, female prisoners at the Santa Rita Jail filed this class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants’ policy of keeping the lights on for 24 hours and other conduct that disrupt the inmates’ sleep violated their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments by denying the basic human right to sleep and serving as a cruel and unusual punishment. As of July 2020, settlement negotiations are in progress.","2. Alameda County Jails consists of two facilities, Glen Dyer Jail in Oakland and Santa Rita 6 Jail in Dublin. Women, including pregnant women are held only at the Santa Rita Jail. Pregnant women are housed with other prisoners. The conditions described herein apply equally to pregnant prisoners. 7
4. Prisoners at the Santa Rita Jail suffer from chronic deprivation of sleep and disturbance of 19 sleep. This ongoing, daily sleep deprivation and disturbance has created significant negative impacts on 20 prisoners’ abilities to function at many levels. Prisoners are negatively impacted cognitively, 21 functionally, and psychiatrically. Cognitive impairment adversely impacts pretrial prisoners’ ability to 22 assist in their legal defense. Prisoners’ overall health and immune systems are negatively impacted 23 resulting in health issues including bacterial and viral infections. Pregnant women are subject to more 24 significant negative health impacts from sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation creates higher levels of pro-inflammatory serum that are associated with postpartum depression and preterm delivery. 25
7. This civil rights class action lawsuit seeks to end this long-standing unconstitutional practice at both Alameda County Jail facilities. The individual Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of 10 themselves and those similarly situated against Defendants COUNTY OF ALAMEDA (“County”); THE 11
19. Plaintiff, TIKISHA UPSHAW, TYREKA STEWART and ANDREA HERNANDEZ are 21 pretrial detainees housed at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, California, in Alameda County and under the authority of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. 22
73. The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class. The claims of the 4 class members arise from the actions that resulted in damages to the class representatives and are based 5 on the same legal theories.
75. The Pregnant Prisoner -Sub Class is sufficiently numerous that joinder of all members of 12 the class is impracticable and unfeasible. On information and believe, plaintiffs allege that 10% of all 13 women prisoners in Santa Rita are pregnant, so that the current sub-class numbers 20 women. Within a 14 year’s time, plaintiffs assert that Santa Rita Jail processes and houses approximately 950 pregnant 15 women. Pregnant women are housed amongst all the other prisoners. There is no separate facility for pregnant women. Pregnant women are subject to the same schedules and same housing conditions as all 16 prisoners. All prisoners in the Jails are subject to Defendants policies and procedures regarding sleep 17 19 practices.
76. The jail is required to conduct pregnancy tests if requested or if the prisoner exhibits 21 symptoms of pregnancy. The Pregnant Prisoner Sub-Class members are identifiable using records 22 maintained in the ordinary course of business by Defendants.
7. The injunction will remain in effect pending further order of the Court.
Case No. 3:18-cv-07814-JD ORDER RE MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION Re: Dkt No. 19 Plaintiffs are women pretrial detainees housed in jails maintained and operated by 14 defendants Alameda County and the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. Plaintiffs brought a class 15 action complaint under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 alleging that defendants violated their 16 constitutional rights through jail procedures that deprived them of a minimal level of nightly sleep.
19. The request for an injunction is granted in part.
The merits determination here is made in the context of plaintiffs’ status as state pretrial 17 detainees. The parties focused almost entirely on the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and 18 unusual punishment for those convicted of an offense, but plaintiffs are not in jail after a trial and 19 conviction. As pretrial detainees, they are entitled to the protections of the Due Process Clause in 20 the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the specific substantive guarantees of the federal 21 Constitution. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535-37 and n.16 (1979); Pierce v Cnty. of Orange, 22 526 F.3d 1190, 1205 (9th Cir. 2008). The Eighth Amendment establishes a constitutional floor in 23 the sense that a jail condition deemed to be cruel and unusual would necessarily amount to an 24 impermissible punishment of a pretrial detainee, but plaintiffs have rights beyond those afforded 25 to the duly convicted. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects a broader 26 class of interests than the Eighth Amendment, and proscribes any conduct that amounts to 27 punishment, cruel or otherwise, of a person detained before trial.

247,JC-CA-0137,"On November 11, 2019 prisoners at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, California filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, the California Forensic Medical Group and Aramark Correctional Services under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, 1983, and 1988. The plaintiffs claimed that defendants acted in violation of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that Santa Rita’s unsanitary confinement conditions, wrongful denials of attorney visits, failure to provide medical care, and retaliation against inmates for speaking out and filing grievances violated these constitutional rights. The case is ongoing.","12. Plaintiffs are all former or current prisoners incarcerated at the Santa Rita Jail. All 17 Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of male imprisoned at the Santa Rita Jail at any time since 18 November 12, 2017, two years prior to the date of filing of the Original Complaint in this action.
28. In addition, joinder is impracticable because, upon information and belief, many members 16 of the class are not aware of the fact that their constitutional rights were violated and that they 17 have the right to seek redress in court. Many members of the class are without the means to retain 18 an attorney to represent them in a civil rights lawsuit. There is no appropriate avenue for the 19 protection of the class members’ constitutional rights other than a class action.
46. Even with “clean” laundry, the “clean” clothing is frequently not very clean, having been 6 improperly laundered. This is due to the insufficient washing machines at the jail. Jail laundry 7 workers, in order to meet their work loads, have to overstuff the washing machines, which results 8 in insufficient water and soap, and laundry which is not properly laundered. Furthermore, jail 9 laundry workers are required to do the sheets and towels and other linens from the coroners’ office, 10 which are often soaked in human bodily fluids. At times these linens even have body parts 11 wrapped within. While these linens are transported in bags clearly marked as “biohazard”, these 12 linens are given to jail laundry workers, who have no protective clothing, no training in handling 13 biohazardous human wastes, and are washed in the same jail washing machines.
77. In 2017, the women prisoners at Santa Rita Jail filed a class action lawsuit against the jail 22 for similar issues. For a period of time, women prisoners, who work the graveyard shift at the 23 kitchen, were organized into cleaning crews, and crews were assigned to clean the various parts of 24 the jail. For the past two months, this situation has reverted. The cleaning crews have been 25 disbanded. The new Aramark staff person no longer has access to the cleaning supplies. There is 26 only one woman prisoner assigned to cleaning, and she given only dishwashing liquid and a 27 squeegee to clean the kitchen floor.
96. Kyle Murphy was incarcerated at Santa Rita Jail. At the time of the incident, he was 6 pretrial and in minimum security. One day Kyle started having seizures. Men in his cell pushed 7 the emergency button. Defendant Technician Kaiser was on duty, and said, “Don’t hit the button” 8 and then apparently turned the button off. Men in Kyle’s cell started yelling “man down”, and 9 soon all of the six cells started yelling “man down”. It took 30-40 minutes for a Sheriff deputy to 10 appear. After visually examining Kyle, the Sheriff Deputy left, and it took another 15 -20 minutes 11 before a male nurse arrived. The nurse came, assessed the situation and gave Kyle a dose of 12 Narcan. That had no effect, so the nurse then left to get oxygen. The nurse returned with an 13 oxygen mask and can, and proceeded to try and apply oxygen to Kyle. The male nurse was not 14 well trained and did not know how to use the oxygen tank and mask. The mask apparently was 15 cutting off all outside oxygen to Kyle, but oxygen was not flowing from the tank. Kyle started to 16 turn blue. Men in the cell started getting upset, and many of them were screaming “he’s dying”.
135. These deputies then proceeded to question Plaintiff Garrett about the incident with 5 Technician Kaiser, asserting that there had been no sex harassment, that the statement “Suck My 6 Dick” was a common, ordinary statement, and that Plaintiff Garrett had not felt “sexually 7 threatened.” They asked him to withdraw his complaint. These deputies stated, “We have to 8 protect our own.” Plaintiff Garrett asked if the deputies’ body cams were on, when they said the 9 body cams were not on, Plaintiff Garrett then asked for a lawyer and the questioning stopped. 10

Plaintiffs sought habeas corpus, injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. 

The district court granted class certification and partially granted a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which mandated more social distancing, providing for more PPE, and improved sanitation policies. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, and applied in both the district court and the Ninth Circuit to stay the case in the lower court until the appeals court had ruled. Both denied these applications, however the Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court saying that the defendants could try to modify the injunction if there were any changed circumstances. Defendants did so, but the district court denied any modifications once again. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which likewise rejected the defendants' motion. Finally, the defendants went to the Supreme Court and asked them to stay the injunction while the Ninth Circuit heard the case on the merits. The Supreme Court obliged on August 5, staying the injunction.

36. The District will pay up to $2.9 million to SCMs as detailed below.
45. The District will pay up to $75,000 for a group of three third-party reviewers to review all claims made by SCMs. The parties will both solicit applications for third-party reviewers from among persons with expertise who are not former employees of the D.C. Department of Corrections. All applicants must be willing to perform the review for twentyeight dollars ($28.00) per hour. From among eligible applicants, the District will select one third-party reviewer, and the Plaintiffs will select the second. The two selected third-party reviewers will then select the third individual. In performing the review, each reviewer will be randomly assigned jackets from potential SCMs for a first review. If the first reviewer concludes that the SCM has a valid claim, that ruling will stand. If the first reviewer concludes that the SCM does not have a valid claim, the other two reviewers will also review that SCMs jacket. The ruling by the majority of the three reviewers will then be final. In the event $75,000 proves insufficient to complete the review of claims, the District will utilize the following sources of funds, in order, until review is complete: (1) any funds remaining from the $250,000 allocated for Class Administration; (2) any funds remaining from the $425,000 estimated for plaintiffs’ costs; (3) the $475,000 allocated for inmate-processing at the DOC.
1. You should read this notice because you may be entitled to claim money from a class action settlement. The purpose of this notice is to inform you about a proposed settlement in the Barnes lawsuit. The settlement may affect the rights of certain people who were incarcerated in facilities operated by the District of Columbia’s Department of Corrections. The settlement is not final. In order for the settlement to be final, the judge in this case, the Honorable Royce Lamberth, will hear from class members who wish to be heard and will then decide if the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers believe that this Agreement is fair, reasonable, adequate, and is in the best interest of the class because it provides compensation for past injuries, while acknowledging that the DOC has substantially eliminated the problems the lawsuit was intended to address. Although Defendant denies that it has committed any wrongdoing, it believes that further litigation would be protracted, expensive, and contrary to its best interests.

The D.C. Circuit has spoken unequivocally. Even assuming all facts alleged by the Fourth Amendment class as true, the claims addressed in Bame and the instant case cannot be distinguished in any meaningful way. Obviously, the Court must reconsider and modify its prior ruling that Marshal Dillard is not entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claims, see Order Denying Defs.’ Mots. to Dismiss [Dkt. 81], in light of the D.C. Circuit’s decision. Marshal Dillard is entitled to qualified immunity against the claims that he violated Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, which spoke solely to the Fourth Amendment claims, will be denied, and summary judgment will be entered for Marshal Dillard.
10 The Fifth Amendment provides that “[no] person shall be... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S CONST. amend X. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to the District of Columbia, which is a political entity created by the federal government, but the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment has been held to impose the same equal protection restrictions on the federal government and D.C. as the Fourteenth Amendment does on the States. Propert v. District of Columbia, 948 F.2d 1327, 1330 n.5 (D.C Cir. 1991) (citing Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954)); Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 234 (1979). “To withstand scrutiny under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, ‘classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.’” Davis, 442 U.S. at 234–35 (quoting Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 316–317 (1977)). “The equal protection component of the Due Process Clause thus confers on petitioner a federal constitutional right to be free from gender discrimination which cannot meet these requirements.” Id. at 235–36.
For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs Donna Curtis, Dianne Johnson, and Carolyn Montgomery will be dismissed without prejudice. Summary judgment will be denied to Plaintiffs on their Fourth Amendment claims and granted to Marshal Dillard on the Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims.

Following class certification, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the District. Believing that the Superior Court Marshal is a federal official who acted at all times under color of federal law, and that the District therefore had no choice but to turn pre-presentment arrestees over to the Marshal, the court concluded that the District could not be held liable for any unconstitutional acts of the Marshal Id. at 90–93.","The District of Columbia and former U.S. Marshal for the D.C.

As a result, the plaintiff could not participate in the court-ordered rehabilitation services offered by the jail. The D.C. jail later placed the plaintiff in voluntary solitary confinement without communicating to him that his solitary confinement was voluntary. The court found in favor of the plaintiff on summary judgment and a subsequent jury trail awarded him $70,000 in damages. ","1. This is an action for damages and other relief by William Pierce, who was denied equal access to programs, services and activities of the District of Columbia because of the absence of accommodations for deaf inmates at the District of Columbia’s Correctional Treatment Facility, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Defendant District of Columbia intentionally discriminated against Mr. Pierce on the basis of his disability by denying him adequate and effective means to communicate with individuals both inside the jail and by telephone with individuals outside the jail. The defendant also retaliated against him for seeking accommodation to which he was entitled Mr. Pierce seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and other appropriate relief.
8. The Correctional Treatment Facility is a medium security facility in the District of Columbia that incarcerates male and female inmates. In 1997, the Corrections Corporation of America (“CCA”), a private prison company, entered into a 20-year contract with the District of Columbia to operate, maintain and manage the Correctional Treatment Facility as an annex to the D.C Jail. That contract obligates CCA to operate the Correctional Treatment Facility in compliance with the Constitution and the laws of the United States and the District of Columbia. CCA is required to provide for all aspects of incarceration, including, but not limited to, staffing, medical and mental health care, religious services, and vocational, therapeutic and substance abuse programming.
9. The District of Columbia is required to provide reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. 10.
51. Defendant’s retaliation against Mr. Pierce for asserting his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act violated his rights under those Acts.
Plaintiff’s motion granted in part, and defendant’s motion denied.
First of all, this Court’s decision is well within the scope of the issues that were presented in the pleadings and cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff’s complaint brings claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”) that are based on Defendant’s alleged failure to provide accommodations to Plaintiff—who is profoundly deaf—in accordance with the requirements of those statutes. (See Compl., ECF No. 1, 1, 9, 15, 49, 50.) At summary judgment, Plaintiff repeatedly argued that Defendant had an “affirmative” obligation to provide accommodations for Plaintiff under the ADA and the RA. (See Pl.’s Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 58, at 8, 10 (emphasis in original); see also Pl.’s Reply Mem. in Further Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 66, at 5, 17, 19.) Moreover, from the outset, Plaintiff maintained that Defendant’s statutory obligation included the duty to “take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with [inmates] with disabilities are as effective as communications with others.” (Compl. 10 (quoting 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(a)(1)); see also Pl.’s Mem. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 47-2, at 12, 27; Pl.’s Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Mot. for Summ J. at 6, 11, 24, 27; Pl.’s Reply Mem. in Further Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 66, at 13.) These claims and their supporting arguments clearly raised the question of what, if anything, the ADA and RA and their accompanying regulations require of prisons regarding the provision of accommodations for deaf inmates. Moreover, at the hearing this Court held on the parties’ cross-motions, Plaintiff’s counsel specifically described what, in his view, the law requires prison officials to do when a plainly disabled inmate such as Plaintiff is taken into custody. (See Transcript of Summary Judgment Motion Hearing (“Motion for SJ Transcript”), ECF No. 80, at 38 (explaining that “when Mr.","A hearing-disabled inmate sued the District of Columbia for discrimination under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Pierce is entitled to summary judgment and compensatory damages on Claims I and II of his complaint.","A deaf inmate sued the District of Columbia for discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.

On September 4, 2009, in the present case, Case No. 8:09-cv-1891-T-17TBM, Plaintiffs Michael Lindsey Gambuzza and Christopher Scott Drescher filed a pro se 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint alleging violation of their constitutional rights when Defendants opened legal mail and implemented the new mail policy allowing only post-card mail to be received. They also claimed that the Defendants censored the newspaper so that inmates at MCJ were not allowed to read all of the newspaper.
On October 26, 2009, the Court appointed pro bono counsel to represent Plaintiffs.

The Complaint seeks to enjoin the Defendants from enforcing the “post-card only” mail policy.
A review of the case law on the issue of post-card only inmate mail, including a case in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, convinces the Court that the present Complaint lacks an arguable basis in law because the Courts have found that the post-card only mail policy is “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Thornburgh v.

254,JC-GA-0016,"In 1999, inmates at the Foster County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia, who had tested positive for HIV, filed this class action lawsuit against county officials.  The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Center for Human Rights, brought the suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  In 2000, the parties reached a settlement agreement that required improved medical care and reduced overcrowding.  ","4. On March 1, 1999, Grady Hospital ceased providing treatment to HIV-positive inmates confined at the Fulton County Jail. As a result, the medical staff at the Jail, which had already failed miserably to follow the regimens prescribed by the Grady infectious disease clinic, is now solely responsible for examining HIV-positive inmates and planning and carrying out their treatment regimens. The County and CHS staff continue to deprive inmates of minimally adequate treatment. As a result, people charged with even minor offenses, and even those who are innocent, may be condemned to a death sentence as a result of the grossly inadequate medical care at the Jail.
17. Defendant Fulton County, Georgia (“the County”), is the governmental unit responsible under state law for properly maintaining, operating, and funding the Jail. O.C.G.A. § 42-5-2. As such, the County has a duty to provide medical care to inmates in the care and custody of the Jail.
22. Defendant Correctional Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (“CHS”) is a private company incorporated in Pennsylvania. CHS is under contract with Fulton County to provide all necessary medical care to inmates at the Jail. Pursuant to this “Health Care Services Agreement,” CHS is specifically obligated to “establish a clinic on-site for chronic illnesses and diseases.” The contract requires that “[t]reatment prescribed for HIV+ and AIDS shall be reviewed for adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standards and court ordered protocol.”
28. Defendants Fulton County, the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, Kenn, Webster, Lowe, Fulton, Darnell, Boxill, Barrett, Briggs, Herron, Ramos, Minerve, Ikoku, the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, the Authority Board of Trustees, Steed, Brown, Shepherd, Adam Smith, Hagy, Otis Smith, Sloan, Glenn, Coleman, Malcolm, and Renford are the final decisionmakers for the policies and customs challenged in this lawsuit.
36. The named plaintiffs in this case are six inmates currently at the Fulton County Jail (“the Jail”) who are HIV-positive and whose lives are threatened by the denial of minimal medical care to which they are entitled.
40. Fulton County (“the County”) has chosen to provide medical care, including HIV- related care, to inmates at the Jail by contracting with Correctional Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (“CHS”), a private correctional medical care company. In every aspect of the medical care delivered at the Jail, the Fulton County and CHS defendants have failed disastrously to meet the minimum medical requirements previously outlined. As a result, plaintiffs have experienced and continue to experience extreme and unnecessary pain, suffering, and accelerated progression of their disease towards AIDS and death.
75. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies available to them. Numerous inmate grievances have failed to result in any improvement in the treatment of HIV-positive inmates at the Fulton County Jail. For example, in October 1998, plaintiff Foster along with fifteen other HIV-positive inmates in the Jail’s chronic care unit (including the now-deceased Ricky Turner), submitted a comprehensive administrative complaint describing the desperately inadequate medical care they were receiving. They received no reply to the numerous issues they raised in the complaint. Defendants do not offer administrative remedies sufficient to correct the immediate and severe medical crisis and the suffering and death it is causing to plaintiffs and others.

32. In December 2014 Terry Clayton was a pretrial detainee in the Marion County Jail awaiting trial.
Mr. Clayton was a pretrial detainee at the Jail from May 28, 2014 to December 10, 2014.
The Plaintiffs claim their illegal detention is the result of various policies and practices instituted by the Sheriff, which include: (1) “operating under a standard of seventy-two hours to release prisoners who are ordered released” (Filing No. 38, Third Amended Complaint 87); (2) the “employment of a computer system inadequate for the purposes intended with respect to the timely release of prisoners” (id. 88); (3) “re- arresting and imprisoning individuals who are released on their own recognizance, found not guilty or acquitted, or who have had their criminal charges vacated or dismissed” (id. 89); (4) “not accepting cash or surety bonds but instead outsourcing the payment and processing of these bonds to the Marion County Clerk” (id. 90); and (5) “not releasing inmates at the conclusion of their sentences, but rather keeping them in jail until Community Corrections1 is ‘ready’ to process them as a group” (id. 84). They seek to certify a class of all individuals who, from December 19, 2012, to the present, were held in confinement by the Sheriff after legal authority for those detentions ceased. They also seek to certify five subclasses based on each of the five alleged policies and practices set forth above II. Rule 23 Requirements Class action suits are governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
ROVNER, Circuit Judge. The plaintiffs in this case brought a class action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the policies and practices of the Marion County Sheriff’s Depart- No. 16-4239 ment and the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and Marion County (collectively referred to as the “Sheriff”) caused them to be detained in the Marion County Jail awaiting release for an unreasonably long period of time, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought to certify five subclasses in that action, and the district court granted certification as to two of those subclasses, but denied it as to the remaining three. The plaintiffs then filed a petition in this court seeking permission to appeal the denial of two of those class certifications pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f). Specifically, the plaintiffs contested the court’s denial of two classes, consisting of all individuals who, from December 19, 2012 to the present, were held in confinement by the Sheriff after legal authority for those detentions ceased, due to: (1) the Sheriff’s practice of operating under a standard of allowing up to 72 hours to release prisoners who are ordered released; and (2) the Sheriff’s practice of employing a computer system inadequate for the purposes intended with respect to the timely release of prisoners.
We granted permission for the interlocutory appeal pursuant to Rule 23(f), and now proceed to the appeal on the merits. We hold that the district court erred in its decision denying class certification and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
The class sought by the plaintiffs consisted of all individuals who, from December 19, 2012 to the present, were victims of the computer issues spawned by OMS. The district court denied certification of the subclass because it held that the class was not “identifiable.” The court noted that the class description must be sufficiently definite to allow ascertainment of the class members Dist. Ct Op. at 12 citing Alliance to End Repression v. Rockford, 565 F.2d 975, 977 (7th Cir. 1977). It held that “[t]he definition of the subclass that Plaintiffs advance is problematic because the technical issues plaguing OMS is one of the overriding reasons for the over-detention of the entire class. As such, the court is not convinced it is a policy or practice from which this subclass can be anchored.” [emphasis in original] Dist Ct
The decision of the district court is VACATED and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

258,JC-KY-0006,"Built in 1991, the Campbell County Detention Center was designed to hold 135 prisoners. It quickly became overcrowded.

Many of the inmates were awaiting transfer to the Kentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC), which was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit.  The KDOC addressed overcrowding at the jail by simply reducing the required floor space for each prisoner from 50 to 40 square feet. This lawsuit, filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by attorney Robert B. Newman of the Cincinnati, Ohio, law firm Newman & Meeks, alleged the overcrowding violated the prisoners' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

exposures [to COVID-19] and protect them with preventative measures. They are the highest risk and would need testing guided by the health department directions.” Doc. 36-21 at
This case concerns the health, welfare, and safety of detained individuals housed at the Prince George’s County Correctional Center (“the Facility”) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Court concludes it does. The PLRA, by its plain terms, reaches all “prospective relief in any civil action brought with respect to prison conditions.” 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a) (1997) (emphasis added). This includes actions brought by pretrial detainees challenging conditions of their pretrial detention. See id. § 3626(g)(3) (defining “prisoner” to include “any person subject to... detention...who is accused of...violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program.”); and (g)(5) (“prison” defined as “any Federal, State, or local facility that incarcerates or detains juveniles or adults accused of... violations of criminal law”).
201. The lockdown policy includes no accommodations for detainees with serious mental health conditions. The Jail detains numerous people who have mental illnesses, including psychotic illness, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder. Some detainees are currently part of a special mental health docket for the court, and some are awaiting competency evaluations or have been deemed incompetent. They too are locked in their cells for 22 or 23 hours per day.
(a) The Released Plaintiffs’ claims are moot; (b) Plaintiffs failed to exhaust the administrative grievance procedures available at the Prince George’s County detention facility (the “Facility”); (c) Plaintiffs’ over-detention claim fails to state a claim for relief; (d) Plaintiffs’ habeas petition fails to state a claim for relief; (e) Count IV fails to state a claim pursuant to § 1983 based on the Facility’s lockdown measures; (f) The Amended Complaint fails to state a due process claim; and (g) The Amended Complaint fails to state a claim for injunctive relief. For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint is due to be dismissed.
266. “Plaintiffs’ habeas claim, at its core, is a challenge to prison conditions.” (Doc No. 84 at 18). Thus, Plaintiffs’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus is due to be dismissed.
This argument is erroneous. Plaintiffs alleged that the Jail’s lockdown is “universal,” and applies to “all prisoners.” FAC
Plaintiffs are not entitled to pursue discovery related to their requests for injunctive relief which remain unsupported by their pleading. Indeed, Plaintiffs’ evident intention to pursue sweeping discovery counsels in favor of dismissing their requests for injunctive relief to properly limit discovery to the scope of their claims, rather than their extraordinarily broad, unsupported demands for injunctive relief. Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief is due to be dismissed as exceeding the scope of possible remedial relief available to Plaintiffs.

Consistent with the statutory requirements of CRIPA, we write to advise you of the results of this investigation.

The Detention Center fails to provide a medically appropriate diet for inmates with conditions that require the inmates to receive special diets. For example, the “heart healthy diet” provided to diabetics at the Detention Center contains approximately 30 percent more calories and fat than recommended for diabetics.

Of the four pregnant women at the Detention Center at the time of our visit, none had any prenatal visit with an OB/GYN during their incarceration documented, despite the fact that two of the women were in their third trimester of pregnancy and near term.

263,JC-NY-0034,"This case was brought by a woman who was arested, subjected to excessive force and a strip/cavity search all on the basis of a false complaint filed by a family member. A jury awarded her $19,645 in compensatory damages and $5,000,000 in punitive damages. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the punitive damages award as not available against municipalities, and reduced the compensatory damages award because Plaintiff had been offered slightly more as settlement.","3. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343, jurisdiction is proper as Ms. Ciraolo’s claims arise under federal law. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, jurisdiction is proper as to the claims of Ms. Ciraolo arising under the Constitution and common law of the State of New York.
39. Jane Does 1 and 2 then ordered Ms. Ciraolo, who was naked, to squat and cough, which she did. They thereby subjected her to a body cavity search.
46. On March 19, 1997, Ms. Ciraolo and her counsel made their third appearance in Criminal Court. The Court dismissed the complaint against Ms. Ciraolo.
76. The proceeding terminated in plaintiff’s favor.
Ciraolo brought suit under § 1983 against the City, the police department, and the individual police officers involved in her arrest and search, claiming that she had been falsely arrested, that the police had employed excessive force during the arrest, and that her strip search violated the Fourth Amendment. She also alleged battery, in violation of state law.
The jury found in favor of the defendants on Ciraolo's claims of unlawful arrest, excessive force, and battery. It concluded, however, that the City had acted in wanton disregard of Ciraolo's rights when she was strip-searched, and awarded her $5,000,000 in punitive damages, as well as $19,645 in compensatory damages.
In Newport, a musical concert promoter, Fact Concerts, Inc., brought suit against the City of Newport, Rhode 239 Island, under § 1983 for a violation of its First Amendment rights. Fact Concerts had entered *239 into a contract with Newport to present a jazz festival. Shortly before the festival, Fact Concerts hired the group Blood, Sweat and Tears to replace an act that had dropped out. See id. at 250, 101 S.Ct.
The Supreme Court reversed the award of punitive damages. See id. at 271, 101 S.Ct.
1983. And the rationale for socially compensatory damages in the case of an individual defendant holds equally true where the defendant is a municipality. Indeed, the case before us shows especially vividly the possible utility of such socially compensatory damages. Here, the City of New York adopted a strip-search policy that it knew or clearly should have known was unconstitutional. Counsel for the City estimated at trial that about 65,000 people arrested for misdemeanors had been subjected to strip searches under the policy. Under ordinary circumstances, very few of those 65,000 victims would have been likely to sue, both because the compensatory damages they would have received would have been relatively low and because they were no doubt, in the main, relatively poor and unsophisticated.
Plaintiff brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against New York City, the NYPD, and the individual officers involved in her case, claiming that she had been falsely arrested, that the police had employed excessive force, and that the strip search violated her Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. Plaintiff also alleged a state law claim of battery.
On May 3, 1999 a four-day jury trial commenced on Plaintiff’s claims.1 The Court granted a directed verdict for Plaintiff under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 with respect to the strip search. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of Defendants on the claims of unlawful arrest, excessive force and battery. The jury awarded Plaintiff $19,645 in compensatory damages for violating Plaintiff’s right against unreasonable search and seizure, as well as punitive damages in the amount of $5,000,000. On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed the award of punitive damages, citing City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981), which held that, ordinarily, municipalities are immune from punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

o This is a proposed Settlement of a class action lawsuit alleging that corrections officers employed at the Philadelphia Prison System engaged in the illegal strip searches of all individuals charged with only minor offenses upon their enny into the Philadelphia Prison System from April 21, 2003 until October 9,2007. After the Litigation was filed, Defendant changed its strip search policy. The proposed Settlement does not include individuals who were convicted at the time of their admission to the Philadelphia Prison System, or who were not strip searched when they entered the Philadelphia Prison System.
The Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, United States District Judge Mary A. McLaughlin presiding. The case is called Boone, et al v. City ofPhiladelphia, Case No. OS-CV-18SI. The persons who sued are called the Plaintiffs, and the municipality they sued, the City of Philadelphia, is called the Defendant.
The Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendant. Instead, both sides agreed to a Settlement. That way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people affected will get compensation. The Class Representatives and their attorneys think the Settlement is best for evelyone who is alleged to have been illegally strip searched.
What Does the Settlement Provide? Defendant agreed to pay a total of $5,900,000.00 to settle the case. That will pay for the claims of the Class Representatives, the administrative costs of the Settlement, an incentive award to the Class Representatives, and the attomeys' fees and expenses. There are believed to be approximately 37,000 Class Members. You can only make one claim, even if you were strip searched more than once. Each Class Member who makes a claim will receive an equal share of the pOltion of the Settlement Fund allocated to pay the claims of members of Subclass I or Subclass II, depending on which subclass you are a member of. Class Counsel anticipates, based on claims rates from other settlements, that all individuals who are members of Subclass I that make a claim on the Settlement will receive between $600 and $900, as a settlement payment, and that all individuals who are members of Subclass II that make a claim on the Settlement will receive between $50 and $100 as a settlement payment. These amounts are dependent on how many claims are received by the Claims Administrator during the claims period, and are subject to change based the number of claims received. No amount is guaranteed.

History of the Litigation Class representative Nakisha Boone brought this class action on behalf of herself and all others who were stripsearched after being charged with a misdemeanor or other minor crime Ms. Boone was arrested for violating a bench warrant with an underlying charge of endangering the welfare of a child. She was strip-searched before being placed into detention. She argued that PPS’s policy of strip-searching all pretrial detainees upon admission was unconstitutional. The complaint named the City, the PPS, the Prisons Commissioner, members of the Prisons’ Board of Trustees and three of the prison’s Deputy Commissioners as defendants.

The court granted class certification, and the parties agreed to a preliminary injunction barring the City from continuing to strip search pretrial detainees without reasonable suspicion that the detainee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of their arrest.

The case ended on April 9, 2010 when the court certified the class and granted final approval to the settlement.","It is apparent that the proposed Settlement is the result of good faith, arms-length negotiations between the Parties. Before settlement negotiations began, Class Counsel took extensive class discovery, including numerous interrogatories, voluminous document production, and many depositions and interviews. (Doc No. 48 at 4). The Parties also vigorously litigated class certification. The settlement negotiations involved the mediation services of former Chief Magistrate Judge James R. Melinson and took several months.

Warner, No. 07-3213 (E.D Pa. 2007) (David MacMain, counsel for Defendants); Boone v. City of Phil., No. 05-1851 (E.D Pa. 2005) (Daniel C. Levin and Christopher G. Hayes, counsel for Plaintiffs).

19. The Detention Center’s written policy on inmate mail bans all publications sent by mail to detainees. A true and correct copy of the written policy is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The policy provides:
20. The Detention Center has a policy and practice of allowing detainees to order from a publisher, and receive by mail, a soft-cover Bible – but no other books, magazines, or newspapers. On July 12, 2010, First Sergeant K. Habersham, Berkeley County Detention Center, sent the following email to Paul Wright, Editor, Prison Legal News:
24. Among the books sent by Plaintiffs but rejected by the Detention Center was Protecting Your Health Safety.

Further, non-Christian inmates often cannot access even the single foundational text BCDC’s policy purports to allow. Defendants informed Bryan Adkins, a Jewish prisoner seeking a Torah, that the prison only provides inmates with copies of the King James Bible. To access a Torah, Defendants informed Mr. Adkins that he must locate a family member to personally deliver the book t o BCDC. Defendants have erected similar barriers to Muslim prisoners seeking copies of the Koran, informing prisoners Marvin Henderson and JaMichael Howard that they could possess a Koran only if family members personally delivered the holy book to the prison. And even if a prisoner is able to arrange for personal delivery of a religious text, Defendants may not allow the prisoner to receive it. Defendants recently refused to provide a copy of the Koran to Mr. Howard after he arranged for his girlfriend to personally deliver it to the facility.

271,JC-TN-0009,This 2017 class action lawsuit was brought by a former inmate of the Davidson County Jail in the U.S. District for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments in failing to prevent the spread of scabies in the prison. The case is ongoing. The plaintiff has not yet filed a motion to certify class.,"5. Plaintiff John Doe is a citizen of the State of Tennessee and a resident ofDavidson County, Tennessee. He is a former inmate who was housed in the Defendant's facility in Davidson County. Plaintiff wishes to use the pseudonym ""John Doe"" because he fears retaliation.
10. All of the claims alleged herein arose in the Middle District of Tennessee, and Venue is therefore proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.
24. Because the Defendant refused to address the Plaintiffs medical needs. Plaintiff asked a friend to download the ""WebMD"" Internet page describing scabies. Plaintiff provided the printout to the Defendant, who still ignored Plaintiffs complaint.
2016. His job was to assist with the maintenance of and repairs to the Defendant's facility.
27. Plaintiff was concerned about the Defendant's failure to provide medical treatment. He feared that he would spread it to other areas of the prison. In December of 2016, Plaintiff submitted another sick call request, stating specifically that he had scabies and begging for help, to no avail.
36. As part of his job duties, Plaintiff worked on the boilers and other areas around the Defendant's facility. Although the prison boilers are supposed to maintain a temperature of 160 degrees in order to sanitize laundry, the Defendant's boiler temperature would frequently fail to meet that temperature. Plaintiff complained about an inability to repair certain items and spoke to one of the Defendant's employees. The employee informed Plaintiff that, because the building belonged to Metro and CoreCivic only leased the premises, they only needed to perform the bare minimum repairs in order to temporarily fix a problem. The employee explained that the Defendant did not want to spend money on the repairs.
38. Inmate J.N. is housed at the Defendant's facility. He frequently complained about the rash over his body. His sick calls and complaints were ignored. His mother informed the Defendant that her son's rash appeared to be scabies, which the Defendant denied. In response to his requests for medical attention and complaints, the Defendant threatened J.N. instead of providing treatment. Because he was unable to sleep and constantly suffered from the itching, J.N. suffered a mental breakdown. The Defendant placed J.N. in solitary confinement without treatment. J.N.' s mother contacted the Defendant' s medical staff and begged for assistance for her son, which was ignored. Sometime later, J.N. was provided Benadryl but not anti-scabies medication, which only masked his symptoms without treating the underlying infestation.
57. The Defendant refused to provide Plaintiff with his prescription medication. The Defendant retaliated against other inmates, including inmate J.N., for requesting medical treatment.
68. The Defendant had exclusive control over the movement and placement of inmates in its custody. The Defendant knowingly and intentionally transferred infested inmates into the crowded cells of healthy inmates, placing them in close proximity to a dangerous contagion. Plaintiff and the class members had no ability to transfer away from infested inmates.

272,JC-TX-0023,"A deaf prisoner of the El Paso County jails sued the County in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas for their failure to accommodate his disability. He was held for eleven days without access to an attorney or an interpreter, in violation of the Americans With disabilities Act ans Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. A private settlement was reached in July 2012 which, according to reports, required installation of videophones in the County jails.  We have no further information about this case.","1. Plaintiff Jose Luis Rodriguez, a deaf man, files this petition against Defendant County of El Paso because it failed and refused to reasonably accommodate him by not making its services accessible to individuals with hearing disabilities.

On April 16, 2015, Judge Merryday issued an opinion denying relief to the plaintiffs, holding that plaintiffs failed to show defendants' violations of their constitutional rights. The case closed in 2016. ","Corizon claims that K.G. never alleges pertinent facts and never states the harm caused by a missed or a crushed dose of medicine. Reading the complaint refutes both claims. Corizon contends that the jail must crush each pill to prevent a detainee’s using a pill as currency and that, in any case, wrongly crushing medication constitutes mere negligence. At present no legal authority and no factual submission establishes either the necessity of crushing or the harm of crushing. Corizon asserts that K.G.’s action “amounts to nothing more than a state medical negligence claim” for which K.G. must file a pre-suit notice in accord with Florida law. Again Corizon merely reads the complaint in the light most amenable to the defendant. See also Patsy v Bd. of Regents of the State of Fla., 457 U.S. 496 (1982).

274,JI-FL-0008,"Three minors represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Florida Justice Institute, Inc., and Florida Legal Services, filed suit on September 4, 2019 in the Northern District of Florida against the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). Plaintiffs sought class action certification to represent children subject to solitary confinement in DJJ-run detention centers. The defendant's summary judgment motion on the merits was denied on December 6, 2019, and the case is in ongoing mediation talks.","3. The named Plaintiffs, and the class they seek to represent, are, or will be, subject to solitary confinement, in one of the 21 DJJ-operated secure detention centers (Secure Detention) throughout the state. They bring this action to address the violations of their rights.
34. Each time that DJJ isolated B.W. in solitary confinement, the cells were disgusting and dirty. There was human feces smeared on the wall. There were bugs and flies in the room. DJJ did not allow her to have a mat or blanket during the day. She was only allowed out of solitary confinement for a few minutes a day to shower after everyone else. She had to eat in her cell. The only time DJJ staff opened the door was to give her food or take her to shower. While in confinement, B.W. felt vulnerable, powerless, and miserable. No staff told her how long she would be in solitary confinement or when she would get out.
39. Defendant Simone Marstiller (Marstiller) is the Secretary of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice. She was appointed DJJ Secretary in January 2019 and is sued in her official capacity. As DJJ Secretary, she is responsible for “planning, coordinating, and managing the delivery of all programs and services within the juvenile justice continuum,” which includes all detention centers and related programs and facilities, community-based residential programs, non-residential programs, and all delinquency institutions funded by the department. § 20.316(1)(b), Fla Stat. (2019). Secretary Marstiller is required to “[e]nsure that juvenile justice continuum programs and services are implemented according to legislative intent; state and federal laws, rules and regulations; statewide program standards; and performance objectives,” “establish program policies and rules,” and “coordinate staff development and training.” §§ 20.316(c)(1), (4) (6), Fla Stat. Secretary Marstiller has the final authority to take any necessary corrective action concerning a DJJ program or provider. See § 985.632(5)(f)(2), Fla. Stat.
45. According to DJJ, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017-18, there were 14,010 youth placed into DJJ Secure Detention statewide.2 Approximately 5,314 of these children were 15 years old or younger. The majority, 54%, were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 30% were White. Id.
61. DJJ, through policy and practice, does not provide an assessment by a mental health professional before it subjects a child with mental illness to solitary confinement. DJJ also fails to regularly provide a mental health status examination by a qualified professional within one hour after confinement begins and at regular intervals as long as a child is in solitary confinement despite a scant Facility Operating Procedure requiring a licensed mental health professional to “review the status” of children in solitary confinement every 24 hours. DJJ also fails to provide mental health treatment for children in solitary confinement; effective monitoring for signs and symptoms of suicide in solitary confinement; examination or treatment after release from solitary confinement to address any lasting effects; or meaningful mental health interventions and de-escalation services in response to obvious signs of suffering and pain. So, DJJ conducted no mental health evaluation of R.L. before placing her in solitary confinement even though it was aware of her bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Likewise, mental health staff failed to effectively intervene with respect to G.H.’s attempts to choke himself in confinement. As a result of DJJ’s failure to develop and implement adequate policies and procedures recognized by experts as necessary to eliminate the known risk of harm, the named Plaintiffs and members of the class are suffering from the damaging effects that mirror those reported in the research about children subjected to solitary confinement. Well Known Risks of Harm of Solitary Confinement for Juveniles

4. Venue in the United States District Court for the District of Hawai’i is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). All claims set forth in the Complaint arose in this District.
5. Defendant STATE OF Hawai’i (“STATE”) is responsible for the administration of juvenile justice in the State. The STATE operates, or contracts for the operation of, the only secure juvenile justice facility in the State. This action concerns the administration of HYCF (“the facility”). The facility houses youth in STATE custody who are confined for periods of time by the STATE courts.
(A) This Memorandum of Agreement (“Agreement”) resolves litigation concerning protection from harm, access to medical and mental health care, and special education claims, and therefore settles all claims asserted in United States v. Hawai’i, Civil No. (D. Haw) (referred to herein as the “litigation” or the “lawsuit”). This litigation concerned conditions of confinement at the Hawai’i Youth Correctional Facility (“HYCF”) in Kailua, Hawai’i, and was brought pursuant to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (“Section 14141”).
(F) The terms of this Agreement shall apply to HYCF. If the State closes HYCF and transfers youth to a state-run facility substantially similar to HYCF or, without closing HYCF transfers all girls or 20 or more youth to another state-run facility which provides services substantially similar to HYCF, the applicable and relevant terms of this Agreement will also apply to the new state-run facility. The State reserves the right to transfer youth to a private facility. If the State transfers youth to a private facility which is substantially similar to HYCF, the State shall do everything in its power to facilitate DOJ’s inspection of the conditions of care at that facility. The State will not transfer youth out of HYCF in order to attempt to avoid compliance with this Agreement or any constitutional requirements.
(75) Termination This Agreement shall terminate three years from the Effective Date of the Agreement. The Agreement may also end earlier than three years from the Effective Date of the Agreement if the State has substantially complied with each of the provisions of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance for at least two years. If the DOJ agrees that the State has maintained such compliance, the parties shall file a joint stipulation to dismiss with prejudice. If DOJ does not agree that the State has maintained such compliance, the burden shall be on the State to demonstrate this level of compliance. There are four substantive sections of this Agreement – protection from harm, training, access to medical and mental health care, and special education. A section of the Agreement may be terminated if the State sustains its burden with respect to that section of the Agreement. Noncompliance with mere technicalities, or temporary failure to comply during a period of otherwise sustained compliance will not constitute failure to maintain substantial compliance. At the same time, temporary compliance during a period of sustained noncompliance shall not constitute substantial compliance.

The Stipulation adopted the same monitoring team used in a concurrent suit, S.H. et al., v. Tom Stickrath (S.H.), led by Fred Cohen, Esq. This team was charged with monitoring the extent to which the State had effectively implemented the reforms required by the Stipulation and providing detailed reports to the Parties. After the Stipulation was signed, the State closed the Marion facility.
The Subject Matter Expert had no concerns about individuals with health problems being identified at intake, assessed, diagnosed, and treated consistent with current, generally accepted professional standards of care. There were no concerns regarding dental care. With the exception of one unit that failed to have the health request slips out next to the drop box, the facility was ensuring that youth could request to be seen by medical staff confidentially and independent from JCOs and custodial staff. The health call slips are kept in a separate binder rather than the medical record. A self-assessment is needed to be sure all health requests from the slips are addressed within each youth’s medical record progress notes.

277,JI-SD-0003,"The juvenile plaintiff brought suit against the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center, challenging the center's policy of strip-searching all juveniles admitted to the Detention Center, without any reasonable suspicion that the juveniles were concealing weapons or contraband. The Eighth Circuit overturned the District Court's ruling, holding that the search of the named plaintiff did not violate the Fourth Amendment. On remand, the parties reached a monetary settlement before having to relitigate the case.","The IDC had a policy ofconducting visual strip searches ofall minors regardless ofthe type ofoffense they were arrested for or whether there was reason to believe that the minors had weapons or contraband. The JDC also had a policy of questioning juvenile detainees about their religious beliefs fu'1d practices. The written strip search policy in effect on August 9, 1999, when Plaintiffwas arrested, required a IDC staff person to escort the juvenile to the JDC's shower room, and instruct thejuvenile to remove all ofhis or her clothing, including undergarments. The JDC staffperson then conducted a thorough visual inspection ofthe juvenile's naked body. The juvenile was required to comb through and, ifnecessary, lift his or her hair and to tum around. The juvenile was required to take a shower in full view of the JDC staff. A complete search ofthe juvenile'S clothing was also conducted by JDe staff. A IDC unifonn was supplied to the juvenile after showering.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota.
The district court denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The court concluded that the JDe's written search policy in effect in August 1999 was unconstitutional and that the subsequent changes to the policy did not cure the constitutional defects. (Mem Op. and Order, R Doc
The district court then granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the Fourth Amendment claim. The court identified three remaining issues relating to these claims: ""(1) what type of injunctive relief is appropriate in this case; (2) what amount of monetary damages are appropriate and how should the class members' damages be determined; (3) what should the ending date be for membership in the first two classes certified by the Court."" (ld. at 18).

Banbury and Cheever contend that they are also entitled to qualified immunity from suits for damages by the unnamed class members. To review that contention, it appears that we would be required by the Supreme Court's current direction to resolve first whether the searches of the unnamed class members violated the Fourth Amendment, and then, ifso, whether the defendants are nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity. See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 197-98 n.3 (2004) (per curiam); Saucier, 533 U.S. at 200; see also Bunting v. Mellen, 541 U.S. 1019, 1024-25 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).
The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded this action for further proceedings consistent with its August 9, 2006 opinion. After Plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court on March 26, 2007, Plaintiffs filed with this Court a Motion for Leave to Substitute Class Representatives. (Doc. 165.) Defendants requested an opportunity to conduct discovery to determine if the substitute class representatives proposed by Plaintiffs are proper. Subsequently, Plaintiffs served Defendant Minnehaha County with discovery requests and asked Defendant to supplement responses to earlier served discovery.
F. In an effort to determine whether the parties could settle this dispute prior to litigating the case for a second time at the district and appellate courts, the parties' counsel, all of whom are experienced class action attorneys, participated in extended negotiations. On February 4,2009, the parties participated in a mediation with Magistrate Judge Veronica Duffy, District of South Dakota. During the mediation, counsel bargained vigorously on behalf of their clients. All negotiations were conducted at arms' length and in good faith.","Jodie Smook filed this suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983, ""individually and behalf of all other persons similarly situated,"" alleging that the policy of the Minnehaha County Juvenile Detention Center (""JOC"") to ""strip search[] minors without probable cause"" was unconstitutional. The district court granted Smook's motion for class certification, and granted the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the search claims. Smook appealed the district court's denial of qualified immunity to the JDC's directors, and the case was remanded to the Second Circuit for further proceedings.","On June 1, 1999, two South Dakota juvenile detainees filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota against the Minnehaha County Sheriff's Office and the South Dakota Department of Corrections. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' written strip search policy violated their Fourth Amendment rights by subjecting them to a thorough visual inspection of their naked bodies. The district court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs on the Fourth Amendment claim. The case was remanded to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with its August 9, 2006 opinion."

The Plaintiffs, class members who are currently detained at the Florida Civil Commitment Center, allege that the Defendants are violating their constitutional rights. Plaintiffs named Liberty Behavioral Health Corporation (“Liberty”) and the Florida Department of Children and Families as the Defendants. The Complaint does not seek monetary damages as relief. Defendant Liberty now suggests that the Court dismiss Liberty from this action because as of July 1, 2006, Liberty no longer provides services to operate the Florida Civil Commitment Center due to a contract that expired June 30,
1. The Complaint is dismissed as to Defendant Liberty Behavioral Healthcare Corporation.
11. Some of the Plaintiffs are on State Probation condition for Sex Offender Treatment, and has requested Timeout from treatment because of the substantive due process liberty interest violation, but the new defendant Mr. Budz under color of state law retaliated by stating if any Plaintiff on timeout from treatment will be placed out of treatment and or start over from M.R.T. The Plaintiffs reasons for taking a timeout from treatment is because they are being deprived of their U.S.C. Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process of law of liberty interest to not be transferred to a more maximum security facility that would effect their mental and physical heaJth that would hinder their progress in the treatment program. The new F.C.C.C. is designed as a county jail or super maximum security prison built in accordance with ACA prison standards and the Florida Legislature under 394.910 even acknowledges that treatment in a prison setting is poor Id. (The Legislature further finds that the prognosis for rehabilitating sexually violent predators in a prison setting is poor.) in which the new facility is a prison. See Hadi v. Liberty Behavioral Health Corp., 927 So.2d 34, 40 (Fla App. I Dist. 2006), ""The dangerous nature of the individuals to be committed, and the fact that they are required by statute to be committed to a secure facility, supports DCF's decision to require the sexually violent predator treatment facility be constructed to the security specifications of an ACA approved prison, and that bidders have correctional experience.""

281,MH-MA-0005,"This was a class-action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs alleged that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had failed to provide medically necessary services as required under the federal Medicaid Act, and that it had failed to inform parents and children that they were entitled to these covered services. The district court found that the Commonwealth violated provisions of the federal Medicaid Act by failing to provide home-based services to thousands of children across the state. In 2007, the district court approved a remedial plan intended to restructure the children’s mental health system by incorporating intensive home-based services, including behavioral health screenings, assessments, case management, crisis intervention and in-home therapeutic supports. It also appointed a monitor to oversee implementation and compliance. The parties agreed to extend the monitor’s appointment several times, with the final extension expiring on December 31, 2018. In July 2019, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to again extend the monitor’s appointment; the First Circuit overturned this ruling on May 4, 2020. As of August 2020, the extension is before the district court on remand.","27. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys experienced in federal class action litigation and public assistance benefits, particularly the Massachusetts Medicaid program. The named plaintiffs seek relief that will inure to the benefit of the plaintiff class as a whole.
The defendants moved to dismiss the action on three grounds. First, they claim that the Commonwealth's sovereign immunity, enshrined in the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution, bars the suit. [FN2] Second, they assert that the EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Act do not create private rights enforceable under section
FN2. The amendment reads: The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State. U.S Const. amend XI. Despite its phrasing, the amendment consistently has been read to render a state immune from suits brought in federal courts both by its own citizens and by citizens of other states. E.g., Employees of Dep't of Pub. Health Welfare v. Dep't of Pub. Health Welfare, 411 U.S. 279, 280, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973); Fred v. Aponte Roque, 916 F.2d 37, 38 (1st Cir.1990) (per curiam).
2. Procedures for Modification Any provision of the Plan that vests the defendants with the discretion to implement a requirement based upon the agencies’ judgment and experience can be modified in the discretion of that agency, provided that the modification is consistent with one of the five standards set forth above. The defendants shall inform the plaintiffs of the modification. If the plaintiffs believe the matter is not entrusted to the discretion of the defendants pursuant to the Plan, the plaintiffs may invoke dispute resolution process.
11. MassHealth will continue its practice of not requiring a primary care visit or EPSDT screening as a prerequisite for an eligible child to receive MassHealth behavioral health services. MassHealth-eligible children and eligible family members can be referred or can self-refer for Medicaid services at any time by another agency, including other EOHHS agencies, state agencies, public schools, community health centers, hospitals and community mental health providers.
In October 2007, Plaintiffs opposed Defendants' proposed regulations that, in their view, would effectively exclude some members of the Plaintiff class from eligibility for services under the court’s remedial order. (Dkt No. 375.) After a hearing on the issue, Defendant agreed to provide the services at issue to the entire Plaintiff class.
First, the remedial order in this case arose from an explicit finding of a violation of federal law, anchored on evidence presented in a multi-week trial, and never appealed. This case does not involve a consent decree. The court found that Defendants failed to comply with the “reasonable promptness” provision of the Medicaid statute in providing EPSDT services. To date, Defendants are still failing to comply with federal law by consistently violating their own Medicaid standard with regard to onethird to more than one-half the Plaintiff children.
2017. (Dkt. 820.) While some elasticity may exist in the notion of what constitutes “reasonable promptness,” Defendants are far outside its boundary, wherever it may lie. A helpful case on this point is Fortin v. Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare, 692 F.2d 790 (1st Cir. 1982). In that case, the issue was the thirty-day time limit for eligibility determinations for applicants seeking Aid to Families with Dependent Children (“AFDC”) benefits and the two-week time limit for applicants for General Relief. At the time of the lawsuit, the defendant was hitting the deadline for only 66.8% of AFDC applicants and for only 52.5% of applicants for general relief. When, following issuance of a consent decree, the compliance rate stalled at roughly 87%, United States District Judge Robert E. Keeton held the defendant Commissioner in contempt and imposed a fine of $100 per applicant for delays above thirty days and another $100 for each sixty-day period thereafter. The defendants appealed, and the First Circuit affirmed, holding that the defendants had failed to demonstrate substantial compliance with the decree. The court observed that “no particular percentage of compliance can be a safe-harbor figure,” adding that “‘substantiality’ must depend on the circumstances of each case, including the nature of the interest at stake and the degree to which noncompliance affects that interest.” Id. at 795 (citation omitted).
The denial by the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings. No costs are awarded.
Defendant Eric Kriss","On February 22, 2007, a group of Massachusetts children with severe emotional disturbances (SED) filed this class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs alleged that the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health (DMH) was violating the federal Medicaid statute by denying the children medically necessary intensive home-based services that were required to treat or ameliorate their conditions. The DMH denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, and the court granted a temporary restraining order and entered an order requiring the DMH to implement a remedial plan. The parties agreed to a court monitor to oversee implementation of the plan.","In 2007, a class action lawsuit was brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) alleging that the DHHS was violating the Medicaid statute by not requiring a primary care visit or EPSDT screening as a prerequisite for an eligible child to receive MassHealth behavioral health services. The DHHS issued a consent decree requiring the defendants to provide services to all eligible children. The defendants appealed, and the First Circuit affirmed, holding that the defendants had failed to demonstrate substantial compliance with the consent decree. The case is now remanded for further proceedings."
282,MH-MS-0001,"The U.S. sued the State of Mississippi under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The U.S. alleged that the State knowingly failed to provide adequate mental health programs for adults with mental illness and segregated adults with disabilities in their State-run hospitals. After a four-week bench trial, the court found that the health system violated the ADA and required a special master to determine and oversee the remedial process. The case is ongoing.","“I’m really wanting to get out.” These words were spoken to DOJ civil rights investigators by a person confined to a Mississippi facility. They illustrate the urgency of our findings. Thousands of Mississippi residents with mental illness or developmental disabilities are institutionalized. While confined in these institutions, they are segregated from non-disabled persons and lead lives of limited choice or independence. They are deprived of meaningful opportunities to choose friends, participate in employment, or make choices about activities, food or living arrangements. In the words of the Supreme Court: “Unjustified isolation … is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597.
We conclude that the State of Mississippi fails to provide services to qualified individuals with disabilities, including mental illness and developmental disabilities, in the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs, in violation of the ADA. This has led to the needless and prolonged institutionalization of adults and children with disabilities who could be served in more integrated settings in the community with adequate services and supports. Further, systemic failures in the State’s system place qualified individuals with disabilities at risk of unnecessary institutionalization now and going forward.
2. Every day, hundreds of adults with mental illness are unnecessarily and illegally segregated in Mississippi's state-run psychiatric hospitals or are at serious risk of entering these institutions. They enter and remain in these isolating institutions because the State of Mississippi (""the State"") has failed to provide them sufficient community-based mental health services.
In 2016, the United States filed this lawsuit alleging that the State “unnecessarily requires thousands of adults with mental illness to receive services in State-run psychiatric hospitals” instead of community-based services, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). Docket No. 153 at 1.
Against this backdrop, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has investigated, litigated, and worked with states around the country to ensure that their systems for mental health treatment uphold the purpose of the ADA, as articulated in Olmstead. In 2011 DOJ issued a findings letter regarding what it deemed to be the State’s over-institutionalization of adults with mental illness and the lack of alternative community-based services. Then, the United States filed this lawsuit in August of 2016.
were ‐‐ were better options, but they weren’t there.” Trial Tr. 738.22 C.R. told the Court about her cousin, T.M., who has been hos‐ pitalized six times. One time, a social worker at MSH called and asked C.R.—a layperson—“what is the discharge plan for T.M.?” At the time, C.R. did not even know that T.M. had been hospitalized. C.R. has never heard about crisis stabiliza‐ tion services that could help T.M. when he is in the commu‐ nity.23 See Trial Tr. 773–86. The witnesses also offered glimpses into what it is like when the State provides the services it promises Dr. Kathy Crock‐ ett, Executive Director of Hinds Behavioral Health Services, testified for the State about the array of services provided in Hinds County, including (among other things) a PACT team, crisis stabilization unit, and drop‐in center. See Trial Tr. 2192–
VI. Mississippi Is Violating the ADA The stipulations and testimony establish the basics. Thou‐ sands of Mississippians suffer from SMI and are qualified in‐ dividuals with disabilities under the ADA. The State is re‐ quired to comply with Title II of that law. Yet the State’s men‐ tal health system depends too much on segregated hospital settings and provides too few community‐based services that would enhance the liberty of persons with SMI. The “great majority” of those Mississippians “would prefer to receive their services in the communities where they are living.” Trial Tr. 1331.52 Even understanding these basics, though, the sheer number of expert opinions, witnesses, and legal arguments can obfus‐ cate whether Mississippi’s system actually violates the Su‐ preme Court’s mandate in Olmstead. For guidance, then, it is important to return to the text of that case. Olmstead’s final holding says that “States are required to pro‐ vide community‐based treatment for persons with mental disabilities when” (1) “treatment professionals determine that such placement is appropriate,” (2) “the affected persons do not oppose such treatment,” and (3) “the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental dis‐ abilities.” 527 U.S. at

Plaintiff, who was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, brought claims under the Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and Section 504 after the College forced her to leave its dormitory following her suicide attempt in June 2004. The case eventually settled, with defendants paying plaintiff attorneys' fees and damages. ","On October 7, 2004, plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, alleging the following causes of action: (1) intentional discrimination and disparate impact under the Fair Housing Act; (2) failure to provide a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act; (3) intentional discrimination and failure to provide a reasonable accommodation under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and (4) intentional discrimination under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
it is her disability. Rather, as plaintiff notes, her disability is Major Depressive Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Plaintiff was originally permitted to reside in the dormitory without regard to her disability (which, as plaintiff alleges, antedates her time at Hunter College, Am Compl. 8), as is any other student with mental disorders.
Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief under all three statutes and money damages under the Rehab Act.
In Tsombanidis v W. Haven Fire Dep't, 352 F.3d 565 (2d Cir. 2003), the Second Circuit stated, “[T]o establish discrimination under either the FHAA or the ADA, Plaintiff has three available theories: (1) intentional discrimination (disparate treatment); (2) disparate impact; and (3) failure to make a reasonable accommodation.” Id at
Plaintiff also argues that the College’s suicide policy has a disparate impact on people with mental illnesses. Plaintiff fails to state a claim under a disparate impact theory, because she has not alleged that this policy disproportionately affects dormitory residents who have a mental illness. See Hack v. President Fellows of Yale College, 237 F.3d 81, 90-91 (2d Cir. 2000) (finding plaintiffs failed to state a disparate impact claim under the FHA because they did not allege that the policy at issue actually or predictably results in an under-representation of orthodox Jews in campus housing; plaintiff must allege “‘a causal connection between [a] facially neutral policy... and the resultant proportion of minority’ group members in the population” governed by the policy); see also Tsombanidis v. West Haven Fire Dept., 352 F.3d 565, 576-77 (2d Cir. 2003) (“there must be some [statistical or other] analytical method to determine disproportionate impact”). Ultimately, she cannot avoid the Second Circuit’s holdings that there is no cause of action for discrimination based on the severity of an individual’s disability, i.e., between mentally individuals who are not so ill as to attempt suicide and those who do.

284,MH-TN-0001,"On March 15, 1996, the United States filed a lawsuit under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, against the State of Tennessee, the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (DMH/MR) and the Memphis Mental Health Institute (MMHI), in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Memphis Division. 

On March 15, 1996, the same day as the complaint was filed, the parties submitted a joint motion for entry of a consent decree.  Under the settlement agreement the defendants agreed to implement all policies, systems, procedures and rules currently in place, to provide quarterly status reports, provide the government access to the facilities, records, patients, and employees of MMHI, and to confer in good faith on the provisions of the consent decree.  

On May 21, 1997, the Court entered judgment in accordance with the consent decree and terminated the case, retaining jurisdiction for necessary enforcement of the decree.  And, on September 18, 1998, the District Court (Judge Gibbons) granted the parties' joint motion for a stipulation and order, effectuating the consent decree.

On June 21, 2005, the District Court (Judge Bernice B. Donald) granted the parties' joint motion for an order partially terminating the consent decree and approved the parties' stipulation for supplemental relief.","On December 12, 1990, we informed you that, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. §1997 et seg., we were commencing an investigation into conditions of patient care and treatment at the Memphis Mental Health Institute (""MMHI"") in Memphis, Tennessee. On February 19 21, 1991, the Department conducted a tour of MMHI with experts in the fields of psychiatry and psychiatric nursing. Our touring team examined patient records, interviewed MMHI's superintendent and numerous staff and spoke with patients. We also reviewed voluminous documents provided by the facility concerning a wide range of activities and procedures. During the tour, we were treated graciously by staff from the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, the Attorney General's office and MMHI.
On December 12, 1990, we informed you that, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (""CRIPA""), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq., we were commencing an investigation into conditions relating to patient care and treatment at the Memphis Mental Health Institute (""MMHI"") in Memphis, Tennessee. As specified by CRIPA, we are now writing to inform you of our conclusions that the conditions at MMHI deprive patients there of their constitutional rights. We also outline the minimum measures we believe necessary to remedy those unconstitutional conditions. Finally, in the Attachment to this letter, we set forth the facts supporting the findings of constitutional violations.
Finally, we determined that mental health patients are being prematurely released from the hospital before their psychiatric condition has been stabilized and without appropriate monitoring or placement in community programs. During our June tour we reviewed records of patients who were discharged even though professionals at MMHI indicated in their records that they were still dangerous or not stabilized. Absent adequate treatment, such patients are subjected to repeated admissions and discharges and a repetitious cycle of harm. A review of records indicated that recidivism is a significant issue at MMHI due to inadequate treatment. For example, we noted numerous patients who had multiple admissions to MMHI. Indeed, we found in an extreme case that one patient was on his 3 Our nursing consultant, also making her third trip to MMHI in June, found that nursing services had not improved, but had deteriorated since her last visit to MMHI. She found that MMHI is not adequately staffed to provide therapeutic nursing care to its patients. Nursing care plans are not adequately individualized to reflect the needs of patients and, due to the lack of nursing staff, what plans are written are often not implemented.
5. Venue in the Western District of Tennessee is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.
1391. All claims set forth in the Complaint arose in said District.
12. Persons residing at MMHI include individuals who are mentally ill.
15. Defendants have failed and are continuing to fail to provide adequate medical care, including nursing care, to MMHI patients.
The United States and the State of Tennessee respectfully move this Court to enter the accompanying Consent Decree as an Order of this Court by signing the document on page nine. The parties have agreed that the Consent Decree represents settlement of this case.
1. This case was instituted by the United States on March 15, 1996, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (""CRIPA""), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et sea.
1. The Defendants shall provide to the United States quarterly status reports on progress made toward implementation of this Consent Decree. The status reports shall be submitted to the United States no later than 15 working days after the-end of each reporting period. The reporting periods shall begin on the first day of January, April, July, and October. The first reporting period shall be the first full calendar quarter after the entry of this Consent Decree. The status reports shall continue until the parties agree otherwise or until this Consent Decree is no longer in effect.
1. The United States and its attorneys, consultants, and agents shall have reasonable access to the facilities, records, patients, and employees of MMHI upon reasonable notice to the Defendants for the purpose of ascertaining compliance with this Consent Decree.

Few of these medications were justified in the medical record. The use of thiothixine (Navane), an antipsychotic medication, without justification, is of special concern.
1. Weight Loss/Gain Particularly in the elderly, significant changes in weight are often an indication of, and contributor to, significant changes in general health. Adequate weight monitoring is an essential component of nursing home health care. Generally speaking, Nim Henson is properly monitoring and developing appropriate nutritional interventions for its residents.
The facility lacks adequate functional furniture, such as dining room chairs and recliners, thus relegating many residents to their wheelchairs. This shortcoming predisposes residents to functional decline, falls, poor posture, contractures, and skin breakdown.
H. Most Integrated Setting Nim Henson’s treatment professionals do not assess residents to determine whether their continued stay at the facility, rather than in more integrated settings, is appropriate. This is contrary to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
1. The Attorney General files this complaint on behalf of the United States of America pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997, to enjoin the named Defendants from depriving residents housed in the Nim Henson Geriatric Center (Nim Henson) of rights, privileges, or immunities secured and protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.

Indeed, the court does not 2 question that it would be extraordinary for a large, sophisticated 3 entity like AT&T to assist the government in a warrantless 4 surveillance program without receiving a certification to insulate 5 its actions.
2001. News reports that the National Security Agency (“NSA”) undertook a warrantless eavesdropping program with alleged cooperation by telecommunications companies spawned dozens of lawsuits by customers against the companies, along with multiple suits against the NSA and other government actors. Tash Hepting and other residential telephone customers (collectively “Hepting”) challenge the legality of the companies’ participation in the surveillance program. Partially in response to these suits, Congress held hearings and ultimately passed legislation that provided retroactive immunity to the companies, subject to various conditions, but expressly left intact potential claims against the government. The sole issue before us is the constitutionality of § 802 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”), 50 U.S.C. § 1885a, known as the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which allows for immunity for the telecommunication companies. Like the district court, we conclude that § 802 passes constitutional muster.

The complaints “challenge[d] the legality of Defen- dants’ participation in a secret and illegal government pro- gram to intercept and analyze vast quantities of Americans’ telephone and Internet communications.” Hepting alleged that the telecommunications companies provided the government with direct access to nearly all of the communications passing through their domestic telecommunications facilities.

Although Hepting offers a broadside against the constitutionality of § 802, we conclude that the statute is constitutional and does not violate Articles I or III of the Constitution or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

The plaintiff alleged that the Transportation Security Administration violated the Freedom of Information Act for wrongfully withholding its records about electronic device searches. The TSA ultimately provided a letter stating it does not conduct device searches, and the ACLU agreed to dismiss the case. ","1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. §552, 3 to enforce the public’s right to information about the federal government’s searches of electronic 4 devices at airports. Government agencies routinely search travelers’ phones, computers, tablets 5 and other devices, which hold within them vast quantities of information—photographs, emails, 6 text and audio messages, address books—that reveal intimate and deeply personal details of an 7 individual’s life.

According to the complaint, the FOIA requests sought greater understanding of the administration's immigration enforcement policies out of a concern that the defendants have targeted individuals on the basis of actual or perceived religion, ethnicity, race, or national origin in enforcing their immigration policies. Specifically, the plaintiffs sought ""disclosure of agency policies, communications, and statistics related to visa processing and visa issuances for individuals applying abroad; to adjudication of entry document applications; and to screening and searching of individuals arriving at U.S. ports of entry."" The case is ongoing.","This action seeks to enhance public understanding of an urgent concern: discrimination in immigration enforcement against Muslims, Latinos, and other members of disfavored groups by the U.S. Department of State (“DOS”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The contemporary importance of this issue is no accident. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald J. Trump asserted he would ban all Muslims, including refugees fleeing war-torn regions of the world, from entering the United States. Candidate Trump also perpetuated harmful and racially charged stereotypes about Mexican and other Latino immigrants, to whom he referred as murderers, rapists, and “bad hombres.” He subsequently called for “extreme vetting” of immigrants. In his first week in office, President Trump continued his anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric and moved promptly to issue a thinly veiled “Muslim Ban” executive order that indefinitely blocked Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days, and prohibited individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. Numerous lawsuits challenging the order’s constitutionality were swiftly brought, and courts around the country preliminarily enjoined that ban. Undaunted, the Administration replaced it with a second executive order, which multiple courts again enjoined. During this time, protests erupted at airports across the country, and media coverage focused on allegations and instances of discrimination in immigration enforcement. The same day he signed the second Muslim Ban executive order, the President issued a memorandum directing the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to develop procedures for “enhanced vetting” for applications for visas and immigration benefits. Since then, however, the Trump Administration has disclosed little information concerning its policies and practices regarding targeted immigration enforcement.

Plaintiffs filed an administrative appeal. JA 67-79. While that administrative appeal was pending, plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. JA 10-20. Plaintiffs argued that neither Exemption 1 nor Exemption 3 applied to the requested information but, even if one or both exemptions did apply, the CIA was nevertheless precluded from issuing a Glomar response because the Agency had already officially acknowledged the existence of responsive records. Plaintiffs and the CIA cross-moved for summary judgment.
C. District Court Decision The district court held that the CIA was entitled to summary judgment, reasoning that the CIA’s Glomar response was independently justified under both FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3.
GARLAND, Chief Judge: The plaintiffs filed a Freedom of Information Act request for records hel d by the Central Intelligence Agency pertaining to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (“drones”) to carry out targeted killings. The Agency issued a so-called Glomar response, refusing to confirmor deny that it had any such records. The district court affirm ed the Agency’s response and granted summary judgment in its favor. The question on appeal is whe ther the Agency’s Glomar response was justified under the circumstances of this case. We conclude that it was not justified a nd therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.

290,NS-DC-0003,"In June 2009, plaintiff Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to defendant National Security Agency (NSA) for records related to National Security Presidential Directive 54 (NSPD 54), aka Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 that was issued by President George W. Bush in January 2009, and to the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI).  in October 2013, the district court ruled that NSPD 54 is not an agency record at all because it originated with the President or the NSC, and contained clear limits on its use and further dissemination. Electronic Privacy Information Center v. Nat'l Security Agency, -- F. Supp. 2d --, 2013 WL 5701645, (D.D.C. Oct. 21, 2013).","1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (""FOIA""), 5 US.C. § 552 (2007), for injunctive and other appropriate relief, seeking the release of agency records requested by the Electronic Privacy Information Center from the United States National Security Agency/Central Security Service.
Civil Action No. 10-0196 (BAH) MEMORANDUM OPINION Pending before the Court is the partial motion to dismiss by the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and the National Security Council (“NSC”) two of the four claims in the Complaint. These claims stem from a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request that the plaintiff, Electronic Privacy Information Center (“EPIC”), filed with the NSA seeking information related to the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, a multi-agency federal initiative to ensure the security of the nation’s online infrastructure. In this case, the NSA referred part of the plaintiff’s FOIA request to the NSC since a responsive document in the NSA’s possession had originated with the NSC. The plaintiff brought this lawsuit against both the NSA and NSC to compel the production of documents responsive to its FOIA request. The plaintiff believes that releasing the documents it seeks “would provide the opportunity for meaningful public participation in the development of new security measures that may have a significant impact on civil liberties, such as privacy.” Def.’s Partial Mot. to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Mot.”), Ex. A at 2-3 (Plaintiff’s FOIA Appeal). The defendants now seek to dismiss the plaintiff’s claims in Count III, which alleges that the NSC “failed to disclose responsive agency records in its possession in response to the referral by the NSA,” Compl. 66, and in Count IV, which alleges that the NSA violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it referred the FOIA request to the NSC. Id.
Civil Action No. 10–196 (BAH) October 21, 2013 Synopsis Background: Plaintiff brought suit under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), claiming that the National Security Agency (NSA) had wrongfully withheld records that were responsive to FOIA request. The NSA asserted “national security” and other FOIA exemption, and parties cross-moved for summary judgment.
III. DISCUSSION [9] [10]The parties have focused their attention on whether the withholding of records responsive to the plaintiff’s request under exemptions to the FOIA was proper, but such exemptions are irrelevant if the records requested are not “agency records” within the meaning of the FOIA. See Judicial Watch, 726 F.3d at 214–15. If the records in question are not “agency records,” courts do not have the power under the FOIA to order their disclosure.5 See id.; see also 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). Thus, the Court will first determine if the primary document at issue, NSPD 54, is an “agency record” before turning to a discussion of the propriety of any exemptions. Next, it will review the application of Exemptions 1 and 3 to IAD Management Directive 20 and NSA/CSS 1–58. Finally, the Court will turn to the plaintiff’s challenge to the defendant’s interpretation of the second portion of the plaintiff’s request.
1. In district court, plaintiff EPIC sought to compel disclosure of NSPD 54 and two related documents under the Freedom of Information Act. The district court ruled that NSPD 54 was not an “agency record” subject to the FOIA. Regarding the two related documents, the court upheld the government’s redactions under Exemptions 1 and
4. Finally, the parties ask that the case be remanded to the district court. On remand, plaintiff intends to argue that it is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees.
44. The plaintiff, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (“EPIC”), seeks attorneys’ fees as a prevailing party pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”). 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E). The defendant, the National Security Agency (“NSA”), challenges the plaintiff’s entitlement to attorneys’ fees and, in the alternative, challenges the reasonableness of the amount requested by the plaintiff, seeking a reduction in fees as a sanction. See Def.’s Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Attys. Fees and Costs (“Def.’s Opp’n”) at 5, ECF No.","In June 2009, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the National Security Agency (NSA) seeking information related to the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) under President George W.

The plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to disclose responsive agency records in its possession in response to the referral by the NSA. The defendants sought to dismiss the plaintiff's claims in Count III, which alleges that the NSC violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it referred the FOIA request to the NSC. On August 14, 2009, the defendants released two redacted documents, USSID SP0018 and NSA/CSS Policy 1–23, responsive to the third part of the plaintiff’s request that had been previously released pursuant to the FOIA.

over the case. See Jerome Stevens Pharm., Inc v. Food Drug Admin., 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C Cir. 2005) (citing Herbert v. Nat’l Acad. of Scis., 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C Cir. 1992))
FACTUAL BACKGROUND In May 2018, the D.C. Circuit affirmed this Court’s ruling that the government could not forcibly transfer Petitioner into the custody of a foreign country. See Doe v. Mattis, 288 F. Supp.
SRINIVASAN, Circuit Judge: This case involves a United States citizen who has been detained by the United States military in Iraq for several months. He seeks release from military custody in a habeas corpus action brought under the pseudonym John Doe. Doe is a citizen not only of the United States but also of Saudi Arabia.
The district court’s second order came about after the government reached an agreement with Country B to transfer Doe to its custody. The government gave the district court the requisite notice of its intent to transfer Doe to that country. The court then enjoined the government from effecting the transfer. In the court’s view, the government had failed to demonstrate the necessary legal authority (specifically, a statute or treaty) for the transfer.
In October 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, acting on Doe’s behalf, petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition asserts that the military’s existing authority to engage in armed conflict does not extend to ISIL, that the military thus lacks legal authority to detain an alleged member of ISIL, and that, as a result, the government must either prosecute Doe in an Article III court or release him. In addition to those legal arguments, Doe contends as a factual matter that he is not an ISIL combatant.
The district court determined that the ACLU had standing to bring the action on Doe’s behalf. The court ordered the government to give the ACLU access to Doe to ascertain whether he wanted to continue the action Am. Civil Liberties Union Found v. Mattis, 286 F. Supp.
On January 23, the district court granted Doe’s request in part. The court entered a preliminary injunction requiring the government to provide 72 hours’ notice before transferring Doe to any other country.
80. Doe moved for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order to block the proposed transfer.
The government appealed the second injunction to this court. It then moved for consolidation of the two appeals and expedited treatment, both of which we granted. This opinion thus resolves both of the government’s appeals. In view of the presumption of public access to judicial proceedings, we have endeavored to fashion the opinion so as to manage redactions while still not revealing the identities of Countries A and B.

He sought $75 million in compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees for this case and a related Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case used to gain information for this litigation under FISA, <i>Bivens</i>, the Federal Tort Claims Act, and the Privacy Act.

The Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit after the federal government removed the individual Plaintiff's name from the Specially Designated Terror List.","1. For more than seventeen years, Muhammad Salah (“Salah”), a U.S. citizen residing in Bridgeview, Illinois, has lived under an unprecedented “embargo” imposed on him by the U.S. Department of Treasury in August 1995, when it designated him a “Specially Designated Terrorist.” Upon information and belief, Salah is the only U.S. citizen residing in the United States subject to such a designation. Pursuant to the designation, all of Salah’s assets were blocked indefinitely, without a warrant, probable cause of criminal activity, or a hearing. Salah was provided no notice of the charges, no evidence upon which the designation was based, and no opportunity to respond to the charges and evidence.
6. Salah seeks a declaration that these actions violate the Constitution and federal statutes, and an injunction against their enforcement and ordering his removal from the list of “Specially Designated Terrorists.” AFSC and ADC seek a declaration that the restrictions on their speech violate their First Amendment rights, and the First Amendment rights of ADC’s members, and an injunction against their enforcement as applied to their intended activities.

12. Defendant United States Department of the Treasury is an agency of the United States.
41152. The designation notice – which was never sent to Salah – simply announced that Salah had been designated, and provided no factual or legal basis for defendants’ decision. Defendants did so without seeking a warrant or any other judicial authorization, and without establishing probable cause. Defendants provided Salah no prior notice regarding its action. The first anyone in his family learned of defendants’ actions was when Salah’s wife was unable to withdraw funds from their bank account and the local bank, not the defendants, informed her of the freeze on assets. Even after they designated him, defendants afforded Salah no notice of the bases for its action, no hearing, no opportunity to respond, and no statement of reasons. Contrary to long-established constitutional requirements, defendants have never even provided him with the administrative record upon which its decision was based.

United States District Court Northern District of Illinois − CM/ECF LIVE, Ver 5.1.1 (Chicago)
U.S. Government Defendant","In August 1995, the U.S. Department of Treasury designated Muhammad Salah as a Specially Designated Terrorist. The designation prohibited him from engaging in any economic transaction with any person in the United States or its territories, and forbade him from accepting as a gift anything (including food, clothing, lodging, transportation, medicine, and legal services) from any person. In September 2012, Salah and the American Islamic Society of Chicago (AFSC) filed a lawsuit in the U,S.

300,NS-IL-0002,"In 2012, the government initiated criminal prosecution of Adel Daoud in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. The government charged Daoud with attempting to damage and destroy a building by means of explosion. In 2013, the government added the charge of soliciting a crime of violence, murder for hire, and witness tampering. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit addressed the tension between the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the evidentiary investigation required by the test laid out in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), for determining the legality of a warrant. The Seventh Circuit reversed the order on June 16, 2014; the defendant appealed the decision to the Supreme Court but cert was denied on February 23, 2015. The underlying criminal case continues.","2017. 2 The plaintiffs in the Clapper case were various attorneys and human rights, labor, legal, and media organizations who brought an action for a declaration that § 1881a was unconstitutional and sought an injunction against § 1881aauthorized surveillance. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the plaintiff’s lawsuit for lack of Article III standing.
If the government identifies and obtains any additional relevant statements of defendant, as contemplated by Rule 16, it will produce them consistent with its discovery obligations, or will address them promptly with the Court. As such, the defendant’s request should be denied as moot. See, e.g., United States v. Edmond, No. 11 CR 378, 2011 WL 6010261, at *1 (N.D.
This Court has jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because, pursuant to FISA, the district court’s ruling constitutes a final order subject to immediate appeal. The district court ordered disclosure of classified FISA application materials based on Section 106 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. § 1806.
To the extent the district court thought its ruling found support in cases applying the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel (see R. 92 at 5), that too was wrong. There is no Sixth Amendment right to have counsel present for a classified, pretrial determination. See United States v. Abu Ali, 528 F.3d 210, 254 (4th Cir. 2008). And FISA’s ex parte review procedure has withstood numerous constitutional challenges. See, e.g., El-Mezain, 664 F.3d at 567-69; Damrah, 412 F.3d at 624-25; Isa, 923 F.2d at 1306-07; United States v. Ott, 827 F.2d 473, 476-77 (9th Cir. 1987); Belfield, 692 F.2d at 148.
This case amply illustrates why Congress created FISA’s procedures. Classified information is too sensitive to be shared with individuals who lack a “need-to-know,” regardless of their possession of a security clearance, thus FISA directs courts to assess the legality of the collection ex parte and in camera. A court may deviate from this procedure only in the rare case in which the legality of the FISA collection cannot be adjudicated without disclosing portions of the FISA materials to the defense. This is not that case. The district court found that it was “capable” of assessing the legality of the FISA collection ex parte and in camera, and that is what the court should have done.
Respectfully submitted.
The case went to trial. There was nothing about 13 Section 215 or the FAA disclosed. In fact, there was just a 14 traditional FISA notice. And I'm responding to something that 15 Mr. Ridgway said about providing the notice and to your 16 question about them not knowing we not knowing what they 17 don't know or et cetera, et cetera. After conviction after a 18 jury trial Mr. Mohamud was provided notice that I believe it 19 was Section 215 was, in fact, used in that case. And we 20 spelled this out in our briefs.

On March 3, 2015, the Court granted the ACLU’s motion in part, finding that DOJ had improperly limited its search under part 3 of the ACLU’s request by reading the word “governing” into the request where it had not been written, and ordered DOJ to conduct a new search without the improperly-added limiting term and to release any responsive records not entitled to be withheld under a FOIA exemption.

Defendant Central Intelligence Agency","The ACLU filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the National Security Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

The plaintiffs filed a motion for injunctive and other appropriate relief, which was denied.","On November 17, 2016, the ACLU and the ACLU Foundation filed this Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the National Security Agency (NSA), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in New York. The plaintiffs sought information concerning the scope of the government's warrantless surveillance programs operated under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and related records showing how this surveillance affects Americans.

The New York Times Company et al v. U.S. Department Of Justice Assigned to: Judge Lewis A. Kaplan Cause: 05:552 Freedom of Information Act
U.S. Government Defendant","On May 12, 2016, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) seeking documents related to the detention and removal of Maher Arar from the United States to Syria. Arar claimed that he was tortured by the Syrian government while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) in Syria. The OIG issued a classified report in March 2008 on the removal of Arar. The FOIA request was granted by the court on May 12, 2016. The court granted the OIG's motion for summary judgment, and the case was closed.",The New York Times Company filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the United States Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act (F.I.A.) and the Open Records Act (O.J.). The complaint alleged that the government violated the FOIA by refusing to provide the company with information it had requested under the FOIA. The court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and granted the plaintiff's request for partial summary judgment.
304,NS-TX-0003,"In 2014, two activists filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas against the National Security Agency and the U.S. Department of Justice, alleging violations of the plaintiffs' First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment Rights and requesting declaratory relief. On August 6, 2015, the District Court issued an order staying this case for six months since the plaintiffs' case was based largely on pending litigation in other courts. This case is administratively closed.","7. This is an action for monetary relief as a result of the Government's illegal and unconstitutional use of an electronic surveillance program in violation of the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the U.S Constitution. In addition, this lawsuit challenges and the Plaintiffs sue the Government's expansive acquisition of Plaintiffs' telephone records under Sec 215 of the Patriot Act, 50 USC 1860 and the legality of a secret and illegal scheme to intercept and analyze vast quantities of communications. The NSA's surveillance program is an internal Government computer system used to manage domestic and foreign intelligence collected from electronic service providers. Government officials have indicated this program has been in place for seven years and that it collects records of all communications companies including Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint. The Government has acknowledged that it is collecting ""metadata"" of every phone call made or received by residents of the United States, and these records provide intricate details, including the identity ofthe individual who was spoken to, the length of time of the conversation, and where the conversation took place. Moreover, it gives the Government a comprehensive record of an individual's associations, speech, and public movements while revealing personal details about an individual's familial, political, professional, religious, and intimate associations. Such telephony metadata includes comprehensive communications routing information, including but not limited to session identifiing information (e.g. originating and terminating telephone number, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, etc.) trunk identifier, telephone calling card numbers, and time and duration of call.
U.S. District Court [LIVE] Western District of Texas (El Paso) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE 3:14−cv−00050−KC
U.S. Government Defendant","This is a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas against the City of El Paso and several of its residents alleging violation of the Constitution, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The suit was originally filed in June 2013 and is still ongoing. The parties have not reached a settlement.","The plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs allege that the Government's electronic surveillance program violated the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the U,S. Constitution. The case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), and the plaintiffs sought monetary and other relief."
305,NS-UT-0002,"In 2017, an American Citizen who is a cleric at a mosque in Salt Lake City filed this complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. The plaintiff alleged that his placement on the FBI’s “terrorist watchlist” violated his Fifth Amendment Rights, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Constitution’s non-delegation doctrine. In 2018, the District Court granted the government’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Tenth Circuit affirmed in 2019. ","2. Standing Defendants next contend that Plaintiffs have not adequately established their standing to bring these claims. In particular, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded a real and immediate threat of injury because the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint do not contain sufficient detail from which to infer Plaintiffs' present status on the Watch List and the consequences flowing therefrom (e.g., additional screening when flying or reentering the country). To establish standing, a plaintiff must set forth specific facts to demonstrate that (1) he has ""suffered an 'injury in fact'... which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) 'actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical""; 2) there exists ""a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of'; and (3) ""it must be 'likely,' as opposed to merely 'speculative,' that the injury will be 'redressed by a favorable decision.""' Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992) (citations and footnote omitted). Plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for every claim, but a claim is justiciable ifeven only one plaintiffhas standing to raise it. Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352, 370-71 (4th Cir. 2014). Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a constitutional injury in fact. The Amended Complaint contains sufficient factual detail to infer at this stage that Plaintiffs are presently on the Watch List and face ongoing, real-world consequences as a result, such as additional screening when they fly or enter the country and the inability to obtain a job at an airport. Therefore, Plaintiffs have standing to assert their claims.4 B. Count 1: Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Claim The Due Process Clause guarantees that ""[n]o person shall be... deprived oflife, liberty, or property, without due process oflaw."" U.S Const. amend V. ""The procedural component of due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of 'liberty' or 'property' interests within the meaning ofthe Due Process Clause."" D.B v. Carda/I, 826 F.3d 721, 741 (4th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). A procedural due process claim requires a plaintiff to show ""(1) a cognizable liberty or property interest; (2) the deprivation ofthat interest by some form ofstate action; and (3) that the procedures employed were constitutionally inadequate."" Shirvinski v. U.S. Coast Guard, 673 F.3d 308, 314 (4th Cir. 2012). As a threshold matter, therefore, the government action complained ofmust ""deprive individuals of'liberty' or 'property' interests within the meaning ofthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment."" Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976). If 4 The Court also finds that Plaintiffs have alleged facts that make their claims against the CBP plausible at this stage. Plaintiffs allege that the CBP enforces and implements the challenged actions of the other Defendants, including the detention of persons on the Watch List for additional screening when they reenter the country at a land border or port. and accordingly that the CBP has engaged in the actions that Plaintiffs challenge as illegal. Thus, it is plausible that the CBP may need to be included in any remedial orders.","On July 20, 2017, Utah resident Yusuf Awadir Abdi filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah challenging his placement on the federal government's terrorist watchlist, which he alleges subjects him to enhanced screening at the airport and requires the government to label him as a ""known or suspected terrorist"" and disseminate that information to government and private entities. On July 21, 2017, the court dismissed the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for a violation of substantive due process and failed to show that any recognized reputational interest was harmed.",The plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs alleged that the CBP violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments by detaining plaintiffs on the Watch List for additional screening when they reenter the country at a land border or port. The court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the plaintiffs had not adequately established their standing to bring this suit. The case is now closed.

4. News reports described Defendants’ implementation of the E.O. as “chaotic” and “total[ly] lack[ing]... clarity and direction.” Id. 7 n.3. Demonstrators and pro bono attorneys appeared in airports across the country by the thousands. As discussed below, different enforcement issues arose as local CBP officials in the various airports and border crossings struggled to implement the E.O. with no advance notice and little guidance. E.g., Compl. 8; see Section IV. A, infra. Within days, various judicial orders were entered barring implementation of portions of the E.O Compl. 6.
The need for prompt resolution is particularly acute in these cases. The records sought involve an Executive Order that has been the subject of substantial media coverage and is a source of ongoing public debate. Plaintiffs sought expedited processing of their FOIA requests in order to provide the public with information about how the CBP read and implemented the E.O. in various local international airports and border crossings across the country. See Compl. 23-26. This has been, and continues to be, a matter of pressing public concern Id. 5-12.

307,NS-WA-0003,"In 2015, two foreign nationals and the estate of a third foreign national filed this suit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants committed human rights abuses against them, including torture, non-consensual human experimentation, and war crimes, during their detention by the United States. The parties settled via a confidential settlement agreement. ","Defendants designed, developed, and implemented a program intended to inflict physical pain and mental suffering on Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs were tortured and cruelly treated as a consequence of their inclusion in that program. Defendants also experimented on Plaintiffs without their consent by attempting to induce in them a state of “learned helplessness” to break their wills by torturing and cruelly-treating them, and by monitoring, recalibrating, and refining their mistreatment based on their assessment of Plaintiffs’ and other prisoners’ physical and psychological reactions to torture and cruel treatment.

CACI Premier Technology, 119 F.Supp.3d 21 434 (E.D.Va. 2015), where the court dismissed the action based on the political question 22 doctrine. Although the parties agree Al Shimari is relevant, and Plaintiffs cite the Fourth 23 Circuit opinion, as discussed infra, in regard to ATS jurisdiction, the District Court’s 24 opinion is not controlling authority. The case is currently on appeal to the Fourth Circuit.
Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the acts of Defendants “touch and concern” the 2 United States, such as to rebut the presumption against extraterritorial application of the 3 ATS.

5. This case presents a model situation for class treatment. Defendants' conduct including its refusal to allow any Cuban-born on the Fathom cruise line to Cuba is uniform among all passengers. The application of Florida federal law to a shared course of conduct will determine liability for members of the putative class as a whole, ensuring that the rights of thousands of individuals are vindicated through the efficiency of a single trial.
6. During the Class Period, Plaintiff Amparo Sanchez resided in, and continues to reside in, the Southern District of Florida.
7. During the Class Period, Plaintiff Francisco Marty resided in, and continues to reside in, the Southern District of Florida. Francisco Marty is a United States Army Veteran and a frequent passenger on Carnival cruise lines. He is an actual VIP cruiser with Carnival.
28. The proposed Class IS so numerous that joinder of all members would be 5 impracticable. Defendants sell (or refuse to sell) thousands of cruise line reservations nationwide. The individual Class members are ascertainable, as the names and addresses of all class members can be identified in the business records maintained by Defendants. The precise number of Class members for the Class is at least in the thousands and can only be obtained through discovery, but the numbers are clearly more than can be consolidated in one complaint such that it would be impractical for each member to bring suit individually.

","41. In addition, the UNC Determination Letter “determined” that UNC was in violation of Title IX because of UNC’s compliance with the Act. 42.
110. Based on those settled principles, the Department’s attempt to impose novel and unforeseeable interpretations of Title IX and VAWA on North Carolina constitutes a violation of the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment. When North Carolina officials and agencies accepted the conditions originally attached to federal funding under those statutes, they could not have foreseen the radical change in those conditions represented by the Department’s recent determination letters. Furthermore, by deeming North Carolina in violation of its novel reinterpretation of Title IX and VAWA, the Department has attempted to coerce North Carolina into complying with the Department’s illegal demand, in violation of the Tenth Amendment.
Following a one-day special session, held March 23, 2016, the state legislature passed Session Law 2016-3, titled “An Act to Provide for Single-Sex Multiple Occupancy Bathroom and Changing Facilities in Schools and Public Agencies and to Create Statewide Consistency in Regulation of Employment and Public Accommodations,” commonly known either as the “Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act,” or “HB2” (the “Act”). See H.B. 2, 2016 Sess L. 3 (N.C. 2016). Section 1 of the Act, which is the most relevant section for purposes of these lawsuits, targets directly Charlotte’s Ordinance. It requires “local boards of education” and “public accommodations” to adhere to a single sex, multiple occupancy bathroom policy, with “sex” defined as “biological” or “physical” sex as “stated on a person’s birth certificate.” See id. §§ 1.2 1.3; see also id. § 1.1. Other provisions of the Act preempt local government control over the minimum wage, id. § 2.1; the power of local government to condition contracts with private parties on certain conditions or employment practices inconsistent with state law, id. §§ 2.2 2.3; and local discrimination ordinances. See id. §§ 3.1 3.3. Governor McCrory signed the Act into law on the March 23, 2016, session date.1 B. Subsequent Litigation The Act has been met both with ire and praise.

All three letters were to the same effect:  1 of the Act violates federal law. The cases were filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina and the Western District of Virginia.","In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice and the ACLU of North Carolina filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of the Carolinas. The complaint alleged that the North Carolina General Assembly's passage of the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act in March 2016 violated Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) by requiring local boards of education and public accommodations to adhere to a single sex, multiple occupancy bathroom policy. The case was brought on behalf of persons born biologically female but who live their lives as males, who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and who received hormone therapy to assist in the treatment of their medical condition.

Subsequent to the Obergefell decision in June 2015 by the Supreme Court, Judge R. David Proctor dismissed this case without prejudice in October 2015, and costs were to be taxed against the defendants. The plaintiffs’ appealed to the Eleventh Circuit in January 2016, but in February 2017, the Eleventh Circuit upheld the district court’s ruling that there was no judicially sanctioned change in the relationship of the parties that would justify an award of attorney’s fees.

Toby Douglas, the Director of the California Department of Health Care Services,1 appeals the district court’s preliminary injunction precluding enforcement of California Welfare and Institutions Code § 14105.191(f), which amended California’s Medicaid Plan and set provider reimbursement rates for the 2009–2010 rate year, and for each year thereafter. The Developmental Services Network and the United Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children’s Foundation of Los Angeles and Ventura County, and the California Association of Health Facilities2 challenged the law under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Supremacy *543 Clause3 because the State did not obtain federal approval of its State Plan Amendment (“SPA”) prior to implementing the rate changes. The State argues that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the preliminary injunction because the Providers have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits, or irreparable harm, or that the balance of equities and the public interest warrant an injunction. We vacate the preliminary injunction and remand.

315,PB-DC-0009,"In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (“Obamacare”) that expanded Medicare coverage to include additional groups of beneficiaries. Arkansas approved a work requirement in Medicaid as a requirement for health coverage in its amendments on March 5, 2018.

On August 14, 2018, three individuals filed a suit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as administrators involved in implementing the Arkansas Works Amendments (AMA) in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the SSA and the Constitution in approving the AWA in March 2018. All three plaintiffs were beneficiaries of Medicaid who lost or risked losing medical coverage due to changes in the AWA. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the AWA and attorney fees. 

On March 27, 2019, the court held that the AWA work requirement does not advance the purpose of the SSA. The court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and vacated the approval for Arkansas’s program. On April 10, 2019, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 

On February 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's judgment vacating the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas Works Amendments. The court emphasized that providing healthcare coverage is the primary purpose of Medicaid. The defendants' alternative objectives of better health outcomes, financial independence, and transition to commercial coverage, on the other hand, were not consistent with Medicaid. The court found the Secretary's approval of the Arkansas program to be arbitrary and capricious due to the failure to consider whether the program would result in loss of coverage, an important aspect of the approval analysis.","9. This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Social Security Act, and the United States Constitution.

Yet a separate question remains: what is the proper remedy? In Stewart I, the Court vacated the approval and remanded to the Secretary. Here, however, the Government argues that vacatur is improper both because, unlike Kentucky, AWA is already active and halting it would be quite disruptive, and because any error is easily fixed, just as it has been for Kentucky. The challengers disagree, positing that the deficiency in the approval is substantial and that any resulting disruption is outweighed by the ongoing harms suffered by the more than 16,000 Arkansans who have lost their Medicaid coverage. Given the seriousness of the deficiencies — which, as this Court explains in a separate Opinion issued today, the remand in Kentucky did not cure — and the absence of lasting harms to the Government relative to the significant ones suffered by Arkansans like Plaintiffs, the Court will vacate the Secretary’s approval and remand for further proceedings.

The plaintiffs alleged that HHS's implementation of the 2016 Rule's prohibition on categorical coverage exclusions for gender-affirming care, as well as its incorporation of Title IX's religious exemption, was arbitrary and capricious. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, but denied their motion for a stay of enforcement of the repeal of the prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex stereotyping and the incorporation of the religious exemption.","This case was brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Los Angeles LGBT Center and the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights (A.H.R.) on behalf of several health care providers who alleged that the federal government violated the First Amendment by denying them the right to equal protection under the law.

319,PB-FL-0004,"On January 15, 2008, a group of Medicaid-eligible adults with disabilities that were confined to a nursing-home facility filed a class action in U.S. District Court against Florida's Health Care Administration and Department of Elder Affairs. The plaintiffs claimed that the state discriminated against them by failing to offer services that would enable them to live in a community setting. After a bench trial, the court entered judgment for one of the named plaintiffs and decertified the class that he had previously approved. In part because of recent legislation that greatly improved the state's efficiency at moving eligible persons from nursing homes to community living, the court determined that the conditions allowing for the class no longer existed.","147.

I certified a class and entered a preliminary injunction in favor of one named plaintiff, Clayton Griffin. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction.
An unrelated legislative development—a virtually limitless appropriation for transitioning Medicaid beneficiaries from nursing homes into the community—led to substantial changes in the state’s Medicaid program. At the parties’ request, I stayed the litigation for a year, while the state implemented the changes and the plaintiffs evaluated their effect on the plaintiffs’ claims. The plaintiffs were not satisfied, and the litigation resumed. Following a bench trial, I now make permanent the injunction in Mr. Griffin’s favor, dismiss as moot the claims of the other named plaintiffs, and decertify the class, on the ground that it is no longer true—as it was when the class was certified—that the case meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b).
III Clayton L. Griffin is the only one of the original seven named plaintiffs who still has a claim. In 2004, at the age of 51, Mr. Griffin suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed on the left side. He is confined to a wheelchair and needs assistance to get in and out of bed, to shower, to dress, and to use the bathroom. When this lawsuit was filed, Mr. Griffin was living in a nursing home. The cost of the nursing home was covered by the state’s Medicaid program Mr. Griffin wished to live in the community rather than in a nursing home. In order to do that, Mr. Griffin needed four hours of personal-attendant care per day, isolated emergency personal-attendant care, and the same outside medical care that would be covered if Mr. Griffin remained in a nursing home. The state refused to provide these services. On June 14, 2008, Mr. Griffin moved out of the nursing home and began living by himself in an apartment complex, despite the state’s refusal to pay for the needed services. A certified nursing assistant went to his apartment for two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening to assist Mr. Griffin with activities of daily living. He had a visiting nurse and visiting physician who provided needed medical care Mr. Griffin spent time in his apartment but also went out into the community using public transportation. He had friends and relatives in the apartment complex Mr. Griffin’s quality of life—at least in his opinion—was substantially better than it had been in the nursing home.

320,PB-FL-0006,"On September 6, 2011, a resident of Florida and applicant for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) assistance filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action against the Florida Department of Children and Families in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division. The plaintiff claimed that Florida's TANF application requirement that all applicants undergo suspicionless drug testing in order to be considered for assistance constituted an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The District Court has issued a preliminary injunction and has certified the class action; an appeal of the injunction to the Eleventh Circuit is pending.","15. The Plaintiff Class consists of all individuals residing in Florida who are applying for, or will in the future apply for, Temporary Cash Assistance, Florida's program to distribute TANF benefits, and who will be subject to Defendant's suspicionless drug testing as a result ofliB 353.
16. According to the DCF website's ""Standard Reports,"" in July 2011 there were 1,107 first-time applicants for TANFtrCA statewide.' All ofth... applicants will be subject to Defendant's suspicioniess drug testing as a result ofllB 353.
The Secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families (“State”) appeals from the district court’s order enjoining the State of Florida from requiring Luis W. Lebron to submit to a suspicionless drug test pursuant to Section 414.0652 of the Florida Statutes, as a condition for receipt of government-provided monetary assistance for which he was otherwise qualified.
Florida’s mandatory drug-testing requirement for all TANF applicants was enacted in May 2011.
In addition to the mandatory drug test, applicants are required to sign a release acknowledging their consent to be tested Id. § 414.0652(2)(e). At the time Lebron applied for TANF benefits, he was notified of Florida’s mandatory drug testing requirement and that he was required to sign the release before DCF would allow him to proceed with the application process. Lebron signed the release, completed the application process and was found eligible for TANF benefits. However, he did not submit to the drug test, but instead filed this lawsuit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of Florida’s mandatory suspicionless drug testing as a violation of his and all other TANF applicants’ Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The district court granted a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the drug testing statute against Lebron and the State agreed to discontinue its drug testing regime as to all TANF applicants until this litigation is fully resolved.
II. Discussion The Fourth Amendment protects the rights of individuals “to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” U.S Const. amend IV. It is undisputed and well-established that government-mandated drug testing is a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. See e.g., Bd. of Educ v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 828 (2002); Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 313 (1997); Vernonia Sch Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652 (1995); Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989); Skinner v Ry. Labor Execs.’ Ass’n, 489 U.S. 602, 614–15 (1989). Thus, the question before us is whether Florida’s mandatory, suspicionless drug-testing of all TANF applicants is a constitutionally reasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. See Skinner, 489 U.S. at 618–19 (“To hold that the Fourth Amendment is applicable to... drug and alcohol testing... is only to begin the inquiry into the standards governing such intrusions.”).

Luis Lebron sued the Secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families (the “State”), claiming that the statute violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. After we affirmed the entry of a preliminary injunction barring the application of the statute against Lebron, the State halted the drug-testing program. See Lebron v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Children Families (Lebron I), 710 F.3d 1202 (11th Cir. 2013). Since then, the district court granted final summary judgment to Lebron, declared § 414.0652 unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined its enforcement.
B. On behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated persons, Lebron commenced this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida on September 6, 2011, against the Secretary of DCF in his official capacity. Lebron sought a declaration that requiring suspicionless drug testing for TANF eligibility under § 414.0652 violated the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. Lebron also asked for a permanent injunction barring the enforcement of § 414.0652. Lebron filed a motion for a preliminary injunction with his complaint. On October 24, 2011, the district court preliminarily enjoined the State from requiring that Lebron submit to a suspicionless drug test pursuant to § 414.0652 as a condition for receiving TANF benefits until the case was resolved.

They claimed that the State’s failure to place them in a community based program, with the ultimate goal of integrating them into the mainstream of society, violated Title II of the ADA. The District Court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the mentally disabled plaintiffs, holding that the State had violated the ADA, and rejected the State’s defense that inadequate funding, rather than discrimination, was the reason for retaining the plaintiffs in an institution. The District Court also rejected the State’s defense that, since the State was already using all available funds to provide services to other persons with disabilities, requiring immediate transfers would “fundamentally alter” the State’s activities. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court, but remanded for a reassessment of the State’s cost based defense. The Eleventh Circuit held that the District Court erred in absolutely ruling out lack of funding as a defense, stating that the State could prevail on this theory if it could prove that requiring it to provide community based integrated services to the plaintiffs would cost so much that, given the demands of the State’s mental health budget, it would fundamentally alter the services provided by the State.

After a period of litigation, the parties settled and the state agreed to help individuals in institutions receive waiver services. ","4. Medicaid Waiver Services. In addition to the mandatory and optional services offered under a state‟s Medicaid State Plan, a state may also enter into an agreement with the federal government to offer services under a waiver program, such as a Home and CommunityBased (“HCBS”) waiver program. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c). With “waiver” services, the state has requested (and the federal government has agreed) to “waive” certain requirements of the Medicaid Act without jeopardizing federal financial participation. 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(3). In this way, the Medicaid Act allows states to provide an enhanced benefit package to certain populations within the state. The Medicaid Act allows the states to enhance their benefit package in waiver programs in two ways. First, a state can provide more of a Medicaid-covered service to a waiver recipient than to a non-waiver Medicaid recipient. Thus, even though a nonwaiver Medicaid recipient can only receive 45 days of inpatient hospitalization per year, a waiver recipient might be able to receive significantly more days. Second, a state can provide services to waiver recipients that are not listed among the 29 mandatory and optional Medicaid services, including respite care, homemaker and companion services, and habilitation services. 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(4)(B). As a result of this waiver authority, Florida has created waiver programs with enhanced benefit packages targeted to Medicaid-eligible persons with HIV/AIDS, traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, cystic fibrosis, autism, spina bifida, and cerebral palsy, among others. These waiver programs, with explicit federal knowledge and approval, exclude and deny these enhanced benefits to persons who do not have the specific disabling condition targeted by the waiver program.

The parties ultimately settled and the state agreed to provide the Plaintiffs with community-based services. ","32. The State of Georgia voluntarily ended its ability to provide SOURCE services to people with mental illnesses and developmental disabilities.
Georgia’s use of Medicaid waivers has also increased dramatically since 2003... Georgia has also opened the SOURCE program to the mental health and developmentally disabled population. SOURCE is a primary care, enhanced case management model. In 2003, just less than 3,000 persons received treatment through SOURCE. By 2009, the number was over 18,000. (Declaration under penalty of perjury, Par. 41 of Frank E. Shelp, M.D., M.P.H. February 22, 2010, filed in United States of America v. State of Georgia, et al., Civil Action No. 1:09-CV-0119-CAP United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia).

Plaintiffs are qualified people with disabilities. Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs are disabled. As in Olmstead, these plaintiffs have shown that they are “’qualified’ for noninstitutional care: The State's own professionals determined that community-based treatment would be appropriate for [them] and [none] opposed such treatment.” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602-603.
The plaintiffs are adults with mental disabilities who have been receiving services under a Georgia Medicaid program called “Service Options Using Resources in a Community Environment (“SOURCE”). (Compl. 1). Services provided through the SOURCE program include nursing and health-related support services, medically-related personal care and case management. See Georgia Department of Community Health, Division of Medical Assistance, Policies and Procedures for Alternative Living Services, at XII-29 (attached as Exhibit 4 to Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj., dated Sept. 10, 2010, ECF. No 11-5). In support of their motion, the plaintiffs have put forth substantial evidence that these services have enabled them to remain in their current residential settings and to avoid the recurrent and long term hospitalizations they have experienced in the past. (See, e.g., Pltfs.’ Mot. for Prelim Inj. at 8, 12, 15, 18, 20, 23.) Plaintiffs have also put forth evidence that, without the SOURCE services provided by the State, or sufficient alternative support services, their health will deteriorate and they will be placed in settings, such as hospitals, shelters and jails, that are far more restrictive than their current settings. (See Declaration of Dr. Richard Elliott, ECF No. 11-11 (“Elliott Decl.”) 34, 42, 60, 69, 75, 77, 96.) All but one of the plaintiffs have been receiving SOURCE benefits in personal care homes licensed by the State. Personal care homes are one source of housing for individuals discharged from the State’s psychiatric hospitals, but they are not the most integrated setting for most individuals with serious mental illness. Supported housing—another type of service setting that exists (albeit in limited supply) in the State’s mental health service system—is an integrated setting in which persons with serious mental illness live in the community and receive flexible support services as needed.4 See Declaration of Michael J. Franczak at 35, Exhibit 20 to United States’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, United States v. Georgia, 09-119 (N.D Ga

In Riley, the plaintiffs sought to certify a subclass of those wrongly denied an available waiver slot in Alabama’s Ho me and Community Based Waiver program. The plaintiffs presented evidence that over 1,600 people were on the waiting list for the program. The court, however, found that the plaintiffs had not established the numerosity requirement. Specifically, the court reasoned that there was no evidence showing how many open waiver slots existed, or how many individuals on the waiting list had been denied an open slot.
The Defendant contends GAPP policy allows for a request for a nurse to accompany a GAPP member to a medical visit using non-emergency transportation. (See Def.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J., Ex. E, Collins Dep. at 65-66). The Plaintiffs contend that GAPP does not allow for non-emergency transportation of nurses unless the Plaintiffs have shown they have no other form of transportation. However, the Plaintiffs have not provided evidence to suggest they ha ve been denied any requests for nonemergency transportation with their nurses.Indeed, Plaintiff Hunter has traveled with a nurse to doctor appointm ents through the non-em ergency travel program. (See Def.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J., Ex. L, Lynah Dep. at 63-64). Accordingly, the Defendant’s motion for partial summary judgment should be granted in this respect.

Hours may be reduced on an evaluation of the current medical plan of treatment (physician orders); updated physician sum maries; provider agency documented current assessments and nursing care… the GAPP Manual states it is “ the expectation that the prim ary caregiver(s) will becom e competent to assume some responsibility for the care of the child.” (Pl’s Ex. 18).

They all had been receiving medically necessary therapies paid for by the State's Medicaid program, administered by the FSAA, for several years. These therapies were necessary to ensure the plaintiffs' conditions would not deteriorate and that they would not lose functional ability. The FSSA had denied the named plaintiffs and others similarly situated continuing access to these therapies, citing two provisions of the Indiana Administrative Code. On February 10, 2011, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs, issuing a permanent injunction preventing the Defendants and their successors from limiting or denying coverage for prescribed physical, occupational, or respiratory therapy, and/or speech pathology, for any person under 21 enrolled in the State's Medicaid program when such denial or limitation was based upon the two disputed provisions.","with milnimal documented change in [J.J.M.'s] condition.""

In an oft-cited opinion, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has characterized the statutory and regulatory framework for the Medicaid program as representing “among the most completely impenetrable texts within human experience.” Rehab. Ass’n of Virginia v. Kozlowski, 42 F.3d 1444, 1450 (4th Cir. 1994). Although the present case concerns the nuances of federal Medicaid law, the questions that it presents are actually quite simple. The plaintiffs are all seriously disabled children for whom therapy services have been prescribed by their treating physicians in order to ward against or otherwise prevent significant regression in their conditions. Notwithstanding both these recommendations and the indisputable fact that the plaintiffs will lose physical and intellectual function absent the continuation of these therapies, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration has begun refusing to provide Medicaid 1 On March 25, 2010, the plaintiffs filed their Motion for Class Certification (R Doc. 10). Briefing on this issue is proceeding, and it is anticipated that this Motion will be fully briefed in advance of the preliminary injunction hearing presently scheduled for May 28,
The named plaintiffs are all Medicaid enrollees who are eligible for EPSDT services as a result of their age. For several years, the plaintiffs have received Medicaid payment for therapies prescribed by their treatment physicians:
The question in this case is whether Indiana is required to provide Medicaid coverage to eligible individuals under the age of twenty-one for placement in long-term PRTFs, or whether Indiana’s obligations under Medicaid are limited to coverage of the acute treatment options currently available in its inpatient psychiatric hospitals. Essentially, the issue boils down to whether Indiana’s exclusion of PRTFs encompasses ‘necessary’ medical services and whether a state has the discretion to make such exclusions under the Act[.] Id. at 373–74. After rejecting the State’s position it was not required to cover long-term placement and that such placement could not be medically necessary, the Collins court explicitly found “that Indiana is required to fund the cost of placement in a PRTF if it is deemed ‘medically necessary’ by an EPSDT screening.” Id. at 376; see also id. at 376 n.8 (quoted supra).
916. This conclusion—that “the services required by the EPSDT mandate are more broad than [the d]efendants would suggest”—was also supported by case law Id. at 916–17 (citing Rosie D v. Romney, 410 F.Supp.2d 18 (D. Mass 2006), S.D v. Hood, 391 F.3d 581 (5th Cir. 2004), and Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc v. Arkansas Dep’t of Human Servs., 443 F.3d 1005 (8th Cir. 2006)).13 13 On appeal, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision in PLEAS. 339 Fed Appx. 542 (6th Cir. 2009). In so doing, it focused on the mandate of 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) that rehabilitative services be covered, and did not venture into the mandate that preventative services also be covered. However, the court soundly rejected the state agency’s contention that the Indeed, the “maintenance therapy” at issue in this case has as its very root the word “maintain,” which is defined to include “preserve from failure or decline” and “to keep in an existing state.” See WEBSTER’S SEVENTH NEW COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 509 (1972). The clear implication is, to put it crassly, that something bad will happen absent these services. In the case of the plaintiffs and the members of the putative class, this “something bad” is significant regression in their conditions, the loss of functionality and the ability to assist in their activities of daily living, the deterioration of muscles and tendons, and the potential need for multiple surgeries that would not otherwise be required. At the very least, the therapies at issue in this case qualify as “preventative services” under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13), and must therefore be covered pursuant to the State’s EPSDT obligation. The plaintiffs are therefore exceedingly likely to prevail on the merits of their legal claims.

The plaintiffs alleged that underfunding and the flawed design of the 2020 Census might lead to undercounts of the US population in violation of the Enumeration Clause and to the detriment of minority populations, as the census count is tied to both public funding and governmental representation. The plaintiffs requested an injunction to require the US to develop a plan to ensure a fair and accurate count. The court dismissed the claim for injunctive relief as unripe because census preparations were ongoing, but allowed the claim on underfunding to continue.

Next, addressing the APA claims, the court held that the plaintiffs had failed to identify any reviewable ""agency action"" over which the court could exercise jurisdiction. Finally, the court held that despite the fact that the APA claims were articulated as requests to ""set aside agency action"" under Section 706(2), those claims were, in substance, requests to ""compel agency action"" under Section 706(1).

328,PB-ME-0002,"On December 18, 2009 three young adult residents of Maine who were Medicaid recipients and who were diagnosed with cerebral palsy, filed a lawsuit against the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services in her official capacity. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. The plaintiffs alleged that DHHS had violated Title II of the ADA and other federal laws. The Plaintiffs alleged that the State had failed to accommodate Plaintiffs' disabilities and to provide medically necessary treatment in the most integrated setting possible, instead forcing them into nursing homes where they were functionally segregated from the outside world. In August, 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint reframing the case as a class action on behalf of all similarly situated Maine residents. The parties began settlement discussions shortly thereafter. On May 2, 2012, the Court (Judge Nancy Torresen) approved the settlement. The settlement agreement required the State to establish a Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver (HCBW) program, which would provide a limited number of qualifying class-members the opportunity to live in community-based settings. The case is presumably closed.","77. The Plaintiffs qualify for the Defendant’s program of long-term rehabilitative services, and would benefit from specialized services provided in a community based setting. Although the community is the most integrated setting appropriate to meet their needs, the Plaintiffs remain institutionalized in nursing facilities. By denying them access to existing community programs and by requiring that Plaintiffs be confined in the segregated nursing facilities in order to receive needed rehabilitative services, the Defendant violates Section 504.
45. The Defendant currently provides services in community-based settings to permit some individuals with mental retardation, autism, and other disabilities to live in the community. These individuals have functional limitations that are similar to those of the Named Plaintiffs. However, the Defendant has refused to make these programs and services available to the Named Plaintiffs and other similarly situated individuals D. The Americans with Disabilities Act And Its Integration Mandate
83. The Defendant has failed to provide the Named Plaintiffs and members of the putative class with medically necessary services with reasonable promptness. These services include, inter alia, specialized services while confined to the nursing facility and long-term care services and supports sufficient to permit them to live in the community. In so doing, the Defendant operates the MaineCare program in violation of 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(8), (a)(10)(A).
The three named Plaintiffs in this case are young men with diagnoses of Cerebral Palsy who are confined to nursing facilities due to the Defendant’s failure to provide them with adequate services that if provided could enable them to live in the community. Each Plaintiff has the right under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 to appropriate services in the least restrictive setting; however, until such services are made available to them, they have no choice but to live in nursing facilities. While they remain in nursing facilities, the law requires that Defendants ensure that they receive services “directed toward (i) The acquisition of the behaviors necessary … to function with as much self-determination and independence as possible; and (ii) The prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current optimal functional status.” 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.120(a)(2), 483.440(a). The Defendant has failed to provide these services. Because the lack of these services is causing Plaintiffs irreparable harm, as they regress, lose skills, and are denied the chance to develop new ones, Plaintiffs request a preliminary injunction that requires Defendant to comply with the Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) requirements of the Nursing Home Reform Amendments (NHRA) and to provide these important services with “reasonable promptness” in compliance with federal Medicaid law.3 3 See Counts V, VI and VII of Plaintiffs’ First Amended Class Action Complaint.

While these factors do not control the court’s analysis, they include t he nature and extent of the intervener’s interest, the intervener’s standing to raise relevant legal issues, the legal position the intervener seeks to advance, and its probable relatoin to the merits of the case. Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Ed., 552 F.2d 1326, 1329 (9th Cir. 1977). The court may also consider whether changes have occurred in the litigation so that interven tion that was once denied shoul d be reexamined, whether the interveners’ interests are adequatelyrepresented by other parties, whether intervention will prolong or unduly delay the litigation, and whether parties seeking i ntervention will significantly contribute to full development of the underlying factual issues in the suit.

A. The Court Has Already Denied Plaintiffs’ Request for Temporary Injunctive Relief. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this action July 1, 2011 [D.E. 1], in which the Plaintiffs sought temporary, preliminary, and perm anent injunctive relief. In order to comply with the Local Rules requiring pleadings to redact or alter the names of minor children, Plaintiffs re-filed their Complaint on July 5, 2011 [D.E. 6] in wh ich they sought the sam e relief. Although Plaintiffs did not file a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order w ith or in the 10 days af ter filing their Com plaint, the Cour t took up consideration of Plai ntiffs’ request for tem porary injunctive relief in its July 12, 2011 Order. [D.E. 19]. The Court found that the Plaintiffs had not met the requirem ents for tem porary injunctive relief set o ut in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008). The Court noted that as alleged in the Complaint, “all plaintiffs are continuing to r eceive services, albeit with reduced budgets... ” [D.E. 19, p. 3]. The Court denied Plaintiffs’ request for temporary injunctive relief.
Further, while the Plaintiffs have known that there would be additional reductions in their respective Support Needs Matrix budgets effective January 1, 2012 for at least 8 m onths, the moving Plaintiffs have waited until the last m inute to bring the instant motion. The Plaintiffs’ delay has created a significant difficulty on the PBH Defendants to respond to the instant motion, and indeed this appears to have been part of Plaintiffs’ strategy. PBH’s offices will be closed on December 26-27 for th e Christmas holiday, and PBH employees who woul d be n ecessary to fully respond to the instant m otion will be out of the office. C ounsel’s law offices will likewis e be closed during the Christmas holidays. Further, at least one of the undersigned counsel will be out of the S tate for 10 days beginning December 23, making participation in the response and hearing on this matter difficult.
On December 20, 2011, Plaintiffs K.C., D.C., and M.S. moved the Court for a Temporary Restraining Order to prevent Defendants from imposing significant reductions in their Medicaid services effective January 1, 2012.

Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, at Raleigh.
The case involves the delivery of Medicaid services to a class of North Carolina Medicaid recipients who suffer from chronic disabilities such as cerebral palsy, seizure disorders, mental retardation, and autism. While plaintiffs’ conditions are serious enough to qualify them for institutional placement, they are able to live in community environments with the assistance of certain support services. For example, named plaintiff D.C. is a teenage Medicaid recipient with severe autism. Although he is verbally non-communicative and requires supervision at all times, D.C. is able to live at home with the help of professionals who teach him basic skills such as eating, dressing, and personal hygiene, and who provide temporary care for him when his parents are unavailable.
The district court ruled on plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on March 29, 2012.

2008. As part of the settlement, the State agreed to convene “workgroups” to study issues relating to the State’s system of providing services to the developmentally disabled. The State also agreed to implement new procedures for handling requests for such services. For their part, the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their claims with prejudice, provided that the district court retained jurisdiction to decide the issue of attorneys’ fees.
The district court asked the parties whether, having reviewed its memorandum and order, they still requested that it grant their joint motion and stipulation for “approval” of the settlement. Both parties certified that they did, and the court granted their motion, subject to the above understanding. The court then dismissed the entirety of the case with prejudice, except for the issue of attorneys’ fees, which it retained jurisdiction to resolve.
The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in denying their application for attorneys’ fees. They contend that they “prevailed” in the underlying action, because the settlement they reached with the State provided some of the relief that they sought. As prevailing parties, the plaintiffs contend, they are entitled to attorneys’ fees under the applicable federal fee-shifting statutes. We review de novo the legal question whether a litigant is a “prevailing party.” Christina A. ex rel. Jennifer A v. Bloomberg, 315 F.3d 990, 992 (8th Cir. 2003).
The plaintiffs here reached a settlement agreement with the State. The district court did not make any determination as to whether the settlement agreement was “good or bad or fair or unfair.” Nor did the district court incorporate the terms of the agreement into its order of dismissal, or otherwise retain jurisdiction “to enforce or construe the settlement agreement in the future.” As a result, the parties’ settlement does not entail the “judicial approval and oversight,” id., required for a “judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.” Id. at","The plaintiffs alleged that the funding they receive from Nebraska is insufficient and thus ""discriminatory"" because the lack of funds has caused or threatens to cause their institutionalization.

This action is brought by transgender people who wish to correct their Ohio birth certificates to accurately reflect their gender identity. They wish to have access to a birth certificate they can use without being exposed to discrimination and other harm, including a high risk of violence. Although Stacie Ray, Jane Doe, and Ashley Breda are all women, the Ohio Department of Health and Office of Vital Statistics incorrectly identifies them as male on their birth certificates. Although Basil Argento is a man, the Ohio Department of Health and Office of Vital Statistics incorrectly identifies him as female on his birth certificate.
OPINION AND ORDER This matter is before the Court for consideration of Defendants’ Motion to Stay Discovery (ECF No. 21) pending the Court’s ruling on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (ECF No. 18). For the reasons that follow, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Stay Discovery (ECF No. 21.) I. On March 29, 2018, Plaintiffs, Stacie Ray, Basil Argento, Ashley Breda, and Jane Doe (collectively “Plaintiffs”), filed this action against Defendants, Lance Himes, in his official capacity as Director of the Ohio Department of Health; Karen Sorrell, in her official capacity as Chief of the Office of Vital Statistics; and Judith Nagy, in her official capacity as State Registrar of the Office of Vital Statistics (collectively “Defendants”). (ECF No. 1.) Plaintiffs are transgender individuals who seek to change their Ohio birth certificates to reflect their gender identity. Plaintiffs allege that they attempted to change the gender marker on their birth certificates, but the State of Ohio (the “State”) categorically refuses to correct transgender individuals’ birth certificates to match their gender identity. (Id., at 41.) Plaintiffs assert that Defendants violated their constitutional rights by enforcing the State’s policy and bring claims under the Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clause, and First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Code Ann. § 68-3-203(d) (""The sex of an individual shall not be changed on the original certificate of birth as a result of sex change surgery.""). Rather, according to Defendants' motion, Ohio's decision not to allow transgender people to change the sex on their birth certificate-which Defendants do not dispute is the practice of ODH-was adopted by Defendants based on ODH's interpretation of sections 3705.15 and 3705.22 (supported by one probate court case) and the notion that birth certificates record an individual's sex, not their gender identity. Assuming the allegations in the Complaint are true, particularly Plaintiffs' assertion that ""gender identity is the critical determinant of sex[,]"" Comp1.1J21, ECF No. 1, the Court is not convinced that Ohio law prohibits Plaintiffs' request. 4 See Ohio Rev. Code§ 3705.02. Plaintiffs allege that ODH has allowed transgender individuals to change the sex on their birth certificate with a court order in the past Compl. 11 43, ECF No.

The plaintiffs sued Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) and Oklahoma State Department of Human Services (DHS) under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Oklahoma Disability Law Center, sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming violations of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and the 504 Rehabilitation Act. In 2018, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims for mootness because the controversy had been resolved.","1. This is an action brought by seniors and adults with disabilities, all residents of the State of Oklahoma, who are current recipients of the Medicaid ADvantage Waiver or the Medicaid In-Home Supports Waiver for Adults, who have received notice from Defendant Lake’s agency, the Department of Human Services (DHS), that their waiver services will be terminated effective December 1, 2017, and who are at serious risk of institutionalization as a result of the arbitrary decision to terminate​ ​waiver​ ​services​ ​solely​ ​for​ ​economic​ ​reasons.1 2.
95. The In-Home Supports Waiver for Adults is a Medicaid program, operated within the larger “Home and Community Based Services Waivers” program offered by the State of Oklahoma for individuals over the age of 18 with an intellectual disability. ​See ​OAC 317:40-1-1. ​Recipients must ​meet the Institutional Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID) Level of Care requirements​ ​per​ ​OAC​ ​317:30-5-122.
1. This is an action brought by seniors and adults with disabilities, all residents of the State of Oklahoma, who are current recipients of the Medicaid ADvantage Waiver or the Medicaid In-Home Supports Waiver for Adults, who have received notice from Defendant Lake’s agency, the Department of Human Services (DHS), that their waiver services would be terminated effective December 1, 2017, and who are at serious risk of institutionalization as a result of the arbitrary decision to terminate waiver services solely for economic reasons.1 2.
2017. In addition, Plaintiff Davis’s parents were notified that Tomas’s Personal Care Services will be terminated. This means that all Tomas’s DHS services will be terminated.
Plaintiffs filed this putative class action asserting claims against the State of Oklahoma based on alleged violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The claims are based on notices sent in October 2017, to recipients of the Medicaid ADvantage Waiver and the Medicaid In- Home Supports Waiver for Adults programs indicating that, due to budget failures, their waivers allowing for community-based services would be terminated as of December 1,
2017. This case was filed on December 6, 2017.
The court concludes that the provision of funding for maintenance of the programs for the remainder of the fiscal year renders plaintiffs’ claims moot. The harm which plaintiffs sought to avoid — the termination of waiver services — has now been avoided for that period, and it would be pure speculation to presume to know what funding decisions may be made by Oklahoma in future years. The result is there is no current case or controversy subject to judicial resolution.
8. For this reason, plaintiffs argue the state’s conduct is capable of repetition yet evading review, necessitating the declaratory and injunctive relief they seek. The problem with that argument is that, where the claimed discrimination is inextricably tied to the level of future state appropriations, there is no such thing as a “permanent” fix. It is doubtful that the Legislature could assure some future funding level for these programs even if it wanted to.1 Further, acceptance of such a justification for continuing jurisdiction in this court would put it in the position of being some sort of ongoing supervisor of the state budget process, a result that is inconsistent with the federalism and other constitutional principles which guide and limit the resolution of challenges like those asserted here by plaintiffs.2 Should the State of Oklahoma fail to provide funding for community-based services in future fiscal years, or fail to provide for appropriate alternatives if those services are cut, a live case or controversy may then exist. At present, one does not. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. #14] is therefore GRANTED. This case is DISMISSED without prejudice.

In August of 2019, Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Wolf announced a plan to move residents from these two centers to ""community"" residences, which are not isolated and whose treatment is not as intense. The lawsuit alleged that this switch was in violation of the residents' rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Medicaid Act, and that the switch violated residents' substantive due process rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.","1. This action is for declaratory and injunctive relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) (“Section 504”), the Medical Assistance Program authorized by 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq., and the United States Constitution.
17. The Defendant, TOM WOLF (Thomas Westerman Wolf), is the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Governor Wolf is sued in his official capacity only.
19. The Defendant, TERESA D. MILLER, is the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (“DHS”) Ms. Miller is sued in her official capacity. Defendant Miller is ultimately responsible for ensuring that Pennsylvania operates its delivery of services to individuals with disabilities in conformity with the United States Constitution, the ADA, the ADA implementing regulations, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and section 504’s implementing regulations.
794. ODP funds services and supports for eligible Pennsylvania residents with developmental disabilities. The ODP was created “to support Pennsylvanians with developmental disabilities to achieve greater independence, choice and opportunity in their lives” and “to continuously improve an effective system of accessible services and supports.”
22. The Defendant, POLK CENTER (“Polk” or “PC”), is a residential facility in Northwestern Pennsylvania that provides, among other things, habilitation, behavioral, and medical services and supports for individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities. Polk opened in

25. The Defendant, MARK R. GEORGETTI, is the Facility Director at White Haven. As Facility Director, Mr. Georgetti is responsible for ensuring the health and safety of all the residents of WHC. In particular, Mr. Georgetti supervises the 24-hour supported living, medical care, and developmental activities of all residents at WHC.
34. The named Plaintiffs do not seek monetary damages. Hence, the burden and expense of prosecuting this litigation makes it unlikely that members of the Class would or could prosecute individual actions. If individual actions were pursued by Class Members, prosecution of those individual claims would be impracticable and inefficient.
36. The Plaintiffs do not anticipate any difficulty in the management of this action as a class action.
57. Community placements are being sought for residents regardless of their needs. “Community” placement is inappropriate for most, if not all, residents of Polk and White Haven, yet, nonetheless the Defendants are pursuing an alternative “community” residence for all the Plaintiffs.
58. Plaintiffs have the right to receive ICF/IID-level of services from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
66. The Defendants have determined that the residents of Polk and White Haven have developmental disabilities and require treatment, services, supports, and care.
85. Services provided to residents at the Polk and White Haven Centers are uniquely tailored to the needs of the residents of those Centers.
97. Among the reasons identified by Defendants for their “depopulation” plan was the ostensibly high cost of providing the necessary services for the disabled residents of the Commonwealth’s developmental centers. In reality, the costs for caring for these residents in “community” settings would be equal to or higher than care in these Centers.
123. Defendants are obligated to provide treatment, sports, and services to individuals residing in the Centers consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act and implementing regulations. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213; 28 C.F.R pt. 35 (2006).

Plaintiff Protection and Advocacy for People with Disabilities Inc a South Carolina non−profit corporation",The plaintiffs filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against the South Carolina Department of Mental Health. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to develop sufficient community-based mental health services. The suit sought declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504).,The plaintiffs filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against the G.

Schreier) declared that South Dakota's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and enjoined the state from enforcing this ban or declining to issue a marriage license because the applicants are of the same gender. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment. The motion to vacate the stay was granted by the District Court on September 9, 2015. This case is now closed.","Plaintiffs argue that they have a fundamental right to marry, and that South Dakota law deprives them of that fundamental right. Defendants argue that Bruning and Baker stand for the proposition that there is no fundamental right to same-sex marriage and that those decisions compel this court to apply rational basis review. Furthermore, defendants argue that Bruning found there is a rational basis for such laws, which finding is also binding on this court. Because Baker no longer has precedential value, and because Bruning did not address either due process or a fundamental right to marriage, plaintiffs are not consigned to rational basis review and have a plausible claim for relief with respect to their due process argument III. Equal Protection The Fourteenth Amendment requires that states afford all citizens the equal protection of the laws. U.S Const. amend XIV. “As a threshold matter, in order ‘[t]o state an equal protection claim, [a plaintiff] must have established that he was treated differently from others similarly situated to him.’ ” Carter v.

Doe by Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993).","On January 12, 2015, same-sex couples in South Dakota filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota alleging that the state's prohibition of same sex marriage violated the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment (Docket Article 43) and issued a permanent injunction (F.3d 862) to recognize valid out-of-state samesex marriages.

In October 2016, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of this regulation, which was granted on December 31, 2016. Defendants' motion to stay the preliminary injunction was denied in January 2017. In May 2017, the defendants filed a motion for voluntary remand and stay, arguing that HHS should be given the opportunity to reconsider the regulation at issue in this case, which would conserve the resources of both parties and the court. In July 2017, Judge O’Connor declined to remand the case, but imposed a stay of all proceedings while HHS reconsidered the regulation. He clarified that the December 31, 2016 preliminary injunction order would be unaffected by the stay and would remain in full force and effect throughout the stay.

The Rule pressures Franciscan to provide abortion-related procedures in violation of Franciscan’s best medical judgment and religious beliefs.

The case is pending but stayed, awaiting the Fourth Circuit's resolution of another case raising the same issue.   ","28. But the Commonwealth’s disrespect of their marriage invites others to see them as “less than.” Victoria and Christy started a family together when Christy gave birth to their daughter, L. B.-K. in November 2012, at Winchester Medical Center. One nurse was overtly hostile to both Victoria and Christy, delaying service and responding with unkind words so often that the couple felt like they were “on their own” – even when Victoria called for help because Christy needed medical attention the night after L. B.-K. was born. Victoria and Christy believe this kind of experience would be far less common for same-sex couples if the Commonwealth recognized the equal dignity of their relationships.
31. When Victoria and Christy purchased their home in Winchester in 2007, they wanted to get a home loan guaranteed by the federal Veteran’s Administration (the “V.A.”). The V.A. guarantees certain types of home loans issued to veterans and their spouses, and those loan products typically feature better interest rates and other financial advantages over other loan products because of the V.A guarantee. However, Christy and Victoria were not able to get a V.A. loan, because Victoria was not Christy’s legal spouse and lenders were unwilling to issue loans with a V.A. guarantee covering only half of the total amount. Since then, Victoria and Christy have married in the District of Columbia and the Supreme Court has struck down as unconstitutional the section of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that previously forbade any federal agency from recognizing the marriages of same-sex couples. However, if they were to buy a new house in Virginia or seek to refinance their current mortgage, Victoria and Christy today would still not be eligible for the full V.A. loan guarantee that other veterans’ families receive, because the V.A. currently looks to the law of joint applicants’ state of residence to determine whether they are legally married, and Virginia refuses to recognize Victoria and Christy as married.

Although the Supreme Court has yet to address whether the requirement of an ""official policy or custom"" to hold § 1983 defendants liable applies even where plaintiffs request only prospective injunctive relief, this issue has been decided in the Ninth Circuit. Chaloux v.

In Chaloux, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin county officials from garnishing their governmental benefits pursuant to state garnishment proceedings. The district court, relying on Monell, dismissed the action, ruling that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that the defendants had inflicted the alleged constitutional violations pursuant to an official county policy. The Ninth Circuit reversed, stating, Monell does not apply here. Unlike Monell, this case presents solely a claim for prospective relief...

First, Green asserted that the prison officials were deliberately indifferent to the risk of harm against Green, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Second, under a theory of supervisory liability, Green alleged that the prison officials proximately caused Green’s injuries.1 The prison officials filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that they did not violate the Constitution and that they were nevertheless immune from suit because they are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the prison officials, finding that no constitutional violation had occurred.

Green also sued other prison employees in Green v. Calhoun (“Green II”). The two cases were consolidated. Following discovery and by stipulation, certain defendants (including all Green II defendants) and other claims (including the conspiracy claim against Lieutenant Grubbs) were dismissed. Two claims against Warden Hooks, Deputy Warden Brown, and Lieutenant Grubbs survived dismissal: (1) Defendants violated Green’s Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and (2) Defendants are liable under the theory of supervisory liability.12 The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Warden Hooks, Deputy Warden Brown, and Lieutenant Grubbs, holding that the Defendants did not violate any constitutional rights. The court also found that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Green’s supervisory-liability claims similarly failed because Defendants did not violate Green’s constitutional rights.

The case involved extensive litigation, with class and sub-class certification granted. However, the case resolved via a settlement that the court held as valid under principles of contract law.","664. The defendant removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Id. The district court dismissed the action on the ground that the defendant was not, at the time of service of the summons, “doing business” in the Southern District of Florida, and therefore, the venue requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c) were not met. Polizzi, Id.
Here, Defendants argue that venue in Hawaii is improper under § 1391(b). (Mem. in Supp. of Mot. at 2-7.) However, § 1391(b), like § 1391(a), limits the district in which an action may be “brought.” See 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). This action was not “brought” in this district court. Rather, the action was brought in Hawaii state court and removed to the district court for the District of Hawaii. (See Doc. 1.) Because the District of Hawaii is the district embracing the place where the action was pending, venue is proper pursuant to § 1441(a) and § 1391 does not apply. See, e.g., Global Satellite Commc’n Co v. Starmill U.K. Ltd., 378 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir. 2004) (noting that “[§] 1441(a), and not the ordinary federal venue statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391, governs venue in removed cases”); Kubin-Nicholson Corp v. Gillon, 525 F. Supp.
Defendants argue that, even assuming, arguendo, that the Daily Outdoor Worship Plaintiffs can establish their prima facie case, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Count XXII because Defendants’ policy/custom of prohibiting daily, outdoor, group worship is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. Defendants argue that prison resources and scheduling do not permit them to allow the practitioners of the Native Hawaiian religion from gathering outdoors on a daily basis. They argue that Saguaro uses six additional staff for each of the four annual outdoor gatherings for the practitioners of the Native Hawaiian religion. Allowing daily outdoor worship for them would require the permanent addition of six staff persons. Further, Saguaro would be required to allow daily worship for the thirteen other religious groups in the facility. [Thomas Decl. at 38-39.] Defendants contend that “[t]here are not enough hours in the day to accomplish daily worship for all religious groups on a daily basis on top of chow time, head counts, and other types of programming.” [Id. at 39.] “Prison security is a compelling governmental interest.” Greene, 513 F.3d at 988 (citing Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 725 n.13 (2005)). The Ninth Circuit, however, has also stated:

Defendant [CoreCivic] agrees to pay a total amount of $70,000.00 to the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation for costs incurred. Parties to incur their own attorneys’ fees.

The district court dismissed the case on the ground that the defendants were not doing business in the district in which the action was brought. The case was then moved to the district court for the district of Hawaii, where the parties reached a settlement agreement.

355,PC-IA-0022,"Several members of the Church of New Song (CONS) who were inmates in the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison, Iowa, filed a lawsuit pro se under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against administrative officials of the Iowa Department of Corrections.  In 2009 the Court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment.","This case was stayed on February 22, 2005, pending the outcome of Wycoff v. Brewer, No. 4:05-cv-00068 (S.D. Iowa) (recaptioned Smith v. Ault). On April 2, 2009, the Honorable Robert W. Pratt entered an order in Smith v. Ault, granting prison officials relief from previous injunctions that allowed inmate members of CONS to exercise their religion equally with other religions and that allowed CONS inmate-ministers to visit segregated CONS inmates.
SUMMARY OF MATERIAL FACTS The following facts are undisputed or taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are inmates who, during the time relevant to the complaint, were incarcerated at the Iowa State Penitentiary (ISP) in Fort Madison, Iowa. They are Jacob Voshell, Jeff Winters, Burt Smith, Louie Jales, Scott Fleming, David Baber, Joseph Ewig, Bryan Keller, Wayne Quillen, Jr., Michael Joslin, Clayton Gregory, Richard Whitney, Thomas Keith, James Hall, and Kristopher Johnson. Defendants are the following correctional staff employed at ISP: John Spence, John Mathes, Ron Welder, Ruth Stockbridge, James Burton, Louis Galloway, Charles Harper, and Dave DeGrange. For years, members of CONS and prison officials have been at odds over the genuineness of Church of the New Song as a religion. In dissolving the protective injunctions, Judge Pratt agreed with prison officials that some inmates used CONS as a way to violate prison rules prohibiting contraband, violence, and gang activity; and it was no longer equitable to continue giving CONS protected status in light of CONS inmates’ abuse of the decrees. Smith v. Ault, No. 4:05-cv-00068 (S.D. Iowa) (Order of Apr. 2, 2009, adopting Dec. 5, 2008, R&R, Clerk’s No. 72, and Clerk’s No. 69, at 28-30). The ruling in Smith v. Ault was not appealed.
Plaintiffs in the instant case were disciplined for violating prison rules against gang activity. They allege Defendants’ acts were really in retaliation for their exercise of CONS beliefs. The punishments imposed included loss of good time or earned time, and none of the disciplinary decisions have been overturned. None of the Plaintiffs filed prison grievances that alleged the Defendant prison officials retaliated against them for exercising their religious rights. None of the Plaintiffs sustained physical injuries as a result of the allegations they raise in the complaint.
DISCUSSION Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment for the following reasons: (1) Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit, as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); (2) Plaintiffs allege no physical injury, a prerequisite to an action for mental or emotional injury under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e); (3) Defendants did not file disciplinary reports against Plaintiffs in retaliation for protected activity; (4) thirteen of the Plaintiffs’ requests for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot because those inmates are no longer at the prison; (5) Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994); and (6) Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. This Court takes judicial notice of the proceedings in Smith v. Ault, No. 4:05-cv-00068 (S.D. Iowa), and it adopts Judge Pratt’s ruling that CONS is no longer entitled to protected status in the prison. Plaintiffs state in the complaint that they did not exhaust administrative remedies because they could not challenge their disciplinary and classification proceedings under the prison grievance program. Even assuming this is true, and assuming that not all of Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by Heck v. Humphrey, or moot, the Court concludes that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiffs’ claims of retaliation fail. There was some evidence on the record that Plaintiffs violated prison disciplinary rules, and there is no evidence SUMMARY For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Judgment shall be entered in favor of Defendants. This case is dismissed. IT IS SO ORDERED. Dated this 23rd day of July, 2009.

357,PC-IL-0041,"In 2016, a group of prisoners of the Illinois Department of Corrections filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to extreme isolation in violation of the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments. The court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. The case is ongoing.
","Further, Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that Defendant failed to provide them with their due process protections. Plaintiffs allege that they did not have advance notice or an opportunity to be heard before placement in detention, were not provided with an explanation for the detention while housed in isolation, and subjected to “sham” hearings. As such, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ have adequately alleged a due process claim. Defendant’s motion as to this claim is also DENIED.
Plaintiffs are six inmates who have been housed in segregation at various facilities throughout the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). They filed this two-count putative class action alleging that the IDOC’s use of segregation, which they claim is tantamount to “extreme isolation,”1 violates constitutional standards. Defendant is John Baldwin, who was the acting director of the IDOC at the time this lawsuit was filed on June 2, 2016.2 Plaintiffs allege in Count 1 that the conditions they are subjected to in 1 The meaning of the term “extreme isolation” is discussed below in the “Factual Background” section.
260. In August 2015, a class consisting of all current and future inmates within the IDOC’s custody who were or should have been identified as requiring mental health treatment 25 References to the docket in the instant case are cited as (Doc. while references to the district court’s docket in Rasho are cited as “Rasho Doc. ___.” was certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). Rasho Doc. 252.26 Later that year, the parties reached a comprehensive settlement agreement regarding all aspects of mental health care in the IDOC, including, for example, screenings and evaluations, treatment plans, medication, staffing numbers, staff training, treatment spaces, and housing assignments. Rasho Docs. 710, 711-1. There were also provisions regarding segregation and discipline for mentally ill inmates. Rasho Doc. 711-1, pp. 16–20, 24–25. The settlement agreement was approved by the court in May 2016.
To be sure, there is some degree of overlap between the two cases, which Plaintiffs admit (Doc. 224, p.15, n.4; Doc. 220, pp. 17, 19). Mentally ill inmates who are in segregation are members of both classes. And that number, although imprecise, is no doubt significant. See supra n.28. Rasho also touches on disciplinary proceedings and conditions in segregation for mentally ill inmates.30 However, Rasho did not ask, litigate, or resolve whether the IDOC’s policies, and/or the purported systemic failure to adhere to those policies, creates inhumane conditions of confinement in restrictive housing for inmates. Nor did Rasho ask, litigate, or resolve whether the process that inmates are provided before and after placement in restrictive housing is constitutionally insufficient. Furthermore, Rasho did not adjudicate anything regarding the rights of inmates in segregation who are not mentally ill, and none of the relief agreed to/ordered in Rasho applies to them.
The timing and imprecision of Defendant’s argument suggests it is more likely a last-ditch effort to avoid class certification than it is a serious contention about conserving resources and promoting efficiency. Additionally, contrary to Defendant’s assertion, the claims in Rasho cannot be amended to encompass the issues raised in this case. A settlement agreement has been reached, a permanent injunction order has been entered, and the case is on appeal. This case is not “largely duplicative” of Rasho, as Defendant asserts. Any overlap is minimal, and Defendant has not given the Court any reason to believe it should preclude class certification. Rather, the overlap would only come to bear on any relief ultimately agreed to or provided in this case, which can be addressed later as necessary by the parties and the Court

The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to dismiss, finding that the class was properly joined. In June 2016, the court entered a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs, limiting the length of time inmates can be kept in isolation and limiting the use of extreme isolation.

BACKGROUND Plaintiffs are Muslim inmates housed in the CMU of the FCI. [Dkts. 40 at 1 1; 47 at 1 1.] The CMU is a self-contained general population unit established to house inmates who “re- quire increased monitoring of communication between inmates and persons in the community in order to protect the safety, security, and orderly operation of Bureau facilities, and to protect the public.” [Dkt. 18-1 at 3 5.] The inmates are allowed out of their cells from 6:00 a.m. until 3:45 p.m. and then again from 4:30 p.m. until 9:15 p.m. [Dkt. 46-1 at 7.] During these times, they are 1 Enaam Arnaout and John Lindh were the named plaintiffs in the Amended Complaint. [Dkt. 40.] In September 2010, Mr. Arnaout was dismissed from the case, [dkt. 63], and a separate action filed by Brian Carr (initially docketed as 2:10-cv-0175) was consolidated with this action, [dkt. 61] Mr. Lindh and Mr. Carr are currently the named plaintiffs in this litigation.
1. Plaintiffs John Lindh, Brian Carr, and A li Asad Chandia are Muslim prisoners confined to the Comm unications Management Unit (“CMU”) at the Federa l Correction Institution in Terre Haute, Indiana. The majority of the prisoners in the unit are Muslim.
21. All plaintiffs are Sunni Muslims who believe that group daily prayer is a religious requirement.
In June 2009, following the issuance of the Warden’s memorandum, two Muslim CMU prisoners, Enaam Arnaout and Randall Royer, filed suit against the Warden alleging that the Warden’s policy on group prayer violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.
C. What Relief Should B e Granted to Mr. Lindh Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act? RFRA provides that a “person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim... in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000b-1. The relief that may be awarded to a prisoner when federal law is violated is constrained by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), 18 U.S.C. § 3626, et seq., which provides that, in litigation brought by a prisoner concerning prison conditions, a court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.

The DLC claimed that the DOC failed to take into account mental illness when subjecting prisoners to long periods of disciplinary and other forms of isolation and segregation.

This is a class action lawsuit based on the willful and deliberate refusal of the Defendants to comply with federal laws protecting the rights of Plaintiffs and similarly situated individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Correction (“DOC”).
25. For more than ten years, deaf and hard of hearing prisoners, including Plaintiffs, have been seeking accommodations from the DOC. These prisoners’ continuing efforts, assisted by advocates and attorneys at Prisoners’ Legal Services (“PLS”), have included direct correspondence with DOC administrators, grievances, and Requests for Reasonable Accommodation of Special Needs filed per DOC policy (103 DOC 207).
35. The only telecommunications method currently available for deaf prisoners in the DOC are telecommunications devices for the deaf (“TDDs”), and even these are provided only on a limited basis in select facilities. TDDs are electronic devices for text communication via a telephone line to enable people with hearing and speech disabilities to communicate by phone. TDDs are also called teletypewriters (“TTYs”). Based on fifty-year-old technology, the TTY is basically a telephone equipped with a keyboard and a screen that displays text. For two parties to have a direct TTY conversation, both must have a TTY. TTYs cannot connect to a videophone.
122. At least three of the Plaintiffs have received disciplinary tickets as a result of being unable to hear count or other announcements due to their hearing disabilities; interpreters were not provided during the resulting disciplinary proceedings. In addition, some of the Plaintiffs have been placed in solitary confinement following the receipt of disciplinary tickets, but have not been afforded interpreters prior to the imposition of such a harsh punishment.

The plaintiff, who originally filed pro se but was later represented by the University of Michigan Law School General Clinic, sought declarative, monetary, and injunctive relief, claiming that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's serious medical needs when they repeatedly denied his request for cataract surgery.  On May 30, 2012, following a reversal by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, the district court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of one of the defendants based on qualified immunity.  As of November 18, 2014, the case is ongoing against the remaining defendants. ","Even after Mr. Cobbs filed this lawsuit in October 2007, no one came forward to say that the defendants had made a mistake, and that Mr. Cobbs’ second eye surgery should have been approved long ago. Instead the defendants sought to dismiss the case. Not until February or 6 Between November 2004 and November 2007, Mr. Cobbs made c. 21 requests for medical assistance about his left eye, in the form of official health care requests, formal grievances and appeals, and letters.
Cobbs is an inmate in the custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections (“MDOC”). In July 2004, doctors diagnosed Cobbs with cataracts in both of his eyes. In August 2004, Dr. Ghulam Dastgir, an ophthalmologist, removed the cataract from Cobbs’s right eye, but prison officials denied corrective surgery for Cobbs’s left eye until February
In October 2007, Cobbs filed this lawsuit. Pramstaller unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment on Cobbs’s claims against him, contending that his only involvement with the denial of Cobbs’s medical requests was attendance at the two Medical Committee meetings at which the Medical Committee denied Cobbs’s requests for surgery. Pramstaller, along with other MDOC defendants, have twice more moved for summary judgment, asserting qualified immunity. Each time, the district court has adopted the magistrate judge’s recommendation to reject the defendants’ claims of qualified immunity.

363,PC-MI-0042,"This 2013 lawsuit was brought by several Muslim inmates of  the Lakeland Correctional Facility in the U.S. District for the Western District of Michigan. The plaintiffs alleged that, in failing to provide adequate nutrition to prisoners observing Ramadan, the defendants, several agents of the Michigan Department of Corrections, had violated the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments as well as the RLUIPA. The case is ongoing. ","*1 Plaintiffs, Lamont Heard, William Johnson, Jamero Moses, and Anthony Nelson are prisoners incarcerated with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC). Plaintiffs allege that they are Muslims and participate in the fast from dawn until sunset each day during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Plaintiffs have sued Defendants alleging that, during the 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts, they were not provided the 2,900 calories of food per day required by MDOC policy. Instead, they allege, their calories were reduced to approximately 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day. (Dkt. 1 23–26.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ refusal to accommodate Plaintiffs’ requests for nutritionally-adequate meals violated their rights under the First and Eighth Amendments, as well as the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc–1 et seq. Plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to provide 2,900 calories per day during the 2013 Ramadan fast.
566. In Hudson– Bey v. Martin, No. 1:00–CV–389 (W.D.Mich.) (5/23/02 Order Partial J., dkt. 51–1), Judge Enslen denied the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff’s claim that the defendants violated his Eighth Amendment rights by failing to provide him a sufficient diet during Ramadan. The defendant argued that the Ramadan meal provided 2,136 calories and was nutritionally sufficient. Judge Enslen concluded that summary judgment was improper because the MDOC policy provided that 2,900 calories was the “necessary caloric intake” for male inmates, and prisoners observing Ramadan were receiving 764 fewer calories, or 26.3 percent of the daily intake that MDOC itself recommended for male prisoners.3 Judge Enslen also found that there were factual disputes with regard to whether the plaintiff actually received 2,136 calories and whether that number of calories was nutritionally sufficient. Finally, Judge Enslen concluded that the defendant was not entitled to qualified immunity because, although Cunningham arguably provided a prison official a reasonable basis to conclude that a diet of between 2,000–2,500 calories was constitutionally sufficient, there were factual disputes that rendered qualified immunity inappropriate.
In Siggers, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants violated his First Amendment rights by improperly rejecting his incoming mail on several occasions. The Sixth Circuit held that the plaintiff’s filing of a single September 16, 2006 grievance was insufficient to exhaust claims relating to several previous mail rejections that occurred many months before the grievance was filed and that the grievance was also insufficient to exhaust mail rejections that occurred after the plaintiff filed the grievance. Siggers, 652 F.3d at
Plaintiffs Lamont Bernard Heard, William M. Johnson, Jamero T. Moses, and Anthony Lee Nelson, Muslim prisoners proceeding pro se, filed this civil rights action alleging, in part, that the defendants violated their First and Eighth Amendment rights by depriving them of adequate nutrition during their 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts by serving them a total of 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint or for summary judgment. A magistrate judge recommended granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, reasoning, in part, that the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims were barred by qualified immunity because there was no clearly established federal law that entitled the plaintiffs to the 2,900 calories a day allegedly mandated by MDOC policy. The magistrate judge did not address whether the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim arising from the 2011 and 2012 Ramadan fasts, where they allegedly received only 1,000 to 1,500 calories per day.
The plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of their Eighth Amendment claim, arguing that they were deprived of adequate nutrition based on their participation in the Ramadan fasts and that they never chose to give up adequate meals but were deprived of them when they were not allowed to take a mid-day meal from the cafeteria to eat after sunset. The district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion, concluding that the plaintiffs could only obtain adequate nutrition by violating their religious beliefs. It thus reinstated the plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims.

The plaintiff, Lamont Heard (Heard) is incarcerated in the custody of the MDOC.

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the inhumane living conditions at EMCF, a prison for the mentally ill, harmed inmates. In 2015, the court granted class certification. After engaging in discovery and a bench trial, the parties attempted to settle. After the parties submitted their supplemental expert reports, the parties attempted to settle. However, on January 24, 2019, the parties notified the court that the parties were unable to settle and that future settlement conferences would not be productive. As of March 25, 2019, the case is ongoing.","1. This is a class action filed on behalf of prisoners confined at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility (EMCF) near Meridian, Mississippi. EMCF was designed as the facility intended to provide treatment for Mississippi's seriously mentally ill prisoners in a safe, humane, and therapeutic environment. Today, EMCF is an extremely dangerous facility operating in a perpetual state of crisis, where prisoners live in barbaric and horrific conditions and their basic human rights are violated daily. Grossly inhumane conditions have cost many prisoners their health, and their limbs, their eyesight, and even their lives. Defendants, high-ranking officials of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), who are responsible for the health and safety of these prisoners, have known of these conditions for years but have failed to take reasonable steps to protect the prisoners in their charge.
114. Correctional health expert Madeleine LaMarre visited EMCF in January 2011 to evaluate medical care pursuant to the Order of Dismissal in Presley v Epps. At the time, medical care was provided by GEO. In nearly every aspect of care assessed, she found gross deficiencies Ms. LaMarre found care by the on-site physician to be so poor that she recommended that he be ""immediately removed from the facility and replaced...""
280. Officials and staff mislead prisoners about the rules of the ARP program. For example, in September 2012, Plaintiff McAbee submitted an ARP seeking proper care for his HIV infection and hypertension Mr. McAbee already had another ARP pending at that time Mr. McAbee was told that he would have to withdraw the ARP seeking medical care because the staff member responsible for processing ARPs told him that there was a policy that he could only submit one ARP at a time. No such policy exists in the Mississippi Department of Corrections. However, Mr. McAbee, believing what he was told by staff, withdrew one of the ARPs but had no means of determining which one he withdrew. Multiple prisoners have been similarly misled and forced to withdraw ARPs.
I. Factual Background and Procedural History Plaintiffs in this case are inmates at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility (“EMCF”), which is located near Meridian, Mississippi. EMCF is designated to house inmates with psychological and/or mental illnesses, and approximately eighty percent of the exclusively male prison population has been so diagnosed. At all times relevant to this lawsuit, EMCF was privately operated by Management and Training Corporation (“MTC”) pursuant to a Residential Services Agreement (“Services Agreement”) that was entered between the Mississippi Department of Corrections (“MDOC”) and the East Mississippi Correctional Facility Authority. The MDOC is charged with operating the Mississippi prison system. In 2012, several individuals, who were later designated by Plaintiffs as experts in this case, toured the facility and reviewed prison records. Based on the then-existing conditions, Plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit alleging that the conditions under which they were being confined violated their Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Through their lawsuit, Plaintiffs seek to correct the alleged constitutional violations by way of injunctive relief.
pleaded guilty to having bribed Epps and is currently in prison. After the MDOC learned of the bribery/kickback scheme, it rescinded the contract with Health Assurance, LLC, and entered a new contract with Centurion of Mississippi (“Centurion”) to provide healthcarerelated services at EMCF. Centurion began providing both medical and mental health care services at the prison in July of 2015.
Conclusion In conclusion, The Court having granted judgment as to each claim by Plaintiffs hereby finally dismisses this case. However, the Court believes that some additional explanation will be helpful. This case was filed in May of 2013, after Plaintiffs’ attorneys had investigated this case, hired and consulted their expert witnesses and evaluated their prospects of a successful result. The pretrial phase of this litigation was long based on the multiple requests for extensions of time that were granted to each side during the discovery and pre-trial stages of this case, and the multiple complex matters that were raised and needed to be resolved by the Court for the case to proceed.

367,PC-NC-0021,"This case is about the refusal of North Carolina's Department of Public Safety (DPS) to recognize Humanism as a faith group within the North Carolina state prison system. On February 2, 2015, an inmate in a North Carolina prison and the American Humanist Association filed this lawsuit in the Eastern District of North Carolina against officers of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety that are involved in policy decisions related to recognition of faith groups in state prison under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. They alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and on March 29, 2018, Judge Terrence W. Boyle granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied the defendants' motion. He entered a permanent injunction ordering DPS to recognize Humanism as a faith group and to permit a Humanist study group to meet within North Carolina state prisons on the same terms as other faiths are allowed and entered declaratory judgment. The court also awarded nominal damages and attorneys' fees and costs. Since the entering of the permanent injunction, there has been no activity in this case. The permanent injunction remains in effect.","1. This action arises out of the Defendants’: (1) refusal to allow a North Carolina inmate with sincerely held Humanist convictions to form a Humanist study group to meet on the same terms that Defendants authorize inmates of theistic religious traditions to meet; (2) refusal to allow inmates to identify as Humanists for assignment purposes. Defendants’ policy and practice of discriminating against Humanist inmates because of their sincerely held convictions violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

368,PC-NJ-0015,"This was a prison medical care case filed in 2002 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking damages and an injunction against contract medical care providers and New Jersey corrections officials.  The plaintiffs that the New Jersey prison system was failing to treat them for Hepatitis C.  By the time the court adjudicated the class action issue, in May 2008, the New Jersey Department of Corrections had adopted major changes in how prisoners with HCV were treated; it updated its procedures to match those of the federal Bureau of Prisons, and ""backscreened"" all the prisoners willing to be screened for the virus.  Given that the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs was this same set of reforms, Judge Hillman denied the request for injunctive relief as moot.  As to two individual class members who had HCV, the court held there was sufficient evidence in the record to go to trial on their constitutional claims (though not on their Americans with Disabilities Act claims), and denied the state's motion for summary judgment.  In October 2009, the case settled for money damages.  (However, it seems from some papers filed by one of the plaintiffs that he may never actually have received  his money.  But when he sought the assistance of the court in enforcing the settlement against his lawyer, Judge Hillman ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction, and directed him to file a collection action in state court.  )","virus (“HCV”) while Plaintiffs were incarcerated in New Jersey State prisons in deliberate indifference to their serious medical needs in violation of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S Constitution. They also brought claims for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.A. § 12131, et seq. (“ADA”).3 This Opinion addresses the following outstanding motions: Motion to Certify Class (together with Motion for Leave to File an Overlength Brief Nunc Pro Tunc in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification); Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs’ Claim for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief; Motion for Summary Judgment as to Claims by Royal and Lacey, and as to Plaintiffs’ ADA Claims (together with Motion to Seal Certain Documents in Support of Motions for Summary Judgment); and Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendant George Hayman.
Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on October 16,
The parties agree that HCV is a serious medical condition. See Ellis v. Mohenis Services Inc., No. 96-6307, 1998 WL 564478, at *3 n.2 (E.D.Pa Aug. 24, 1998) (explaining that HCV remains in the blood and accounts for a large percentage of cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer cases (citing to Downs v. Hawkeye Health Servies, Inc., No. 97-3851, 1998 WL 348201, at *3 (8th Cir. July 1, 1998) (quoting from Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 784 (26th ed. 1995)). HCV is not a disease, but a virus that can cause liver disease, and over time, liver damage. HCV is a blood borne virus that can be spread through IV drug use, sexual contact, needle stick injury, tattooing, body piercing, or any other means of transferring blood.
This Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over cases that are moot and, therefore, we first address the issue of whether Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief is justiciable if Defendants have adopted current Federal Bureau of Prison (“FBOP”) guidelines for the management of HCV, and if all NJDOC inmates have been “back-screened.” For the reasons explained below, Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief is denied as moot.
V. CONCLUSION Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is denied. The Defendants’ motions as to Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief are granted on the ground that Plaintiffs’ request for such relief is moot. The Defendants’ motions are denied as to the § 1983 claims but granted as to the ADA claims. Defendants’ motion to file an overlength brief and motion to seal are granted. An Order will be entered consistent with this Opinion.
2 Although the Third Circuit permits district courts to exercise ancillary jurisdiction to resolve attorney fee disputes, Novinger v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours Co., Inc., 809 F.2d 212, 217 (3d Cir. 1987), the facts of this case are substantially different from Novinger. In Novinger, Plaintiff’s attorney requested a lien on the settlement prior to the conclusion of the case. The district court subsequently issued an order stating that the court would determine attorney’s fees at the conclusion of the case. Here, the court was informed by the parties that the matter had been settled, jurisdiction was not retained to resolve any outstanding issues, and Plaintiff moved for enforcement several months after settlement.

For over a decade, he has been preaching at Sunday Protestant services at NJSP and leading other inmates in religious activities such as choir and Bible study. Far from disrupting security at NJSP, Mr. Thompson's activities have been praised by NJSP chaplains as helpful to the rehabilitation ofmany of those confined at NJSP. Last year, however, NJSP implemented a new policy without warning or justification that bans Mr. Thompson and all other inmates from preaching in the prison.

After extensive settlement negotiations and mediation, the parties were unable to reach and agreement. This case is proceeding to trial.","1. This is a civil rights action, brought on behalf of state prisoners who seek to redress defendants’ failure to make their programs, services, and activities accessible to prisoners with disabilities who are in the custody of the New York State Department of Correctional Services (“DOCS”). Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of individuals that have mobility disabilities and are currently housed in DOCS facilities. These individuals are being denied access to prison services, programs and activities and are not being provided reasonable accommodations for their disabilities. Defendants discriminate against plaintiffs and the putative class on the basis of their disabilities in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, (“Section 504”), the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., (the “ADA”), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“Section 1983”). Plaintiffs, on behalf of the class they seek to represent, seek injunctive and declaratory relief. The named plaintiffs also seek, inter alia, monetary damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees.
3. Venue properly lies in the Western District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).
44. Defendant Jim Lindsay is the Deputy Superintendent of Programs at Orleans, and is sued in his official capacity. Deputy Superintendent Lindsay is responsible for overseeing the provision of prison programs at Orleans as well as for overseeing the provision of reasonable accommodations and compliance with the DOCS directive on reasonable accommodations.
82. The gym area at Five Points is inaccessible to plaintiffs. There is no gym equipment accessible to wheelchair users and there is no accessible path of travel in the weight room. The gym bathroom is also not accessible. It has a wide door with no grab-bars and the toilet is to low for safe transfers between plaintiffs’ wheelchairs and the toilet.
83. The Recreation Pen (“Rec Pen”) is inaccessible to plaintiffs because there are several stairs which prevent plaintiffs from entering the area. The Rec Pen area is particularly hazardous to plaintiffs because the fire exit is blocked by an 8 to 10 inch stair. Further, the doors lack any handles that plaintiffs can grab to assist in opening the doors, and the activity areas within the Rec Pen are so cramped that plaintiffs cannot maneuver their wheelchairs therein.
99. The walkways throughout the facility are not accessible to plaintiffs because such walkways are riddled with potholes and uneven slabs of cement.
129. The exterior doors throughout Orleans are inaccessible to plaintiffs because they require greater force to push or pull open than is reasonably possible to exert while seated in a wheelchair.
136. The law library at Attica is inaccessible to plaintiffs. The library is constructed and arranged in a narrow and restrictive manner that prevents plaintiffs from reasonably maneuvering their wheelchairs in the law library.
137. Green Haven Correctional Facility (“Green Haven”) is a maximum security prison located in Stormville, New York.
23. Further, the Court is not persuaded that the limitations expressed by Defendants, with the exception of limiting the class to declaratory and injunctive relief, are necessary. Therefore, the Court certifies the following class: “Plaintiffs and all prisoners in the custody of the New York State Department of Correctional and Community Supervision who suffer from a mobility disability limiting one or more of the prisoner’s major life activities and that requires the use of a wheelchair.” The Court finds no basis at this juncture to limit the class to only the facilities alleged in the complaint. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to certify, ECF No. 172.

The case was consolidated to include the complaints of two other prisoners. The prisoners won both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to provide them a Kosher diet at no personal cost. The permanent injunction, issued February 8, 2006, ordered the Director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections 'to immediately provide to the plaintiffs Kosher diets at no cost, [while complying with nutritional requirements currently applicable to all other ODOC prisoners].' On September 26, 2012 the Court found that the judgment entered in this case only applies to the claims pursued by the three named plaintiffs, and the permanent injunction relief does not apply to all Oklahoma Department of Corrections inmates. ","In Beerheide v. Suthers, 286 F.3d 1179(lOth Cir. 2002), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the United States District Court for the District ofColorado 's decision that, consistent with the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, the Colorado Department of Corrections must provide a kosher diet to its Jewish inmates following the dietary restrictions of Orthodox Judaism with no monetary contribution from the inmates. Applying the fourfactor test established in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78(1987), for evaluating the constitutional validity of prison regulations that burden constitutional rights of inmates, the Third and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have reached similar conclusions that a kosher diet must be provided to an inmate that satisfies the inmate's Orthodox ludaism dietary restrictions. Johnson v. Hom, 150 f.3d 276(3d Cir. 1998); Ashelman v. Wawrzaszek, III F.3d 674(9th Cir. 1997) Cf. Holterman v. Helling, 1995 WL 702300(8th Cir. 1995)(given the ""few kosher diet requests"" received by the Iowa Department of Corrections, the administrative burden and costs of providing kosher food is ""not warranted"" and prison is not constitutionaJly required to provide a kosher diet to its Jewish inmates). These decisions reflect a change in the law in this controversial area of prison litigation, and the application of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel under these circumstances is not appropriate. Accordingly, Defendant Ward's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs Fulbright and Cottriel' s actions should be denied.
Colorado DOC officials appealed the district court’s decision. In April 2002, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the district court’s decision. Beerheide v.

The circuit court reviewed the Turner factors relevant to the alleged denial of the inmates’ constitutional rights and found that the inmates were constitutionally entitled to a kosher diet, that the Colorado DOC had not presented reliable evidence that the cost of providing a kosher diet would be more than de minimis, that the Colorado DOC already had in place a well-established system which served to screen out prisoners who sought to participate in the kosher diet program without a legitimate reason, that the Colorado DOC presented only a “specious argument” that the provision of kosher meals would cause a “floodgate” of litigation from other inmates seeking religious meals, and that the provision of kosher meals to inmates free-of-charge while using a selective screening method unrelated to money was an easy, available alternative with a de minimis impact on the Colorado DOC’s annual food service budget. Beerheide, 286 F.3d at 1185-1192. The circuit court concluded that the Colorado DOC’s proposed co-payment plan was not rationally related to the legitimate penological concerns put forth by the officials of cost and abuse, and the court affirmed the lower court’s grant of a permanent injunction.

DISCUSSION Great care must be used in the granting of interlocutory injunctive relief because of the extraordinary nature of that remedy. Commercial Security Bank v. Walker Bank Trust Co., 456 F.2d 1352, 1356 (10th Cir. 1972). As a result, it may only be granted without notice to the adverse parties when the procedural safeguards of Fed R. Civ P. 65(b) are “scrupulously honored.” 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, M. Kane, Federal Practice Procedure only reiterate that Rule 65 must be strictly complied with.”) Those safeguards require the movant to show that “immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result... before the adverse party... can be heard in opposition,” and certify “in writing any efforts made to give notice [to the adverse party] and the reasons why it should not be required.” Fed R. Civ P. 65(b). In the declaration supporting her motion, Plaintiff does not address her efforts to notify the Defendants of the application or provide any reasons for her inability to provide such notice. As a result, it is recommended that the motion for a temporary restraining order be denied. Commercial Security Bank, 456 F.2d at 1356 (reversing the district court's issuance of a temporary restraining order in part because the court had failed to comply with Fed R. Civ P. 65(b)).
Plaintiff, a state prisoner appearing pro se, brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of her constitutional rights. United States District Judge Timothy D. DeGiusti has referred the matter to the undersigned magistrate judge for initial proceedings consistent with 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B)-(C). The following motions are pending before the Court. All defendants have filed an alternative Motion to Dismiss or Motion for Summary Judgment, (ECF No. 30), as well as a court-ordered Special Report. (ECF No. 29) (SR). Plaintiff has responded to defendants’ motion. (ECF No. 43). Plaintiff has filed three motions for entry of default judgment against Defendant Keithley, (ECF No. 45); Defendant Addison, (ECF No. 47); and Defendant Patton, (ECF No. 49). Finally, Attorney Wilson D. McGarry has moved to withdraw as co-counsel for defendants. (ECF No. 52).
In this case, Plaintiff properly exhausted her administrative claims with respect to the issues set forth in Count I, demonstrating that Plaintiff was well aware of the exhaustion procedures set forth in OP-090124, the ODOC’s “Offender Grievance Process.” (SR 29-9). But Plaintiff did not comply with the time limitations in the grievance process. Plaintiff filed an RTS on May 15, 2003, seeking to have her gender amended to female on all prison records. (SR 29-8 at 12). The request was denied on May 15, 2013.
First, Plaintiff concedes that her official-capacity claims against the director and employees of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (“DOC”) for money damages were properly dismissed. But she asserts that claims for injunctive relief should not be dismissed. Although a claim for prospective injunctive relief may sometimes proceed under the Ex parte Young doctrine,1 any such claim would fail in this case for other reasons.
Second, Plaintiff challenges the dismissal of her claims against some defendants for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. She contends the Complaint adequately alleges a basis for supervisory liability under Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). There are “three elements required to establish a successful § 1983 claim against a defendant based on his or her supervisory responsibilities: (1) personal involvement; (2) causation, and (3) state of mind.” Schneider v. City of Grand Junction Police Dep’t, 717 F.3d 760, 767 (10th Cir. 2013). The Complaint states insufficient facts to establish any of these elements for her claim in Count I of denial of medical care by Defendants Justin Jones, former director of the Department of Corrections (DOC); Don Sutmiller, DOC’s chief medical officer; Michael Addison, warden of Joseph Harp Correctional Center (JHCC); Buddy Honaker, JHCC’s health service administrator; or James Keithley, JHCC’s psychologist. Plaintiff also asserts she has sufficiently alleged that Dr. Keithley was deliberately indifferent to the mental health needs of a person with gender identity disorder (GID). However, the Complaint contains no factual allegations that might establish either, objectively, a serious need of Plaintiff for mental health treatment or, subjectively, deliberate 1 See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).

On August 26, 2013, the court granted the defendants' motion for injunctive relief. The court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order in part because the court had failed to comply with Fed R.

376,PC-PA-0035,"On July 27, 2012, plaintiff, a male prisoner, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Pennsylvania under Bivens against the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants violated plaintiff's right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution by forcing him to share a cell with a hostile prisoner, which caused a threat of violence, and by placing him in painful restraints that caused injury for prolonged periods on multiple occasions for refusing dangerous cell assignments with hostile prisoners; and that defendants violated his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution by depriving him of any meaningful process prior to and during their use of punitive measures against him. On April 9, 2013, the U.S. District Court (Judge William B. Nealon) granted in part and denied in part defendant's motion to dismiss, declining to certify the class. The Third Circuit reversed and remanded the district court's denial of class action certification on June 15, 2016, but the district court again denied certification. Litigation is ongoing.","On December 7, 2011, Plaintiff filed the instant action. He claims that Defendants Carrasquillo, Fleming, Johnson, Mattingly, Miller, Saylor, Scampone, Seeba, and Whittaker kept him in hard restraints or four-point restraints for seventeen (17) days in unsanitary and inhumane conditions in order to punish him for refusing to accept a dangerous cell assignment Id. at
While White first recognized the logic of the picking off exception, it was not until the following year that this exception was expanded to permit relation back—not just to the date of the motion for class certification, but to the date of the class complaint. In Blankenship v. Secretary of HEW, all the named plaintiffs received complete relief (in the form of expedited review of their disability claims) before they moved for class certification. 587 F.2d 329, 333 (6th Cir. 1978). This, the defendants argued, mooted the entire class action. The Sixth Circuit disagreed. It recognized that the plaintiffs’ claims epitomize[d] the type of claim which continually evades review if [they are] declared moot merely because the defendants have voluntarily ceased the illegal practice complained of in the particular instance. Thus, the defendants may expedite processing for any plaintiffs named in a suit while continuing to allow long delays with respect to all other applicants.
A brief discussion of the facts in Weiss helps make the reasoning behind this approach clear. Richard Weiss filed suit against Regal Collections on behalf of himself and a putative nationwide class of similarly situated individuals alleging that Regal Collections’ debt collection practices violated the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (FDCPA) Id. at
This concept of undue delay was also discussed by the Fifth Circuit under similar circumstances in Sandoz v. Cingular Wireless LLC, 553 F.3d 913 (5th Cir. 2008). Sandoz filed a class action complaint against Cingular Wireless in state court. Twenty-four days after the case was removed to federal court, Cingular made a Rule 68 offer of judgment and then sought to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court concluded that the Rule 68 offer did not moot the entire case and denied the motion to dismiss. The case was taken up on interlocutory appeal, and the Fifth Circuit concluded that application of the relation back doctrine was appropriate. Unlike the situation in Weiss, however, “Sandoz did not file her motion to certify until thirteen months after she filed her complaint, and relation back is warranted only when the plaintiff files for certification ‘without undue delay.’” Id. at 921 (quoting Weiss, 385 F.3d at 348). The court therefore concluded that “[o]n remand, the district court must determine, under these unique facts, whether Sandoz timely sought certification of her collective action. If she did, then her motion relates back to the filing of her initial state court petition.” Id.10 10 On remand, the district court held that “[i]n sum, between the time defendants answered the petition and made their offer of judgment, the litigation has been embroiled in the single issue of whether defendants' offer of judgment mooted the plaintiff’s claim and/or mooted the entire litigation. After that issue was preliminarily Unfortunately, applying this “undue delay” analysis to the facts of our case presents an added challenge. Typically, when determining whether the plaintiff has unduly delayed, we measure the time between the filing of the complaint (or amended complaint) and the filing of the motion for class certification. Richardson, however, never filed a motion for class certification. We hold that that is of no moment here. His failure to file a motion for class certification does not prevent relation back because the issue was clearly presented to the District Court without undue delay.

The plaintiffs sued USP Lewisburg and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, alleging that the defendants’ failure to provide adequate treatment for prisoners with mental illness constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The plaintiffs eventually dismissed their claims.","1. This class action lawsuit concerns the inadequate and unconstitutional treatment of prisoners within the Special Management Unit (“SMU”) at the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg (“USP Lewisburg”) who suffer from mental illness.

This matter involves the treatment of prisoners who are housed within the Special Management Unit at the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania (“USP Lewisburg”). The Plaintiffs, who are proceeding with counsel, contend that prisoners in this Special Management Unit are not receiving constitutionally adequate mental health treatment. As a result, they have filed the instant complaint, not only on behalf of themselves, but on behalf of all other persons who are similarly situated. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief, which would require the Defendants to end the allegedly unconstitutional treatment, and which would further require the Defendants to ensure that the prisoners housed within this Special Management Unit receive constitutionally adequate mental health treatment.

Plaintiffs alleged that the conditions at Beaumont were unsanitary and inhumane, and that as a result of damage to the building caused by Hurricane Rita, they were subjected to confinement in a building unfit for inhabitants. Plaintiffs also alleged they were entitled to damages for working conditions endured while working in a UNICOR factory manufacturing Kevlar helmets. Defendant moved for dismissal or summary judgment in the alternate. Several years later, but before the district court ruled, plaintiffs' counsel died, and the case was dismissed without prejudice for failure to prosecute.","37. Claimants returning on November 8, 2005 re-opened the UNICOR factory. After a lunch break, their 8 hour shift ended at 3:30 p.m. Claimants were compelled to work overtime.
42. Asking for m edical attention or reporting to sick call was not an option. The medical area of the pr ison was badly dama ged by water and totally infested with black mold on its walls, running from the doctor offices to the examining rooms. The medical care part of the prison was shut down.

Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the negligence claim as it did not breach its duty of care. Further, even if Defendant was negligent, Plaintiffs can prove no damages proximately caused by that negligence. Further, Plaintiffs’ Walsh-Healey Act claims fail because the United States did not waive sovereign immunity for that type of claim. Plaintiffs’ reckless disregard deliberate indifference cruel and unusual punishment (as a Constitutional tort) claims fail for the same reason. Finally, Plaintiffs malice claim fails because Texas does not recognize a cause of action in tort for malice.
Recommendation This lawsuit should be dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b).

He sued multiple TDCJ employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. He alleged that TDJC policies that prevented his smoking a prayer pipe during Native American pipe ceremonies, limited his ability to wear a religiously significant medicine bag, and prevented him from growing long hair violated his rights under RLUIPA and the First Amendment.

The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit and were successful in getting judgement on the RLUIPA grooming policy claim vacated and remanded. On remand, the defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the RLUIPA grooming claim was denied. As the RLUIPA grooming policy claim moved towards trial, the initial prisoner plaintiff in the case was released and his claims were dismissed. The Court ordered the consolidation of cases Casey v.

The inmate alleged that he was denied the right to practice his religion in violation of the Constitution and The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) because he was not allowed to grow his hair or smoke a pipe at pipe ceremonies. The court dismissed the case on January 7, 2013, but the inmate retained his free exercise claims against the prison. On July 8, 2013, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The Fifth Circuit upheld the district court's dismissal of the case, holding that the RLUIPA is sufficiently the same as that previously imposed under RFRA.","On April 13, 1995, a Native American of Ojibwe heritage who was confined at a TDCJ unit in Gatesville, Texas, filed suit for injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, seeking, inter alia, that the TDCJ be required to provide sacred pipe ceremonies to Native American adherents confined within the unit.

381,PC-VA-0021,"A Sunni Muslim incarcerated in Virginia Department of Corrections facility (VDOC) brought suit against the officers of the VDOC for failing to provide adequate food to him during his Ramadan fasts and interfering with his participation in post-Ramadan religious events. The court issued a preliminary injunction. In 2007, the parties agreed to settle and the case was dismissed.","3. In 2005, The Keen Mountain Correctional Center (""the prison"") required the inmates who participated in the Ramadan fast to observe the first day of fasting beginning at dawn on October 5, 2005, and to observe the final day of fasting ending at sunset on November 4, 2005.
9. However, in a second corrective memo, dated September 21, 2005, (which abrogated the earlier memo of August 29th), Dep Dir. Jabe informed prison officials that the Ramadan ""Religious observances [would] start on the evening of October 10.
Mar. 22, 2006) (citing O’Lone v. Shabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348 (1987); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 545 (1979)). The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.... ” U.S CONST. amend I. In order to establish a right under the Free Exercise Clause, Couch must make two threshold showings. First, Couch must show that he sincerely holds his religious beliefs. See Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215-16 (1972). Second, Couch must show that his claims are rooted in religious belief and are not “purely secular.” Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215-16. Next, pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987), when a prison regulation impinges on an inmate’s constitutional rights, “the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” Evaluating a statutory violation under RLUIPA involves the same threshold issues as invoked by the Free Exercise Clause for the most part. RLUIPA prohibits a prison institution from “impos[ing] a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution...” Unless the prison can show that “imposition of the burden... (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling interest.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000cc-1(a) (West 2003). RLUIPA defines religious exercise as “any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000cc-5(7)(A) (West 2003). As under the First Amendment, although prison officials may not question the truth of an inmate’s belief, an inmate must demonstrate that the belief is sincerely held in order to establish a protected right under RLUIPA. See McManus, 2006 WL 753017 at *5 (citing Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 725 n.13 (2005)). Under both the First Amendment and RLUIPA, Couch must show that his right to the free exercise of his religion has been “substantially burdened.” McManus, 2006 WL 753017 at *5 (quoting Hernandez v. Comm’r, 490 U.S. 680, 699 (1989)); see also 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000cc-1(a) (West 2003).
As the Seventh Circuit reasoned in Al-Alamin v. Gramley, 926 F.2d 680, 688 (7th Cir. 1991), here, Keen Mountain made special accommodations for providing inmates the opportunity to participate in the Ramadan fast. Moreover, I find that the fact that the defendants made such accommodations satisfies the First Amendment 10In Haines, the Supreme Court held that the allegations of a pro se complaint are held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by attorneys. See 404 U.S. at 520.","In 2004, a Muslim inmate at the Mountain Correctional Center filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) alleging that he was deprived of hot meals during a regularly scheduled lockdown, part of which coincided with Ramadan 2008 .<n>The case was settled in 2007 with the defendants agreeing to provide the inmate with 2,200 calories of food during Ramadan and to pay the inmate $450,000 .","In 2005, an inmate at The Keen Mountain Correctional Center filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wisconsin alleging that the prison had violated his First Amendment rights by requiring him to participate in the Ramadan fast.

The case was dismissed on appeal."
382,PC-VA-0022,"On December 19, 2014, three Virginia prisoners placed in administrative segregation at Red Onion State Prison, filed this pro-se lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. They brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Eighth Amendment. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as money damages. The plaintiffs claimed that the VDOC Operating Procedure 830.A, (a self-described Segregation Reduction Step-Down Program designed to help prisoners progress in stages toward a return to the general prison population), violated plaintiffs’ rights.

383,PC-VA-0024,"On May 6, 2019, twelve prisoners who had been held in solitary confinement in two Virginia supermax prisons for at least two years filed this putative class action lawsuit in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The plaintiffs alleged that each prison had violated their Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment rights by continuing to implement a program that intentionally held prisoners in solitary confinement without the possibility of re-entering the general population. They alleged that this program also violated an earlier settlement agreement, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The defendants, the Virginia Department of Corrections, its employees, and the wardens of each prison, filed two motions to dismiss. District Judge Robert E. Payne has not yet issued a decision on either motion.","7. Almost forty years ago, VDOC was sued by a class of prisoners held in solitary confinement at Virginia’s then maximum-security prison—the Mecklenburg Correctional Center (“Mecklenburg”). VDOC was using a so-called “Phase Program” which it touted as a scientifically based “behavioral modification” program, whereby prisoners could advance through “phases” of solitary confinement with varying levels of privileges and ultimately become eligible for return to the general prison population. The class alleged that VDOC used the Phase Program to warehouse prisoners in solitary confinement, causing mental and physical harms. For prisoners deemed particularly “disruptive,” VDOC had a so-called “Special Management Unit,” where prisoners generally spent their entire incarceration in a more draconian form of solitary confinement, without the opportunity to obtain additional privileges, and with additional attendant harms. In Brown v. Landon, Case No. 81-0853-R (E.D. Va.), the prisoners alleged that, through the Phase Program and Special Management Unit, VDOC violated their Constitutional rights to due process and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.
9. In the wake of that report, VDOC reached a comprehensive settlement in the Brown case. The Settlement Agreement in Brown was intended to carry out VDOC’s pledge to “ensure that the systematic degeneration of the correctional operations which occurred at [Mecklenburg] does not occur again at any institution in the Virginia Department of Corrections.”
10. Under the Settlement Agreement, VDOC stated that it “has discontinued the phase program and does not intend to reinstate any similar program in the future.”
19. The Named Plaintiffs seek to enforce VDOC’s promise not to use any version of solitary confinement that is “similar to” the Phase Program or Special Management Unit. The Named Plaintiffs also seek an end to VDOC’s unconstitutional solitary confinement system unless and until VDOC can show that it is capable of administering and operating a constitutional solitary confinement system.
74. In the wake of the 1984 Mecklenburg Study Committee Report, the VDOC defendants entered into a Settlement Agreement with “[a] class of all prisoners who are, or will be, confined in the Mecklenburg Correctional Center of 40 Hutto Compl.
77. The parties submitted the Settlement Agreement to the Court, which issued a consent decree on April 5, 1985.
95. Conditions at Red Onion and Wallens Ridge are no exception. But, as with Mecklenburg, the conditions of long-term solitary confinement at Red Onion and Wallens Ridge go beyond what the general population in maximum security prisons experience by depriving prisoners of almost every aspect of ordinary prison life.
107. Prisoners in long-term solitary confinement at Red Onion and Wallens Ridge endure dehumanizing, daily cavity searches.
120. VDOC has held some prisoners, including Plaintiffs Thorpe and McNabb, in solitary confinement for well over a decade. Remaining infraction free, completing all required programming, and refraining from any acts approaching violent behavior does not guarantee a return to general population. As discussed infra in paragraphs 154-167, VDOC’s use of mandatory minimum solitary confinement periods guarantees that prisoners will endure lengthy solitary confinement regardless of their behavior there, as do the arbitrary, irrational, and largely illusory review procedures.
124. Following a class-action suit filed by the ACLU of Connecticut, the Connecticut Department of Corrections withdrew its prisoners from Red Onion and Wallens Ridge and cancelled its interstate compact with Virginia. 66
223. In 1985, VDOC and the individual Defendants became bound to the Brown v. Landon Settlement Agreement. With respect to the Phase Program and SMU, VDOC entered into permanent and binding obligations that required no ongoing court supervision.

Judge John P. Jones denied the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief in 2017 and initially granted summary judgment in favor of VDOC in 2018, but the Fourth Circuit overturned him on appeal in late 2019, saying that VDOC's use of access to television for religious services as an incentive program unduly burdens the plaintiff's rights to practice a bona fide religious belief.

Defendants' motion to strike (Dkt. 46) should be granted. Exhibits 2 and 3 of Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' motion, (Dkt. 43, at 7-36), complaints purportedly filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. These pleadings are of limited relevance and were not considered.
Plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that by April of 2007 shackling inmates while they are in labor was clearly established as a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Defendants admit that Washington Department of Correction's own policy prohibited it. Although not binding authority, the Eight Circuit recently held that a female inmate's ""protections from being shackled during labor had... been clearly established by decisions of the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts before September 2003."" Nelson v. Correctional Medical Services, 583 F.3d 522, 533 (8th Cir.2009). The Nelson court noted that as early as 1994, a federal district court in the District of Columbia held that shackling an inmate in labor was a violation of female prisoner's constitutional rights. Women Prisoners of D.C Dept. of Corrections v. District of Columbia, 877 F.Supp. 634 (D.D.C.1994), modified in part on other grounds, 899 F.Supp. 659 (D.D.C.1995). The Nelson court also reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court holding in Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). In Hope, the Supreme Court held that under the circumstances presented in the case, handcuffing an inmate to a hitching post was a violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Hope court held that the prison officials had acted with deliberate indifference to Hope's health and safety in ""violation of the Eighth Amendment by restraining him `[d]espite the clear lack of an emergency situation' in a manner `that created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation.'"" Nelson, at 532 (quoting Hope, at 737-38, 122 S.Ct. 2508). The Nelson court concluded that the Supreme Court holding in Hope regarding shackling an inmate to a hitching post, and the holdings from the D.C. district courts was sufficient to show that the right not to be shackled during labor and delivery of an infant was clearly established. The Nelson court also examined the Arkansas Department of Corrections regulations and found that they, too, discouraged the shackling of the inmate in that case. Id., at

Defendant Kent School District","This class-action civil-rights lawsuit challenged King County’s pervasive policy 16 and practice of holding children who have not been convicted of any crime in long term solitary confinement at the Maleng Regional Justice Center (RJC) and the Kent School District’s denial of an adequate education to every child held at the RJC.

389,PC-WY-0006,"On April 3, 2008, Muslim prisoners sued the Wyoming Department of Corrections for violations of First Amendment Rights and the RLUIPA for failure to accommodate their religious practices.  The case was resolved by Consent Decree on November 19, 2008.","Plaintiffs Joseph Miller and Hurie Purdiman, Jr., are Muslim prisoners incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary (""WSP""). They file this motion in an effort to immediately halt further violations of rights guaranteed them by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (""RLUIPA""), 114 Stat. 804, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc.
Defendant Michael Murphy is the Warden of WSP, and Defendant Robert Lampert is the Director of the Wyoming Department of Corrections (""WDOC""). These prison officials adopted, and their subordinates at WSP enforce, a policy known as the ""twenty-minute"" rule. This policy requires segregated prisoners to eat their meals within twenty minutes after delivery by guards. Food not eaten within twenty minutes will be confiscated and discarded.
1. Plaintiffs Joseph Miller and Hurie Purdiman, Jr. are prisoners of WSP. Both men have been followers of the Muslim faith for more than fifteen years. See Declarations of Hurie Purdiman, Jr., and Joseph Miller, attached respectively as ""Exhibit 6"" and ""Exhibit 7."" For reasons set forth in their Declarations, Plaintiffs pray five times each day and periodically engage in religious fasts from sunup until sundown. In addition, they receive special religious (""Halal"") meals from WSP due to their religious dietary constraints.
The Ninth Circuit's decision in Shakur is instructive. In that case, prison officials gave a Muslim prisoner the choice between eating food that was religiously acceptable (""Halal"") but which caused him gastric distress, and eating the prison's regular food that cured his medical problem but which violated his religious beliefs. Prison officials refused to offer other types of Halal food that were readily available and medically palatable to Mr Shakur. The district court granted summary judgment to prison officials on Mr. Shakur's RLUIPA claim, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Prison officials were giving Mr. Shakur a ""Hobson's choice"" that violated RLUIPA, requiring him to choose between eating and remaining faithful to his religious beliefs. Id., 514 F.3d at
The two named Plaintiffs in this lawsuit are Muslims incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary. As a matter of faith, Plaintiffs devote specific time each day to prayer, and certain days of each year to fasting. As a result of the prison policy challenged herein, Plaintiffs must choose between adhering to their deeply held religious beliefs and eating meals. Defendants' policy requires prisoners to eat their meals within twenty minutes after delivery, after which the meals are confiscated. Plaintiffs have requested of Defendants that they be exempted from this rule when a religious exercise, such as prayer or fasting, renders consuming the meal within twenty minutes impracticable, but Defendants have denied these requests. Consequently, Defendants' policy substantially burdens Plaintiffs' religion because it coerces them to violate their religious beliefs or forego a meal. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief and nominal damages.

393,PN-CA-0018,"On June 26, 2003, two separate suits were filed against the City of Oakland and the Oakland Police Department (OPD), and related defendants, in federal court. The suits were filed in response to the OPD's actions on April 7 at a peaceful antiwar demonstration at the Port of Oakland. The Police, without giving sufficient notice to disperse and without provocation, barraged demonstrators with a variety of ""less-lethal"" munitions, while blocking the main exit routes. Police pursued demonstrators and others present when they attempted to disperse, while continuing to fire at them and intentionally strike them with motorcycles. On August 11, 2003, the Court ordered that the cases be officially related and heard before the same judge. One of the two cases, Local 10 ILWU v. City of Oakland, was filed as a class-action on behalf of all persons who attended the April 7 demonstration. The suit also named as plaintiffs Local 10 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, plus nine of its members who were ""standing by"" in the vicinity of the demonstration but not active participants in it. The other suit, Coles v. City of Oakland, sought relieve for several individual demonstrators who were allegedly injured by the OPD. In both cases, Plaintiffs sought compensatory, exemplary, and punitive damages, as well as to recover legal costs. They also sought declaratory judgments holding the Defendants' actions to be unlawful violations of the Plaintiffs' rights under the Constitutions of the U.S. and of California and of statutory law. They sought injunctions that among other things would prohibit the Defendants from unlawfully interference with the constitutional and statutory rights of participants in public demonstrations and protests.

On December 24, 2004, the parties entered a court-approved partial settlement addressing the Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief to the extent that those claims related to the Defendants' crowd control policies. Oakland adopted a new official Crowd Control Policy that forbade the police from dispersing crowds that had not behaved illegally or that did not pose a clear and present danger of imminent violence. It also forbade the indiscriminate use of less-lethal weapons directly against crowds, even when specific individuals in the group were violent. The remaining issues eventually settled, with awards of damages and attorneys' fees well in excess of $1,000,000.","FRCP 12(b)(6) where a “pursuing police car sought to stop the suspect only by the show of authority represented by flashing lights and continuing pursuit,” but accidentally stopped the suspect by crashing into him.

Warrantless Arrest The Fourth Amendment safeguards “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,” and provides that “no [w]arrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.” U.S Const. amend IV. Although use of a warrant is the preferred course, “a warrantless arrest by a law officer is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment where there is probable cause to believe that a criminal offense has been or 5 Plaintiffs’ opposition responded to these arguments but also defended other allegations in the complaint, which were not challenged in the defendants’ motion. See Dkt.
9. The defendants offer no explanation or analysis in support of either theory— and for good reason. “Constructive possession is established when a person, though lacking such physical custody, still has the power and intent to exercise control over the object.” Henderson v. United States, 135 S Ct. 1780, 1784 (2015). To prove constructive possession of a firearm under D.C. law, “the government [must] show that [defendant] (1) knew of the location of the handgun; (2) had the ability to exercise dominion and control over it; and (3) intended to exercise dominion and control over it.” Burnette v. United States, 600 A.2d 1082, 1083 (D.C. 1991). Here, the defendants offer no basis to believe that the mere presence of the gun on Crossland’s property—or the fact that the gun was within his reach, even if unknown to him—meant that he “intended to exercise dominion and control over it.” Indeed, they offer no evidence or reason to infer that Crossland even knew that there was a gun in the jacket’s pocket. Taken to its extreme, the defendants’ first argument (that the jacket was on Crossland’s property) would mean that Crossland’s mother and grandmother were also subject to arrest because the gun was found on their property. And their second theory (that the jacket was within Crossland’s reach) would mean that there is probable cause to arrest someone for illegal possession of handgun if a firearm belonging to someone else is anywhere within reach—even if it is on another person or in his clothing, unbeknownst to the arrestee. That is not the law.
CONCLUSION For the reasons explained above, the defendants’ motion to dismiss, Dkt. 9, is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.

400,PN-GA-0003,"In 2009, patrons of an Atlanta gay bar sued the Atlanta Police Department, alleging that a raid on the bar had taken place without particularized reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The parties reached a settlement requiring the police department to reform its policies. However, after the judgment, the plaintiffs filed for sanctions twice because the police department had not implemented the policies. 

In response to a joint motion by the parties, the Court ordered the appointment of a special master on June 22, 2016 to monitor the Atlanta Police Department's compliance with court orders and assist the parties in addressing any obstacles with compliance or relevant discovery. After some time, the special master noted several disputes between the parties. The Court ordered the police department to show cause why it should not be held in contempt for violating the court order. However, as of September 2018, the parties were close to reaching a settlement agreement.  ","3. Defendants violated the Constitution and committed said torts when, without search or arrest warrants, officers of the Atlanta Police Department (“APD”) raided the Atlanta Eagle (“the Eagle”) and Rawhide Leather (“Rawhide”) on September 10-11, 2009 (the “Raid”). During the Raid, officers of the APD detained all persons who were customers or employees at the Eagle and Rawhide (forcing most to lay flat on the ground, many to lay in spilled beer and broken glass, and restraining some with handcuffs); used excessive force, including shoving individuals to the floor and kicking others already on the floor; made threats of improper and excessive violence; made anti-gay slurs; searched all persons on the premises; seized the driver’s licenses or other ID documents of persons on the premises; and entered the names of persons on the premises into a police computer and checked their names against a police database. These actions were taken without particularized reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that any individual patron, let alone every person at the establishment, was involved in any criminal activity whatsoever.
basis, many of them heavily, and phone memory is recycled, thus obliterating deleted data.” (Affidavit of John Carney, 31, Attachment 4 hereto.) This action arises from a warrantless raid (the “Raid”) conducted on the night of September 10, 2009 and early morning of September 11, 1009, by the Atlanta Police Department (“APD”) on a bar called the Atlanta Eagle. Defendants have admitted that APD officers forced all 60-70 persons in the establishment to lay on the floor while they frisked them and entered all their names into a police database to search for warrants and/or criminal history.2 Plaintiffs contend, among other things, that Defendants unlawfully detained them without particularized reasonable articulable suspicion; unlawfully arrested them without probable cause; unlawfully frisked them for weapons without particularized reasonable articulable suspicion that they were armed and dangerous; unlawfully searched them without a warrant or probable cause; unlawfully searched the premises of the Atlanta Eagle, a retail store in the same building, and the home of Plaintiff Shepherd without a warrant or probable cause; and unlawfully arrested Plaintiff Shepherd in his home.
7. Second Request for Production Nos. 23 and 24 These requests were for boots and clothing worn by undercover officers during the operation. The intent of the request as represented by Plaintiffs‟ counsel was for the Plaintiffs‟ to identify the officers who were inside the club during the operation because their identities were unknown to Plaintiffs. In a supplemental response to discovery, the City has identified every participant in the operation, including the specific location of each officer within the club and each officer‟s area of responsibility during the operation. Some of the officers named as defendants had zero involvement with the operation for a number of reasons. In addition, photographs of clothing for John Brock (20953-20957). The boots worn by the uniformed officers involved in the operation are standard and pictures of the boots worn by James Menzoilan have been produced as document nos. (3649036498).
In December 2010, the parties entered into a consent order (the “2010 Order”) settling a lawsuit regarding the Atlanta Police Department’s (“APD”) unconstitutional search of an Atlanta nightclub. The 2010 Order set forth a number of reforms the City was required to undertake in order to remediate the unlawful practices of its police force. See [265]. In 2011, the City consented to the entry of another order (the “2011 Order”) due to its noncompliance with the 2010 Order. See [280]. The City was later held in contempt of the Court’s prior orders in 2015 (the “2015 Order”). See [289]. The Court refers to the aforementioned orders as the “Calhoun judgments,” and the related proceedings as the “Calhoun proceedings.” The 2015 Order required that the “City of Atlanta shall reimburse Plaintiffs’ counsel for any reasonable fees and costs they expend in ensuring compliance with the Orders of this Court,” which included specific tasks for which Plaintiffs’ counsel would be reimbursed, though reimbursement was not limited solely to those tasks. [289]
15. The question here is whether this Court can award fees in this case, not the emergency petition. This case was based on § 1983, one of the civil rights law listed in § 1988.

The parties filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. On June 20, 2016, the parties made a joint motion [308] to appoint a special master pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53, which this Court granted [309] on June 22. The Court ordered the City to show cause as to (1) why it should not be held in contempt of the Court's previous orders, see [347], and (2) why the City believes it is entitled to relief from the Court’s prior orders. The City also raises a disqualification charge under  455(b)(1) because this argument was raised for the first time in a reply.","On September 10, 2009, the Atlanta Eagle and Rawhide Leather, Inc., a Georgia corporation, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against the City of Atlanta and the Atlanta Police Department.

401,PN-IL-0007,"In November 1974, several individuals and groups filed a civil rights action against Chicago's mayor and police officials, claiming that they had engaged in unlawful intelligence gathering and electronic surveillance. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants had violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, and they sought both damages and injunctive relief.

After the case was consolidated with a number of related cases, in August 1981, the parties entered into a consent decree settlement. The consent decree barred the City from political spying, harassment, and investigation of certain activities protected by the First Amendment. Despite the settlement, decades of litigation addressing enforcement of the decree followed.

In April 2011, the district court granted the City's motion to dismiss the case. The court's order permitted the plaintiffs to file a motion to reinstate the consent decree within 45 days if the City did not conduct an audit showing compliance with the terms of the agreement. There was no further legal action taken by either party.","In 1976 the Department of Justice published guidelines for FBI investigations (the ""Levi Guidelines,"" after the then Attorney General). The guidelines led to a sharp reduction in the number of domestic security investigations and set the stage for the settlement of the suit. The parties signed a settlement agreement in the fall of 1980.
*4 Res judicata (claim preclusion) does not apply to this action, since res judicata cannot bar litigation which could not have been raised in the prior adjudication. This case is an action to enforce a 1981 consent decree which was issued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Since, any proceeding to enforce the decree must be filed in this court, the District of Columbia’s court’s ruling cannot constitute res judicata as to this proceeding.
In 1974, the original plaintiffs in this case, including the Alliance to End Repression and the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a class action complaint against the City of Chicago, the Chicago Police Department, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Director of the FBI, alleging that the defendants were engaging in unconstitutional conduct directed at their First Amendment activities. After several years, the case was settled in August of 1981 by the entry of a consent decree which was approved by a district judge.[1]Alliance to End Repression v. Chicago, 91 F.R.D. 182 (N.D.Ill.1981).

In appealing that decision, Defendant City of Chicago essentially conceded the Fourth Amendment violation but represented to the Seventh Circuit that it had abolished the policy allowing such detentions. The Seventh Circuit reversed the award of the injunction on standing grounds.

The defendants moved to dismiss the suit as untimely. The plaintiffs asked the district judge to equitably estop the defendants from raising the limitations defense, claiming that the officers intimidated them into silence.
I. Background This case comes to us from a dismissal on the pleadings, so we accept the following facts from the plaintiffs’ complaint as true. See Price v. City of Chicago, 915 F.3d 1107, 1109 (7th Cir. 2019). In September 2011 Chicago Police Officers Dal Ponte, Srisuch, and Nigro stopped and searched the plaintiffs without justification and took them to Homan Square, a notorious police warehouse that was later exposed No. 18-1266 as a den of police misconduct. There the officers interrogated the plaintiffs for eight or nine hours, omitting Miranda warnings and ignoring their repeated requests for an attorney. The plaintiffs were denied food, water, and access to a bathroom, and the officers tried to coerce false confessions from them. The officers also threatened to file false charges against the plaintiffs if they told anyone about their mistreatment at Homan Square.
P. 4(a)(7)(A). Here the judge dismissed the case by minute order entered on March 31, 2016.

The court also granted defendants qualified immunity on plaintiffs'  1983 unlawful arrest claims for the reason that individual defendants had arguable probable cause to make all arrests in question.","The case was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri by Gregory L.

408,PN-NY-0013,"In January 2010, plaintiffs filed a class action suit against City of New York and the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) claiming claim that the city and NYCHA employed a pattern and practice of illegal stops, seizures, questioning, searches, and false arrests of residents of, and authorized visitors to, NYCHA residences.  Nine plaintiffs settled, but nine remain. In 2015, the parties settled, and they are currently implementing the terms of the settlement.","126. The experiences of the Named Plaintiffs are the direct result of the NYPD's policy, practice, and custom of operating roving pedestrian checkpoints, otherwise known as ""vertical patrols"" or ""vertical sweeps,"" in NYCHA residences.
167. In 1999, the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a class action lawsuit, Daniels, et al v. City of New York, et al, No. 99-1695 (S.D.N.Y. filed 1999) {""Daniels""), on behalf of African-American and Latino plaintiffs challenging the NYPD's policy and practice of stopping-and-frisking people of color without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity as required by the Fourth Amendment. The plaintiffs further alleged that NYPD officers selectively targeted them on the basis of their race, ethnicity, and/or national origin in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
This putative class action challenges the policies and practices that the New York City Police Department (""NYPD"") and the New York City Housing Authority (""NYCHA"") use to enforce prohibitions against trespassing on public housing property. The lawsuit alleges that defendants' actions have resulted in a widespread pattern of unlawful stops, questioning, frisks, searches, and arrests of NYCHA residents and their invited guests.1 This is the second of three lawsuits before this Court that challenge the NYPD’s stop and frisk practices.2 Like the other two cases, and like many of its predecessors, this suit “thrusts to the fore difficult and troublesome issues regarding a sensitive area of police activity.”3 Nearly forty-five years ago, faced with a rising tide of urban violence and what Justice William O. Douglas called “powerful hydraulic pressures”4 to give police an upper hand, the Supreme Court first confronted “the practical and constitutional arguments pressed with great vigor on both sides of the public debate over the power of the police to ‘stop and frisk’ – as it is sometimes euphemistically termed – suspicious persons.”5 In Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution permits stops when the police have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. But the precise contours of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable stops remain fiercely debated in the courts, the newspapers, and the streets.
What distinguishes this case from the other two is its focus on stop and frisk practices at public housing properties owned and operated by the New York City Housing Authority (“NYCHA”). Plaintiffs argue that the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) uses unlawful stops, searches, and arrests to enforce the prohibition against trespassing in NYCHA buildings.2 According to plaintiffs, the NYPD’s practices violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees “[t]he right of the people to be secure... against unreasonable searches and seizures.” Plaintiffs also argue that the NYPD’s practices are based on racial discrimination against African Americans and Latinos, and thus violate the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees “the equal protection of the laws.” As the Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly affirmed, 2012) (granting class certification); Floyd v. City of New York, 813 F. Supp.
(5) NYCHA's motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' remaining race discrimination claims is granted.

A brief history is in order. Daniels v. City ofNew York was filed in 1999.
In Davis v. City of New York, the plaintiffs alleged unlawful, race-based enforcement of trespass laws in New York City Housing Authority (“NYCHA”) developments. The parties settled the case on February 4, 2015, agreeing, among other things, that they would participate in the Floyd and Ligon remedial process, and that orders issued in that process would be incorporated into the settlement.

2. On June 1, 2020, people from Pittsburgh and surrounding communities assembled in the East Liberty neighborhood of the City of Pittsburgh to add their voices to these nationwide protests and seek change locally. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (“PBP”) responded by escalating a peaceful protest into a scene of pandemonium, panic, violence and bloodshed. The PBP deployed hundreds of officers to counter approximately 150 protesters. As the assembled protesters held their hands in the air and chanted, “This is not a riot,” and “Hands up – Don’t shoot,” PBP ordered its officers to attack them with explosives, chemical agents and ammunition which is known to seriously wound and sometimes kill its targets. PBP officers drove ambulances past injured protesters without stopping. After ordering peaceful protesters to leave the area, PBP officers blocked their escape with chemical gas, riot police and mounted patrols. PBP then arrested several protestors for failing to disperse, subjecting them to confinement in the midst of a global COVID-19 pandemic. The PBP ordered tactical officers dressed in paramilitary garb to patrol a residential neighborhood in armored vehicles and arbitrarily throw canisters of chemical gas at and/or arrest anyone they encountered.

However, following some reports of property damage, PBP officers used chemical gas, rubber bullets and other projectiles, pepper spray, flashbang grenades and other riot control agents indiscriminately against everyone present, including peaceful protesters and nonviolent bystanders. Numerous protesters were seriously injured. The PBP arrested 46 people at the protests for “failure to disperse.” The Allegheny County District Attorney refused to pursue charges against at least 39 of these arrestees because the PBP’s evidence was insufficient to support the charges.

416,PN-RI-0001,"Plaintiffs, individual Hispanic members of a high school soccer team, sued police officers and the City of Coventry based on police search of the team after an away soccer game. Plaintiffs alleged Fourth Amendment and Equal Protection claims in violation of  42 U.S.C. § 1983 as well as a number of analogous state law claims. On September 9, 2009, the district court granted summary judgment for defendants on all of plaintiffs' claims, and on April 1, 2011, the First Circuit affirmed.","Plaintiffs then brought an action before this Court. Counts I, II, and III are actions brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging deprivation of the Plaintiffs’ rights to due process, equal protection, and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. The Plaintiffs also brought state law claims. Count IV alleged an invasion of privacy pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 9-1-28.1. Count V alleged a violation of Rhode Island’s relatively new Racial Profiling Prevention Act of 2004, R.I.G.L. § 31-21.2 et seq. Finally, Count VI alleged a violation of R.I.G.L. § 9-1-35, Racial/National Origin Intimidation.
The Defendants also attempt to obtain summary judgment on Count II of Plaintiffs’ complaint, a § 1983 claim for violation of their right to equal protection. The Defendants claim that they are entitled to summary judgment because there was no evidence that the Plaintiffs were treated differently than others similarly situated based upon their race. There is more than sufficient evidence to support a jury finding to the contrary.
2006. The Appellants, who are Hispanic, were members of the Central Falls High School Men’s Soccer Team. The team had travelled by bus to an “away” game in Coventry, a predominately white community. Their Coach, Robert Marchand, accompanied them to the game. After the game, as the team was boarding the bus, the Coventry players accused the Central Falls players of having stolen iPods and cellular telephones from the Coventry locker room. An angry mob surrounded the Central Falls team bus, shouting racial epithets and demanding a search of the players.
The District Court granted summary judgment to the Coventry defendants on all counts. The District Court found that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the claims for the violations of the Central Falls’ players rights under the Fourth Amendment, and also under R.I.G.L. § 9-1-28.1. As its basis, the District Court ruled that Coach Marchand had given an uncoerced consent to the search. The District Court also ruled that the case law was not sufficiently clear as to whether Coach Marchand, a school official, lacked in loco parentis authority over the players so as to authorize him to consent to the search. Therefore, the District Court ruled that the Coventry Police could reasonably have relied upon Coach Marchand’s “consent” to the search. The District Court also found that there was insufficient evidence on the record to support an inference of racial discrimination on behalf of the officers, and thus dismissed the claims for violation of the Equal Protection Clause, as well as R.I.G.L. § 31-21.2-1 and R.I.G.L. § 9-1-35. The District Court made a similar ruling on the claims for municipal and supervisory liability.
The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all counts. First, it held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the Fourth Amendment and state privacy claims because (1) it was not unreasonable for the officers to believe that Coach Marchand had power to consent to the search, and (2) coercion did not vitiate Coach Marchand's consent. Second, it held that the players did not introduce sufficient evidence to support a finding that the police engaged in racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause or Rhode Island's statutes prohibiting racial profiling and ethnic intimidation. The district court also held on independent grounds that the players had not introduced material facts to support their claims of supervisory and municipal liability.

419,PN-WA-0004,"In May 2014, approximately 125 police officers from the Seattle Police Department (SPD) brought this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The plaintiffs alleged that SPD's new policy that limited the amount of force they could use on civilians was a violation of their constitutional right to self-defense. The court dismissed the case in October 2017, holding that there was no constitutional right to self-defense. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the holding.","Background The Represented Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs representing themselves are police officers 5 employed by the Seattle Police Department (“SPD”) who have filed suit to challenge the Use of 6 Force Policy (“Policy”) adopted by the City of Seattle (“City”) pursuant to a consent decree and 7 settlement with the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”). (Dkt No. 13 at 3–4; see Case 8 No. C12-1282-JLR, United States v. City of Seattle.) In the first lawsuit, the Department of 9 Justice claimed that after “an extensive investigation of the Seattle Police Department [...], the 10 United States determined that SPD engages in patterns or practices of using unlawful force 11 that systematically deny the people of Seattle their constitutional rights.” (Case No. C12-1282- 12 JLR, Compl. DOJ Report, Dkt No. 1 at 2, cited in Am. Compl., Dkt No. 13 at 3.) The 13 settlement agreement and its central components, including the use of force policy it pledged to 14 produce, had the “goal of addressing the policies, procedures, training, and oversight that the 15 United States alleges contributed to a pattern or practice of constitutional violations.” (See Case 16 No. C12-1282-JLR, Joint Motion and Proposed Order for Approval of Settlement Agreement, 17 Dkt No. 3 at 2–3, cited in Am.

(Dkt No. 12-1 21 at 52–70; Dkt No. 12-2 at 5–6.) According to the court-appointed Monitor when he submitted 22 the Policy to the court, the Policy was “calibrated to bring about Constitutional policing without 1 sacrificing the safety and well-being of police officers or the general public.” (Dkt No. 12-2 at Plaintiffs now allege the Policy is too solicitous of the rights of those being policed and 4 insufficiently concerned with the rights of those employed as police officers. (See Am. Compl., 5 Dkt No. 13 at 2.) Plaintiffs bring their claims under § 1983 and Bivens, alleging the creation and 6 implementation of the Policy violates their own Second and Fourth Amendment rights, their 7 “right of self-defense as embedded in the Fourth Amendment,” the Equal Protection Clause, and 8 substantive and procedural due process.

8 On March 16, 2020, in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Calvary suspended in9 person worship services. However, Calvary sincerely believes that online services and drive-in 10 services thwart the Bible’s requirement of in-person services for corporate worship, and some 11 12 church attendees do not have internet access and therefore are not able to participate in online 13 services. Calvary therefore wishes to resume in-person services.
Citing this disparate treatment, Calvary Chapel brought suit in Federal District Court and sought an injunction allowing it to conduct services, in accordance with its plan, for up to 50% of maximum occupancy. The District Court refused to grant relief, the Ninth Circuit denied Calvary Chapel’s application for an injunction pending appeal, and now this Court likewise denies relief.
Houses of worship can—and have—adopted rules that provide far more protection. Family groups can be given places in the pews that are more than six feet away from others. Worshippers can be required to wear masks throughout the service or for all but a very brief time. Worshippers do not customarily travel from distant spots to attend a particular church; nor do they generally hop from church to church to sample different services on any given Sunday. Few worship services last two hours. (Calvary Chapel now limits its services to 45 minutes.) And worshippers do not generally mill around the church while a service is in progress.
Finally, the State relies on the Court’s recent temporary injunction decision in South Bay United Pentecostal Church KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting v. Newsom, 590 U S. (2020). There, the Court considered a California limitation on crowd size at religious services. California treated religious organizations better than some secular organizations, like movie theaters, but worse than other secular organizations, such as restaurants, supermarkets, retail stores, pharmacies, hair salons, offices, factories, and the like. In my view, the State of California’s explanation, at least on that record, did not persuasively distinguish religious services from several of the favored secular organizations, particularly restaurants and supermarkets. But the Court ultimately denied the church’s request for an emergency injunction. In his concurrence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE appropriately emphasized both the high standard for obtaining injunctive relief in this Court and the ongoing and rapidly changing public health emergency. THE CHIEF JUSTICE also noted that the favored secular activities did not involve people who “congregate in large groups” or “remain in close proximity for extended periods.” Id., at (opinion concurring in denial of application for injunctive relief) (slip op., at 2).","On May 29, 2020, a church in Nevada filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada against Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak and the State of California.

This case arises from the President's use of the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account (the ""Account"") as a primary vehicle for his official communications. He uses this account to make official statements on a wide variety of subjects, many of great national importance. The public, in turn, is able to respond to and engage with the President and other users on Twitter. In Knight First Amendment Inst. at Columbia Univ v. Trump, we concluded that this dialogue creates a public forum. 928 F.3d 226 (2d Cir. 2019).

See Professor Josh Blackman, New York Governor Cuomo: “I’m Going to Say to the Orthodox Community Tomorrow If You Don’t Agree Then We Will Have to Close Down Your Religious Institutions,” The Volokh Conspiracy (Oct. 6, 2020) https://reason.com/2020/10/06/new-yorkgovernor-cuomo-im-going-to-say-to-the-orthodox-community-tomorrow-if-you-dont-agree-thenwe-will-have-to-close-down-your-religious-institutions/. Defendant concedes that he has never enforced the already existing restrictions on houses of worship that Plaintiffs have fully complied with. Defendant has never contended that Plaintiffs have violated any capacity, distancing, masking, or other safety requirements. There is simply no justification for the unwarranted, unnecessary and unconstitutional restrictions imposed this week.
Two days ago, Defendant instituted new gathering restrictions designed to target religious institutions. During a press conference on October 5, 2020, Defendant singled out “[r]eligious institutions” as “the greatest potential” threat, declaring that “[w]e know religious institutions have been a problem.” Id. Defendant showed pictures of religious gatherings while making these statements, wrongly stating the pictures were from “the recent past.” Id.; Ex. B at
3. Among other things, Plaintiffs have split the traditional congregational service into several separate gatherings, which accommodates every congregant while still ensuring that congregants maintain proper social distancing Id. Plaintiffs require congregants to wear masks during the entirety of their religious services, and congregants have fully complied with the mask policy. Id.
Closure of houses of worship would require Plaintiffs to sacrifice religious practice. Plaintiffs are sincere practitioners of Judaism who wish to worship in synagogue. But the limits proscribed by Defendant’s restrictions makes such worship impossible. Reisman Decl. 5; Feifer Decl. 4; Saphirstein Decl. 5.

U.S. District Court Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE 1:20-cv-04834-KAM-RML","On March 23, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued Executive Order 202.10, which banned non-essential gatherings of any size for any reason. Plaintiffs claimed that the Order violated the Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution and sought a declaratory judgment preventing its enforcement. The district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the order. The parties subsequently moved for emergency injunctions pending appeal and to expedite their appeals, which were denied by the district court.","On October 6, 2020, the Orthodox Jewish Congregations of Brooklyn and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The plaintiffs alleged that the governor's executive order restricting the number of individuals who may gather in houses of worship, at risk of substantial financial penalties, violated their First Amendment rights. The district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the order, and the parties moved for emergency injunctions pending appeal and to expedite their appeals."
425,PR-WA-0001,"On March 5, 2019, the State of Washington filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for violating Title X’s “Nondirective Mandate,” the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Title X generally, and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706). On March 4, 2019, HHS published a Final Rule, scheduled to go into effect on May 3, 2019, which would alter longstanding regulations governing Title X grants for family planning services. Washington sought declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate the Final Rule and prohibit HHS from implementing or enforcing it, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. On March 18, 2019, this case was consolidated for pretrial proceedings with a separate case filed by the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA; a national membership organization of Title X providers that operate or administer more than 3,500 health centers providing family planning services to more than 3.7 million patients each year), a Washington-based NFPRHA member organization, and two health care professionals, challenging the same HHS Rule on behalf of themselves and their patients.

Washington and the NFPRHA parties filed preliminary injunctions on March 22, 2019, seeking to prohibit HHS from implementing the Final Rule. Judge Bastian granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Final Rule nationwide until further order of the court. On May 3, 2019, defendants filed a notice of appeal and motion to stay the preliminary injunction, as well as a notice of interlocutory and preliminary injunction appeal regarding plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction.

On June 20, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a three-judge panel per curiam decision granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit noted that the Final Rule was challenged in federal court in California, Oregon, and Washington (this case), and district courts in each case granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. HHS appealed in each case and sought to stay the injunctions pending a decision of the merits of its appeals. The panel found that HHS was likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and that the remaining factors also favored a stay pending appeal. 

On June 25, 2019, plaintiffs in the Oregon and Washington cases filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc regarding the stay. On July 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that the three cases (California, Oregon, and Washington) be reheard en banc, and that the motions for stay pending appeal granted by the Ninth Circuit panel would not be cited as precedent by or to any court of the Ninth Circuit. 

On July 11, 2019, the Ninth Circuit en banc court denied the motions for administrative stay of the three-judge panel’s order granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The en banc court stated they would proceed expeditiously to rehear and reconsider the merits of Defendant-Appellants’ motions for stay of the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders pending consideration of the appeals on the merits. This case is ongoing.","Title X grantees challenged the Final Rule in federal court in three states (California, Washington and Oregon), and sought preliminary injunctive relief. The district courts in all three states granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. The Department appealed and sought to stay the injunctions pending a decision of the merits of its appeals.
7714. But a group of state governments and existing Title X grantees (“Plaintiffs”) challenged the Final Rule in federal court in three states (California, Washington, and Oregon), and sought preliminary injunctive relief. The district courts in all three states granted Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. See Washington v.
Section 1008 of Title X prohibits grant funds from “be[ing] used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.” Regulations issued in 1988, and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991, completely prohibited the use of Title X funds in projects where clients received counseling or referrals for abortion as a method of family planning. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 177-79 (1991). Regulations issued in 2000 were more permissive. In March 2019, HHS promulgated the 2019 rule, which was similar to the regulations adopted in 1988 and upheld by Rust. Plaintiffs, including several states and private Title X grantees, brought various suits challenging the 2019 Final Rule.
The en banc court held that the 2019 Final Rule was consistent with § 1554 of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). The court held that the ACA did not address the implementation of Congress’s choice not to subsidize certain activities. The Final Rule placed no substantive barrier on
The en banc court next turned to plaintiffs’ arguments that the 2019 Final Rule was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. First, plaintiffs argued that HHS’s promulgation of the physical and financial separation requirement in 42 C.F.R. § 59.15 was arbitrary and capricious. The court held that HHS examined the relevant considerations and provided a reasoned analysis for adopting this provision. In light of HHS’s reasoned explanation of its decisions and its consideration of the comments raised, the court rejected plaintiffs’ arguments that HHS failed to base its decision on evidence, failed to consider potential harms in its cost-benefit analysis, failed to explain its reasons for departing from the 2000 Rule’s provisions, and failed to consider the reliance interest of providers who have incurred costs relying on HHS’s previous regulation. Second, plaintiffs argued that HHS’s cost-benefit analysis of the 2019 Final Rule was arbitrary and capricious. The court held that HHS reasonably concluded that the harms flowing from a gap in care would not develop, and on this record, the court would not second-guess HHS’s consideration of the risks and benefits of its action. Third, plaintiffs asserted that the referral restrictions were arbitrary and capricious. Because
The en banc court held that plaintiffs would not prevail on the merits of their legal claims, and they were not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the court vacated the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders, and remanded for further proceedings. The government’s motion for a stay pending appeal was denied as moot.
1554. For instance, plaintiffs claim that commenters’ objections to the Final Rule on the grounds that it would “ban Title X providers from giving women full information about their health care options” gave HHS notice that the Final Rule would violate § 1554’s ban on promulgating a regulation that “interferes with communications regarding a full range of treatment options.” 42 U.S.C. § 18114(3). The district courts agreed. See California, 385 F. Supp.
22. Accordingly, the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders are vacated and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The government’s motion for a stay pending appeal is denied as moot.
Eastern District of Washington U.S. District Court (Yakima) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE 1:19-cv-03040-SAB
U.S. Government Defendant
Yakima, Courtroom","The National Family Planning Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA) filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the State of Washington. The complaint alleged that the Final Rule dramatically and unlawfully alters the longstanding 4 regulations governing Title X grants for family planning services. The Final Rule is slated to 5 go into effect on May 3, 2019. NFPRHA filed a motion for a stay pending appeal of three preliminary injunction orders issued by district courts in three states which enjoined from going into effect the 2019 revised regulations to Title X of the Public Health Service Act, pertaining to pre-pregnancy family planning. The panel granted the Department's motion to stay the injunctions pending a decision of the merits of its appeals.","In March 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) promulgated the Final Rule, which was similar to the regulations adopted in 1988 and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991 in Rust v.

426,SD-LA-0013,"In 1964, a group of African American families filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant Jefferson Parish School Board had violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by continuing to segregate the school system. The Court granted injunctive relief, mandated desegregation of the school system, and required that the defendants use busing to speed up the integration process. The injunction remained in place for several decades. In 2007, the School Board sought to implement a magnet school program in the hopes of boosting academics and increasing school diversity. The parties jointly moved to supplement the desegregation plan to include the magnet school program, and the Court issued Consent Orders in 2008-2009 that enabled the School Board's plans. However, issues arose in the following years with the School Board's implementation of the plan. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants were using the Consent Orders as a pretext to conceal attempts to continue a system of racially segregated schools. After the Consent Orders expired, the parties reached a settlement agreement and the Court declared Jefferson Parish Schools unitary in 2011. ","On August 10, 1971, the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, 332 F.Supp. 590, ordered the Jefferson Parish School Board to implement, beginning on August 31, 1971, the plan for desegregation of the public schools of said parish which had been submitted to the court eight days earlier. Having been denied stays of that order by the District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Board seeks a stay here. Hearing was had in the District Court on the feasibility of beginning the desegregation process without delay. The evidence there adduced demonstrated that the parish would undoubtedly experience those difficulties normally incident to the transition from a dual to a unitary school system. Recognizing the existence of these difficulties, the District Court nonetheless correctly applied the law as End of Document developed by this Court in concluding:
There are no unusual circumstances in this case. The schools involved have been mired in litigation for seven years. Whatever progress toward desegregation has been made apparently, and unfortunately, derives only from judicial action initiated by those persons situated as perpetual plaintiffs below. The rights of children to equal educational opportunities are not to be denied, even for a brief time, simply because a school board situates itself so as to make desegregation difficult.
The District Court, Kurt D. Engelhardt, J., held that motions to intervene were untimely.
I. BACKGROUND This action was originally commenced on July 31, 1964.
1971. (See Rec Doc. 1, Docket sheet, entry 90). This plan was submitted following the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). The plan submitted by the JPSB, however, was not accepted, and Plaintiffs were granted further relief pursuant to Swann. The United States Fifth Circuit, in its opinion entered on February 11, 1972, affirmed the decision of the District Court from which the JPSB had taken an appeal. 456 F.2d
37. This Consent Order shall terminate on June 30, 2011.
A. Background This suit was originally filed on July 30, 1964, to desegregate the public schools of Jefferson Parish and to eliminate the vestiges of the prior dual school system. After various judicial proceedings and decrees, by Consent Order [164] entered May 15, 2008, the court approved numerous unopposed modifications of the previously operative Orders covering all phases of school district operation.
Mediation. If Plaintiffs reasonably believe that the response provided by Defendants does not resolve the issue(s) or alleged violation(s) raised in the Notice, the Parties may invoke a mediation process (""Mediation"") to resolve the dispute. Mediation shall take place in Jefferson Parish; the mediator need not be from that Parish, however. The costs of Mediation shall be Defendants' responsibility. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Parties, Mediation must commence within forty-five (45) calendar days from receipt of Notice. For alleged violations which Plaintiffs, in good faith, reasonably believe may result in immediate and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, the Notice shall so indicate this belief, and Mediation must then commence within five (5) business days, if at all practicable. However, should Plaintiffs learn of an alleged breach at a time that is five (5) days or less prior to the termination date of this Agreement, they shall promptly notify Defendants of the alleged breach, and Defendants shall make a good faith effort to correct the alleged breach within 24 hours thereof. The Parties shall conduct the Mediation in good faith in an attempt to resolve the matter(s) contained in the Notice.

428,SD-MI-0002,"On Dec. 3, 1997, Barbara Grutter brought this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the University of Michigan Law School. She claimed that, in denying her admission, the school discriminated against her on the basis of her race, and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which held that the law school's desire to obtain a ""critical mass"" of underrepresented minority students counted as a narrowly tailored use of race in its admissions process and was not unconstitutional.","Background On December 3, 1997, plaintiff Barbara Grutter commenced this action under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983 and 2000d on behalfofherself and others similarly situated. Gruttcr, who is white, alleges that in June 1997 The University ofMichigan Law School rejected her application for admission because ofher race. Gruttcr alleges that the law school has an admissions policy whereby ""students from favored racial groups had a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups."" Complaint, ,[20. Plaintifffurther alleges that ""race was one of the predominant factors... used for determining admission"" and that this policy is not justified by any compelling state interest Id. ,1,1 23,
Plaintiffs filed separate complaints alleging that university’s admissions policy impermissibly utilized race as a factor in determining admissions. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Patrick J. Duggan, J., 183 F.R.D. 209, and Bernard A. Friedman, J., denied motions to intervene filed by prospective minority applicants for admission to university and non-profit organizations dedicated to preserving higher educational opportunities for minority students. Proposed intervenors appealed. On consolidated appeals, the Court of Appeals, Daughtrey, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) proposed interventors had a sufficient substantial legal interest to support intervention as of right; (2) proposed intervenors made sufficient showing that impairment of their substantial legal interest was possible if intervention was denied; and (3) proposed intervenors established possibility that university would not adequately represent their interest in underlying actions.
In an opinion and order dated March 27, 2001, the court found that the University of Michigan Law School has violated the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by using race as a factor in considering applications for admission. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 137 F.Supp.3d 821 (E.D.Mich.2001). Accordingly, the court ordered that the law school “is hereby enjoined from using applicants’ race as a factor in its admissions decisions.” Id. at
Nos. 01-1447, 01-1516. Argued: Dec. 6, 2001 Decided and Filed: May 14, 2002 Regents of state university and its law school appealed from a decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Bernard A. Friedman, J., 137 F.Supp.2d 821, which determined that the law school’s consideration of race and ethnicity in its admissions decisions violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The Court of Appeals, Boyce F. Martin, Jr., Chief Judge, held that law school’s admissions policy admissions policy was narrowly tailored to serve its compelling interest in achieving a diverse student body, and therefore its policy was valid.
This case requires us to decide whether the use of race as a factor in student admissions by the University of Michigan Law School (Law School) is unlawful.
The District Court heard oral argument on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on December 22, 2000.
321 *321 In the end, the District Court concluded that the Law School's use of race as a factor in admissions decisions was unlawful. Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court determined that the Law School's asserted interest in assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because ""the attainment of a racially diverse class... was not recognized as such by Bakke and it is not a remedy for past discrimination."" Id., at 246a. The District Court went on to hold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race to further that interest. The District Court granted petitioner's request for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions. The Court of Appeals entered a stay of the injunction pending appeal.
Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment and vacated the injunction. The Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke was binding precedent establishing diversity as a compelling state interest. According to the Court of Appeals, Justice Powell's opinion with respect to diversity constituted the controlling rationale for the judgment of this Court under the analysis set forth in Marks v. United States, 430 U S. 188 (1977). The Court of Appeals also held that the Law School's use of race was narrowly tailored because race was merely a ""potential `plus' factor"" and because the Law School's program was ""virtually identical"" to the Harvard admissions program described approvingly by Justice Powell and appended to his Bakke opinion. 288 F.
320. Thus, we reversed that part of the lower court's judgment that enjoined the university ""from any consideration of the race of any applicant."" Ibid.

The district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for declaratory relief and enjoined the Law School from using race to further that interest. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court's decision and vacated the injunction. The case is now closed."
429,SD-MI-0003,"On Oct. 14, 1997, two applicants who had been denied admission to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor brought this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the university. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest counsel, claimed that the university's admissions policy treated race as a predominant factor in granting admission, and that they, as white applicants, had been discriminated against in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The case went to the Supreme Court, which held that the school's admission policy that automatically awarded 20 points out of a possible 150 to underrepresented minorities was not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest of diversity in education and so violated the Equal Protection Clause.","Plaintiffs filed complaint alleging that university’s admissions policy impermissibly utilized race as a factor in determining admissions. Prospective minority applicants for admission to university and non-profit organization dedicated to preserving higher educational opportunities for minority students filed motion to intervene as of right, or in the alternative for permission to intervene. The District Court, Duggan, J., held that: (1) proposed intervenors lacked a substantial legal interest in the suit necessary for intervention as of right; (2) proposed intervenors failed to show inadequate representation by university, so as to satisfy requisite for intervention as of right; and (3) permissive intervention would not be allowed.
This lawsuit is predicated upon plaintiffs’ contention that the University’s admission policy is unlawful because it impermissibly utilizes race as a factor in determining admissions. Plaintiffs have not advanced a claim that the policy adversely affects minorities. While the proposed intervenors argue that the elimination or modification of the existing policies may adversely affect minorities, proposed intervenors have not asserted any right to have the existing policy continue.
Plaintiffs filed separate complaints alleging that university’s admissions policy impermissibly utilized race as a factor in determining admissions. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Patrick J. Duggan, J., 183 F.R.D. 209, and Bernard A. Friedman, J., denied motions to intervene filed by prospective minority applicants for admission to university and non-profit organizations dedicated to preserving higher educational opportunities for minority students. Proposed intervenors appealed. On consolidated appeals, the Court of Appeals, Daughtrey, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) proposed interventors had a sufficient substantial legal interest to support intervention as of right; (2) proposed intervenors made sufficient showing that impairment of their substantial legal interest was possible if intervention was denied; and (3) proposed intervenors established possibility that university would not adequately represent their interest in underlying actions.
OPINION On October 14, 1997, Plaintiffs filed a class action against the University ofMichigan and various university officials asserting that the University's College ofLiterature, Science, and the Arts (""LSA"") had violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, by considering race as a factor m admissions decisions.

Before addressing the merits of this case, the Court finds it necessary to define the nature of Plaintiffs' challenge. A litigant may challenge the constitutionality of a statute by asserting a facial challenge, an as-applied challenge, or both. See Harris v. Mexican Specialty Foods, Inc, 564 F.3d 1301, 1308 (llth Cir. 2009).

The plaintiffs are two third- party candidates for United States Representative and the Georgia Green Party. They allege that, under these circumstances, Georgia’s ballot-access restrictions unconstitutionally burden their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and they seek declaratory and injunctive relief pro-rating the number of petition signatures required for the 2020 general election.
The plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in early May. After a hearing, the Court granted the motion in part after determining, among other things, that the plaintiffs “have shown a substantial likelihood of success” on their claim. (ECF 29 at 19.) As a remedy, the Court issued a preliminary injunction reducing Georgia’s petition-signature requirements for the 2020 election by 30 percent. (ECF 29.) The preliminary injunction effectively gave the plaintiffs all of the injunctive relief they sought. (ECF 1 2.) Neither party has appealed that ruling, and the time for an appeal has now expired.

Legal Standard: the United States Constitution bans poll taxes as well as de facto poll taxes The Twenty-Fourth Amendment plainly and unambiguously bans poll taxes.

See Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528 (1965) (applying amendment). Courts have also construed the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as including this prohibition on poll taxes, with respect to all elections. See Harper v Va. State Bd. of Elect., 383 U.S. 663, 666 (1966) (“We conclude that a State violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard.”).

439,CW-DC-0001,"On June 20, 1989, foster care children of the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Human Services. The plaintiffs, represented by Children's Rights and the ACLU, asked the court to order improved policies related to protective services, family preservation and preventive services, child placement, case reviews, adoptions, and staffing, among other issues, claiming violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA), the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, the District of Columbia Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Act of 1977, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the District of Columbia Youth Residential Facilities Licensor Act of 1986. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that caseloads were too large, leaving many children in the foster care system for far too long with unresolved cases. Additionally, the complaint alleged inappropriate placements for children and inadequate efforts to return children home. 

In 1993, Judge Thomas F. Hogan approved a consent decree directing DHS to develop policies and procedures to rectify the system. After many years of oversight, and periodic contempt orders, the system has gradually improved. However, there is still a monitor in place reporting on the progress of the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) created as a result of this case.","According to stipulations entered into by the parties, as of September 30, 1988, 2,166 children were in foster care in the District of Columbia. As of June 1989, the average stay for children in the District’s foster care system was 4.8 years. This compares to a national average of just over two years. See Center Report at ii. According to the Stein Report, as of December 1989, 27 percent of the children in the District’s custody had been in that status for more than five years and 60 percent had been in custody for more than two years. Approximately 95 percent of the children in the District’s foster care are black.
This is a review of a decision by the district court in favor of a group of unfortunate children who brought a class action suit for injunctive relief against various officials of the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs brought the class action on behalf of children who are in foster care under the supervision of the District of Columbia Department of Human Services (“DHS”), as well as children who are reported to be abused or neglected but are not yet in the care of the DHS.
In general, “principles of comity and the desirability of a ‘surer-footed reading of applicable law’ support the determination of state claims in state court.” [Citing Gibbs and a D.C. Circuit case.]3. Determination by the state court is especially important where the case involves “novel and unsettled” issues of state law.... Here, the law in question is new, its meaning ambiguous and sharply disputed. Moreover, the district court should not retain jurisdiction because this case directly implicates the processes by which a locality governs itself. Appellees’ remedy, if any, lies in the courts of the District of Columbia.
amend. XI (italics added). That eliminates the District of Columbia. I would have thought that judges in this circuit needed no reminding that the District is not a sovereign state, separate from the federal government. It is the seat of our national government, and it is subject to Congress’ plenary authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution.9 See Palmore v. United States, 411 U.S. 389, 397, 93 S.Ct. 1670, 1676, 36 L.Ed.2d 342 (1973). Although inhabitants of the District today possess, to some degree, the power of self-government, District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, Pub.L No. 93-198, 87 Stat. 774 (1973), they hold that power at Congress’ forbearance, and it is far from absolute.

The District now argues that the LaShawn I decision was fundamentally flawed because it analyzed pendent jurisdiction under Gibbs rather than Pennhurst State School Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (“Pennhurst II”).

In Frew, parents of children eligible for certain Medicaid services alleged that Texas’ Medicaid program did not comply with federal law.

The district court agreed. The Fifth Circuit reversed, concluding that the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the decree is a “federal court order that springs from a federal dispute” such that its enforcement lawfully “vindicates an agreement that the state officials reached to comply with federal law,” id. at 438-9, even if it requires the defendants to “take some steps that the statute does not specifically require.” Id. at 439.","In September 1988, the Center for the Study of Social Policy and Children's Rights, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) alleging that the District's foster care system was in violation of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1986 and the fifth amendment to the Constitution. The parties entered into a consent decree that required the District to develop policies and procedures for the reporting of reports of neglect/abuse and determine whether abuse/neglect has occurred. The decree also required the DHS to place children with appropriate family members and to place the children for adoption.

Plaintiffs have encountered various accessibility barriers throughout Steamboat Springs. There are numerous issues related to SST, the city’s public transportation system, as well as several of the city’s other programs and facilities.
Other aspects of Steamboat Springs’ public transportation system are inaccessible to Mr. Richardson and Mr Steele. For example, some of the bus stops have shelters inside of which patrons of the bus system may shield themselves from the winter wind and cold as they wait. Some of these shelters are inaccessible to persons who use wheelchairs.
In addition to the accessibility barriers to Steamboat Springs’ public transportation system, there are several other facilities in Steamboat Springs that are inaccessible to individuals with disabilities, particularly persons who use wheelchairs. For example:
The parking lot at Spring Creek Reservoir, a city-owned and -operated park that Mr. Steele frequents, is almost exclusively reserved for persons with disabilities. Steamboat Springs, however, removed a wheelchair-accessible portable restroom from this location, leaving only an inaccessible, standard portable restroom.

I. INTRODUCTION On July 1, 1999, Timothy Richardson and Jonathan Steele (“Individual Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against the City of Steamboat Springs, Colorado (“City”), alleging that the City had discriminated against them on the basis of disability in connection with the provision of transit service and certain other City services, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12149 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehabilitation Act”), 29 U.S.C. § 794.
G. The City shall continue to provide comprehensive training for all bus and van operators, dispatchers, and mechanics. The City shall also provide said training upon hiring of any new operator or mechanic, whether or not said employee previously worked for the City. The City shall also provide timely refresher training for any operator or mechanic if and when said employee demonstrates a lack of knowledge of proper wheelchair lift operation, maintenance, and repair. Refresher training for operators shall also be provided at or about the beginning of winter. The training shall include courses available from wheelchair lift and/or bus manufacturers to cover the proper operation, maintenance, and repair of lifts. The training shall also include hands-on training for all operators that includes proper deployment and stowing of wheelchair lifts utilizing both hydraulic and manual systems, if they exist; proper operation of lifts during inclement weather; procedures in compliance with paragraph F, above, for dispatching of alternate transportation when disabled individuals using wheelchairs cannot board a City vehicle; and the provision of adequate time in operating the lifts to allow individuals with disabilities to safely complete boarding and disembarking from the vehicle. The training shall also include general information about applicable Department of Transportation regulations under Title II of the ADA and appropriate behavior in interacting with individuals with disabilities. To insure the effectiveness of its training, the City shall utilize a self-evaluation program to establish criteria and test each trainee's competency at the conclusion of the training. The City shall make and maintain for the duration of this Consent Decree records showing the dates and hours of training, names of instructors and students, and the subject matter covered.
J. By agreeing to and voluntarily entering into this section (II(J)) of the Consent Decree, there is no admission or concession by the City, express or implied, that it has in any way violated the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, or any other federal, state, or local law, regulation, order, or rule.

CONSENT DECREE by Judge Zita L. Weinshienk (cc: all counsel) entry date 12/12/00 (former empl) (Entered: 12/12/2000)","Two wheelchair users filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against the City of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The plaintiffs alleged that the city violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by failing to make its public transportation system readily accessible to and usable by persons who use wheelchairs.

443,DR-CO-0011,"Plaintiffs were disabled individuals who sued the Colorado Rockies baseball club after it removed accessible seats in Coors Field and raised prices on others. There was a trial held, after which the court dismissed all claims by stipulation. It is unclear, however, whether the parties settled.","11. Defendant Colorado Rockies Baseball Club, Ltd. is a Colorado limited partnership with its principal place of business in Denver, Colorado. Defendant owns the Colorado Rockies major league baseball team and leases and operates Coors Field, the stadium in which the team plays.
34. Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiffs on the basis of disability. Defendant’s discriminatory conduct includes but is not limited to:
2. That this Court issue an order declaring the Defendant to be in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act; 3.
34. Coors Field has 406 wheelchair-accessible seats. Of these, only 12% are located at the front of their respective seating areas. The remaining 88% are located at the back of their respective seating areas.
45. The Individual Plaintiffs are all baseball fans who enjoy attending games at Coors Field.
III. The Lower Level Box Seating Areas At Coors Field Are In Violation of the ADA.
104. Defendant argues that the Bleacher/Balcony Exception excuses the current configuration at Coors Field, in which all wheelchair-accessible seats in the Lower Level Box seating areas are located behind the back row of ambulatory seating. This is not the case.
Background In these two consolidated cases, the plaintiffs assert that defendant has violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA"") in certain respects, particularly including the failure to provide appropriate seating to those required to use wheelchairs when attending a baseball game in the facility used by the Colorado Rockies. The defendant, not surprisingly, disagrees with plaintiffs' contentions. For the reason that this case will soon be coming before the Court for a bench trial in April of 2004, which will require more thorough and fully developed background and factual recitations in the final Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, this Order will not spend significant time and resources on such factual development.
Plaintiffs argue that Coors Field has 406 wheelchair accessible seats. Of these, only 12% are located at the front of their respective seating areas; the remaining 88% are located in the back of their respective seating areas. Only 16% of the wheelchair accessible seats on the Lower Level of Coors Field are in front of the seating area; these seats are either the $100 Backstop Accessible Seats or seats beyond the outfield in the Pavilion seating areas.
This Court agrees with the analysis employed by the Berry v. City of Lowell court. The Rockies may not ""ghettoize"" wheelchair spaces or designate a few token wheelchair spaces in the luxury seating areas as has been done. ""`Dispersal requires a choice of various seating areas, good and bad, expensive and inexpensive, which generally matches those of ambulatory spectators.'"" Berry v.

445,DR-RI-0003,"On April 8, 2014, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island alleging that Rhode Island violated the ADA by segregating individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in sheltered workshops and facility-based day programs that denied them the opportunity to associate with those who did not have a disability. On April 9, 2014, the District Court approved a Consent Decree where Rhode Island agreed to, among other things, provide employment planning services to individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities designed to encourage and assist them in working in integrated working environments, provide state support and services for those working in integrated settings and those making the transition to those settings, programs to educate relevant individuals about the programs and benefits that the Rhode Island offers to those working in integrated settings. Rhode Island must also implement policies regarding the services required by the Consent Decree, train its personnel in the new procedures and working with individuals with disabilities, and Rhode Island must help sheltered workshops change their structure to become integrated working environments.","9. This Consent Decree shall be interpreted in accordance with federal law and the laws of the State of Rhode Island. The venue for all legal actions concerning this Consent Decree shall be in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
1. The Parties agree to jointly file this Consent Decree with the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
On September 24, 2014, Education Commissioner Deborah A Gist approved the Rhode Island Department of Elementary Secondary Schools Employment First Policy. This policy specifies that work in integrated employment settings is the first and priority service option for youth seeking transition work placements and for transition-age youth's postsecondary vocational planning objectives. The policy reflects the State's expectations regarding the provision of supports to youth in transition and the achievement of integrated employment through systemic collaboration with the adult service system. This is the first known Employment First Policy for a State Education Agency in the country. The RIDE Employment First Policy was submitted to the State Coordinator in October 2014.
• TLS Network. ORS presented on the ORS perspective and services available to 100 Life Skills teachers over 3 RIDE coordinated sessions.
Summary. BHDDH, RIDE and ORS have collaborated with the Sherlock Center in the development of a competency based and value based training program addressing the specific provisions of the Consent Decree. The training program was reviewed and given provisional approval by the Monitor and is being implemented. BHDDH, ORS and RIDE have provided a significant number of training opportunities to staff and technical assistance to provider agencies. Additional steps need to be taken to provide documentation that staff involved in the delivery of services and supports, as identified by Section IX (2) and (3) of the Consent Decree, are being trained to established competency levels. RIDE reports that non-public special education schools are participating in the training that is being provided. The Monitor requests that additional information is provided on the nature of these schools (see below).

U.S. District Court Monitor On March 1, 2016 a Joint Motion was filed with the Court requesting a hearing to review the current status of the State’s compliance with the Consent Decree’s requirements. The Parties jointly determined that a court ordered remedial action plan would facilitate compliance with the Consent Decree.

The State prepared and submitted the evidentiary report and presented testimony on April 8, 2016 regarding the progress that the State has made in each of the areas mentioned in the Court Order. The Department of Justice indicated that it did not believe the State was in full compliance with the Consent Decree.

Rhode Island Supported Employment and Integrated Day Services Consent Decree Background The consent decree resolves the Civil Rights Division’s Jan. 6, 2014, findings that the State of Rhode Island violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead v. L.C. by failing to serve individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) in the most integrated day activity service setting appropriate for their needs, and by placing transition-age youth at serious risk of segregation.

After being effectively denied an appropriate placement at International Academy for a student of her age, N.S. enrolled in the tenth grade at Flint Southwestern Academy, an FCS school. Southwestern did not reevaluate N.S. to determine her special education needs. Her mother was not invited to an IEP meeting to review her IEP and discuss any placement.
199. Northwestern neglected to review and revise N.S.’s IEP from Battle Creek. It also failed to provide her with special education and related services in accordance with the requirements of her pre-existing IEP.
263. Due to FCS’s refusal to admit D.K. to a FCS school unless accompanied by his mother, D.K. was out of school for at least three months between preschool and kindergarten during a critical time in his development.
285. From the time that he was a preschool student, O.N. exhibited behavior characteristic of ASD. His preschool teacher noticed and was concerned, since she had a child with ASD. She encouraged O.N.’s guardian grandmother to request an initial evaluation to determine if he was a student with a disability who qualified for special education and related services. The verbal request was denied and, as a result, O.N. was not evaluated at the preschool level. The preschool teacher did not obtain an evaluation for O.N. even though she noted her concerns to his grandmother, and encouraged her to initiate the request.
289. Student records at Doyle/Ryder were destroyed in a flood at the school. Consequently, the date on which O.N.’s grandmother made a written request for an evaluation is unclear, as is the date on which she disclosed his ADHD diagnosis by an outside provider.
290. Due to the school’s refusal to provide O.N. with an evaluation to assess his needs and to provide him with the attendant special education and related services, O.N. does not have an IEP in place and has repeatedly been suspended and removed from the classroom environment for disability-related behaviors.

448,ED-NC-0001,"On November 17, 2014, Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina under The Civil Rights Act of 1964, against the University of North Carolina. Plaintiff asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit the consideration of race in college admissions, claiming that UNC's current admissions policy discriminated against Asian American applicants. The court denied summary judgement and, as of April 9th, 2020, the suit is ongoing.","3. The Supreme Court was misled. No college or university, including UNC-Chapel Hill or Harvard itself, merely uses race contextually to fill the last few seats in the entering freshman class. Indeed, UNC-Chapel Hill adamantly denies that it uses race in this manner. UNC-Chapel Hill, like all other colleges and universities, labels every applicant by race on the claim that it is pursuing the so-called “critical mass” diversity objective. That creates two problems for UNC-Chapel Hill. First, by failing to implement the “Harvard Plan” rationale that led to the permissibility of racial admissions preferences, UNC-Chapel Hill has deprived the Court of any continuing “authority to approve the use of race in pursuit of student diversity.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 394 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Second, UNC-Chapel Hill’s claimed interest—critical mass—never should have been endorsed and should be outlawed once and for all. “[T]he concept of critical mass is a delusion used … to mask [an] attempt to make race an automatic factor in most instances and to achieve numerical goals indistinguishable from quotas.” Id. at 389.
30. UNC-Chapel Hill is a public research university located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. UNC-Chapel Hill is a constituent institution of the University of North Carolina system.
37. UNC-Chapel Hill gathers information about the race and ethnicity of its applicants through numerous ways.
142. UNC-Chapel Hill also admits applicants through an early admission program. Early admissions is a practice in which schools allow students to submit their application in the early Fall if they apply to only one school or promise to attend the school if admitted.
2017. (Id.) Second, the Court considers the prejudice any resulting delay may cause the other parties. Prejudice related to the issue of timeliness is to “be measured by the delay in seeking intervention, not the inconvenience to the existing parties of allowing the intervenor to participate in the litigation.” Sierra Club v. Espy, 18 F.3d 1202, 1206 (5th Cir. 1994). Approximately a week after Proposed Intervenors filed their motion to intervene, UNCChapel Hill moved to stay the case pending the outcome of Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, to which SFFA later consented.5 (ECF Nos. 46, 64.) The case was stayed until August 1, 2016.
I. BACKGROUND A. Parties SFFA is a nonprofit corporation which states that its purpose is “to defend human and civil rights secured by law, including the right of individuals to equal protection under the law, through litigation and any other lawful means.” (ECF No. 163-1 at 9.) SFFA’s membership is comprised of over 22,000 members, including, among others, applicants who have applied for and were denied admission to UNC. (See id. at 9–10; ECF No. 113-9 at 2; ECF Nos. 1145, 114-6.) Founded in 1789, UNC is “the nation’s first public university.” (ECF No. 154-1 16; ECF No. 154-4 7; see ECF No. 163-2 at 2.) As a public university, UNC “receives a portion of its funding from the State of North Carolina and enrolls students who receive financial assistance from the Federal Government.” (ECF No. 30 at 19.) UNC states that its “mission is to serve as a center for research, scholarship, and creativity and to teach a diverse community of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students to become the next generation of leaders.” (ECF No. 154-32 at 2.) According to the University, its “experience has shown that [it] cannot achieve this mission without enrolling a broadly diverse student body where everyone feels empowered to be, speak, and act as unique individuals.” (ECF No. 154-4 10.) B. UNC’s Admissions Process UNC’s undergraduate admissions policy is “broadly set by the Board of Trustees,” which, in turn, has “delegated authority over the establishment of policies and procedures for undergraduate admission to the University’s [Faculty] Advisory Committee on Undergraduate Admissions [(the ‘Advisory Committee’)].” (ECF No. 154-4 15–16; ECF No. 155-4 at 4.) On September 5, 2007, the Advisory Committee adopted a “Statement on the Evaluation of Candidates for Admissions” which states, in part, as follows:
Defendant UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA BOARD OF TRUSTEES TERMINATED: 03/20/2015","On November 17, 2014, Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. (SFFA) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina against the University of the North Carolina at Chapel Hill. SFFA alleged that the University's use of race in its undergraduate admissions process violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act of 1964. SFFA sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. The parties moved for dismissal of SFFA's Complaint, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing to sue. The Court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the parties' motion to seal. In light of the parties’ failure to specifically address Count III, the Court denied summary judgment on Count III.","The Sierra Club sued the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) on behalf of students who were denied admission to the UNC-Chapel Hill campus.

In the spring of 2015, during A.W.’s sophomore year, A.W. and his mother had several meetings with A.W.’s guidance counselor, Debra Tronvig, during which they requested that A.W. be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms at school. The counselor spoke to the school’s principal, Richard Aiello, and one of its assistant principals, Brian Geiger, and she advocated that A.W. be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms. However, at a meeting in March 2015, she reported back to A.W. and his mother that the school administrators had decided that A.W. would only be permitted to use the girls’ restrooms or the single-user, gender-neutral restroom in the school office. Tronvig and the school administrators did not suggest or indicate any circumstance under which A.W. might be permitted to use the boys’ restrooms in the future.
50. During that same meeting, Graf asked A.W. why he was not using the girls’ restroom or single-user restroom as directed. He informed her that the school’s policy violated his rights as a transgender student under Title IX. When A.W. made clear he could not use girls’ restrooms because he is not a girl, she again asked him to compromise and use the single-user restroom in the main office. He again refused because of the humiliation, stigma, and lost class time that he would face using that bathroom. Graf then reiterated her instruction that A.W. cease his use of boys’ restrooms.
School’s Refusal to Permit A.W. to Be Considered for Junior Prom King

The plaintiffs alleged that Wal-Mart discriminated against African-Americans in hiring of over-the-road truck drivers.  On May 16, 2007, the court certified a class of African Americans who had not been hired or had been deterred from applying for these jobs.  Discovery continued in preparation for trial and on January 13, 2009 the court denied the defendant's motions for decertification and summary judgment.    The parties thereafter reached a settlement that was approved by the court on March 5, 2009.  In the settlement Wal-Mart agreed to damages in the amount of $17,500,000 to be distributed to the named representatives, class members, and their attorneys.

2. Settlement Efforts The Parties’ efforts to settle this litigation have been extensive. One such attempt was from November 2010 to September 2011 under the auspices of a private mediator. The Parties’ original agreement was to attempt mediation for up to four months, but the process continued much longer. The mediation entailed many face-to-face meetings, phone calls, and exchanges of proposals. Despite a very substantial allocation of resources to the process by all involved, and much progress, ultimately mediation was not successful. See Ex. 2 (J. Klar Decl.) at 3-4. The Parties made another effort to negotiate a settlement in July 2016, this time without the assistance of a neutral.

10. The Contreras class administrative charge was filed on March 23, 1995 and hence overlapped the Gonzalez class action. Under the American Pipe tolling doctrine, claims relating to assignments, training, promotions, discipline, awards and language use are tolled for all Special Agents who were members of the Gonzalez class up until the present time because of the subsequent initiation of the Contreras class action. In other words, the Gonzales class action tolled the claims of these putative members until at least 1998, but in the interim the Contreras action was filed, these claims are preserved to the present.5 In United Airlines v. McDonald, 432 U.S. 385 (1977), the Supreme Court held that the American Pipe tolling doctrine applies until the final disposition of the class allegations. In that case, the district court denied class certification and the case proceeded for several years until it was settled. After the settlement, a putative class member attempted to intervene in order to appeal the denial of class certification. The Supreme Court held that such intervention was proper and that the statute of limitations was tolled through the entire lawsuit, so that a new named plaintiff could appeal the prior denial of class certification.

On May 13, 2011, the Court decided that the Section 1981 can go forward as a class action because it meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which governs class actions in federal courts. The Court allowed, or ""certified,"" this lawsuit as a class action because there is a sufficient number of African-American individuals who were employed by YellowNRC at Chicago Ridge between October 15, 2004, and the present to form a Class; there are legal questions and facts that are common to the Class Members; the Class Representatives' claims are typical of the claims of the rest of the Class; the Class Representatives and the lawyers representing the Class will fairly and adequately represent the Class Members' interests; the claims made by the Plaintiffs against YellowNRC are generally applicable to the Class; there are more important common legal questions and facts in this case than questions that affect only individuals; and this class action will be more efficient than having many individual lawsuits.

Thompson, 2002 WL 31862689 (10th Cir Dec. 23, 2002), the Tenth Circuit, albeit in an unpublished decision, expressly declined to extend the single-filing rule to permit a plaintiff who had filed an individual charge to predicate her claim on the administrative complaint of another plaintiff. In that case, one plaintiff, Beverly Wilkins, filed an administrative complaint but did not pursue her claims in federal court until long after the 90-day period triggered by the right-to-sue notice that she had received. See id. The district court dismissed her claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. See id. On appeal, Ms. Wilkins argued that she should have been permitted to rely on the administrative charge of one of her co-plaintiffs. See id. The Tenth Circuit rejected this argument, stating that “a plaintiff who filed an individual charge may not invoke the single-filing rule,” and held that the district court properly dismissed Ms. Wilkins’ claims. See id. In doing so, the Circuit cited to other federal courts of appeals that had similarly concluded that a plaintiff who filed an individual charge of discrimination “should be required to rely upon his or her own... charge and cannot reasonably rely upon [an]other claimant’s charge.” See id. (quoting Gitlitz v. Compagnie Nationale Air France, 129 F.3d 554, 558 (11th Cir. 1997) and citing Anderson v. Unisys Corp., 47 F.3d 302, 309 (8th Cir. 1995)).
2003. Defendant argues that its evaluation system was not age discriminatory, but even if it was, comments about or changes made to the system after the relevant time frame of Plaintiffs’ claim cannot be reasonably calculated to discovery of evidence of pattern and practice of age discrimination. Plaintiffs disagree, contending that their requests seeking information on comments made by Defendant’s chief executive officer regarding its evaluation system are relevant because this evaluation system is one of the means by which Plaintiffs claim Defendant engaged in a pattern and practice of age discrimination. They maintain they are entitled to discover whether Mr. Forsee either criticized or embraced the system, or whether changes were made in response to suggestions or criticisms of Mr Forsee. The Court finds that these requests, which seek statements ascribed to, Defendant’s new chief executive officer commenting on the company’s Performance Management System and/or Employee Evaluation system and documents announcing or concerning any changes to Alpha LINK after he re-joined Sprint in April 2003 appear to seek discovery relevant to Plaintiffs’ claim that Defendant engaged in a pattern and practice of age discrimination. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant utilized its Performance Management System and/or Employee Evaluation system in order to effectuate its policy of discriminating against older employees. Discovery into criticism or endorsement of Defendant’s evaluation system by its new chief executive officer would thus be relevant toward establishing whether Defendant’s evaluation system had been internally criticized as age discriminatory and changed as a result of this criticism. Defendant’s relevancy objections to these requests are therefore overruled. Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Defendant to produce documents responsive to their Ninth Request Nos. 41 and 42 is granted. Defendant shall produce documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ Ninth Request Nos. 41 and 42 within thirty (30) days of the date of this Memorandum and Order.

FOCUS is required to serve as a conduit for or facilitato r of such coverage. Such a requir ement is a substantial burden under RFRA.
The regulations do not im pose a substantial burden on plain tiffs because they do not require plaintiffs to modify their behavior in any meaningful way. See Priests for Life, 2013 WL 6672400, at *5-10; Notre Dame, 2013 WL 6804773, at *7-14; Michigan Catholic Conf. 2013 WL 6838707, at *4-8. T o put this case in its simplest terms, plaintiffs challenge regulations that require them to do next to nothing, except what they would have to do even in the absence of the regulations. As explained above, the regulations require nothing of the individual plaintiffs i.e., Mr. Martin, Mr. Miller, Ms. Canne lla, and Ms. O’Boyle), and t hus cannot impose a substantial burden on their religious exercise. Moreover, FOCUS, as an eligible organization, is not required to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contracep tive coverage. To th e contrary, it is f ree to continue to refuse to do so, to voice its disa pproval of contraception, and to encourage its employees to ref rain from using contrac eptive services. F OCUS need only f ulfill the self certification requirement and provide the complete d self-certification to its TPA. It need not provide payments for contraceptive services to its employees. Instead, a third party—FOCUS’s TPA—provides payments for contraceptive services, at no cost to FOCUS. In short, with respe ct to contraceptive coverage, FOCUS need not do anything m ore than it did prior to the promulgation of the c hallenged regulations—that is, to inf orm its TPA that it objects to providing contraceptive c overage in order to ensure that it is not responsible for contracting, arranging, paying, or referring for such coverage. T hus, the regulations do not require plaintiffs “to modify [their] religious behavior in any way.” Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at

Recently, NFHA held informal discussions with its employees concerning systemic racism and perceptions of white people and other demographic groups in connection with the killing of George Floyd. As an organization focused on preventing housing discrimination and providing underserved populations with equal access to housing opportunities, NFHA will continue to hold similar trainings and discussions with its members and employees in the future. Indeed, fair housing advocates must use the lessons of history to address the current manifestations of that history; otherwise, they cannot help create a fair and equitable society. NFHA has also held conversations, discussions, education and outreach events, and trainings with non-profit groups and housing and lending stakeholders, including fair housing organizations, academicians, think tanks, non-profit organizations, financial services institutions, governmental entities, real estate sales groups, and housing industry trade associations on issues of systemic racism, structural inequities, sexism, unconscious bias, and intersectionality. Many of these groups include NFHA's members. These conversations, discussions, education and outreach events, and trainings increased precipitously in the aftermath of the COVID-19 health pandemic and the murder of George Floyd. Various stakeholders wanted training and information from NFHA on why the nation was experiencing grave disparities related to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis; a better understanding about why residential segregation is still significant in many communities; insights into why racial disparities exist with respect to arrest and conviction rates; information about the intersectionality between segregation and disparate health, housing, credit, and criminal justice outcomes; and help understanding what programs and policies should be implemented to address continuing racial inequities.

467,FA-IL-0012,"On April 22, 2010, homecare providers who did not wish to support the designated labor union filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking an injunction against enforcement of the agency-fee provision of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA) and a declaration that the law violated the personal assistants' fundamental rights. On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court held that the clearest case on point, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. 431 U. S. 209 (1977), did not apply because the public employees at issue there were distinct from the care providers here. Accordingly, the Court stated the agency-fee provision must serve a compelling state interest that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms. The Court found insufficient the interests contended by Defendants and held the Illinois PLRA unconstitutional.","Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.
No. 10-3835 D. Current Litigation The following year, the personal assistants from both groups filed a two-count complaint against the Governor and the three unions involved. The Rehabilitation Program plaintiffs claimed that the fair share fees they were required to pay violated the First Amendment by compelling their association with, and speech through, the Union. The Disabilities Program plaintiffs argued that although they did not yet pay fees, they are harmed by the mere threat of an agreement requiring fair share fees. The district court dismissed the Rehabilitation Program plaintiffs’ claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. It dismissed the Disabilities Program plaintiffs’ claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because they lacked standing and their claims were not ripe. The plaintiffs appeal both dismissals.
The district court did err in one respect however. After holding that the Disabilities Program plaintiffs’ claims were not yet ripe, it dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Generally, when a complaint is dismissed because it is not ripe (or because the plaintiffs lack standing, for that matter) it is dismissed without prejudice unless it appears beyond a doubt that there is no way the plaintiffs’ grievance could ever mature into justiciable claims. Chattanoga Mfg., Inc v. Nike, Inc., 301 F.3d 789, 796 (7th Cir. 2002) (holding that district court erred in dismissing counterclaims with prejudice because “[i]f a dispute ripens between the parties, [the counterclaimant] should have the opportunity to litigate its claims.”). If the Disabilities Program personal assistants ever do vote to unionize and enter an agreement with the State mandating fair share fees, the plaintiffs will have a ripe claim. Given our holding above, it may be that such a claim will not last long, but we will not prejudge the issue in this case. Therefore, we will remand the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the claims of the Disabilities Program plaintiffs without prejudice.
23. The union and the State subsequently entered into collective-bargaining agreements that require all personal assistants who are not union members to pay a “fair share” of the union dues. Id., at 24–25. These payments are deducted directly from the personal assis­ tants’ Medicaid payments Ibid. The record in this case Opinion of the Court shows that each year, personal assistants in Illinois pay SEIU–HII more than $3.6 million in fees. Id., at 25.
with and whom JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U S. 209 (1977), an- swers the question presented in this case. Abood held that a government entity may, consistently with the First Amendment, require public employees to pay a fair share of the cost that a union incurs negotiating on their behalf for better terms of employment. That is exactly what Illinois did in entering into collective bargaining agreements with the Service Employees International Union Healthcare (SEIU) which included fair-share provisions. Contrary to the Court’s decision, those agreements fall squarely within Abood’s holding. Here, Illinois employs, jointly with individuals suffering from disabilities, the inhome care providers whom the SEIU represents. Illinois establishes, following negotiations with the union, the most important terms of their employment, including wages, benefits, and basic qualifications. And Illinois’s interests in imposing fair-share fees apply no less to those caregivers than to other state workers. The petitioners’ challenge should therefore fail. And that result would fully comport with our decisions applying the First Amendment to public employment. Abood is not, as the majority at one point describes it, HARRIS v. QUINN KAGAN, J., dissenting “something of an anomaly,” allowing uncommon interference with individuals’ expressive activities. Ante, at

The defendants' motion to dismiss was granted, and the plaintiffs filed to reopen the case and amend their complaint. This motion was denied on August 26, 2019. ","3. In January 2018, HUD abruptly announced that it was suspending for years the requirement that jurisdictions prepare AFHs and submit them for HUD review, effectively suspending the Rule itself. Plaintiffs National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), Texas Low Income Housing Information Service (Texas Housers), and Texas Appleseed bring this suit to challenge HUD’s suspension of the AFFH Rule’s requirements as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 500, et seq. 4.
3. In January 2018, HUD issued a notice suspending for almost three years the requirement that jurisdictions prepare AFHs and submit them for HUD review, effectively suspending the Rule itself. Plaintiffs sued. Less than two weeks later, in May 2018, HUD withdrew that notice, but the agency simultaneously replaced it with another notice that accomplishes the same result by withdrawing the Assessment Tool, thus making it impossible for jurisdictions to prepare and submit AFHs. Plaintiffs National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), Texas Low Income Housing Information Service (Texas Housers), and Texas Appleseed bring this suit to challenge HUD’s suspension of the Tool, which in effect suspends the AFFH Rule, as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).
1. As noted, supra Part I.B.1, the plaintiffs’ overarching missions are to promote fair housing. In particular, NFHA seeks “to promote residential integration and combat discrimination in housing based on race, national origin, disability, and other protected classes covered by federal, state, and local fair housing laws.” Am Compl. 16; see also Second Decl. Deborah Goldberg, Vice President of Housing Special Projects, NFHA (“NFHA Decl.”) (dated June 25, 2018) 2, ECF No. 37-2. Texas Housers focuses “on expanding housing opportunities for low-income residents of Texas,” Am Compl. 17, and has “worked on issues relating to residential segregation and access to fair housing choice throughout Texas,” Second Decl. John Henneberger, Co-Director, Texas Housers (“Texas Housers Decl.”) 3, ECF No.
The plaintiffs present three primary reasons why HUD’s decision to withdraw the LG2017 Tool allegedly was arbitrary and capricious. First, the plaintiffs argue that “HUD failed to adequately explain why its professed concerns justified its decision to withdraw the AFH Assessment Tool.” Pls.’ Mem. PI at 22 (capitalization omitted). Second, the plaintiffs contend that “HUD ignored the benefits of ongoing implementation of the AFFH Rule.” Id. at 30 (capitalization omitted). Finally, the plaintiffs assert that HUD’s action was “contrary to the Fair Housing Act.” Id. at 32 (capitalization omitted). The plaintiffs’ critical appraisal of HUD’s reasons for withdrawing the LG2017 Tool raises legitimate concerns but, ultimately, falls short of establishing that the reasons HUD provided are arbitrary or capricious.
For either intervention as a matter of right or permissive intervention, however, the movant must establish Article III standing. See Deutsche Bank, 717 F.3d at 193 (“It is circuit law that intervenors must demonstrate Article III standing.”); Fund for Animals, Inc v. Norton, 322 F.3d 728, 731–32 (D.C Cir. 2003) (“[I]n addition to establishing its qualification for intervention under Rule 24(a)(2), a party seeking to intervene as of right must demonstrate that it has standing under Article III of the Constitution.”). New York has failed to do so.
38. The Court granted HUD’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and further held that the plaintiffs would not have been entitled to the injunctive relief they sought, even if they had standing. See Nat’l Fair Hous All
18. In the plaintiffs’ view, the two notices constituted unlawful agency action because they effectively suspended the AFFH Rule without notice-and-comment procedures and because the withdrawal of the Assessment Tool was arbitrary and capricious. The plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunctive relief, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and Local Civil Rule 65.1, and expedited summary judgment for an order that HUD rescind the May 2018 notices and reinstate the Assessment Tool for local governments. See Pls.’ Mot Prelim. Injunc Exped. Summ J. The defendants, on the other hand, moved, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b), to dismiss the case entirely due to the plaintiffs’ lack standing. See Defs.’ MTD. The Court dismissed the action because no plaintiff had standing. As discussed in the accompanying opinion, the standing analysis applicable to an organization suing on its own behalf has a familiar framework: the organization must establish an injury, causation, and redressability.

THIS CAUSE comes before the Court the parties' cross motions for summary judgment.[1] This case involves individual plaintiffs, as well as corporate plaintiffs, Regency Properties of Boca Raton, Inc. (""Boca House"") and Awakenings of Florida, Inc. (collectively referred to as ""Provider Plaintiffs"") suing the City of Boca Raton (""City"") regarding its passage of Ordinance No. 4649, later amended by Ordinance No. 4701 (""Ordinance"")[2] and Section 28-2 of the Code of Ordinances (""Section 28-2""). Plaintiffs brought this suit in March 2003.
2007. Plaintiffs brought suit against the Defendant City of Boca Raton in March 2003, alleging that it violated the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. (FHA), Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 1342 U.S.C. § 12131, *1342 et seq. (ADA), and the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution by passing Ordinance 4649, as amended by Ordinance 4701, and Section 28-2. Primarily, Plaintiffs allege that the City's actions discriminate against them based on their handicapped status where these two zoning provisions limit the ability of Plaintiffs to reside in residential areas of the City. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), I make the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.
1357. The recovering individuals testified about the negative impact their addiction had on their lives, including preventing them from caring for themselves or keeping a home at times, and losing jobs and families. All of these things impacted their everyday lives in a significant way. All Individual Plaintiffs and current residents of Provider Plaintiffs testified, that at one time, they had because of their addiction been unable to perform one of these major life activities. For some the deprivation was long-term. For others the deprivation may have been shortterm, but repeated itself with frequency when he or she would relapse and again find themselves without their family, their home, their job, or ability to care for his or herself. The evidence established that the individuals involved suffered an impairment which qualified them as disabled under the FHA.

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs' motion to strike the statute of limitations affirmative defense was an example of unnecessary formalism. The court granted the motion for leave to amend. The case was dismissed on April 17, 2008 without prejudice.","On October 5, 2006, a former employee of Fruit Patch, Inc. filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of all legal hourly-paid workers who had been employed by Fruit Patch. The plaintiffs alleged that the owners and owners had conspired to operate Fruit Patch through a pattern of racketeering activity, the Illegal Immigrant Hiring Scheme. The district court dismissed the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to show that they had a duty to report immigration violations to their employers or to an appropriate government agency. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the case. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit for further proceedings."

Plaintiffs challenged the federal immigration rule restricting eligibility for asylum for noncitizens who transited through another country prior to reaching the southern U.S. border. Plaintiffs claimed the rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Plaintiffs successfully sought a preliminary nationwide injunction.  However, defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit and the nationwide scope of the injunction was stayed. Then the District Court restored the nationwide scope of the injunction on September 9, 2019, but the government again appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay pending disposition of the appeal in the 9th Circuit. The District Court issued a separate preliminary injunction against another rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in the closing days of the Trump Administration which was substantially similar to the one already enjoined. The Ninth Circuit upheld the original injunction in April, 2021. The case is ongoing but is likely to terminate soon given the change in presidential administrations.","19. Plaintiff Innovation Law Lab is a nonprofit organization that has projects in multiple 20 states, including an office in Oakland, California.
109. Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that provide assistance to asylum seekers, including those who came to the United States after transiting through another country. The new Rule will cause each Plaintiff significant harm.
The Interim Rule was also challenged in an action filed in the District Court for the District 27 of Columbia. On June 30, 2020, that court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and 28 vacated the Interim Rule, finding that it was invalid under the Administrative Procedures Act 2 United States District Court Northern District of California 1 (“APA”) for failing to adhere to notice and comment procedures.

Circuit, ECF No. 131 4 at 9, but the vacatur remains in effect.
Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that represent asylum seekers. They brought suit in district court seeking an injunction against enforcement of the Rule, contending that the Rule is invalid on three grounds: first, the Rule is not “consistent with” Section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158; second, the Rule is arbitrary and capricious; third, the Rule was adopted without notice and comment. The district court found that plaintiffs had a likelihood of success on all three grounds and entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Rule, with effect in the four states on our border with Mexico.
Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (“State Farm”). Third, under § 706(2)(D), the Rule was adopted “without observance of procedure required by law” because it was adopted without notice and comment. The district court agreed with plaintiffs on all three grounds. We affirm on the first two. We do not reach the third.","On July 16, 2019, the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, Al Otro Lado, Innovation Law Lab, and Central American Resource Center filed this lawsuit against relevant federal agencies and agency officials in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California.

The plaintiffs challenged the Department of Homeland Security's Final Public Charge Rule (the Rule), which added non-cash benefits to the factors considered in determining whether a person applying for legal permanent residence is likely to become a public charge. The plaintiffs alleged that the Government violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding its statutory authority, claimed that the Rule was ""arbitrary and capricious,"" and asserted that the Rule violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In October 2019, a district court judge denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining the government from implementing the Rule, but issued an order for preliminary injunction in a related case that would enjoin the implementation of the rule in California, Oregon, the District of Columbia, Maine, and Pennsylvania. This preliminary injunction was stayed by the Ninth Circuit in December 2019. It was affirmed a year later in December 2020, but the order was stayed pending petitions to the Supreme Court in the Second, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits.

In September 2019, the court granted preliminary injunction, enjoining defendants from continuing to detain asylum seekers without individualized consideration.  In March 30, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for preliminary injunction, seeking immediate reviews of class members still detained.  The court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for order to show cause why the defendants should not be held in contempt for violating the 2019 preliminary injunction order, expedited discovery, and the appointment of a special master. The court granted limited discovery. The case is ongoing. ","77. ICE has failed to provide Y.A.L. with adequate medical care at Pine Prairie, causing significant harm to his health. Prior to being detained, Y.A.L. managed his gout successfully with medication and diet. In ICE custody, he has lost the ability to walk. He suffers from swelling, redness, and extreme pain in his extremities. He cannot independently bathe or use the toilet, and relies on other detained men for assistance. He is confined to a wheelchair. Despite many requests to detention officials, he has been continuously deprived of a medically appropriate diet and adequate medical treatment. The longer he remains detained, the more his pain and suffering intensifies.
84. ICE has failed to provide M.R.M.H. with adequate medical care or a medically appropriate diet, causing significant harm to his health. M.R.M.H. has notified ICE and jail officials several times that he is allergic to certain foods. Yet ICE has failed to ensure that he has access to food that does not provoke potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. As a result, M.R.M.H. has had hives for several months. He has experienced severe breathing problems, including anaphylaxis. He has lost consciousness and been hospitalized on several occasions. A physician who conducted an independent medical evaluation of M.R.M.H. in April 2019, found he needed allergy testing, a special diet, immediate access to an epinephrine pen, and x-rays of his foot and chest. Another physician who reviewed M.R.M.H.’s medical records found he “is at extremely high risk of dying in ICE custody from a preventable condition.”
11. On March 20, 2020, the New Orleans ICE Field Office denied release on parole to two SIFI clients with medical complications who are confined inside LaSalle. The clients, asylum seekers, have both engaged in a hunger strike for about 140 days. Their strike is rooted in their frustration with the way the immigration courts have treated their pleas for asylum, and, as the duration of their confinement lengthens, their desperation at being locked up, separated from family. Before the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic, SIFI filed initial parole requests. They contained evidence from a leading medical expert in detainee health attesting that they are medically vulnerable, and documents showing they pose no risk to public safety and no flight risk, having sponsors willing to host them upon release.

The Court granted, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, class certification for the plaintiffs in September, 2006.

The Defendants failed to pay the Plaintiffs and the other members of the class the minimum wage for all the work they performed.
*1284 The Eleventh Circuit has designed a two-step analysis to be applied when a federal court seeks to ""borrow"" a state statute of limitations in actions brought under a federal civil rights statute which does not contain its own statute of limitations. In choosing which state statute of limitations to apply to claims under the federal civil rights statutes, we must engage in a two-step analysis: `first, what under federal law is the ""essential nature"" of the claim, and second, what statute of limitations would the state courts hold applicable to this type or class of claim.' Solomon v. Hardison 746 F.2d 699 (11th Cir.1984) (citations omitted). Here, the parties agree that the essential nature of Plaintiffs' AWPA claim is breach of their employment contract with Defendant Eller Sons Trees, Inc. (""Defendant""). The parties disagree, however, on the statute of limitations that Georgia courts would hold applicable to this type or class of claim. Plaintiffs assert that O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24's six-year statute of limitations applies, which governs claims on written contracts in Georgia. By contrast, Defendant asserts that O.C.G.A. § 9-3-22's two-year statute of limitations applies, which is the statute of limitations for wage claims and governs claims arising under statutes.
Unsurprisingly, Plaintiffs take the position that the class claims in this case predominate over any question affecting the individual members of the putative class. Defendants The Southern Poverty Law Center has served as class counsel in eighteen cases over the course of the past thirty years. (See Affidavit of Rhonda Brownstein ""Brownstein Aff."" P 6, Pls.' Ex. 62.) Attorneys at the Southern Poverty Law Center have been class counsel in actions before the Supreme Court of the United States, the Eleventh Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Eastern District of Louisiana, the Middle District of Alabama, the Northern District of Alabama, and the Western District of Kentucky. (Id.) Mary Bauer, one of the attorneys for Plaintiffs in this action, is the director of the argue, on the other hand, that individual questions predominate over common questions of law or fact with respect to Plaintiffs' allegations regarding inaccurate records of hours worked and resulting improper pay. Defendants assert that the claims of Plaintiffs and the other putative class members must be addressed on an individualized basis because of the many variations of the practices of the various crews. Defendants also contend that their assertion of the Motor Carrier Act affirmative defense will require individualized proof and weighs against class certification.
This is an interlocutory appeal from the district court's grant of class certification. The Appellees, migrant workers, claim Eller Sons Trees, Inc. (Eller Sons) and Jerry Eller (collectively, the Appellants) violated their rights under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1872 (AWPA) and the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-219 (FLSA), during their employment at Eller Sons at various times from June 1999 through June 2005.

The plaintiff sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services for failing to process its FOIA request for immigration records since the 2008 institution of the Controlled Application Review & Resolution Program, alleging that this conduct was a wrongful delay of release of records in violation of FOIA. The plaintiffs dismissed their claims without explanation on June 28, 2019.","2. In order to obtain information about the extent of the CARRP’s program impact on Muslim applicants for immigration benefits, on August 1, 2017, Plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to Defendants seeking the release of agency records concerning demographic information and processing times for individuals applying for naturalization, change of status, and asylum since April 11, 2008, when USCIS instituted CARRP. On September 6, 2017, Plaintiff revised the timeframe for which it is seeking the associated records.
11. Venue in the Northern District of Illinois is proper under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).
12. On April 11, 2008, USCIS released a memorandum titled, “Policy for Vetting and Adjudicating Cases with National Security Concerns,” wherein the agency instituted a covert vetting program now known as the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program (“CARRP”). See Exhibit A. Since 2008, USCIS has used CARRP—an internal policy that has neither been approved by Congress nor subjected to public notice and comment—to investigate and adjudicate applications deemed to present potential “national security concerns.” Regional offices of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (“CAIR”) and their litigation partners have previously filed lawsuits against USCIS to challenge inordinate, unreasonable delays due to CARRP. See Group Exhibit B.
13. On August 1, 2017, Plaintiff submitted an electronic FOIA request to the USCIS National Records Center FOIA/PA Office seeking: “information on all individuals who have applied for naturalization, change of status, and asylum through forms N-400, I-589, and I-485 since April 11, 2008,” specifically “the associated immigration benefit and form submitted by each applicant, the processing time for each application, the processing status for each application, the region and country of origin or asserted citizenship of each applicant, the number of times each applicant was interviewed by USCIS agents, and the number, if any, of subsidiary applicants and the status of their citizenship applications – including those who have had citizenship granted.” See Group Exhibit C.
18. The Plaintiff’s altered request also sought expedited processing and a waiver of fees. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E), agencies shall provide expedited processing of records where “the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I). A compelling need exists when there is, “with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(v).
29. FOIA mandates that an agency issue a response within 20 business days of receiving a FOIA request, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(I).

483,IM-MA-0001,"On March 2, 2007, a resident alien and two non-profits filed a class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, challenging the mandatory detention provision of Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The plaintiff also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, requesting his immediate release from detention.  

On July 12, 2007 district court held a hearing on the writ of habeas corpus, however, before ruling on the issue the plaintiff was released from custody. The court then dismissed the remainder of the case. 

","1. This is an action to declare invalid the federal defendants’ misinterpretation of Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) (“mandatory detention” provision), and Section 303(b) (“Transitional Period Custody Rules” or “TPCR”) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”). Section 236(c) of the INA, in effect since October 9, 1998, requires the mandatory detention without bond of virtually all immigrants who commit a removable offense listed therein upon the immigrant’s release from the criminal custody that resulted from the offense. The TPCR provision, in effect until October 9, 1998, also required detention upon release for those who committed removable offenses listed therein—but did not preclude bond. The net result of these two provisions is that § 236(c) does not apply to: 1) anyone released from criminal custody for an offense covered by the statute, if the release occurred prior to October 9, 1998; and 2) anyone released from criminal custody for an offense not covered by the statute, even where the release occurred after
2. Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent are immigrants unlawfully detained by defendant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Boston field office (“Boston ICE”) as a result of this misinterpretation. In erroneously subjecting plaintiffs and other class members to mandatory detention, defendants have deprived them of statutory and regulatory rights to be considered for release on bond under INA § 236(a), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), and under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(c)-(f). They have been or will be denied all opportunity to be heard concerning their suitability for release based upon evidence that they are not flight risks or a danger to their communities and that therefore no purpose is served by their detention. As a consequence of defendants’ actions, the individual plaintiffs and class members are suffering or will suffer unnecessary imprisonment, prolonged separation from family members, and economic harms, including lost business income, wages and property, as well as reduced ability to access legal services and develop and present their cases against removal. Plaintiffs also include two organizational plaintiffs—a national nonprofit immigration legal services provider and a local nonprofit immigration legal services provider that rely on limited resources and charitable contributions to assist the growing number of detainees, including unrepresented immigrants, held in Boston ICE’s New England contract detention facilities pursuant to contracts and/or agreements with the jailer defendants.
B) Plaintiff POLITICAL ASYLUM/IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION PROJECT (PAIR) is a not-for-profit organization that is the core provider of pro bono legal services to indigent asylum-seekers and immigration detainees in Massachusetts. Through its Detention Center Program, PAIR assists immigration detainees held by defendant Boston ICE in contract facilities throughout the New England region, with the goal of identifying immigrants unjustly detained and, as resources permit, representing them or helping them obtain private counsel. PAIR is one of only two organizations in the New England region that provides group presentations on legal rights to immigration detainees, as well as individual legal counseling, services that are explicitly authorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in its Detention Operations Manual. See INS Detention Standard: Group Presentation on Legal Rights (revised February 11, 2002). PAIR also provides written materials explaining to detainees their legal rights. Since September 1996, PAIR has put on approximately 125 group presentations and counseled approximately 1,750 individuals in detention facilities throughout New England. The Federal Defendants
At issue in this putative class action is the mandatory detention provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c).

In addition, Parinejad filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
For the foregoing reasons, the matter is DISMISSED in its entirety pursuant to Parinejad's notice of dismissal.

484,IM-MA-0018,"In September 2019, the Irish International Immigrant Center sued U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services and President Trump. Plaintiff alleged defendants illegally terminated an immigration relief program that granted ""deferred action"" to seriously ill individuals and their families. Represented by the ACLU, the plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief for violations of Equal Protection and the Administrative Procedure Act. The court granted a joint motion to stay the case on October 31, 2019, so parties could seek a nonjudicial resolution. This followed a USCUS announcement that the deferred action program would return but requests would only be granted “based on compelling facts and circumstances.” Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice on June 15, 2021.","INTRODUCTION This lawsuit challenges the Trump Administration’s abrupt termination of a longstanding government program that protects seriously ill people from deportation and death. The Administration’s action is unconscionable. It is also illegal. For decades, the United States Customs and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) has operated a small but vital humanitarian program that allows immigrant families battling serious illnesses to request immigration relief in the form of “deferred action.” The program recognizes that deporting seriously ill individuals and their families is in many cases tantamount to a death sentence. Deferred action does not grant immigration status to beneficiaries; it confers other benefits, including an opportunity to apply for work authorization, the tolling of any accrual of “unlawful presence” that could bar future entry into the United States, and a measure of protection against removal proceedings by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). Those protected by this program are in dire straits. They include the mother of a U.S. citizen baby that has spent eight of the last ten months in the hospital; a ten-year-old girl with eye cancer; and a partially-immobilized 18-year-old boy with burns over 70% of his body. In August 2019, the Trump Administration abruptly prohibited USCIS field offices from granting deferred action in cases of serious medical need, and has now put the lives of scores of medically fragile individuals at immense and immediate risk. In doing so, the Administration provided no opportunity for notice-and-comment, or any other procedural protection that is required under the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”). Nor did the Administration provide any rationale for its abrupt termination of the program, as required by law.
1343. This Court has authority to issue declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, 5 U.S.C. §§ 702-06, and the Court’s inherent equitable powers. Venue is proper in the District of Massachusetts under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).
PARTIES Plaintiff Irish International Immigrant Center, Inc. is a nonprofit organization based in Boston, Massachusetts. Founded by Irish immigrants in 1989, the IIIC provides services for 3,500 immigrants and refugees from more than 120 countries every year. The IIIC empowers newcomers with legal and other services so they can reach stability, contribute to their communities, and flourish. As part of this work, the IIIC helps immigrant families with life- threatening illnesses apply for and secure deferred action status from USCIS. See generally Exhibit 1, Declaration of Anthony Marino.
2020. For example, in March 2020, deferred action will expire for the family of the seven-year-old boy whose epilepsy is so severe that it results in multiple seizures a day and a risk of sudden death III. USCIS Abruptly Terminated Deferred Action in Non-Military Cases. On August 7, 2019, USCIS abruptly and without notice stopped its consideration of deferred action for non-military requestors. USCIS did not publicly announce its change in policy. Nor, on information and belief, did it provide a reason for the change. Around August 15, 2019, USCIS’ Boston field office began sending denial letters to deferred action applicants. The IIIC, on behalf of its clients, received the first of these letters on August 19, 2019, from the USCIS Boston Field Office Director. Denial of applications for six additional clients followed, all of which were dated between August 15 and 22,

485,IM-MD-0010,"In 2018, the City of Baltimore filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiff alleged that certain changes to the Public Charge rule by the U.S. President, Secretary of State, and Department of State were made without following proper administrative procedure and in violation of equal protection. The rule increased the number of immigrants barred from applying for visas for having previously received public assistance. The rule was preliminarily enjoined in a different lawsuit on July 29, 2020. The lawsuit is ongoing, but proceedings are stayed until May 24, 2021.","18. This case involves the process by which non-citizens may apply for a visa to enter the United States, and the Trump Administration’s attempts to restrict that process for noncitizens who may use public benefits.
58. INS never finalized the 1999 NPRM. INS’s 1999 Field Guidance.
Baltimore’s homeless services programs. Or an immigrant may choose to defray the hit to their budget from losing one source of public assistance by consuming another service provided by Baltimore. In other words, by forcing immigrants off of federal or other programs, the FAM change effectively forces them onto programs administered by Baltimore, increasing Baltimore’s costs.
American Immigration Council; Americans for Immigrant Justice; Asian Americans Advancing Justice Los Angeles; Black Alliance for Just Immigration; LatinoJustice PRLDEF; MacArthur Justice Center; Muslim Advocates; National Immigrant Justice Center; Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, Inc.; and Southern Poverty Law Center jointly filed a memorandum in support of plaintiff, docketed at ECF 51.
71. The government argues that the City has not plausibly raised this claim, insisting that the amended FAM does not attach new legal consequences to past events. ECF 17-1 at 42-44. Instead, it allows past events to be considered as a factor in future visa determinations. The City disagrees. It maintains that it sufficiently alleged that the changes to the FAM are impermissibly retroactive. ECF 25 at 49-51. Further, it contends that such a retroactive change must be authorized by statute. Moreover, even if it were authorized, it would be unjustified, according to the City. “Retroactivity is not favored in the law.” Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988). The “core principle disfavoring retroactive application of laws” is that “‘settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted[.]’” GTE S., Inc v. Morrison, 199 F.3d 733, 741 (4th Cir. 1999) (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 265). The APA provides that a rule must be of “future effect.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(4). Therefore, “a statutory grant of legislative rulemaking authority will not, as a general matter, be understood to encompass the power to promulgate retroactive rules unless that power is conveyed by Congress in express terms.” Bowen, 488 U.S. at
259. Instead, the Department appears content to allow the specter of the IFR (and the FAM change) to continue deterring immigrants and their families from using public benefits. By its terms, the IFR applies to all benefits received after October 15, 2019, see id. at 55,005, even though the Department did not actually begin implementing the IFR on that date XI.

42. Petitioners are among dozens of detainees in the State of Pennsylvania—and the Middle District of Pennsylvania in particular—who have been held for six months or more without a hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified. Indeed, it is the government’s policy or practice to detain non-citizens for prolonged periods of time pending completion of their removal proceedings without providing them with hearings to determine whether such detention is justified.
50. Petitioners request only one form of relief: a constitutionally adequate hearing to determine whether their prolonged detention is justified. Petitioners argue here that: (1) the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) does not authorize their prolonged detention without such a hearing, and (2) if it does, their prolonged detention without adequate review violates the Due Process Clause.
The petitioners are lawful permanent residents charged by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement with being deportable from the United States as a result of certain criminal convictions. In their combination habeas petition and civil complaint, the petitioners challenge their detention during the pendency of removal proceedings pursuant to the mandatory detention provisions of Section 236(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). As of the date of the filing of their amended petition, Alli and Grenade had been detained for approximately 9 months and 20 months respectively.1 The petitioners seek a declaration that the failure to provide them with a hearing at which the government must justify their continued detention violates the INA and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The petitioners also seek an order directing the government to conduct such hearings and have moved for a preliminary injunction directing the government to conduct their hearings within 14 days.
Finally, the portions of the petitioners’ habeas petition seeking class relief will be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the petitioners’ motion for class certification will be denied. NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

489,IM-SC-0001,"This is a class action lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a South Carolina immigration law which requires state and local law enforcement officers to investigate the immigration status of any individual they stop, detain, or arrest whenever they have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the individual lacks immigration status, allows law enforcement officers to arrest individuals solely for failing to carry registration documents, makes it a crime to harbor or transport an undocumented immigrant or to be harbored or transported by others if one is an undocumented immigrant, and imposes civil liability on the police for failing to enforce its provisions to the maximum extent possible. The law was patterned after Arizona's SB 1070. The District Court has issued a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the law, and this injunction has been appealed to the Fourth Circuit; in the meantime, the case, along with several others like it from different states, are stayed at the District Court or U.S. Appellate level pending the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Arizona.

After Arizona v. United States was decided the issue was remanded to the District Court. The district court left in place most of its original preliminary injunction, enjoining the state from enforcing Sections 4, 5, and 6 (B)(2). The 4th Circuit per Judge Davis agreed and affirmed the order on July 13, 2013. In March of 2014 Judge Gergel permanently enjoined South Carolina from enforcing Sections 4, 5, and 6(B)(2). Furthermore the state agreed to more favorable interpretations of Section 7, and the remainder of Section, encouraging the Plaintiffs to dismiss their claims on those sections without prejudice. ","24. Plaintiff Nuevos Caminos is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to providing hope to Hispanic families in the communities of Charleston, Dorchester, and Berkeley Counties in South Carolina. The organization provides services to Hispanic families, including immigrant families, through needs assessment, case management, Spanish/English assistance, community forums, parenting and pre-parenting classes, mothers’ support groups, and assistance to victims of violence, including domestic violence. All of their services are provided in Spanish. Families are often referred to Nuevos Caminos after they are in contact with the South Carolina Department of Social Services, the criminal court, or the family court. Some of Nuevos Caminos’s services are provided to crime victims.
34. Plaintiff South Carolina Hispanic Leadership Council (“SCHLC”) is an organization dedicated to enhancing the quality of life and quantity of services delivered to the Hispanic Community in South Carolina through the sharing of useful information and timely exchange of ideas. The SCHLC has approximately 5 board members and approximately 180 members. The majority of its members are Latino. The SCHLC serves the Hispanic community in South Carolina by educating members about business leadership, offering Reach scholarships to low-income students, being a partner in the state’s Latin Festival, convening an annual luncheon, and offering public speakers during Hispanic Heritage Month. The volunteer board members carry out these services and organize these events.
36. Plaintiff Service Employees International Union (“SEIU”) is one of the largest labor organizations in the world, representing 2.2 million men and women who work primarily in the public sector and in janitorial, health services, long-term care, and security industries. Many of SEIU’s members are recent immigrants to the United States and many of its members come from racial minority groups. SEIU has long called for and worked toward comprehensive reform of U.S. immigration laws. Another priority for SEIU is fighting discrimination against minorities, women, and other groups in the workplace and society in general. In South Carolina, SEIU has a local affiliate, the Southern Regional Joint Board of Workers United. This affiliate represents about 1,125 employees who live in South Carolina. These employees work in seven different work sites across the state and at one worksite in Pineville, North Carolina, which is on the North-South Carolina border. At least 50 of these employees reside in the Charleston area. Approximately 15 percent of the employees that the Joint Board represents in South Carolina are Latino and the majority of the remainder are African American. In South Carolina, SEIU works in partnership with the Southern Regional Joint Board and other groups to combat discrimination and mobilize for immigration reform at the national level.
Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-2958 Civil Action No. 2: 11-cv-2779 ORDER This matter comes before the Court on motions for preliminary injunction filed by plaintiffs in the two above-captioned matters. These actions arise out of legislation adopted by the South Carolina General Assembly on June 27, 2011 (hereafter referred to as ""Act 69"" or ""the Act""). Act 69 attempts to address a broad range of immigration related issues through, inter alia, the adoption of various state criminal provisions, employer sanctions and mandates to local law enforcement regarding the identification and apprehension of persons unlawfully present in the United States. Plaintiffs in the two separate actions assert similar, but not identical, constitutional challenges to various sections of Act 69 and seek to preliminarily enjoin the implementation of portions of the challenged state statute, which will otherwise become effective on January 1,

B. In two separate actions filed in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, the Lowcountry Immigration Coalition (“Lowcountry Plaintiffs”) and the United States challenged various sections of the Act, largely on preemption grounds. Lowcountry Plaintiffs is a group of individuals and organizations, including the National Immigration Law Center, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina. The district court, after consolidating the cases, found Sections 4, 5, and 6(B)(2) (as well as other subsections of Section 6 not relevant here) were preempted by federal law and issued a preliminary injunction as to those sections.

The complaint alleged that the law would subject South Carolinians with permission from the federal government to unlawful interrogations, prolonged detentions, and arrests. On July 23, 2013, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of Section 6(B)(2) until further order of this Court.","On June 27, 2011, a group of individuals and organizations, including the National Immigration Law Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina.

490,IM-TX-0019,"On December 15, 2006, a group of employees at Swift Beef Company's meat packing plants filed a class action lawsuit against their employer and related companies, alleging that Swift had engaged in a longstanding scheme of hiring undocumented immigrants for the express purpose of depressing employee wages, and that in furtherance of its scheme, Swift had recruited undocumented immigrants to work in its plants and assisted in providing them with fake immigration documents. After the Court dismissed plaintiffs' illegal hiring claims as insufficiently specific and denied their motion for class certification, the parties stipulated for a dismissal with prejudice on June 18, 2009, and the case was terminated.","This is a putative class action brought on behalf of all persons legally authorized to be employed in the United States who have been employed at Swift’s processing plants as hourly wage earners.

They have filed suit against Swiftas a corporate entity and against five John Does – unidentified members of Swift’s management (collectively, “Management”). 1

Defendant 4 denied Mr. Shovey access to a psychiatrist for over a year after his arrest, despite 5 serious mental health symptoms, because a therapist decided medications were not 6 warranted since he had not been receiving them in the months before he was 7 arrested. Individuals who are referred to a psychiatrist must often wait several 8 weeks to be seen. Once a jail clinician finally referred Mr. Shovey to a psychiatrist 9 because of symptoms including paranoia and mania, he had to wait five weeks and 10 file two grievance before a psychiatrist evaluated him. People who are suffering 11 from severe symptoms must wait weeks or months before receiving psychiatric 12 medications.
19. Defendant has a policy and practice of denying or delaying access to 7 psychiatrists. Therapists generally operate as gatekeepers, and, based on assessments they 8 are not qualified to make, deny access to psychiatrists. For example, former plaintiff 9 Zachery Shovey, who is no longer in Defendant’s custody, had a serious psychiatric 10 condition that led to placement in state psychiatric hospital for nine months. When Mr.
46. After intake, Defendant does not house people with physical disabilities in 4 locations where they can safely programs and services. For example, Defendant did not 5 house Mr. Topete, who uses a wheelchair, in an accessible housing unit. His wheelchair 6 did not fit through his cell door, which meant that he had to stand up, fold his wheelchair, 7 push it through the doorframe, and then unfold the wheelchair again once inside. There 8 were no grab bars next to the toilet inside his cell or the shower. Defendant forced him to 9 go up and down stairs, without any assistance, to access the visiting room to visit his 10 family. Once he reached the top of these stairs, Defendant did not provide him with his 11 wheelchair that remained on the floor below Mr. Topete fell and was at risk of serious 12 injury as a result of Defendant’s failure to accommodate him. Defendant does not have 13 enough housing units equipped with accessible features to meet the needs of its current jail 14 population.

495,JC-CO-0006,"On April 2, 2002, prisoners at the El Paso County Jail in Colorado Springs filed a class action lawsuit uagainst El Paso County, the Board of County Commissioners, and former and current Sheriffs. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, alleged that the jail failed to protect and adequately provide for prisoners with serious mental health needs, particularly in preventing suicides. On June 28, 2006, Judge Richard P. Matsch denied class certification and on September 22, 2006, he dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.  ","34. The Jail’s use-of-force policy permits officers to use pepper spray against prisoners “in the maintenance of order and discipline.” Pepper spray is sprayed in the face, and causes excruciating pain, gagging, and temporary paralysis of the larynx. Its use in custodial settings has been associated with side effects including high blood pressure, nerve damage, chemical burns, and death. The Jail’s policy and training materials do not caution officers that pepper spray often fails to achieve the desired effect when the prisoner’s unruly behavior is the result of mental illness or overdose or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol. Nor do the Jail’s policy or training materials provide that officers should limit use of pepper spray to a single one-second burst. As a result, mentally ill prisoners are likely to be subjected to repeated doses of pepper spray, with the accompanying increased risk of serious health consequences and even death. The El Paso County Coroner identified pepper spray as a contributing cause of the death of Andrew Spillane, a pre-trial detainee who died in the Jail in May,
23. Instead, the court focused entirely on the PLRA, reasoning that the relief plaintiffs sought was beyond its jurisdictional competence after the passage of the PLRA and that class certification is properly denied when the court lacks “the authority to order the prospective remedy requested.” Shook v Bd. of County Comm’rs of County of El Paso, 216 F.R.D. 644, 647 (D Colo. 2003). We reversed. Noting that “[t] he text of the PLRA says nothing about the certification of class actions,” though it does contain provisions discussing the administration of class actions once certified, we held that “the PLRA does not alter the class certification analysis under Rule 23.” Shook v. El Paso County, 386 F.3d 963, 970 (10th Cir. 2004) (“Shook I”). And because the PLRA left the traditional Rule 23 class certification standards intact, we held that the district court, which had neither analyzed Rule 23(a)’s 1 Mr. Reinig and Ms. Elliott did not intervene until after this case was remanded to the district court, and thus their allegations were not before the district court when it issued its first order. In addition to the details of the nam ed plaintiffs’ experiences at the Jail, the various complaints contain allegations about a number of other inmates, some identified by name and others anonymous.
The district court again denied class certification. This time, the court held that plaintiffs had failed to satisfy either Rule 23(a)(2), (a)(3) or (b)(2). Shook v Bd. of County Comm’rs of County of El Paso, 2006 WL 1801379, at *1 (D Colo. 2006) (“D Ct. Op.”). With respect to this last provision, the district court held that plaintiffs failed to bear their burden under Rule 23(b)(2) of showing that defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, such that the declaratory and injunctive relief sought is appropriate respecting the class as a whole Id. In particular, the district court noted the factual differences between the individual named plaintiffs’ situations, suggesting that because some plaintiffs were asserting claims for denial of medication, some for lack of supervision, and others for use of excessive force, there was no single policy or procedure to which all were subject. Similarly, the court held, this variation in fact patterns made injunctive relief on a class-wide basis inappropriate Id. at *11. The court reasoned that many of the matters plaintiffs sought to have addressed, such as the use of tasers or restraints, could not be dealt with prospectively on a class-wide basis because the propriety of using such methods depended on the circumstances in which they were used, and those circumstances necessarily varied among class members Id. And while some of the standards plaintiffs sought to have put in place did not depend on individual circumstance, the court expressed concern that it was not equipped to determine what constitutes “adequate” training or how many employees are “sufficient” to deal with a shifting number of mentally ill prisoners, id., and thus that it would be extraordinarily difficult to craft an injunction satisfying the specificity requirements of Fed R. Civ P. 65(d).2 Plaintiffs now appeal this decision, contending that the district court’s second order suffers many of the same defects as its first.

The plaintiffs challenged the Cook County Sheriff's policy of strip searching all males following their return to the Cook County Jail from court after there was a judicial determination that there was no longer a basis for their detention.  The parties settled in 2011 and the defendants paid $1.4 million in damages and roughly $2 million in attorney's fees and costs. ","4. Defendant Cook County, under Illinois law, funds the Office of the defendant Sheriff, and is therefore required to pay a judgment entered against the sheriff’s office in it’s official capacity.
33. In the fall of 1996, defendant Sheahan entered into a settlement with the plaintiff class in Watson. The class included approximately 51,000 male and female inmates who were held for excessive periods of time at the Jail after receiving a judicial order requiring their release.
Dist. Lexis 13884, (2003), the plaintiffs challenged the District of Columbia, Department of Correction’s policy of strip searching inmates upon reku’ning from court to jail with court orders entitling them to be released. In determining that the plaintiffs’ had satisfied the commonality requirement of Rtde 23(a), the court stated that Regardless of the potential variation of individual circumstances of each inmate’s return, the challenged activity-strip searching- is common to all putative class member. The question of whether defendant’s policy of strip searching violates the Constitution raises questions of law and fact that are common to the class. When the cause of action arises out of a course of conduct that affects a group of persons, one or more elements of the cause of action will be common to the entire group. Bynum, 214 F.R.D. at 34 (quoting Alba Conte Herbert Newberg, Newberg On Class Actions Sect. 3.10 (42 ed., 2002). In this case, as with the other detention class, the question of causation will be the same for all plaintiffs, because it is the same course of conduct that allegedly injured each plaintiff.
As of March 2008, the jail housed 9,165 inmates. Of these, 8,436 were male and 729 were female. Approximately 800 to 1,200 inmates go to court on any given weekday. The inmates are transported by bus to different courts. The ratio of male to female inmates is greater than 9 to
B. Fourth Amendment The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979) governs Fourth Amendment unreasonable search analysis in the prison context. The plaintiffs in Bell challenged the defendants’ practice of strip searching all inmates following contact visits. The Supreme Court held:
The parties agree that as of March 2008, the Jail housed 9,165 inmates. Of these, 8,436 were male and 729 were female--a ratio of approximately nine to one. CCDOC inmates live in one of the Jail's ten housing divisions, each of which operates semi-autonomously and has its own separate building on the Jail grounds. Eight of the divisions are for men, and two are for women. Inmates are housed according to their security classifications, which are established based on a number of factors, including criminal history, prior convictions, prior disciplinary problems, known gang affiliation, any history of drug or alcohol abuse, etc. Roughly 32% of all CCDOC inmates (male and female) have a maximum security classification.
1988. The plaintiffs allege that they were strip searched upon being returned to the jail for out-processing following a court ruling which warranted their release from Jail.
4. Settlement Process. During the pendency of defendants’ appeal on Eleventh Amendment issues, counsel for the parties participated in the Settlement Conference Program of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. With the assistance of Joel N. Shapiro, Senior Conference Attorney, counsel for the parties discussed the outline of a proposed resolution of this case. Counsel thereafter renewed the settlement dialogue and agreed to a proposed settlement. This proposal was presented to the Cook County Board and approved by the Board after further negotiations between the parties. The pro- posed settlement takes into account the risks, delay and difficulties involved in establishing a right to recovery in excess of that offered by this settlement and the likelihood that the litigation will be further protracted.
In March 2011, the parties in this suit entered into a settlement agreement. One term of the agreement stipulated that Reid was to receive an “incentive award” of $25,000 for serving as one of the representatives for the plaintiff class. Defendants later discovered that, during bankruptcy proceedings in 2010, Reid certified that he had no legal claims of any value. Defendants claim that Reid’s debts were ultimately discharged on the basis of the latter representation, and that, as a result, he is now judicially estopped from recovering the incentive award. I agree.

ROSEMARY MUNYIRI, Plaintiff v. PETER M. HADUCH, JR., et al., Defendants Civil No. AMD 08-1953 MEMORANDUM OPINION and ORDER This case stems from an arrest by a Baltimore City police officer following a traffic stop on I-83 in Baltimore City. Plaintiff Rosemary Munyiri asserts that she was pulled over for minor traffic offenses, arrested at gunpoint, and taken to the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Facility (“CBIF”), where she was subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches. Munyiri has filed a multitude of damages claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of the Fourth Amendment against the following defendants: (1) Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (“DPSCS”); (2) the Secretary of DPSCS (“Secretary Maynard”); (3) the Warden of the Central Booking and Intake Facility (“Warden Williams”);(4) Unnamed correctional officers at CBIF; (5) the Baltimore City Police Department (“the BCPD”); (6) the Commissioner of the BCPD (“Commissioner Bealefeld”); (7) the arresting officer, Peter M. Haduch, Jr. (“Officer Haduch”); and (8) the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City. Secretary Maynard, Warden Williams, Commissioner Bealefeld, and Officer Haduch were sued in both their official and individual capacities.
At trial on July 2, 2008, Haduch failed to appear and the state entered a nolle prosequi as to all the charges against Munyiri. Munyiri filed this action about three weeks later.
2008. In all other respects, the motions to dismiss are GRANTED and ALL CLAIMS against the remaining defendants are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.
Now pending before the court is a motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted filed by defendants Gary D. Maynard (“Secretary Maynard”), Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (“DPSCS”), Mitchell Franks (“former Warden Franks”), former Warden of the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Facility (“CBIF”), and Naomi Williams (“Warden Williams”), the CBIF’s current Warden (collectively “defendants”). Plaintiffs Rosemary Munyiri, Kimberly Felder, Christina Schaeffer, and Nelear Walls are suing defendants in their individual capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. The issues in this case have been fully briefed and no hearing is necessary. For the reasons stated below, the defendants’ motion to dismiss will be denied.
I have reviewed the pending motion for summary judgment on behalf of defendants Gary D. Maynard, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, and Mitchell Franks and Naomi Williams, former Wardens of the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center (“Central Booking”). They have been sued by four female plaintiffs who allege they were subjected to unconstitutional strip searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment following their arrests for minor offenses. Two of the plaintiffs were searched in April 2008, during Warden Franks’s tenure. The other two plaintiffs were searched in November 2009 and January 2009, respectively, during Warden Williams’s tenure. The plaintiffs bring their claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, relying on a theory of supervisory liability against the Secretary and the Wardens.1 Under § 1983, supervisory liability may attach if a plaintiff can establish:

2. The plaintiffs class action challenges certain condition of confinement at the Suffolk County Center, located in Riverhead NAI!I Yor!<.
6. Venue is proper because the events complained of occurred in the County of Suffolk, which is the Eastern District of New York.
8. Venue is proper in the Eastern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). All the events described in this Complaint occurred in the Eastern District of New York.
17. Defendant Suffolk County operates the SCCF through its Sheriff’s Office and allocates funds for the maintenance of the SCCF. The Sheriff’s Office promulgates and implements policies at the SCCF, including those governing the living and housing conditions, grievance procedures, and access to medical and other program services, mandated by local law and court orders, at the SCCF.
28. Of-counsel in this case, the New York Civil Liberties Union (the “NYCLU”), is a non-profit membership organization founded in 1951 as the New York State affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union. The NYCLU has long been devoted to protecting the fundamental rights and values embodied in the United States Constitution and the New York Constitution, and has extensive experience in litigating federal court class action cases involving civil rights claims. Indeed, the NYCLU has specific history successfully litigating class actions involving the SCCF in the Eastern District of New York. In 1974, the NYCLU served as class counsel in Manicone v. Cleary, 74 Civ. 575 (JBW) (E.D.N.Y.), a class action challenging certain conditions of confinement at the SCCF. That case resulted in a consent order that remained in effect for more than two decades, during which time the NYCLU consistently served as counsel to the class in enforcement actions and motions to modify the consent order.
30. The SCCF has a history of violating minimum health and safety standards for correctional facilities in the State of New York. In 1997, The New York Times quoted a spokesman for the New York State Commission of Corrections (“NYSCOC”), who described the SCCF as “the most seriously and profoundly overcrowded county facility in the state.” Seven years later, a February 2004 article in The New York Times quoted the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office as acknowledging that the severe overcrowding issues in the SCCF continued and estimating that the SCCF was typically housing at least 1,400 persons, but often more than 1,500, in facilities that, at the time, could handle just over 1,100.
75. Riverhead’s unsanitary environment is compounded by inadequate ventilation. Inadequate ventilation creates and exacerbates unsanitary and unhealthy conditions by providing an environment hospitable to fungus, mold, rust, and bacteria, and by contributing to the transmission of airborne diseases. The serious nature of the problem is magnified for those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory ailments or have compromised immune systems, such as those men who have HIV infections.
153. Suffolk County has systematically and deliberately ignored, or failed to take reasonable measures to address, the visibly deplorable and unconstitutional conditions at the SCCF. As described in detail in this Complaint, the facilities are overcrowded and filled with rust and holes, causing them to leak water in many areas inside the facilities. Areas of the walls, ceilings, and showers are covered in black mold. Men are forced to live in each others’ filth and waste. The facilities are infested with rodents and insects. The water is undrinkable and visibly dirty, and the food is inadequate and unsafe and served in visibly filthy conditions.

On November 19, 2014, the Court issued an order of final dismissal terminating the settlement agreement and dismissing the case with prejudice.","In large part, the lack of a clear and consistent procedure for on‐going assessment of suicide risk can be attributed to the fragmentation of the mental health service delivery system at the Facility. The Facility's lead social worker, another part‐time social worker, a counselor, and a variety of community‐based counselors all provide mental health care services to Terrebonne youth. While the number of available counselors is encouraging, the fact that they do not communicate regularly, share information on clients, or have access to each other’s progress notes means that the service delivery system is disjointed and a strong potential exists for a youth’s mental health needs to fall through the cracks.

The Monitor shall be an expert in the area of juvenile protection from harm. The Parties shall agree upon a Monitor within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date. If the Parties are unable to agree upon a Monitor, then each Party shall submit two names, along with resumes or curricula vitae and cost proposals, to the Court, within 120 days of the Effective Date and the Court shall appoint the Monitor from among the names submitted.
76. Monitor’s Access to Facility and Records. In order to assess the Parish’s implementation of each substantive provision of this Agreement, the Monitor will conduct regular compliance reviews to ensure that the Parish has implemented and continues to implement all measures required by this Agreement. Such access shall continue until this Agreement is terminated.
77. Settlement Agreement Coordinator. The Parish shall appoint a settlement agreement coordinator to oversee compliance with this Agreement. The settlement agreement coordinator shall:
c) The Parish may, at any time during the term of this Agreement, request that the United States certify that the Parish has maintained substantial compliance with all provisions of this Agreement for twelve (12) consecutive months. If the United States so certifies, the parties shall jointly move the Court to dismiss this action.
87. Non-retaliation. The Parish agrees that it shall not retaliate against any person because that person has provided any information or assistance to the United States or the Monitor, has filed or will file a complaint, or has participated in any other manner in an investigation or proceeding relating to this Agreement. The Parish agrees that it shall timely and thoroughly investigate any allegations of retaliation in violation of this Agreement and take corrective actions identified through such investigations.
6. The revised settlement agreement shall be entered into the record. Based on the stipulation of the parties, the Court finds that the prospective relief in the revised agreement is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the federal right for purposes of 18 U.S.C. §

The case was dismissed without prejudice on September 22, 2003, when Defendant agreed to provide Plaintiff with an application for those services.","v. Revnolds, 6 F.3d 519, 526 (8th CiT. 1993). Participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but if a state chooses to participate, it must do so in accordance with federal statutes and regulations. Little Rock Family Planning Services. P.A v
BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS' RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION I. Introduction This case concerns the Developmental Disabilities Alternative Community Services Medicaid Waiver (""ACS waiver"") administered by the Arkansas Department of Human Services (""ADHS""). Plaintiff, already a Medicaid recipient, seeks a preliminary injunction requiring ADHS to immediately accept her ACS waiver application, determine her eligibility for ACS waiver services, and, if she is eligible, provide ACS waiver services. She does not allege that the full array of Medicaid services falls short of meeting her health care needs. Nor does she allege what, if any, ACS waiver services she must have to avoid irreparable injury.
The defendants argue at page 5 of their brief that the plaintiff does not suffer a threat of irreparable harm arising out of their refusal to give her an application for ACS services. The plaintiff disagrees. Because the defendants refuse to give an application to the plaintiff, she has no way of applying for ACS services. If she cannot apply for ACS services, she has no way to get them. By foreclosing the plaintiffs ability to receive waiver services, the defendants have exposed her to a very real threat of physical and emotional harm that clearly satisfies her burden of proving a ""threat of irreparable harm"". Chu Drua Cha v. Noot, 696 F.2d 594, 599 (8th Cir. 1982) (irreparable harm established because loss of some medical care cannot be made up by the later entry ofa money judgment)(citing Turner v. Walsh, 435 F Supp. 707, 711 (W.D Mo. 1977) (termination or reduction of Medicaid benefits is sufficient irreparable injury to justify temporary restraining order), affd per curiam, 574 F.2d 456 (8th Cir. 1978) (approving the district court's opinion as ""weJl-reasoned"")). The defendants provide ACS services because they enrich the lives of those who need them, i.e. disabled individuals for whom these services were specifically designed, and there can be no serious question that depriving the plaintiff of her only opportunity to receive these services exposes her to a threat of irreparable harm. The defendants argue that the plaintiff cannot prove a threat of irreparable harm simply because there are no open slots under the ACS program. The defendants are mistaken. On page 5 of their brief, the defendants tell the Court that there are only 3,067 total slots under the ACS program, but a letter obrained from the defendants under the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act shows that there are 3,598 total slots under the program at this time. See the letter attached hereto and marked as ""Exhibit I "". This letter is dated August 6, 2002, and is from Dr. James Farris, Regional Administrator for the federal Department of Health Human Services, Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services, to Ray Hanley, former Director of the Division of Medical Services of the Arkansas Department of Human Services. In the letter, Dr. Farris states that he is pleased to inform Mr. Hanley that his request for an amendment to the Arkansas Home and Community-Based Services Waiver has been approved effective July 1,
The district court granted preliminary injunctive relief to the plaintiffs on this claim. It found that West Virginia had no clear policies, procedures, or forms regarding applications under the waiver program. C~itical elements of application policies and procedures had not been reduced to writing, such as criteria for ranking individuals placed by the State on a ""waiting list"" for services. Individuals were discouraged from applying unless the State thought they were eligible, and no one was given the fully-completed application packet required by the State unless they were on the waiting list and the State had a slot open and waiting to be filled Id. at

506,PB-CA-0031,"On January 20, 2010, an employee of the federal judiciary married to her same-sex partner under California law filed a lawsuit against the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, alleging that the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) violates the Fifth Amendment by refusing to recognize lawful same-sex marriages for purposes of the laws governing spousal health benefits for federal employees, thereby denying her of a benefit that would be available to her if her spouse were of the opposite sex. On February 22, 2012, the District Court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff, holding that the application of DOMA to deny spousal health benefits in this case did not have a rational basis and thus constituted a Fifth Amendment violation. It entered a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from interfering with the enrollment of the plaintiff's wife in her family health benefits plan.  On July 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a petition in the Supreme Court for certiorari prior to judgment.   That petition was held without decision while the Court considered the California Prop. 8 case (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11970"">PB-CA-0029</a> in this Clearinghouse) and Windsor, the DOMA case from the Second Circuit (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12113"">PB-NY-0017</a> in this Clearinghouse), in which the Court granted review on December 7.

The district court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, holding that  3 of DOMA, as applied to her, violated the equal protection and due process components of the Fifth Amendment. The case was held in abeyance pending the Supreme Court's resolution of United States v. Windsor, No. 12-307, which held that DOMA was unconstitutional as a deprivation of liberty of the person protected by the Fifth amendment of the Constitution.

507,PB-CA-0039,"Plaintiff, an individual with muscular dystrophy, filed this lawsuit alleging that the state's planned reduction in his home care nursing services (due to his reaching his 21st birthday and transition into ""adult"" services) puts him at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in violation of the ADA and Section 504. The parties reached a settlement agreement and on August 1, 2013, the case was dismissed.","1. This civil rights action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the 3 devastating reduction in Medi-Cal funded in-home nursing care to Plaintiff Pablo Carranza. This 4 young man has Muscular Dystrophy, a severe and progressive disease that has left him unable even 5 to breathe or swallow on his own. Pursuant to his doctor’s orders, he needs constant skilled 6 nursing care to monitor his ventilator, feeding tube and oxygen levels, to clear fluids from his lungs 7 and tracheotomy tube, to transfer him from bed to wheelchair and back, and to bathe and reposition 8 him. While this kind of twenty-four hour care is often provided in a hospital or Subacute medical 9 care facility, Pablo has been able to remain at home with his family. If the Medi-Cal program 10 reduces Pablo’s in-home nursing care as planned, he will be placed at risk of unnecessary 11 institutionalization, and separated from his family and community. Due to his fragile medical 12 condition, placement in an institution is also likely to result in dire health consequences and even 13 death.
17 The cost of his care was $230,000 per year, which is far less than the amount Medi-Cal would 18 actually pay for institutional placement for an individual with Pablo’s care needs. On Pablo’s 21st 19 birthday September 17, 2012 Defendant Department of Health Care Services and its Director, 20 Toby Douglas (collectively “DHCS” or “Defendants”), reduced the authorization for his in-home 21 nursing by more than 200 hours per month, even though his condition has not improved. The sole 22 reason for this drastic and life-threatening reduction in Plaintiff’s in-home nursing care is that 23 Defendants have placed arbitrary cost limitations on the home care services available to adults 24 versus those for children. Specifically, Defendants capped the cost of in-home nursing care for 25 adults such as Pablo at $180,000 per year, which is at least $90,000 below the actual cost of 26 equivalent care in an Adult Subacute facility, and also significantly below the cost that Medi-Cal 27 provided for his care prior to his 21st birthday.
3. Defendants have the discretion and the ability to modify State Medi-Cal rules to Carranza v. Douglas: Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief 1 increase the arbitrary cap on Plaintiff’s in-home nursing care to enable him to receive the skilled 2 nursing care he needs, and that is ordered by his doctors. They have refused to do so.
10 § 12312 (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“Section 11 504”). Under the ADA and Section 504, a public agency such as DHCS has a duty to provide 12 services to people with disabilities in the “most integrated setting appropriate to their needs” and 13 avoid unnecessary institutionalization. The most integrated setting for Pablo is to live in the 14 community with his family, as he has for the past 21 years of his life, with adequate in-home 15 nursing to meet his significant needs. Placing him at risk of unnecessary institutionalization in 16 order to receive the care he needs violates the ADA.
17. Medicaid is a joint federal and state medical assistance program for certain groups 9 of low-income people, including children. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v. California has elected to 10 participate in the Medicaid program, and so must comply with the requirements of the federal 11 Medicaid Act and its implementing regulations. California’s Medicaid program is known as 12 “Medi-Cal.” 18.
41. Pablo’s health care has been funded entirely by Medi-Cal. 42.
78. Defendant’s actions are in violation of Title II of the ADA.
90. Under the due process clause of United States Constitution, when recipients of 8 needs-based public benefits such as Medicaid are facing a reduction or termination of benefits, they 9 are entitled to advance written notice explaining the basis for the adverse government action and an 10 opportunity for a hearing prior to reduction or termination of their benefits.

Mr. Foreman has maintained a strong preference to live independently in the community and has consistently asked for transition assistance at the nursing facility and the hospitals to which he was admitted subsequently. The District failed to provide Mr. Foreman with transition assistance to access long-term home and community based services. Prior to his discharge from the nursing facility, the DC Housing Authority had offered Mr. Foreman three wheelchair-accessible apartments but failed to assist him to access the Medicaid Waiver for People who are Elderly or have Physical Disabilities (EPD Waiver).
Ms. Tucker assumed that she “would be able to move once they find [her] a place and stuff like that,” but the District “never brought [her] the voucher.” (Id. at 53:18–25.) Ms. Tucker visited one apartment in the community. (Id. at 58:22–25.) It was not fully wheelchair accessible. (Id. at 59:2–5.)

KAREN LECRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge: In Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, the United States Supreme Court held that the unjustified segregation of disabled individuals in institutions is a form of disability discrimination barred by federal law. 527 U.S. 581 (1999). Consequently, the District of Columbia (“District”) violates the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Pub L No. 101-336, 104 Stat.
After a nine-day bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of the District. We now reverse and remand.","In 2012, the District of Columbia's Department of Health Care Finance Administration (""DHCF""), the single state agency that administers the District's Medicaid program, was sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington for failing to comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (""Title II"") by failing to integrate people with disabilities into community-based programs and services appropriate to their needs. The complaint alleged that the lack of integrated services was a form of discrimination under Title II. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to show that they had a concrete, systemic failure to implement a comprehensive and effective Olmstead integration plan. On appeal, the District Court remanded the case to the D.C. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further proceedings.","The District of Columbia's Department of Health Care Finance Administration (""DHCF""), a recipient of federal financial assistance, was sued in its official capacity by a resident of a nursing facility who wanted to live independently in the community. The resident's complaint alleged that the District failed to provide him with transition assistance to access long-term home and community based services.

509,PB-LA-0003,"Plaintiffs are a same-sex couple who asked a federal court in Louisiana to declare as unconstitutional Louisiana's refusal to issue an amended birth certificate for an adopted child listing both individuals in an unmarried same-sex couple as the legal parents, and, for injunctive relief requiring Louisiana to issue such birth certificate. 

After the district court held for plaintiffs, the Fifth Circuit reversed and found that Louisiana's recognition of a New York adoption order was not entitled to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and that there was no Equal Protection violation.

ORDER AND REASONS Before the Court is a Motion for Summary Judgment (Rec Doc. 27) filed by Plaintiffs, Oren Adar and Mickey Ray Smith, individually and as parents and next friends of J.C.A.-S., a minor (“Plaintiffs”). Defendant Darlene W. Smith, in her official capacity, opposes the m otion. The motion, set for hearing on Dece mber 10, 2008, is be fore the Court on the briefs without oral argument.

They are adoptive parents of J, born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 2005.

Appeals from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
B. Proceedings In October 2007, the Plaintiffs–Appellees filed suit in the Eastern District of Louisiana against the Registrar in her official capacity, seeking (1) a declaration that the Registrar’s refusal to issue the Certificate violates both the Full Faith and Credit Clause (the “Clause”) and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and (2) a mandatory injunction requiring the Registrar to issue a Certificate that identifies both Adoptive Parents as Infant J’s parents.
The Registrar filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction which the district court denied. After the Registrar filed an answer to the amended complaint, the Adoptive Parents filed a motion for summary judgment. In it they asserted that (1) by its plain language, LA.REV.STAT ANN. § 40:76 expressly requires the issuance of a Certificate for Infant J reflecting that both Adoptive Parents are his parents, (2) Louisiana owes full faith and credit to the New York state adoption decree, and (3) failure to issue a Certificate for Infant J denies the Plaintiffs–Appellees equal protection under the United States Constitution.
The district court ruled in favor of Smith and Adar on their full faith and credit claim. Following the Registrar's appeal, a panel ofthis court pretermitted the full faith and credit claim, concluding instead that Louisiana law, properly understood, required the Registrar to reissue the birth certificate. This panel opinion was vacated by our court's decision to rehear the case en bane. Adar v. Smith, 622 F.3d 426 (5th Cir. 2010).
No. 09-30036 updated birth certificate following adoptions,5 and Louisiana law directs the Registrar to perform this service for out-of-state adoptive parents when presented with a valid out-of-state adoption decree.6 In officially rejecting Appellees' request to correct Infant J's birth certificate, the Registrar stated, ""We are not able to accept the New York adoption judgment to create a new birth record for J."" She did so on the rationale that Louisiana law allows only single individuals and married couples (1) to adopt (2) in Louisiana, and that this rule should control who may be listed as the parents ofan adopted child on his Louisiana birth certificate, irrespective ofhis state of adoption. This, even though, by its express terms, Louisiana adoption law governs only who may adopt in a Louisiana adoption proceeding; it does not address birth certificates at all. (Ironically, the Registrar eventually offered to settle this case by putting the name of either Adar or Smith, but not both, on a revised birth certificate for Infant J, despite the fact that the New York adoption decree lists both Adar and Smith as Infant J's lawful parents. I have searched the Constitution in vain for a ""Half Faith and Credit Clause."") Appellees sued the Registrar in district court. Their complaint makes two claims, both under§
Adar and Smith moved for summary judgment on both claims. The Registrar filed an opposition but did not file any cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted Adar and Smith's summary judgment motion based solely on their FF&C Clause claim. Significantly, that court never reached their claims brought under the Equal Protection Clause.

Defendant","A same-sex couple who jointly parent their child as legal parents filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against the State of Louisiana and the New York Department of Social Services.

510,PB-NC-0007,"On April 9th, 2014, several same-sex couples residing in North Carolina filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the state of North Carolina. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare that North Carolina's ban on same-sex is unconstitutional, declare North Carolina laws prohibiting joint adoption by same-sex couples are also unconstitutional,  enjoin the state from enforcing any of its laws banning same-sex marriage, direct the state to recognize same-sex marriages entered into in other states, and award the plaintiffs costs of suit and reasonable attorney's fees. The court ruled in the plaintiffs' favor on October 14, 2014, declaring the North Carolina laws in question unconstitutional to the extent they prevent marriage and recognition of same-sex couples.","1. Plaintiffs are three North Carolina families. In each family, the adults are loving, committed same-sex couples who seek to have their legal out-of-state marriages recognized as lawful marriages in North Carolina. In addition, one couple is raising a child together, and seeks to ensure that both his parents have legally recognized parent-child relationships. Because North Carolina law does not respect their legal marriages, and in the case of the family raising a child, bars one parent from legalizing her relationship with her child, plaintiffs bring this suit alleging violations of the U.S. Constitution.
7. Plaintiffs bring this action (“Action”) to challenge the constitutionality of North Carolina‟s laws that exclude same-sex couples from marrying and that effectively void the marriages of same-sex couples lawfully entered into in other jurisdictions. In addition, Ms. Mejia and Ms. Ginter-Mejia challenge the constitutionality of North Carolina‟s adoption laws that prevent J.G.-M., the child plaintiff, from having a legal relationship with both of his parents.

This matter is before the Court on Defendants’ Motions [Doc. #23, #30] to stay further proceedings in this case pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Bostic v. Schaefer, Case No. 14-1167. Also pending is a Motion for Preliminary Injunction [Doc. #3] by Plaintiffs, as well as Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Doc. #37]. The Complaint in this case challenges North Carolina statutory and constitutional provisions that define marriage as exclusively being a legal union between one man and one woman, as well as the North Carolina statutes that prohibit “second-parent” adoption. Plaintiffs ultimately seek a declaration that North Carolina General Statutes § 51-1, § 51-1.2, § 48-1-100 et seq., and section 6 of Article XIV of the North Carolina Constitution (Amendment One) violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and are void and unenforceable.

The District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, and it was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit on interlocutory appeal following the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. On February 4, 2016, Judge Bataillon issued a permanent injunction striking down Nebraska’s ban on gay marriage. ","29. The plaintiffs are same-sex couples who seek to marry in Nebraska or to have their marriages from other states recognized in Nebraska. They assert claims for deprivation of their fundamental right to marry and allege discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The defendants (hereinafter referred to, collectively, as ""the State"") are Nebraska officials charged with enforcing the State's marriage laws.
Plaintiffs are seven same-sex couples seeking to marry in Nebraska or to have their marriage in another state recognized in Nebraska. They also seek state benefits incident to marriage. The district court1 granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. It found that Article I, § 29 of the Nebraska Constitution, which denies same-sex couples the right to marry, likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. Nebraska brings an interlocutory appeal. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), this court affirms.

224. The Obergefell case struck down the marriage exclusions in Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. While precedent does in fact dictate the result in the case before this Court, Section 29 has not specifically been declared unconstitutional. The Court agrees with the plaintiffs. The decision by the United States Supreme Court in Obergefell does not provide the certainty plaintiffs requested from this Court. Accordingly, any argument that this issue is moot is unfounded and without merit.","This case was brought by seven same-sex couples seeking to marry in Nebraska or to have their marriage in another state recognized in Nebraska.

512,PB-SC-0005,"In 2016, a same-sex married couple filed this Civil Rights Act of 1871 complaint in the District Court of South Carolina (Columbia Division). Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming violations of their fundamental right to marry and other protected liberties related to the differential treatment of birth records for children with same-sex married parents. Summary Judgment was granted in favor of the Plaintiffs and a consent decree entered ordering South Carolina to make changes to the policies of their birth-record keeping, as well as the issuance of corrected birth certificates to the Plaintiffs and all who qualified under the new policies and requested such a correction. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement for attorney’s fees and the case closed in June 2017.","18. Upon information and belief, and as required by the Regulation, DHEC routinely provides birth certificates listing both different-sex spouses as parents based on the fact of their marriage. DHEC refuses, however, to issue accurate birth certificates on the same terms to same-sex couples. Instead, upon information and belief, DHEC will not issue a birth certificate accurately listing both same-sex spouses as parents unless the omitted parent obtains either an adoption decree or some other court order requiring DHEC to issue an accurate birth certificate.
II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY Plaintiffs are married and the same-sex parents of their twins, S.B.C. and S.D.C. Plaintiff Jacqueline Carson became pregnant with their children by means of artificial insemination. Under the current practice of Defendant, Plaintiff Jacqueline Carson, as the birth mother of the twins, is listed as a parent on S.B.C.=s and S.D.C.=s birth certificates, but the birth certificates fail to name Plaintiff Jacqueline Carson=s spouse, Plaintiff Casy Carson. Under the same circumstances, if Plaintiffs were an opposite-sex married couple, both of their names would be listed on the birth certificates. With this lawsuit, Plaintiffs seek to modify Defendant=s practice in this regard.
Plaintiffs argue Defendant=s policy discriminates on the basis of sex and sexual orientation. Plaintiffs assert Defendant is also discriminating against S.B.C. and S.D.C., as well as the children of other same-sex parents. Plaintiffs aver Defendant has neither a legitimate nor compelling interest in denying marital children of same-sex spouses birth certificates with both parents named on them. Plaintiffs further assert the undisputed evidence establishes Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief.
1. DHEC shall apply all rules, procedures, policies and practices relating to the issuance of birth certificates to same-sex spouses on the same terms as it applies them to differentsex spouses.

Plaintiff also alleges that defendants rejected his mailing in retaliation for lawsuits he has pending against the New Mexico Corrections Department.
BACKGROUND Plaintiff Jacob Barrett is an inmate of the Oregon Department of Corrections (“ODOC”) and is currently in the custody of the Florida Department of Corrections. Plaintiff was previously in the custody of the New Mexico Corrections Department (“NMCD”) and while there, sent an envelope with a drawing on it to his cousin who was an inmate at the Oregon State Penitentiary (“OSP”). Because Plaintiff’s mailing violated ODOC’s policy precluding envelopes with drawings on them, Plaintiff’s mailing was returned.

Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff’s claims. I concluded in my November 14, 2013, Opinion Order that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity insofar as Plaintiff sought money damages.1 I, however, denied Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff’s First Amendment free speech claim, which alleges that Defendants violated Plaintiff’s First Amendment free speech rights when they rejected his envelope containing a drawing on it.

Plaintiff Jacob Barrett, an Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC) inmate, brings a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which provides a cause of action against state and local governments and their officials for violations of a person’s federal constitutional and statutory rights. Plaintiff brings this claim against Jeff Premo, Superintendent of the Oregon State Penitentiary (OSP); Michelle Dodson, former Executive Assistant to Superintendent Premo; Jane Doe1; Colette Peters, Director of ODOC; and Kelly Raths, Administrator of the Office of Inmate and Community Advocacy at ODOC; (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated his First Amendment rights by rejecting and returning a letter that Plaintiff sent to an inmate at OSP because of a picture Plaintiff had drawn on the front of the envelope.
P. 52 (a)(1). As explained below, Defendants violated Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights. As a result, Plaintiff is awarded declaratory and injunctive relief.
8. Plaintiff filed the present lawsuit on November 10, 2011.
Plaintiff has established that ODOC’s incoming mail policy burdens his First Amendment rights, as well as the First Amendment rights of other inmates and their correspondents. Defendants face the possibility of spending a minimal amount of additional time each day looking more closely at envelopes in order to read the recipient’s address. The constitutional hardship is far greater than the insignificant potential impact on Defendants' time and resources.
CONCLUSION Defendants violated Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights. Plaintiff is entitled to declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from rejecting or otherwise prohibiting incoming mail for containing artwork on the front of envelopes. Plaintiff is also entitled to an order requiring Defendants to inform inmates that they are permitted to receive letters with artwork on the front of envelopes. Plaintiff shall prepare a judgment in accordance with these Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. After conferring with Defendants, Plaintiff shall submit the proposed judgment to the Court for review within 30 days of the date below. If the parties cannot agree on a judgment, Plaintiff shall notify the Court, which will then schedule a telephone conference with counsel. IT IS SO ORDERED.

JOHN WETZEL, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, Defendant.
1. This action seeks to stop the cruel and unusual punishment of prisoners in Pennsylvania prisons diagnosed with serious mental illness.
These men and women are confined in so-called Restricted Housing Units (RHUs) under horrific conditions, through an unconstitutional process that takes no account of—and exacerbates—their mental illness. Defendant’s mistreatment of these prisoners violates their rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
6. Plaintiff, the Disability Rights Network of Pennsylvania (DRN), is a non-profit organization designated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pursuant to federal legislation to advocate for and protect the rights of Pennsylvanians with mental illness. DRN seeks an injunction requiring Defendant to cease violating the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners with mental illness in Pennsylvania prisons, provide them with constitutionally adequate mental health care, and protect them against dangerous and unconstitutional conditions of confinement.
69. In February 2010, Prisoner #2 was evaluated and found incompetent to stand trial by a psychiatrist at Torrance State Hospital, who opined that he was “floridly psychotic” and in need of “structured and supervised psychiatric care.” The DOC has not provided him with such care.
124. Other prisoners have sexually assaulted him on numerous occasions. Threats of that nature make him extremely anxious, which as a result of his diagnosed mental illness causes him to threaten or assault others.
137. Defendant knows or is deliberately indifferent to the fact that the numerous prisoners who have been diagnosed as having serious mental illness are placed in RHUs for extensive time periods and that confinement in RHUs creates a substantial risk that those prisoners’ mental illnesses will be exacerbated and that their mental health will deteriorate. Defendant also knows or is deliberately indifferent to the fact that the mental health treatment provided to prisoners with mental illness in RHUs is inadequate and results in the exacerbation or unnecessary prolongation of prisoners’ mental illnesses. The impact of long-term isolation in RHUs has been brought to Defendant’s attention through numerous prisoner grievances and communications with prisoners’ rights advocacy organizations. Nonetheless, Defendant has refused to take reasonable steps to correct this systemic violation of prisoners’ rights.
The netw ork, designated under federal law to protect the rights of people w ith disabilities, said the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections confines about 800 men and women w ith mental illnesses in horrific conditions with inadequate mental health treatment. The law suit alleges that the department is aw are that such confinement exacerbates their mental illness, but does not adequately take their mental health into account before disciplining them by placing them in solitary confinement for extended periods of time. The law suit alleges the state's mistreatment of these prisoners, who make up about 33% of the total RHU population, violates their rights under the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

9. Plaintiffs Prison Legal News, Daniel Denvir, Philadelphia City Paper, Christopher Moraff, Pennsylvania Prison Society, Solitary Watch, and Professor Regina Austin rely on and publish speech by individuals convicted of personal injury crimes (as defined for purposes of the Silencing Act) to convey information of public concern. Prison Legal News, the City Paper, the Prison Society's ""Graterfriends"" newsletter, and Solitary Watch are publications that feature content that is written by or quotes Pennsylvania inmates convicted of personal injury crimes. Denvir, a City Paper senior staff writer who focuses on criminal justice issues, and Moraff, a freelance criminal justice journalist, are both working on long-term pieces that would feature interviews with and comments from Pennsylvania inmates convicted of personal injury crimes. Professor Austin runs a University of Pennsylvania Law School program that, to support clemency applications of Pennsylvania prisoners, creates videos that contain oral or written testimonials by the prisoners themselves. These seven organizations and individuals all reasonably fear that the Silencing Act will be used to enjoin or penalize their publication of offender speech and that the Act will chill offenders from speaking with them- whether through interviews, written submissions, or otherwise.

Finally, the Court must consider whether the parties currently named in this case may adequately protect the interests of the United States.

But while census data is almost always the starting point for determining a population base, it need not, and in some cases cannot, be the ending point. The Court has recognized that blind reliance on census data can lead to unconstitutional results. In Mahan v. Howell, for instance, the Court considered a districting plan that relied on census data to count some 36,000 military personnel in the state senate district where they were “home-ported”—that is, the district containing their naval base. 410 U.S. at 330–31. However, only about half of these people actually lived in the district, either on the naval base or off the base but still within the district Id. The Court held that the scheme was unconstitutional. The scheme “resulted in... significant population disparities,” and the state could not fall back on its reliance on census figures to justify these disparities because “[t]he... use of [a] census enumeration to support a conclusion that all of the Navy personnel on a ship actually resided within the state senatorial district in which the ship was docked placed upon the census figures a weight that they were not intended to bear.” Id.

V.

536,CJ-AZ-0002,"Several citizens and residents of Arizona subject to the death penalty brought suit under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC) and several associated governmental employees. The plaintiffs argued that the ADC's lethal injection procedure violated their First Amendment right to access governmental proceedings, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment, and the Federal Supremacy Clause. The parties came to a stipulated agreement prohibiting the defendant from using certain chemicals for execution, among other limitation. The case is ongoing after the Ninth Circuit remanded counts for retrial. ","96. In March 2012, in a case filed against the FDA that challenged the legality 24 of the importation of sodium thiopental for purposes of lethal injection, the United States 25 District Court for the District of Columbia found that the importation of that drug was a 26 violation of the FDCA.
2014. Wood seeks information from the Arizona Department of Corrections (“Department”) regarding the method of his execution, which the Department has not provided. Wood argues that, by withholding this information, the Department has violated his First Amendment rights. He seeks a preliminary injunction delaying his execution until he receives the information. The district court denied Wood’s motion. Although we do not reach the ultimate merits of the case, we conclude that Wood has presented serious questions going to the merits of his claim, and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in his favor. We therefore reverse the district court’s denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction.
B On June 26, 2014, Wood and five other capital prisoners (“Wood” or “Plaintiffs”) filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint in the District of Arizona, seeking equitable, injunctive, and declaratory relief. In the complaint, the Plaintiffs argue the Department has not provided sufficient information in response to requests by the Federal Defender and alleges three counts: that by deliberately concealing lethal injection information, the Department has violated Plaintiffs’ (1) First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances and (2) First Amendment right to be informed about the manner in which Arizona implements the death penalty; and (3) that Arizona’s protocol, developed without complying with the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, violates the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the Constitution. On July 2, Wood filed a motion for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order. Wood argued the district court should grant an injunction preventing the Department from carrying out his execution until it provides him with the information he requests. In a July 10 order, the district court denied Wood’s preliminary injunction motion. The court concluded that the motion—founded on Wood’s second First Amendment claim—was unlikely to succeed on the merits and that Wood had failed to present “serious questions” going to the claim’s merits. See Developmental Servs. Network v. Douglas, 666 F.3d 540, 544 (9th Cir. 2011) (“Nevertheless, if a plaintiff fails to show that he has some chance on the merits, that ends the matter.”).

No. 17-16330 Argued and Submitted September 12, 2018 San Francisco, California Filed September 17, 2019 Synopsis Background: Arizona death-row inmates and non-profit advocacy organization brought § 1983 action against state prison officials, challenging Arizona’s execution procedures, alleging that they violated the First Amendment by restricting the ability of execution witnesses to hear the sounds of the entire execution process, failing to disclose the source and quality of the lethal-injection drugs used in the inmates’ executions, and failing to disclose specific qualifications of the execution team members who would insert intravenous lines into the inmates. The United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Neil V. Wake, Senior District Judge, 188 F.Supp.3d 940, dismissed the action, in part.
The district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court held that the right of access to governmental proceedings does not encompass either the right to hear the sounds of the execution process or the right to obtain the requested information regarding execution drugs and personnel. The district court’s decision turned largely on its reading of California First Amendment Coalition v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 868 (9th Cir. 2002), which held that the right of access to governmental proceedings includes the right to view executions in their entirety Id. at 873–77. The district court construed the holding of that case as limited to the right to view executions, not the right to hear the sounds of executions or the right to obtain information regarding execution drugs and personnel. The court also concluded that the plaintiffs had not plausibly alleged a historical tradition or the functional *1075 importance of access to execution sounds and information, as required by the relevant First Amendment test.","In 2007, inmates of the Arizona Department of Corrections filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona challenging the state's lethal injection procedures. The plaintiffs alleged that the procedures violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court granted summary judgment for the State. The Supreme Court vacated the stay of execution, and the parties bear their own costs. The case is now closed.","On June 26, 2014, Arizona death-row inmates and a non-profit advocacy organization brought  1983 action against state prison officials, challenging Arizona’s execution procedures, alleging that they violated the First Amendment by restricting the ability of execution witnesses to hear the sounds of the entire execution process.

FINAL JUDGMENT In this action Plaintiffs John Doe #1-5 and Mary Doe challenged the constitutionality of Michigan’s Sex Offender Registration Act (“SORA”). See First Amended Complaint (Dkt. 46, Pg.

U.S. District Court Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit) CIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE 2:12−cv−11194−RHC−DRG","In 2005, two sex offenders filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the State of Michigan and the Michigan Department of Corrections. The sex offenders claimed that the State's Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) and its extensive reporting requirements and prohibitions violate their constitutional rights. The court held that the SORA was unconstitutionally vague because it entrusted the enforcement of the ordinance to the moment-to-moment judgment of the policeman on his beat. The case was dismissed on appeal.","In 2009, two sex offenders filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan challenging the constitutionality of Michigan's Sex Offender Registration Act.

The district court dismissed the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs had not alleged a cause of action. The case is now closed."
538,CJ-MI-0006,"Six Insane Clown Posse fans, or ""Juggalos,"" sued the DOJ and FBI in the the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under the Administrative Procedures Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act, alleging that the FBI had designated the Juggalos as a ""loosely organized hybrid gang"" in 2011, which had caused various harms to the plaintiffs, including extra police attention. The district court dismissed the case upon finding that the designation was not a final agency action, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed the dismissal.","Plaintiff Scott Gandy also alleges discrimination on the basis of his Juggalo affiliation. He claims that in 2012, he visited a U.S. Army recruiting station, and that at the time, he had large ICP tattoos on his chest. The recruiting officer asked Gandy whether he had any tattoos, and told Gandy that because Juggalos were on the federal government’s “gang list,” he considered Gandy’s tattoos to be gang-related. The officer questioned Gandy regarding his Juggalo affiliation, and instructed Gandy that he would have to remove or permanently cover his tattoos or the Army would immediately deny his application. Gandy subsequently spent hundreds of dollars to have his Juggalo tattoos covered with other tattoos. When he returned to the recruiting station, the officer accepted his application and told Gandy that he would receive consideration. Ultimately, the Army denied Gandy’s application. (Id. at Pg. ID 12–13.) Plaintiff Robert Hellin is currently a corporal in the Army, and has served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Korea. He has a number of visible ICP tattoos, but worries that because of the federal government’s designation of Juggalos as a hybrid gang, he is in imminent danger of discipline or involuntary discharge from the army. (Id. at Pg. ID 13.) As mentioned earlier, Plaintiffs Bruce and Utsler are members of ICP. They claim that on August 20, 2012, they entered into a contract with AEG Live to perform at the Royal Oak Music Theater in Royal Oak, Michigan, for ICP’s annual “Hallowicked” event. On October 8, 2012, the Royal Oak Music Theater cancelled the “Hallowicked” event, informing Bruce and Utsler that its landlord prompted the cancellation. Upon further discussions with AEG Live and the Royal Oak Music Theater, Bruce and Utsler discovered that the Royal Oak Police Department had asked the Royal Oak Music Theater to cancel the event, citing the federal Juggalo gang designation as a motivating reason. (Id. at Pg. ID 14.) On March 21, 2014, after Plaintiffs filed the instant suit, the National Gang Intelligence Center released its 2013 National Gang Report. Neither Juggalos nor “hybrid gangs” receive any mention therein. See generally, National Gang Intelligence Center, 2013 National Gang Report (2014), available at http://www.fbi.gov/statsservices/publications/national-gang-report-2013/view (June 9, 2014) (rendering of URL contains spaces).
Bruce and Utsler allege at least two third-party actors who were responsible for their injury: the Royal Oak Music Theater and the Royal Oak Police Department. According to these Plaintiffs, the Royal Oak Music Theater decided to cancel their “Hallowicked” concert event following the Royal Oak Police Department’s request. Although Bruce and Utsler allege that the Royal Oak Police Department cited the DOJ’s report in asking the Theater to cancel the “Hallowicked” concert, the complaint does not allege that the DOJ or FBI directed either party to do so. Instead, the complaint reveals that two independent actors, neither of whom are present in the instant law suit, decided to cancel the event.
2012. On October 8, 2012, the Royal Oak Music Theater cancelled Hallowicked without prior notice. (Id. 96-97). “After discussions with AEG Live and Royal Oak Music Theater, ICP’s record label discovered that the Royal Oak Police Department asked the Royal Oak Music Theater to cancel the event. When asking the Royal Oak Music Theater to cancel the Hallowicked event, the Royal Oak Police Department cited the federal Juggalo gang designation.” (Id. 98-99).

Center, (2) Gladman Mental Health Rehabilitation Center, and (3) Morton Bakar Center. These facilities are large, congregate, institutional settings populated by individuals with mental health disabilities. Individuals confined to these psychiatric institutions, especially Villa Fairmont, regularly remain institutionalized for weeks beyond what is clinically necessary due to the shortage of appropriate community options.
DRC takes issue with AHS’s allegedly deficient consultation and coordination with 5 community providers, ACBHCS case managers, physicians, and others in connecting patients to 6 the community-based programming they need – which it claims does not sufficiently yet exist.76 7 This, allegedly, results in unjustified institutionalization of persons with mental health 8 disabilities – a form of unlawful discrimination under both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.77 9 As articulated below, how can AHS violate a statutorily mandated care of patients and patient 10 discharge practices when DRC also alleges that the County does not provide programs for AHS to 11 discharge patients? DRC’s theory is that AHS violated the integration mandate under the ADA and 13 Rehabilitation Act. The ADA’s implementing regulations requires that a public entity provide 14 services to qualified individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate to the patient’s needs.78 15 In Olmstead, the Court held that a violation of the integration mandate occurs when (1) treatment 16 professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate, (2) the transfer from 17 institutional care to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and (3) the 18 placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the 19 State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.79 DRC fails to state with sufficient particularity that Defendant AHS’s conduct violates the 21 integration mandate because community-based treatment placement is an obligation of the 22 County – not AHS. Moreover, DRC does not plead a plausible claim that AHS’s administration 23 of the hospital had a discriminatory effect because there is no alleged unlawful conduct by AHS 24 that results in AHS placing DRC constituents at risk of institutionalization.
Disability Rights California (DRC) is suing the County of Alameda (the County), 14 Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (ACBHCS), and Alameda Health 15 System (AHS) for alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the 16 Rehabilitation Act, and California disability law. DRC alleges that Defendants subject 17 Alameda residents to unnecessary institutionalization and an unnecessary risk of 18 institutionalization by failing to provide sufficient community-based treatment programs 19 and other services that would reduce institutionalization in the County.

With the exception of the Lee Adjustment Center, KyDOC’s new (private) institution, each institution has, long-since, installed a videophone kiosk. Lee recently got a videophone as well. During this past year, however, there were significant technical difficulties with the videophones, which are obtained from Purple Communications. There were weeks of system-wide outages, and some institutions have had ongoing difficulties. Only KSR, which has a Sorenson as well as the Purple kiosk, has escaped these problems. It will be important for KyDOC to monitor the issue going forward; if significant outages recur, it may be that an alternative or backup is necessary. In addition, once I heard about the outages, I worked with each institution that has inmates who use the videophone to ensure that a temporary alternative was made available to them, using the VRI laptop. This alternative should not await my intervention; it should be routinely used as the stop-gap when the videophones are out-ofservice.

1. This is a federal civil rights action brought by eight Mobile County Public School System (“MCPSS” or the “District”) students on behalf of a class of other MCPSS students to challenge the violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right to receive notice and a hearing before being punished with long-term suspensions. The named Plaintiffs, all students in the Mobile County Public Schools, have been long-term suspended without proper notice or a hearing for minor infractions. One was long-term suspended for having his shirt untucked, another for not carrying his identification badge. When another student arrived late to lunch, he was suspended for the remainder of the semester and never given an opportunity to defend himself. Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, school administrators must provide students with notice and a fair hearing before punishing them with long-term suspensions.

545,ED-MS-0006,"In 2017, four low-income African American mothers filed suit against the numerous officials of the State of Mississippi claiming the state failed to live up to the educational requirements set by the Mississippi Readmission Act of 1870. They sought declaratory relief that the requirements are still intact. The case was dismissed in 2018 due to the state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. The plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit which affirmed in part and reversed in part. The defendants requested rehearing en banc, but the Fifth Circuit denied the request. The defendants then filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court and a request to stay the Fifth Circuit's mandate in January 2021. The case is ongoing.","7. Because the Court found that the State of Mississippi was the real, substantial party in interest with respect to Plaintiffs’ claims, it additionally found that the claims were barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity Id. (relying on Pennhurst State School Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984), a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the “Eleventh Amendment bars a suit against state officials when ‘the state is the real, substantial party in interest.’”). Thereafter, the Court entered a Final Judgment by which the case was dismissed with prejudice.
The plaintiffs in this lawsuit are low-income African-American women whose children attend public schools in Mississippi. They filed suit against multiple state officials in 2017, alleging that the current version of the Mississippi Constitution violates the “school rights and privileges” condition of the Mississippi Readmission Act. The district court held that plaintiffs’ suit was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and dismissed the case. Though we agree that a portion of the relief plaintiffs seek is prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment, we hold that the lawsuit also partially seeks relief that satisfies the Ex parte Young exception to sovereign immunity. Accordingly, we AFFIRM in part and VACATE and REMAND in part.
III. The district court dismissed the complaint because it concluded that plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. On appeal, the state officials defend the district court’s judgment while also making several alternative arguments in support of affirmance, contending that plaintiffs lack standing, the suit is barred by the political question doctrine, and there is no private right of action under the Mississippi Readmission Act. These arguments were raised in defendants’ briefing before the district court, but they were not addressed in the district court’s order. Though “[a] successful party in the District Court may sustain its judgment on any ground that finds support in the record,” Jaffke v. Dunham, 352 U.S. 280, 281 (1957), the decision whether to consider an argument for the first time on appeal is “one left No. 19-60069 primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals,” Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976).
A. As a sovereign entity, a state may not be sued without its consent. The Eleventh Amendment, which protects the states’ sovereign immunity, “deprives a federal court of jurisdiction to hear a suit against a state.” Warnock, 88 F.3d at 343 (citing Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 100). Read literally, the text of the Eleventh Amendment prevents only non-citizens of a state from suing that state. U.S Const. amend XI. Since Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10–11 (1890), however, courts have understood that the Amendment provides protections beyond its text, shielding states from suits brought by their own citizens as well as citizens of other states.3 See Va. Office for Prot. Advocacy 3 Because this broad reading of the Eleventh Amendment is not supported by its text, we have dubbed “Eleventh Amendment immunity” a “misnomer... [since] that immunity is really an aspect of the Supreme Court’s concept of state sovereign immunity and is neither derived from nor limited by the Eleventh Amendment.” Meyers ex rel. Benzing v. Texas, 410 F.3d 236, 240–41 (5th Cir. 2005) (citing Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 712–13 (1999)). “Nevertheless, the term ‘Eleventh Amendment immunity’ has been used loosely and interchangeably with ‘state sovereign immunity’ to refer to a state’s immunity from suit without its consent in federal courts.” Id. (citing cases).
court granted the defendants’ 12(b)(1) motion, holding that it lacked jurisdiction based on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. On reconsideration, the court dismissed without prejudice.

547,EE-AL-0122,"This case was brought by an African-American job applicant against Cook's Pest Control, Inc., alleging that Cooks had maintained a pattern and practice of discrimination in employment on the basis of race. The parties reached a settlement in October of 2011 and the court has granted preliminary approval and certified a settlement class. The court approved the parties' settlement and dismissed the case with prejudice in July 2012. ","INTRODUCTION The efforts of the representative plaintiff, the defendants, and their respective counsel have yielded a class action settlement providing monetary and non-monetary benefits for employment applicants for positions at Cook’s Pest Control, Inc. (“Cook’s”). Plaintiff Marion Waters filed this lawsuit on behalf of himself and other African-American applicants or individuals denied employment or discouraged from applying for jobs with Cook’s because of their race. The terms of this settlement will provide Cook’s employees with training and hiring procedures developed to eliminate race discrimination in the workplace. The settlement will also provide monetary relief for African-American class members who applied for, but were denied, employment at any Cook’s location during a specified period. The parties now request that this Court certify the settlement class and give its final approval on the settlement. The parties request approval of the incentive award to the representative plaintiff who helped further the lawsuit. Finally, Class Counsel have elected to use the “common fund” method of determining reasonable attorneys’ fees in this matter, in order to eliminate the Court’s need to for an hour-by-hour review.1 Class Counsel requests an attorneys fee award of 35% of the common settlement fund which equals $875,000.00 plus reasonable litigation expenses in the amount of $53,831.55.
In this case, Cook’s is alleged to “have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,” by failing to hire the Class Members as part of a widespread pattern or practice of race discrimination in hiring. The predominant relief requested is a consent decree requiring implementation of new hiring procedures, training programs, and methods of record keeping, as well as the institution of a monitor to oversee the decree. The parties also request a Court order enjoining Cook’s from violating the decree or discriminating against African-Americans in employment based on their race. Because the predominant relief requested is equitable, and individual damages are easy to calculate and manage based on the formula agreed upon by the parties, certification is appropriate under both Fed R. Civ P. 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).
M. Time Required to Reach a Settlement. The mediation process, start to finish, took almost a year. The parties selected a skilled mediator and agreed to additional discovery and review to facilitate settlement. The parties held two formal mediation sessions and nine informal conferences in order to reach a resolution of matters and draft the specific terms of the Settlement Agreement. This factor supports the requested fee of 35% of the Settlement Fund N. Any Non-Monetary Benefits Conferred Upon the Class by the Settlement. In addition to each Class Member receiving a monetary award that is expected to be several thousands of dollars, Class Counsel has negotiated a Settlement Agreement that provides other non-monetary benefits. In fact, as outlined above, the predominant relief requested is equitable. Namely, a consent decree will be entered requiring Cook’s to implement new hiring procedures, training programs, and methods of record keeping, and a monitor will be instituted to oversee the decree. The Court will also enjoin Cook’s from violating the decree or discriminating against African-Americans in employment based on their race. This factor strongly weighs in favor of the slightly enhanced attorneys’ fee of 35% of the Settlement Fund O. Objections by Class Members or Other Parties to the Settlement Terms or the Fees Requested by Counsel.

3 II. U.S. SOCCER HAS NOT ENGAGED IN PAY DISCRIMINATION.................... 5
U.S. Soccer paid the WNT far more than the MNT over the past 6 five calendar years. Between the beginning of 2015 (the year encompassing the start of 7 the Title VII class period) and the end of 2019, U.S. Soccer paid the WNT players and 8 their union more than $37 million. (Irwin Dec Ex. 1 at 13.) The corresponding figure for 9 the MNT is just north of $21 million. (Id.) Even setting aside (i) all the money paid to 10 players in the form of NWSL salaries and bonuses and (ii) all the money the players have 11 directed to their union instead of themselves, U.S. Soccer still has paid the WNT 12 $6 million more than the MNT over that same period. (Id. at 17.) Even controlling for the 13 number of games each team has played, U.S. Soccer still has paid the WNT more than 14 the MNT on a per-game basis. (Id. at 17-21.) Plaintiffs nevertheless claim that U.S. Soccer has engaged in sex-based pay 16 discrimination against them. They contend that if a few provisions in their last two 17 collective bargaining agreements had been different, and had matched certain provisions 18 in the MNT’s collective bargaining agreement, then they would have been paid even 19 more money over the last five years. This is neither evidence of sex discrimination nor 20 consistent with the way collective bargaining is designed by federal labor law to work.
U.S. Soccer values all its athletes, including its WNT players, and it also values the 18 collective bargaining process, during which U.S. Soccer and the players created an 19 overall package of compensation, benefits, and other terms designed to meet the players’ 20 needs while enabling U.S. Soccer to fulfill its overall mission. Following ratification of 21 the contract, one player (a union representative at the time and Plaintiff now) hailed the 22 deal as “exactly what we thought was fair and what we thought should be in the CBA.” 23 (Klingenberg Ex. 7.) Plaintiffs should not be allowed to use this lawsuit as a vehicle to 24 selectively revise portions of that agreement. The lawsuit should be dismissed.

558,EE-PA-0148,"In 2006, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and complainants, that intervened as plaintiffs, filed this suit against Schott North America, Inc, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleged sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 2009, the court approved the parties’ consent decree. The court retained jurisdiction for three years to ensure compliance. This decree required that the defendants provide monetary relief for the claimants, comply with Title VII, provide anti-discrimination training to all its employees, retain records of employment discrimination, and regularly report to the EEOC. In 2012, this case closed.","2. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were and are now being committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
I. Background This case grows out of an October 2004 reorganization and subsequent layoff of employees at Defendant Schott North America’s specialty glass plant in Duryea, Pennsylvania. (Defendant’s Statement of Material Facts in Support of Summary Judgment (hereinafter “Defendant’s Statement”) (Doc. 43) at 1).1 Employees at the plant were represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, and a collective bargaining agreement covered production employees at the time of the layoffs. (Id. at 4). The six intervenor plaintiffs all worked in the plant prior to October 2004 and filed discrimination charges against the company with the EEOC. (Id. at 6). The EEOC represents five other plaintiffs who did not file discrimination charges with the agency: Lori Zielinski, Linda Stoss, Margaret Moran, Sally Guzik and Jean Donovan. (Id. at 9).
With the court’s leave, plaintiff EEOC filed an amended complaint on January 12, 2007 (Doc. 27). The amended complaint alleges that defendant violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act “by subjecting Charging Parties and a class of female employees to a discriminatory layoff process which resulted in the loss of their jobs due to their gender.” This might be called the “disparate treatment” portion of the complaint. Among the unlawful employment practices alleged by the plaintiffs were: a segregation of the work force by gender and an unwillingness to train women in the positions primarily occupied by men; an undervaluing of the skill required to do the jobs primarily occupied by women in the creation of the matrix that assigned the new MLO position, resulting in less change for female workers to obtain those jobs; an unfair rating process that gave men credit for the ability to perform jobs which they had never done; attempts by the Human Resources department to manipulate scores to give men higher ratings; of the 36 MLO positions provided, 34 went to men and 2 to women. The complaint also raises a charge of “disparate impact” under Title VII, alleging that defendant subjected “Charging parties and a class of female employees to a discriminatory layoff process” that “caused a disparate impact based on gender.” That portion of the complaint alleges that plaintiff matrix system for evaluating employees “had an adverse impact on female applicants who were selected for layoff at a significantly higher rate than male employees. As relief, plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction prohibiting defendant and its agents and employees from engaging in any sexually discriminatory action; an order from the court directing defendant to institute a program to eliminate discrimination and rectify the effects of past discrimination; back pay and other financial remedies for those harmed by the unlawful employment practices; other compensatory damages for plaintiffs; and punitive damages.
16. In addition to the training described in Paragraph 15, Defendant will provide training to all employees and supervisors in its Human Resources Department at its Duryea, PA facility, regarding conducting a prompt and effective investigation into allegations, complaints, or charges of sex discrimination.
19. For a period of three (3) years following entry of this Decree, Defendant shall maintain records of each complaint of any incident of sex discrimination occurring at its Duryea, PA facility. Each such report shall indicate the date the complaint was made, who made it, what was alleged, and what actions the Defendant took to resolve the matter. The Defendant shall also make records of all actions it takes to prevent sex discrimination at its Duryea, PA facility during the duration of this Decree.
26. This Consent Decree shall be filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and shall continue to be in effect for a period of three (3) years. Any application by any party to modify or vacate this Consent Decree during such period shall be made by motion to the Court on no less than thirty (30) days notice to the other party.
In its lawsuit, the Commission alleged that SCHOTT violated Title VII. Schott has consistently denied these allegations.
To resolve the case, EEOC and the Defendant have entered into a Consent Decree which provided, among other things, that: (I) SCHOTT will not discriminate on the basis of sex; and (2) SCHOTT will train all employees at its Duryea, PA facility, regarding sex discrimination and Defendant's policy prohibiting sex discrimination.

The complaint alleged that due to a discriminatory layoff process, Defendant unfairly selected Charging Parties Arlene Anderson, Carolyn Blockus, Laura Figueroa, Deborah Gdovin, Patricia Pavolonis, Yvonne Prywara and a class of female employees for layoff based on their gender. The intervenor plaintiffs also filed a complaint that repeated the EEOC's allegations of discrimination by disparate treatment and disparate impact under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. The parties entered into a consent decree in which the parties agreed that the defendant would comply fully with all provisions of Title VII. The consent decree continues to be in effect for a period of three (3) years. Any application by any party to modify or vacate this consent decree during such period shall be made by motion to the Court on no less than thirty (30) days notice to the other party.","In October 2004, the EEOC filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania against Schott North America, Inc.

The Plaintiffs argued that the U.S had violated equal protection under the fifth amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs represented by Winston and Strawn LLP, LAMBDA Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Outserve-SLDN (now known as the Modern Military Association of America) sought declaratory and injunctive relief allowing HIV positive service members to continue to serve and damages. The Plaintiffs allege that they were discharged from their duties in the Air Force due to their HIV status. The case was assigned to Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.  On January 11, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to  prevent the defendants from restricting Roe and Voe and others similarly situated from being promoted, changing duty station, or re-training on the same terms as other service members living with HIV who are not being separated.  A hearing was held before Judge Brinkema on February 15, 2019. The same day, Judge Brinkema issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.  The order enjoined the defendants from separating or dicharging from military service Richard Roe, Victor Voe, and any other similarly situated active-duty member of the Air Force because they are classified as ineligible for worldwide deployment or deployment to the United States Central Command area due to their HIV-positive status.

Therefore the City could not possibly have breached the contract by suspending referrals. The letter noted several provisions of the contract that, it argued, forbade CSS’s policy of discrimination.
2 Contra Respondents, CSS does not seek an “indefinite” contract, but merely the ability to participate without First Amendment violations. AOSI sought—and received—the same kind of remedy. See AOSI, 570 U.S. at 211-212. So did Trinity Lutheran. Trinity Lutheran, 137 S Ct. at 2022.

Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants' wealth-based banishment scheme.
15. On September 12, 2016, the City Council of the City of McCrory passed Ordinance No. 306 (the ""Trailer-Banishment Ordinance"" or the ""Ordinance""), that amended ""Ordinance 151A Regulating Trailers, Mobile Homes, Manufactured Housing, Trailer Parks, and Other Purposes.""
• Do the City of McCrory and Police Chief Paul Hatch expel residents living in mobile homes worth less than $7,500? • Do the City of McCrory and Police Chief Paul Hatch impose fines upon residents living in mobile homes worth less than $7,500? • Do the City of McCrory and Police Chief Paul Hatch inform residents of McCrory who live in mobile homes worth less than $7,500 that they must leave the City? • Does the Trailer-Banishment Ordinance deter indigent residents from living in McCrory or cause indigent residents to leave McCrory?
128. The Class therefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the City of McCrory and Police Chief Paul Hatch from enforcing the Trailer-Banishment Ordinance. Because the putative Class challenges Defendants' scheme as unconstitutional through declaratory and injunctive relief that would apply the same relief to every Class Member, Rule 23(b)(2) certification is appropriate and necessary.
B. Mobile Home Parks. A tract ofland that is used, designed, maintained, or held out for rent to accommodate one or more mobile homes. Mobile homes located in a mobile home park are used only to provide living and sleeping accommodations; A mobile home park does not include an automobile or mobile home sales lot on which unoccupied mobile homes are parked for inspection or sale. The term ""Mobile Home"" shall include mobile dwelling.
4. Plaintiffs challenge McCrory’s Trailer-Banishment Ordinance because it was unconstitutional. Defendants’ wealth-based banishment ordinance (1) violated substantive due process by infringing on Plaintiffs’ fundamental right not to be forcibly expelled from their place of residence; (2) discriminated on the basis of wealth status without any rational connection to a legitimate government interest in violation of the Equal Protection Clause; (3) criminalized poverty and thus violated the Constitution’s proscription against criminalization of status; (4) imposed excessive fines in violation of the Eighth Amendment for violators of the ordinance whose only offense is being poor; and (5) violated procedural due process by imposing punishment without any process whatsoever.
16. On September 12, 2016, the City Council of the City of McCrory passed Ordinance No. 306 (the “Trailer-Banishment Ordinance” or the “Ordinance”), that amended “Ordinance 151A Regulating Trailers, Mobile Homes, Manufactured Housing, Trailer Parks, and Other Purposes.”
2. Although Watlington and Hollaway's request for injunctive relief is moot, they also seek some damages. Ng 25at15-16,

565,FH-DC-0015,"In August 2017, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) abruptly announced it would delay, by two years, a rule designed to allow low-income families greater choice in their housing options.  The Plaintiffs argued that HUD’s failure to implement the rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act, and they sought a preliminary injunction, which was granted. HUD then agreed to implement the rule and paid the Plaintiffs' attorney's fees. ","1. This suit challenges the decision of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to abruptly and unlawfully suspend implementation of its own promulgated rule, the Small Area Fair Market Rent Rule (Small Area FMR Rule). The rule provides that, as of January 1, 2018, tens of thousands of low-income families who participate in the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program—families who disproportionally are African-American, Latino, and other racial minorities—can use their housing vouchers to move from poor and racially segregated communities to areas that provide greater opportunity in education, jobs, and more. In doing so, the Small Area FMR Rule aligns the federal government’s primary rent subsidy program with HUD’s statutory mandates to ensure fair housing and avoid contributing to concentrated poverty.
57. In 2007, the Inclusive Communities Project (ICP) filed a lawsuit against HUD challenging its setting of a single FMR for the 12-county Dallas metropolitan region. ICP alleged that, by fashioning an FMR based on rent data from such a wide area, HUD was effectively steering voucher holders—who, in that area, are predominantly African-American—away from predominantly white areas (where the FMR was inadequate to meet neighborhood market rents) and into predominantly minority areas. ICP alleged that HUD thus violated the Fair Housing Act and the Housing and Community Development Act. Complaint at 25, 36-37, Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc v.

Since all claims over which this Court has original jurisdiction are dismissed, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).

9. Five Year Agreement. ICE will have one year after the Court finally approves the Settlement to make the required changes. The Settlement will be in effect for four years after that. During this time, ICE must provide information to Class Counsel to monitor and enforce the Settlement, including providing various documents and allowing Class Counsel to visit the Facilities to interview detainees.
Background on the Lawsuit This class action lawsuit asserted that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) does not provide adequate telephone access for immigration detainees housed in Contra Costa West County Detention Facility, Yuba County Jail, Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center (RCCC), and Mesa Verde Detention Facility (collectively, the Facilities). Specifically, the lawsuit asserted that ICE is violating the statutory and constitutional rights of immigration detainees because the telephone access conditions in the Facilities: (1) prevent detainees from retaining and communicating effectively with lawyers, and (2) prevent detainees from gathering evidence to present in immigration-related proceedings. The parties reached a settlement that the Court has approved.
C. The parties agree that any action or proceeding to enforce the terms of this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Court in this proceeding shall have the power to award such relief and issue such judgments as the Court deems proper and appropriate.

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant's agencies in southern California violated INA by coercing plaintiffs into accepting voluntary departure through misstatements, omissions, threats, and/or pressure in violation of defendants' own regulations. The parties settled on March 11, 2015, where defendants agreed to allow applications from the class members that would enable their return to the United States and their legal position prior to acceptance of voluntary departure.

At the expense of fully pursuing its organizational goals, PEOC has been 7 compelled to devote significant portions of its limited resources to counteract the 8 unlawful practices Defendants employ in the administration of voluntary departure.
23. Plaintiff San Bernardino Community Service Center (“SBCSC”) is an 14 organization headquartered in San Bernardino. SBCSC’s mission includes 15 advocating on behalf of indigent and low-income immigrants for access to the legal 16 system and robust procedural protections within it.

If SBCSC had not 20 been compelled to expend these resources to address Defendants’ unlawful 22 toward the advancement of its advocacy concerning conditions of immigration 23 detention and the availability of bond hearings for individuals in removal 24 proceedings.
Introduction This putative class action was brought by 11 individuals (the “Individual Plaintiffs”) and three non-profit organizations (the “Organizational Plaintiffs”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). They brought claims arising from a voluntary departure program (the “Program”) for foreign nationals who were present in the United States without permission. The Program was administered by immigration enforcement agencies in Southern California. First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), Dkt. 28.1 Under the Program, foreign nationals could agree to leave the United States voluntarily by signing expulsion orders Id. The FAC alleges that implementation of the Program deprived the deportees of their rights under federal statutes and the Constitution. The FAC advances the following causes of action: (1) violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.; (2) violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq.; (3) violation of procedural due process rights under the Fifth Amendment; and (4) violation of substantive due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. FAC, Dkt. 28.
After several months of litigation, exchange of discovery materials and substantial arms-length negotiations, the parties reached a settlement agreement (the “Agreement”). Agreement, Dkt. 90-4, 1 Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint (the “FAC”) named the following senior, federal officials as Defendants: Rand Beers, Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”); Thomas Winkowski, the Deputy Commissioner of CBP, who performs the duties of CBP Commissioner; and John Sandweg, Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) Id. 24-26. The FAC also named the following local federal, officials as Defendants: Paul Beeson, Chief Patrol Agent for CBP’s San Diego Sector; Gregory Archambeault, ICE Field Office Director for San Diego; and Dave Marin, Acting ICE Field Office Director for Los Angeles Id. 27-30. After the filing of the FAC, pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 25(d), Jeh Johnson, the current secretary of the DHS, was named as a defendant in place of Rand Beers. See Dkt. 70 at 6 n.1. Collectively, they are called “Defendants” throughout this Order.
94. The central facts are as follows. On June 4, 2013, Plaintiffs brought this putative class action against federal immigration enforcement agencies in Southern California. See FAC 1-6, Dkt.
37. Plaintiffs sought relief only as to certain Individual Plaintiffs. That relief included that the voluntary departure orders they had signed would be stayed so that they could reenter the United States without suffering adverse consequences. See Proposed Order, Dkt. 37-11. On December 2, 2013, Defendants withdrew their motion to transfer venue Dkt. 45.
On April 10, 2014, the parties attended a settlement conference with Magistrate Judge Abrams. Riordan Decl.
VI. Conclusion For these reasons, the Motion for Final Approval of the Class-Wide Portions of the Settlement Agreement is GRANTED. The Motion for Attorney’s Fees of $700,000 is GRANTED.

2013. The Joint Stipulation to stay the case is moot. (shb) (Entered: 10/24/2013)","On June 4, 2013, a class action lawsuit was brought in the Southern District of California against the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on behalf of foreign nationals who were present in the United States without permission. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' voluntary departure program (the “Program) deprived the deportees of their rights under federal statutes and the Constitution. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification on July 1, 2013, and the parties entered a settlement agreement on July 2, 2014. The parties agreed that the Program would no longer be administered by CBP and ICE, and that the plaintiffs would be allowed to apply to return to the US through the San Ysidro Port of Entry if they met the criteria for class membership.","On June 4, 2013, a group of individuals and three non-profit organizations filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The plaintiffs alleged that the federal government's voluntary departure program for foreign nationals who were present in the United States without permission deprived the deportees of their rights under federal statutes and the Constitution. The parties reached a settlement agreement. On March 3, 2015, the parties filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement, which was granted by the court on April 10, 2015."
573,IM-CA-0127,"On July 10, 2018, the ACLU of Northern California filed this FOIA suit against U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The plaintiff sought records pursuant to a FOIA request about the defendant's use of a contractor to process and transport immigration detainees, some of whom had allegedly suffered injury and death due to the contractor's malfeasance. The plaintiff sought an order from the court that the defendant provide the records. This case was combined with a suit from a private plaintiff alleging mistreatment in ICE and G4S custody in July 2019. Document production appears to be continuing smoothly at a rate of 750 pages per month, but shifting production online due to COVID-19 has yielded some issues in getting documents over to the plaintiff. Document production is ongoing.","1. This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552 3 et seq., to obtain information about the treatment of immigration detainees by the U.S. Department 4 of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”).
7. On December 18, 2017, Plaintiff American Civil Liberties Union of Northern 5 California (“ACLU-NC”), a non-profit civil rights organization, submitted a FOIA request to ICE 6 seeking its contracts with G4S and any other contractors providing transportation services for 7 immigration detainees in the San Francisco region (the “First FOIA Request”). On April 6, 2018, 8 ACLU-NC and East Bay Express (“EBE”), a local independent newspaper, submitted a FOIA 9 request to ICE seeking records about policies, procedures, and guidelines for detaining and 10 transporting immigration detainees in the state of California; recent complaints about the 11 transportation of immigration detainees; records related to the retention of private transportation 12 providers; and records related to the vehicles, officers, and other individuals involved in the 13 transportation process (the “Second FOIA Request”).
9. ACLU-NC now brings this action to require production of the information 17 requested. ICE cannot simply ignore legitimate FOIA requests.
34. The FOIA Requests are legitimate requests for records relating to matters of great 7 public concern. Defendant ICE has wrongfully withheld agency records requested by Plaintiff 8 under FOIA in the FOIA Requests.
Factual Background By letters dated December 18, 2017 and April 6, 2018, Plaintiff American Civil Liberties 8 Union of Northern California (“ACLU-NC” or “Plaintiff”) submitted two Freedom of Information 9 Act (“FOIA”) requests to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs 10 Enforcement (“ICE” or “Defendant”) seeking records about ICE’s transport of individuals in 11 immigration custody in ICE’s San Francisco Area of Responsibility. A description of the records 12 requested in the December 18, 2017 and April 6, 2018 FOIA requests was included as Plaintiff’s 13 attachments to prior joint CMC statements. See Dkt Nos. 29-1 32-1. Given the large corpus of 14 potentially-responsive documents, Defendant agreed to conduct searches for documents responsive 15 to a Targeted List of FOIA Requests provided by Plaintiff in order to streamline the document 16 search, review, and production process.

On September 26, 2019, the Court granted the Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on the subject matter of the FOIA request. The plaintiff's complaint alleged that ICE's failure to disclose the records requested by Plaintiff was unlawful.

574,IM-CA-0167,"This case was filed in response to the July 6, 2020 directive by ICE that would effectively force international students studying under F-1 and M-1 visas to attend in-person classes or risk deportation. The state of California filed this suit against ICE and DHS on July 9, arguing that the directive was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in two ways. First, the directive was arbitrary and capricious in that it failed to take into account students' and universities' reliance interests and the defendants gave no reasoned basis for the new order. Second, the defendants were in violation of procedural elements of the APA, because they failed to use proper notice-and-comment rule-making when issuing the new order.

On July 15, in a different lawsuit filed against the administration over the same July directive, plaintiffs met with counsel for the government and worked to get the regulations rescinded. In order to effectuate the rescission, ICE removed the guidance from its website and replaced it with the previous guidance and as a result, plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction. California continued to monitor the alterations ICE made to its website between July and September and filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on October 19, 2020.

ICE 25 acknowledged that the exemptions were necessary “[g]iven the extraordinary nature of the 26 COVID-19 emergency,” and asserted that the policy would be “in effect for the duration of the 27 emergency.”

On March 30, 2012, the District Court ordered DHS to provide adequate description of the exempted information in response to the FOIA request so that AILA could make a proper segregability determination.  This was the last action in this case.","17. The reliability and fairness of an adjudication process—especially in an area with such great importance as immigration—can only be evaluated if the procedures and actions of the government agency are transparent. To this end, AILA filed two FOIA requests with USCIS seeking detailed information relating to the current procedures for reviewing and adjudicating H-1B cases. The public interest in these procedures is particularly high because the aforementioned recent measures implemented by USCIS concerning H-1B petitions have caused confusion and concern among U.S. businesses that legitimately depend on temporary foreign workers with specialized knowledge in order to operate successfully. The measures additionally have caused confusion and concern on the part of foreign workers named as beneficiaries on H-1B petitions.
18. The FOIA requests lodged by AILA seek to obtain records of particular importance in educating businesses, foreign workers, the bar, and the public at large concerning compliance with the H-1B rules, regulations, and associated law. This action concerns the failure of DHS and its component USCIS to release requested records under FOIA.
5. In particular, AILA appealed the withholding of the six pages of responsive record(s) from disclosure by USCIS and DHS. AILA also challenged (i) the adequacy of the search for records responsive to the First FOIA Request, (ii) the failure to segregate non-exempt information from allegedly exempt information, and (iii) the alleged applicability of the cited FOIA exemptions to the records sought.

576,IM-DC-0021,Central American mothers and children detainees brought suit against the Department of Homeland Security and its various agencies for the government's unlawful expedited removal policies at the Artesia Family Residential Center. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case in January 2015 after DHS remedied the violations of Plaintiffs' rights in their immigration proceedings and closed the Artesia facility.,"10. This case arises under the United States Constitution; the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.; the regulations implementing the INA’s asylum process; and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. 11.
13. Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A) requires that all § 1252(e)(3) actions be brought in the District Court for the District of Columbia. In addition, venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District.
1996. 8 U.S.C. § 1225 et seq. (setting forth the expedited removal system). In particular, this case concerns the government’s creation of a new, revised expedited removal system for use in cases involving recently arrived Central American families.
75. Understandably, most women detained at Artesia—the vast majority of whom are unrepresented by counsel—have no understanding of such technical legal questions and thus are unable to respond appropriately.
76. Immigration judges reviewing negative credible fear determinations have also applied Defendants’ new policies. For example, an immigration judge reviewing a negative credible fear determination issued to Plaintiff B.C.M. indicated that noncitizens fleeing gangs are categorically not entitled to asylum, even though such a claim has been recognized by courts. During the credible fear review hearing, the judge told Ms. B.C.M. that “people from all these countries come to the United States because of gangs and that is why they are not being granted asylum.” The judge further stated that “gangs are not a reason for [them] to stay,” and then proceeded to tell Ms. B.C.M. that she was going to be deported. The judge also repeatedly interrupted Ms. B.C.M. throughout the hearing, preventing her from providing details as to the basis of her fear.
97. All of the Plaintiffs have been subject to such restrictions on their phone use. Indeed, earlier this week, an immigration officer forced Plaintiff M.S.P.C. to end her call with counsel in the instant case after only 3 minutes and 39 seconds. Plaintiffs M.R.R. and B.C.M. have similarly had their calls cut off by ICE officers while they were in the midst of speaking to or attempting to reach an attorney.
When Plaintiff R.E.C.G. finally managed to secure the assistance of a volunteer attorney, she encountered numerous barriers to her access to counsel. On multiple occasions, her attorney added her to the list of detainees whose attorneys sought to meet with them, yet ICE failed to produce Ms. R.E.C.G. for those meetings.
Civil Action No. 14-1437-ABJ Plaintiffs’ Notice of Voluntary Dismissal Pursuant to Rules 41(a)(1)(A)(i) and 41(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs submit this notice of voluntary dismissal of all claims, without prejudice, in the above captioned case. On August 22, 2014, Plaintiffs initiated this case to challenge the federal government’s unlawful expedited removal policies at the Artesia Family Residential Center. Plaintiffs are Central American mothers and children who are fleeing persecution in their home countries. After they entered the United States seeking refuge, they were arrested and detained by the federal government at a remote federal detention facility in Artesia, New Mexico. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs challenged policies and procedures by the federal government that denied them a meaningful opportunity to present their claims, prejudged their cases and applied an erroneous legal standard to deny their claims, and resulted in orders of removal that would have returned them to countries where they face extreme danger, despite obviously meritorious claims. Under the challenged policies, Plaintiffs and other families detained at Artesia were almost completely cut off from communications with the outside world, provided insufficient information and in some cases no information about their rights under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), affirmatively precluded from effectively contacting and receiving assistance from attorneys, and ultimately forced to navigate pro se a complex immigration process that was heavily weighted against them. Plaintiffs and others detained at Artesia were subjected to a highly truncated process in which they were provided virtually no notice of when critical proceedings were scheduled to occur; asylum officers and immigration judges rushed them to answer questions regarding the violence, death threats, and sexual abuse they feared, while their children listened; their children were ordered removed without being individually screened to determine whether they had a separate basis for fearing persecution; and asylum claims were denied for failing to properly respond to questions phrased in complicated legal terminology.

577,IM-DC-0053,"On June 20, 2018, three immigrant parents separated from their children filed a civil action against various federal agencies and officials in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for immediate reunification with their children.The plaintiffs were detained after crossing the United States-Mexico border without inspection with young accompanying children, seeking asylum. After plaintiffs were apprehended at the border, the children were separated under the “zero-tolerance” immigration policy announced April 6, 2018, which criminally prosecuted adult entrants crossing the border illegally and placed accompanying minors in custody of the government. All three plaintiffs crossed the border prior to the Executive Order issued on June 20, 2018, which allowed immigrant parents and children apprehended at the border to remain together during the pendency of their proceedings. The plaintiffs alleged interference of family integrity in violation of Due Process, and sought preliminary and permanent injunctions to immediately reunite plaintiffs with their children. The plaintiffs obtained preliminary relief and were (along with another parent who joined the case later to prevent separation from her daughter) ultimately re-united with their children. The case is now closed.","1. This lawsuit challenges the federal government’s recent decision to indefinitely separate immigrant parents from their young children. The government’s separation policy is designed, intended, and administered as a means of deterring all immigration, even legal immigration by those with a right to seek asylum. This is punishment, it interferes with family integrity, and it interferes with access to courts, all of which our Constitution’s Fifth Amendment does not allow. Families naturally experience forced separation as torture and they urge this Court to stop it.
M.G.U. received a positive credible fear determination and her family would be released from STFRC. The bad news: the family would not be leaving together, and instead were going to be separated.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES","On June 20, 2018, three immigrant parents who had been separated from their children filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the government's forced separation of their children from their parents violated their Fifth Amendment rights. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction seeking immediate reunification with their children on June 26, 2018. On July 12, 2018, the court issued an order barring the government from enforcing the separation of immigrant parents and their children at the border until the case is resolved. On July 13, 2018, the government filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the plaintiffs had not shown that they were in custody within the jurisdiction of the court. The case is now closed.","On June 20, 2018, three immigrant parents who were separated from their young children after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Homeland Security.

The complaint alleges that in preventing a Syrian national with a valid U.S. visa from returning to the U.S. pursuant to the EO, the defendants violated the First Amendment Establishment Clause, Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and international law. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. 

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and Bernard Harcourt of Columbia Law School, is a resident in the University of Illinois Chicago/Advocate Christ Hospital. He returned to the United Arab Emirates to get married on Jan. 23, and upon returning to the U.S. to continue his residency, he was detained at Abu Dhabi International Airport on Jan 29. Despite his valid visa, he was detained pursuant to the EO. If the plaintiff cannot return to the U.S., he faces the risk of being deported to Syria, where he is a citizen but has never been a resident. 

That same day, the plaintiff also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.

The case was assigned to Judge Elaine Bucklo.  At a status hearing on February 1, the parties told the judge they had reached a ""settlement in principle.""

On February 2, the plaintiff successfully entered the United States at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. On February 8, the plaintiff filed a motion for voluntary dismissal and leave to reinstate on or before August 1, 2017. Judge Bucklo granted this motion and terminated the case.

579,IM-LA-0015,"On Aug. 14, 2013, 13 Indian guestworkers filed suit in S.D. Miss. for harm suffered as a result of an allegedly fraudulent and coercive employment recruitment scheme.  In Oct. 2013, the court transferred this case to E.D.La where it was consolidated with the Achari lead case. The Achari case was dismissed due to settlement agreement but the court retained jurisdiction.","COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND I. This is a human trafficking case brought by workers from India who were trafficked into the State of Mississippi. Defendants collectively engaged in a scheme to defraud Plaintiffs out of tens of thousands of dollars and, in the wake ofa devastating hurricane in the Gulf Coast region, unlawfully turned them into an exploitable source of cheap labor. The Defendants worked together to defraud each of the Plaintiffs, falsely promised them that they would receive permanent residence in the United States, trafficked them into the United States, forced them to live in squalid and unsanitary conditions that damaged their health and psychological well-being, discriminated against them on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, and alienage, and threatened them with financial ruin and adverse immigration action if they balked or complained.
9. Plaintiffs traveled to the United States in late 2006 and were horrified by what they saw when they reached Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Their living conditions were deplorable. Signal forced them into overcrowded trailers in a fenced-in property with armed guards preventing visitors and carefully monitoring the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs. Signal workers referred to the camp as ""the Reservation."" Signal served them rotting food that was often inedible and made them sick. And to add insult to injury, Signal charged them each $35 per day, or as much as $1050 per month, for this room and board. Plaintiffs were not permitted to opt out of the room and board provided by Signal; it was deducted from their pay even if they lived or ate elsewhere.
10. The work conditions were no better. Signal supervisors verbally abused Plaintiffs and derided them for their race and alienage. They forced Plaintiffs to perform dangerous jobs with inadequate safety equipment, knowing that Plaintiffs had no choice but to obey their commands. All of this was reserved solely for Signal's Indian workers. Its non-Indian workers could live and eat where they pleased, were not forced to pay for room and board, and performed relatively easier and safer tasks at work. Signal could not even provide the Plaintiffs with steady work, although it continued to charge them $35 a day even if they did not work, so Plaintiffs were unable to pay down their debts as they were promised.
34. Upon information and belief, Defendant Michael Pol was, at all relevant times, the President of Global Resources, Inc., and resides in Mississippi. On information and belief, Pol was at all relevant times the sole corporate officer of Global. Pol and Global Resources, Inc. are alter egos. Global and Pol will be referred to collectively below as ""Pol,"" unless a distinction is drawn between them.
67. Each of the Plaintiffs was assigned to work at Signal's fabrication facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and to live in a nearby ""man camp"" built in the fall of2006 specifically for the Indian workers. Signal employees and management referred to the Pascagoula man camp as ""the Reservation."" They discussed among themselves, including in written email communication, that housing the workers in a secluded man camp on the outskirts of town was preferable, since it would keep the Indians segregated from the rest of the Pascagoula, Mississippi community.
74. Plaintiffs also were required to bring food from the mess hall for their lunches at Signal's Pascagoula facility. However, because the workers had to leave for work very early in the morning, their already rotting food would sit and bake in the Mississippi heat for several hours before they had the opportunity to eat it, by which time it was completely spoiled and inedible.
283. Defendants threatened not to extend Plaintiffs' H-2B visas, not to sponsor Plaintiffs for green cards, to deport Plaintiffs, and to send them back to India if they complained about conditions at Signal, and also deceived Plaintiffs about the terms of their immigration status, each in a manner that constitutes an abuse ofthe legal process under 18 U.S.C. § 1589(3). Defendants retaliated against Plaintiffs when they sought legal advice regarding their rights and immigration status.

The plaintiffs alleged that the company's scheme to traffic vulnerable workers into the US and exploit them for cheap labor caused them to be unable to pay down their debts. The case was consolidated with a separate case in the same court.

3. This is a third party action brought to recover monetary damages against the named Third Party Defendant for whatever monetary damages, if any, that are assessed to the Third Party Plaintiffs in the main action. The main action alleges that the Defendants have a policy and practices of excluding limited English proficient (LEP) immigrants aged 17-20 from enrolling at Thomas R. Proctor High School (Proctor High School) in Utica, New York. The main action was brought on behalf of six refugees, Patrick Tuyizere, Suk Maya Rai, BBT by her parent and natural guardian Birkha Bolon, Ali Janar, Cho Cho Win and Ado Lar and a class of similarly situated individuals.

INTRODUCTION Petitioners/plaintiffs Junior Onosamba-Ohindo (“Class Petitioner”) and Antonio Lopez Agustin (“Subclass Petitioner”) (collectively “Petitioners”) have filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, purportedly on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated. (Dkt. 1 (“Petition”)). At the time the Petition was filed, Petitioners were both civil immigration detainees held under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) pending their removal proceedings. Petitioners seek: class certification; a declaratory judgment that the “actions, practices, policies, and/or omissions” of defendants/respondents William Barr, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), James McHenry, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”), Matthew Albence, Chad F. Wolf, and Jeffrey Searls (collectively “Respondents”) violate the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) and its implementing regulations, the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; a declaratory judgment that each class member is entitled to a custody hearing at which the government bears the burden to justify continued detention by proving by clear and convincing evidence that the detained individual is a danger to others or a flight risk; and an order stating that each class member must be released unless provided with such a custody hearing. (Id. at 18-19).
Accordingly, Respondents’ motion to dismiss is granted as to all claims by the RCC detainees, including Subclass Petitioner, and consequently including all claims asserted on behalf of the proposed subclass. The dismissal is without prejudice. Additionally, because the only claims presently remaining before the Court are the “core” habeas claims of Class Petitioner and the remaining putative class members, all Respondents aside from Jeffrey Searls are also dismissed without prejudice.2 See Rodriguez, 2019 WL 2192516, at *3.

COUNTY, TOM SCHMERBER, AND MARIO A. HERNANDEZ Defendants City of El Cenizo, Texas, Raul L. Reyes, Maverick County, Tom Schmerber, and Mario A. Hernandez (“the El Cenizo parties”) move to dismiss Texas’s First Amended Complaint pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 12(b)(1). Immediately after SB 4 was signed, Texas filed this suit. Its barefaced attempt to outrun the lawsuits it anticipated, and thus upend the ordinary rule that plaintiffs—not governmental entities—decide the forum for challenges to statutes, fails. Indeed, permitting this case to proceed would set a dangerous precedent, inviting any state to run into court any time it enacts a controversial and legally vulnerable statute. Such requests for advisory opinions would be anathema to the constraints on federal judicial power. This case should be dismissed. Texas lacks standing, because it asserts no concrete harm. Even if Texas did have standing, the Court should nonetheless dismiss its lawsuit. The Declaratory Judgment Act provides for discretionary jurisdiction, and that discretion should not be exercised in favor of Texas’s highly unusual preemptive action that is now entirely redundant of El Cenizo, et al v. Texas, No. 5:17-cv-404 (W.D Tex. May 8, 2017). The El Cenizo case, which seeks injunctive relief from actual harm, provides the proper vehicle for litigation of Texas’s defense of SB
22. Texas filed this lawsuit just a few short hours before it was signed by the Governor and months before it will ever be enforced. The motive for filing action could be the common desire of litigants desire to control venue in courts that they believe will be most receptive to their arguments. This is a desire with which many plaintiffs are acquainted. However, there could be a darker desire in filing this suit by Texas, the elimination of dissent. Texas began this lawsuit by suing the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. And, now, it has enlarged this suit to include other nonprofits like the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund. These are entities that cannot violate federal immigration law nor SB 4 in any circumstances, now or in the future. They are, however, vocal dissidents of the policy and perspectives that fuel SB
xii INTRODUCTION Just before midnight on a Sunday, mere hours after the Governor signed Senate Bill 4 (“SB4”) into law, the State of Texas filed this lawsuit asking to have its new law declared constitutional. As defendants, the State named municipalities and local officials who had criticized SB4 leading up to its enactment, along with a non-profit civil rights organization. After lawsuits challenging SB4 were filed in a different division, the State asserted that all challenges would have to be transferred to the division the State had chosen on the evening of enactment. Instead, however, the challenges were consolidated in the other venue, where they have made significant progress, including hundreds of pages of briefing on the merits, an all-day evidentiary hearing, a 94-page decision by the district court, and an appeal to this Court. The district court properly dismissed Texas’s unusual suit. Under binding Supreme Court precedent, federal district courts lack statutory jurisdiction over suits by States seeking preemptive declarations that state regulations comply with federal law. Indeed, Texas has ample means to enforce SB4 in its own courts, with penalties that include fines, prosecution, and removal from office. It faced no imminent harm when it filed this lawsuit, four months before SB4 would even go into effect. Texas claims that the defendants’ criticism of SB4 and eventual legal challenges harmed the State in various ways, but a State has no cognizable interest in punishing critics or preempting possible legal challenges. And as the natural defendant, the State has no right to dictate where and when injured parties must seek judicial review, even if it beats them to the courthouse on the evening it enacts a new law.
C. The Decision Below. The district court, per Judge Sam Sparks, dismissed this case for lack of jurisdiction on August 9, 2017.","On May 7, 2017, the State of Texas filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas against the City of Austin, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), and the Travis County Commissioners Court. The State sought a declaration that Senate Bill 4 (SB 4) is constitutional. On August 9, 2017, the District Court dismissed this case for lack of jurisdiction.","On May 8, 2017, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas against the City of El Cenizo, Maverick County, and the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund, seeking injunctive relief from SB 4.

The District Court dismissed this case for lack of jurisdiction. The case was appealed and the District Court upheld the dismissal on August 9, 2017."

DISCUSSION Erie County and Sheriff’s Department officials Howard, Livingston, and Huggins, and former sheriff Gallivan (hereinafter collectively “County Defendants”)1 objected to production of the booking sheets on privacy grounds (Docket No. 29, County Defs Memo. at 3-11). Since the parties strenuously disagreed upon production of these booking sheets and could not agree upon a confidentiality agreement to obviate the need for plaintiffs’ motion, the Court decided to enter its own protective Order. The Court was guided by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and its protective orders in similar cases. See McDaniels Ex. K; see also Marriott. This Order addresses the concerns raised by the County Defendants (see Docket No. 29, County Defs Memo. at 3-6, 8-11), especially the privacy issues arising from New York Criminal Procedure Law § 160.50 I. Method of Production Defendants are to produce the bookings sheets with redactions or produced in summary form identifying only the name, address, telephone number, date of birth, arresting charge, and date of arrest, see Marriott, supra, Tr. at 36, for those arrestees who were arrested from July 2001 to present, but excluding those arrested who (a) were ultimately not convicted or (b) were convicted of felony offenses (see Docket No. 29, County Defs Memo. at 11). (Docket No. 52, at 17-18). (Hereinafter the booking sheets, any summaries of these sheets, and the data therefrom will be referred to collectively as the “booking sheets” despite the manner ultimately provided by defendants.) Defendants are to explain any coding or shorthand in booking sheets produced so that plaintiffs, and ultimately the Court, can decipher what has been produced II. Confidentiality and Its Preservation Information contained in the booking sheets shall be deemed confidential and subject to this protective Order. See McDaniels Ex. K, supra.

What is Happening Now The lawyers in this case have an agreement about how to end the case. This agreement is called a “consent decree.” This is a legal word. It means an agreement that everyone must follow. It is a long process to do a consent decree. Here is how it works. • First, the lawyers agree on how they think the case could end. The jail agreed to follow certain procedures to protect people from COVID. The ACLU and Just City lawyers think these procedures are good. The lawyers write down what they agree on. The paper with this agreement is the “consent decree.” This already happened.

The case arises from concerns about Plaintiffs’ safety while detained in the Shelby County Jail (“the Jail”) during the current pandemic caused by COVID-19. (ECF Nos. 1, 50.) Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety. (ECF No. 25.) On June 10, 2020, the Court denied Defendants’ motion and certified a Class and Subclass of medically vulnerable and disabled individuals detained pretrial at the Jail. (ECF No. 38.)

587,JC-WA-0010,"In August 2014, detainees at the Franklin County Jail filed a lawsuit alleging that jail officials used excessive force against them and that the jail provided inhumane living conditions, in violation of the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. In March 28, 2016, the parties settled. The defendant paid $400,557.66 in attorneys’ fees and was required to hire additional staff, renovate the prison, and adopt new mental health services policies.","Previously, the plaintiffs alleged that the Franklin County jail regularly engaged in unconstitutional practices such as denying inmates access to mental health care, confining inmates to solitary confinement for lengthy and unhealthy periods of time, shackling inmates to fixed objects for days on end, and shackling inmates on suicide watch to a fence located in the jail booking area wearing only a smock. The plaintiffs requested a temporary restraining order barring those practices. This Court denied the request for several reasons including, the lack of service of process or reasonable notice to the defendants, the lack of a response from the defendants, and the lack of admissible evidence of immediate and irreparable harm. This Court invited the parties to schedule a hearing for a preliminary injunction, but instead the plaintiffs filed this motion for reconsideration.
7. The Parties participated in a settlement conference on February 4 and 8.
8. On February 5, 2016, the Parties reached a settlement. As a result, United 4 States Magistrate Judge Rodgers entered the Parties’ confirmation of reaching an 5 agreement on the record.

89. The parties inform the Court they have reached a 17 settlement. The parties indicate they will be filing a joint motion for class 18 certification and a joint motion for preliminary approval of a settlement agreement.
19 Because the parties have reached a settlement, they request a stay of proceedings 20 in this matter and the suspension of Defendants’ filing of expert reports. The Court 21 finds good cause to grant the motion. The above-captioned case is stayed until 22 further notice.

The Plaintiffs raised a number of claims regarding the conditions at the Jail; 15 conditions under which all people detained there were held. See Dkt. #66-2 16 (Second Amended Complaint). The parties have agreed to resolve these claims 17 through this settlement. All people who are currently held at the Jail and all people 18 who will be held there in the future will benefit from the changes the Defendants 19 have committed to make. Commonality of law and fact is present.
Civ. P. 23(a)(3). The named plaintiffs were all incarcerated at the Jail when this case was originally filed. See Dkt. #1 (Plaintiff’s Complaint). The Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges that the named Plaintiffs suffered substantially similar conditions to those all others at the Jail endured. See Dkt. #66-2. Though they are not currently housed at the Jail, the eight named Plaintiffs have standing to represent the proposed class and have claims typical of the class as a whole. See Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 111 n. 11 (1975) (conviction does not moot claims of pre- trial detainees who are class representatives when challenged actions are “capable of repetition, yet evading review”); also, Wade v. Kirkland, 118 F.3d 667, 670 (9th Cir. 1997) (pretrial detainee has standing to assert class claims even after release from jail because jail conditions claims are “inherently transitory”).
50. There was no collusion between the parties in reaching this agreement. The settlement is the result of a thorough, well conducted investigation and a long, detailed mediation process.
At the preliminary approval stage, “the court is only concerned with 13 whether the proposed settlement discloses grounds to doubt its fairness or other 14 obvious deficiencies such as unduly preferential treatment of class representatives 15 or segments of the class, or excessive compensation of attorneys.” Alberto v. 16 GMRI, Inc., 252 F.R.D. 652, 666 (E.D Cal. 2008).

A National Security Letter is an administrative subpoena issued by the FBI to a wire or electronic communication service provider requiring the provider to produce specified subscriber information that is relevant to an authorized national security investigation. 18 U.S.C. § 2709(a). By statute, a National Security Letter may include a requirement that the recipient not disclose the fact that it has received such a request. In this case, recipients of National Security Letters alleged that the nondisclosure requirement violates their First Amendment rights.
2012. Following receipt, CREDO and CloudFlare petitioned the district court to set aside the information requests and nondisclosure requirements contained in each NSL. Each recipient also sought to enjoin the government from issuing additional NSLs and from imposing additional nondisclosure requirements. In response, the government cross-moved in each case to compel compliance with the NSLs.
2015. Recognizing the extensive changes to the NSL law made by this enactment, we vacated the district court’s judgments and remanded to allow the district court to consider in the first instance the constitutionality of the 2015 NSL law.
On remand, CREDO and CloudFlare submitted renewed petitions under § 3511(a) to set aside the information requests and nondisclosure requirements contained in each NSL and the government cross-petitioned to enforce both components of the NSLs. This time, the district court held that the NSL law, as amended, was constitutional. It also determined that the government had carried its burden of showing that there was good reason to believe that disclosure of the 2011 NSL to CREDO and of the 2012 NSLs to CloudFlare might result in one of the four enumerated harms. Accordingly, it granted the government’s cross-petitions to enforce those three NSLs in their entirety. However, with respect to the 2013 NSLs to CREDO, the district court held that the government’s certification that one of the four enumerated harms would
result absent nondisclosure was insufficient. Accordingly, it granted CREDO’s petition to set aside the nondisclosure requirement in the 2013 NSLs.

Specifically, the FBI cited FOIA Exemption 7(A), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A), which permits agencies to withhold “records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information … could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Rather than explain the basis of its decision to invoke this exemption, the FBI instead merely reiterated the statutory standards by way of analysis: “The records responsive to your request are law enforcement records; there is a pending or prospective law enforcement proceeding relevant to these responsive records, and release of the information in these responsive records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.”
37. The News Organizations have exhausted all administrative remedies, having filed administrative appeals that were denied. The News Organizations are therefore entitled to seek judicial review of those denials pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).

The News Organizations sought information about the FBI's contract with a tool vendor to hack the iPhone of one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terror attack in December 2015 and the subsequent counter-terrorism investigation opened by the FBI. The Court granted the News Organizations' motion for summary judgment, finding that the information was properly and independently protected under FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, and 7(E) of the Freedom of Information Act, and that the purchase price was not an official disclosure that compelled the release of the requested information over the FBI’s valid exemption claim.

Defendant seeks a determination that it 19 properly withheld records, that it reasonably segregated exempt portions and produced that 20 which was feasible, and that plaintiff must pay $1,274.60 in copying costs associated with the 21 production.2 1 During the course of briefing this summary judgment motion, defendant reevaluated the exemptions claimed for certain documents.

('FAPD') filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on June 14, 2007 against the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration ('AHCA'), the Florida Department of Health ('DOH'), and the state of Florida. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated Title XIX of the Social Security Act by failing to provide Medicaid-eligible children in Florida with essential medical and dental services. The parties agreed to a settlement in which the AHCA agreed to pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and costs, and the defendants agreed to provide the plaintiffs with medical, rehabilitation, and other services.","The Florida Pediatric Society, Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and Florida Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, Inc. filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

597,PB-HI-0005,"On December 28, 2011, two Hawaii-based religious organizations filed a lawsuit in United States District Court against the State of Hawaii. The lawsuit alleged that a California law set to take effect in 2012 was chilling plaintiffs' religious freedom and unconstitutional under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The case was stayed, and the law changed in July of 2012. On October 3, 2012, the case was dismissed for lack of standing.","Presumably, Plaintiffs will cite to Awad v. Zirax, 670 F.3d 1111 (10th Cir. 2012) for the proposition that their clients have standing (and this action is ripe). There, a Muslim Oklahoma resident brought an action against state election officials, alleging that a resolution proposing an amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution to forbid courts from considering or using international law or Sharia law violated the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of First Amendment. The District Court granted the resident's motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prohibiting the election officials from certifying the election results until the court ruled on merits of his claims. The election officials appealed. The Tenth Circuit held that the resident had standing to bring Establishment Clause claim and the Establishment Clause claim was ripe for judicial review. Defendants believe that case is distinguishable from the present action. As noted by the Awad Court, the amendment targeted the plaintiff’s religion for disfavored treatment because it is “a constitutional directive of exclusion and disfavored treatment of a particular religious legal tradition…[and the plaintiff] is facing the consequences of a statewide election approving a constitutional measure that would disfavor his religion relative to others.” Id. at
Based on the following, the Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. The current Complaint is moot because Act 267 amended the Civil Unions Law, and the Complaint was not amended to reflect the statutory change. More important, granting leave to amend (to revise the Complaint to challenge the current version of the Civil Unions Law) would be futile because the action would remain nonjusticiable. Whether gauged in relation to the current Complaint or an amended complaint, conditions for justiciability have not changed since the denial of the Motion for TRO. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they have standing or that the action is ripe. Accordingly, the action is DISMISSED without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
1138. Justiciability includes the doctrines of mootness, ripeness, and standing, see, e.g., Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 v. Del Papa, 200 F.3d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1999) (observing that Article III’s case or controversy “justiciability limitations are reflected in the doctrines of standing, mootness, and ripeness”) and all three doctrines are implicated here, as analyzed to follow A. The Complaint Is Moot Initially, the factual basis of the Complaint as pled no longer exists. Because Act 267 amended the Civil Unions Law retroactively to add an immunity provision the absence of which formed the primary basis of the alleged constitutional infirmity of Act 1 the Complaint as written no longer constitutes a live controversy. In short, the Complaint is moot. See, e.g., Montana Wilderness Ass’n, Nine Quarter Circle Ranch v. U.S. Forest Serv., 655 F.2d 951, 958 (9th Cir. 1981) (“[A]n attack on a statute will be mooted by new legislation which eliminates the aspects of the old law which gave rise to the challenge.”) (citations omitted); Chem. Producers Distribs. Ass’n v. Helliker, 463 F.3d 871, 875 (9th Cir. 2006) (“Where intervening legislation has settled a controversy involving only injunctive or declaratory relief, the controversy has become moot.”) (quoting Bunker Ltd. P’ship v. United States, 820 F.2d 308, 311 (9th Cir. 1987)).3 Despite the pleading deficiency, Plaintiffs’ argument indicates that they now seek to challenge the constitutionality or adequacy of Act 267’s key amendment (the new immunity provision in HRS § 572B-B) they briefly contend that “[t]he limited exemption of Act 1, as amended, fails to satisfy the First Amendment by placing three conditions precedent for a church needing to meet before being able to utilize the limited exemption.” Doc No. 23, Pls.’ Opp’n at 7.
moot. Granting leave to amend would be futile because the action is not presently justiciable. The action is dismissed without prejudice. See Ass’n of Am Med. Colls v. United States, 217 F.3d 770, 785 (9th Cir. 2000) (modifying a dismissal of an unripe claim to a dismissal without prejudice because events may later progress “to a point where plaintiffs’ claims are ripe”); Frontline Processing Corp v.

The parties entered a consent decree in which the parties agreed to a series of conditions, including that the defendant would provide housing and supportive services to the parents and that the court would monitor compliance with the terms of the consent decree.

599,PB-IN-0009,"On Sept. 8, 2014, a same-sex couple filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a county clerk and the Indiana Department of Health. The plaintiffs claimed that the state's ban on same-sex marriages violated the their 14th Amendment rights to due process and equal protection. After the 7th Circuit struck down Indiana's marriage ban, the state agreed to recognize the plaintiffs' out-of-state marriage pending a final resolution to the case.","1. Veronica and Mayra are a committed same-sex couple (“adult Plaintiffs”) residing in Indiana with their two minor children, B.Y.R. and I.R. (“child Plaintiffs”). Plaintiffs bring this 1 The undersigned counsel hereby provides notice to the Court that this action is being taken on behalf of Mayra Yvette Rivera to avoid imminent and irreparable harm pursuant to Rule 1.14 of the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct.
3. Through Defendants’ adherence to and enforcement of Indiana Code Section 3111-1-1 and their interpretation and enforcement of the State’s other laws to preclude same-sex couples from marrying or having their marriages lawfully entered into other jurisdictions recognized in Indiana, the State and Defendants send a message that lesbians, gay men, and their children are second-class citizens who are undeserving of the legal sanction, respect, protections, and support that different-sex couples and their children receive automatically through marriage. This discrimination (referred to herein as the State’s “marriage ban”) is established in the State’s statutes, which prevent same sex couples from entering into a civil marriage in the State and prohibit the State from honoring a civil marriage validly entered by a same-sex couple in another jurisdiction.
5. The right to marry the person of one’s choice and to direct the course of one’s life in this intimate realm without undue government interference is one of the fundamental liberty interests protected for all by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The State’s exclusion of Veronica and Mayra and other same-sex couples from marriage violates their fundamental right to marry. The State also interferes with the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interest in familial association and integrity of B.Y.R. and I.R. and other children of same-sex couples without any compelling, important, or even legitimate justification.
15. Sometime around September 1996, Veronica learned that her sister was seven months pregnant. Her sister was not able to raise another child on her own. Mayra and Veronica both love children and had planned to start a family of their own. It was an easy decision for them to raise the child as their own. On November 11, 1996, B.Y.R. was born. Mayra and Veronica took B.Y.R. home from the hospital and have loved and cared for her ever since. B.Y.R. thinks of both Mayra and Veronica as her mothers.
29. Indiana has enacted a statute that excludes same-sex couples from marriage. See Indiana Code § 31-11-1-1. This statute cannot be explained by reference to legitimate public policies that could justify the disadvantages the marriage bans impose on same-sex couples who wish to marry. Rather, the history of its enactment and its own text demonstrates that interference with the equal dignity of same-sex couples was more than a mere side effect of this enactment — it was its essence C. Plaintiffs Are Injured by the Marriage Ban.
c. Family leave for an employee to care for a spouse; d.
45. The State’s interest in child welfare is affirmatively harmed — not furthered — by the marriage ban. The marriage ban injures same-sex couples’ children without offering any benefit to other children.
E. Veronica and Mayra’s Need for a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction.
89. Plaintiffs seek preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief to protect their constitutional rights and avoid the injuries described above. In addition, Veronica and Mayra seek a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary injunction against the Defendants. A favorable decision enjoining Defendants would redress and prevent the irreparable injuries to Plaintiffs identified herein, for which Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.
marry in the state and enjoy the benefits accorded by the state. On the heels of this change, Plaintiffs in this case seek an injunction for recognition by the State of Indiana of their out-ofstate same-sex marriage. To this end, they moved for a Temporary Restraining Order, but while the court was reviewing the submissions, the parties jointly stipulated that certain relief be accorded to Plaintiffs while Bogan, supra, is pending an appeal in the Supreme Court of the United States.
In particular they agree that Defendants will not enforce Indiana Code § 31-11-1-1(b) against Plaintiffs and will recognize their out-of-state marriage. And, should either adult Plaintiff die, the Department of Health will issue a death certificate recording the deceased Plaintiff’s status as “married” and list the other adult Plaintiff as the “surviving spouse.” Moreover, they agree that the Department of Health assist local health departments, funeral homes, physicians, coroners, medical examiners, and others involved in the completion of death certificate to understand their duties under this agreement.
The parties also agree that the case should otherwise be stayed until the Supreme Court issues its decision regarding the appeal in Bogan.

600,PB-KY-0001,"In 2013, three same-sex couples married under the laws of other states filed a lawsuit, individually and on behalf of their children, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against the Commonwealth of Kentucky, challenging the constitutionality of Kentucky's laws prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying and voiding within Kentucky marriages of same-sex couples validly entered into under the laws of other states and countries.  Judge John Heyburn found for the plaintiffs on July 1st, 2014, and issued the final order declaring Kentucky laws banning same-sex marriages to be unconstitutional.  This order was stayed and then reversed by the Sixth Circuit. The case is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.","31. Venue is proper in the Western District of Kentucky under 28U.S.C. § 1391(b) because Defendants perform their official duties in this district.
Five years later, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declared that the state’s own ban on same-sex marriage violated their state constitution. Goodridge v. Dep’t of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941, 969 (Mass. 2003). In May 2004, Massachusetts began marrying same-sex couples. In response, anti-same-sex marriage advocates in many states initiated campaigns to enact constitutional amendments to protect “traditional marriage.”4 Like-minded Kentuckians began a similar campaign, arguing that although state law already prohibited same-sex marriage, a constitutional amendment would foreclose any possibility that a future court ruling would allow same-sex marriages to be performed or recognized in Kentucky. See S. DEBATE, 108TH CONG., Only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Kentucky. A legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized KY
A. If the classification imposed by Kentucky’s laws significantly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right, “critical examination of the state interests advanced in support of that classification is required,” i.e. strict scrutiny applies. Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 383 (quotation omitted). Kentucky’s laws prevent all same-sex couples from marrying. This acts as a complete bar to Plaintiffs’ ability to marry each other, thus satisfying the “significant interference” threshold. The only question that remains is whether the right Plaintiffs seek to exercise is a fundamental right—a question that neither the Supreme Court nor the Sixth Circuit has answered. The right to marry is a fundamental right situated within the due process right to liberty. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (marriage is a “fundamental freedom”); Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942) (marriage is “one of the basic civil rights”); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923) (the right to marry is a central part of Due Process liberty); Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 205 (1888) (marriage is “the most important relation in life”). The right to marry is a nonenumerated fundamental right; that is, it is not written in the Constitution. Its constitutional significance arises from various protected liberty interests, such as the right to privacy and freedom of association. See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 486 (1965) (marriage is a “right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights”);
8. The plaintiffs’ experts testified that same-sex couples raise children as well as opposite-sex couples, and that denying marriage to same-sex couples creates instabilities for their children and families. The defendants’ experts testified that the evidence regarding the comparative success of children raised in same-sex households is inconclusive. The district court sided with the plaintiffs. It rejected all of the State’s bases for its marriage laws and concluded that the laws failed to satisfy rational basis review.
The district court granted the plaintiffs relief in both cases. In Obergefell, the court concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a fundamental right to keep existing marital relationships intact, and that the State failed to justify its law under heightened scrutiny. The court likewise concluded that classifications based on sexual orientation deserve heightened scrutiny under equal protection, and that Ohio failed to justify its refusal to recognize the couples’ existing marriages. Even under rational basis review, the court added, the State came up short. In Henry, the district court reached many of the same conclusions and expanded its recognition remedy to encompass all married same-sex couples and all legal incidents of marriage under Ohio law.
Petitioners filed these suits in United States District Courts in their home States. Each District Court ruled in their favor. Citations to those cases are in Appendix A, infra. The respondents appealed the decisions against them to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. It consolidated the cases and reversed the judgments of the District Courts. DeBoer v.

The plaintiffs challenged the state's laws excluding same-Sex couples from marriage and voiding within the State the marriages of gay couples entered in other states or countries. The court found that the laws violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States. The case was restyled on February 27, 2014 and the plaintiffs appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court reversed the lower court's decision. The Supreme Court held that the right to marry is a fundamental right situated within the due process right to liberty, and that the Supreme Court has previously held that it must still be a wide one.",Two same-sex couples filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky against the State of Kentucky and the Ohio Department of Health. The plaintiffs argued that the state's ban on same-Sex marriage violated their Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and equal protection under the law. The district court granted the plaintiffs relief in both cases. The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court's decision in favor of the plaintiffs. The Supreme Court of the United States has not yet issued a decision on the issue.
601,PB-NY-0003,"This class action was about whether the City of New York improperly denied federally sponsored cash assistance to qualified New York City residents under a program implemented by the city in the late 1990s. The plaintiffs each claimed to be qualified welfare beneficiaries who had been improperly denied assistance by one of New York City’s new job centers in violation of the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process, the city’s obligations under 7 U.S.C. §2020 (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—then referred to as Food Stamps) and 42 U.S.C. §1396 (Medicaid), in addition to violating state law; the plaintiffs sought class certification for all similarly situated New York City residents, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 16, 1998, with Judge William H. Pauley presiding. The court entered a temporary restraining order on the same day directing the city to provide emergency food stamps and cash assistance to the named plaintiffs. The court granted a preliminary injunction in-part to the plaintiffs on January 21, 1999. The court ordered the city to (1) allow applicants for public assistance to apply for benefits the first day they visit a job center, (2) cease conversion of income support centers to job centers without a formal hearing, (3) make eligibility requirements for food stamps and Medicaid separately from the eligibility determination from cash assistance, (4) send applicants timely notice of the city’s decision on whether they qualify for benefits, and (5) form a corrective plan for achieving its policy goals while also meeting the needs of public assistance applicants. The city moved to vacate the preliminary injunction on December 10, 1999, after procuring more evidence surrounding the efficacy of the job centers in achieving their welfare obligations. Meanwhile, the State of New York moved to dismiss the complaint against them for failure to state a claim. Judge Pauley denied both motions and granted the plaintiff’s motion for class certification on July 21, 2000. 

The court entered a permanent injunction in favor of the plaintiffs on December 30, 2004. The permanent injunction directed both the city and state to: (i) provide expedited food stamp service to eligible applications within 7 days; (ii) separately process applications for food stamps when the applications for cash assistance are denied or withdrawn; (iii) send notices to applicants confirming voluntary withdrawals for Medicaid in accord with 42 C.F.R. 435.913 and document such withdrawals pursuant to 7 C.F.R. 273.2(c)(6); and (iv) provide adequate and timely notice by correctly completing certain documentation. The injunction also required the state to supervise the city and make sure it met the obligations of the injunction. On January 13, 2005, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the part of the December order in which the court concluded that 8 N.Y.C.R.R. § 387.8(a)(2)(i)(a) did not confer a privately enforceable right of action and that plaintiffs’ claim under New York Social Services Law § 133 was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court granted the motion on February 14, 2005. Final judgement was entered on December 14, 2005; the court also granted the plaintiffs declaratory judgment.

Both the state and the city appealed the permanent injunction to the Second Circuit on January 12, 2006, but the city dropped its appeal. On October 31, 2007, the Second Circuit reversed the district court, ruling that the state did not have a non-delegable duty to administer the decentralized Medicaid and Food Stamp programs, the state’s efforts in supervising the city since the permanent injunction was issued were adequate, and the district court exceeded its authority by issuing a permanent injunction in light of New York State’s affirmative supervisory steps it had taken to assure compliance. In a series of stipulations and orders from January 31, 2007 to July 22, 2011, the City of New York agreed to pay a total of $2,920,675.94 to plaintiffs for attorney fees and costs sought; the state agreed to pay a further $639,918.98. The case is now closed.","Motion granted in part.
1999. The temporary restraining order was modified on consent to provide for an “informal intervention procedure” to address individual cases of exigent need for “expedited food stamps” and/or “emergency cash assistance.” As the hearing date approached, the parties requested additional time to continue compromise negotiations in an effort to resolve the litigation. This Court granted that request and adjusted the discovery and pre-hearing briefing schedules to accommodate the parties’ needs. On January 14, 1999, the parties advised the Court that they were unsuccessful in their efforts to settle the action. The hearing date was rescheduled to January 20,
Q. Reject the case. Which case would you reject? Would their public assistance case be rejected? A. The whole case. It’s a package deal.
*381 B. Eleventh Amendment Immunity [6] [7] The State defendants contend that plaintiffs’ claims against them are barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” U.S Const. amend XI. An unconsenting State is thus immune from suits in federal court brought by its own citizens, see Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662–63, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1355–56, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), and such immunity extends to State agencies and officers acting on behalf of the State. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth v. Metcalf Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 144–47, 113 S.Ct. 684, 687–89, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993).
1983. The parties are directed to meet and confer regarding reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements.
Almost seven years later, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Pauley, J.) awarded plaintiffs permanent injunctive relief, directing city defendants to comply with specified provisions of federal and state law and directing state defendants to supervise the City’s adherence to the injunction. Initially all the defendants appealed the judgment, but the City withdrew its appeal prior to oral argument before this Court. We are left then with the state *187 defendants’ challenge to the district court’s judgment. We agree with appellants’ contention that the record before us does not support the imposition of liability on the state or warrant the issuance of a permanent injunction against it.
First, the City failed to provide a significant portion of eligible applicants with expedited food stamps within the mandated period of seven days. See 7 U.S.C. § 2020(e)(9) (1999); 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(i)(3)(i) (2007). Second, although the City was required to make separate determinations with regard to applicants’ eligibility for food stamps and Medicaid after their applications for cash assistance were denied, see 7 U.S.C. §§ 2014(b), 2020(i)(2) (1999); 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(b)(3) (2007); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) (2003); 42 C.F.R. §§ 435.906, 435.913 (2006), such determinations were made infrequently. Third, half of the withdrawn applicants audited were found to have been improperly withdrawn as a result of the City’s mishandling of notices and records. See 42 C.F.R. § 435.913 (2006), 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(c)(6) (2007). Fourth, the City *188 frequently failed to give adequate and complete notices to applicants regarding eligibility decisions, in violation of the plaintiffs’ due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and in violation of the regulations. See U.S. Const., amend. XIV, § 1; 7 C.F.R. § 273.10(g)(1) (2007); 42 C.F.R. §§ 435.911, 435.912 (2006).

603,PB-OK-0001,"Plaintiffs are lesbian couples who filed suit on November 3, 2004 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against the United States and the State of Oklahoma, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Article 2 § 35 of the Oklahoma Constitution (the ""Oklahoma Amendment"") violate the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs alleged that DOMA and the Oklahoma Amendment violates the Due Process, Equal Protection, Full Faith and Credit, and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The court found for the plaintiffs, holding on Jan. 14, 2014 that the ban on same-sex marriage violated the Equal Protection Clause.  

The Tenth Circuit found for the plaintiffs on July 18, 2014, and after the Supreme Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari (on October 6, 2014), the Court lifted the stay on its original mandate and enjoined the Defendant from enforcing the Oklahoma Amendment and denying same-sex couples marriage licenses. The Court awarded $309,485.27 in attorney's fees to the plaintiffs. The case is now closed.","2. Eleventh Amendment Second, the State Defendants argue that Palintiffs are procedurally barred from bringing their case against the State of Oklahoma based on the doctrine of sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. The Eleventh Amendment provides: “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” U.S CONST. amend XI. United States Suprem e Court case law has clarified, however, that notwithstanding state sovereign immunity, “where prospective relief is sought against individual state officers in a federal forum based on a federal right, the Eleventh Amendment, in most cases, is not a bar.” Idaho v. Coeur d’Alene Tribe of Idaho 521 U.S. 261, 276-77 (1997); Nelson v. Geringer, 295 F.3d 1082, 1096 (10th Cir. 2002). This is based on the Ex parte Young doctrine, under which “individuals m ay bring suit for prospective injunctive relie f to prevent ongoing constitutional violations against individual state oficials named in their official capacity even ifthe state is immune.” Nelson, 295 F.3d at 1096.
I. Procedural History On November 3, 2004, Plaintiffs, two lesbian couples, filed a Complaint seeking declaratory relief that the Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”), codified at 1 U.S.C. § 7 and 28 U.S.C. § 1738C, and Article 2, § 35 of the Oklahoma Constitution (the “Oklahoma Amendment”), violate the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs originally brought suit against (1) the State of Oklahoma, ex rel. Drew Edmondson, in his official capacity as Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma (“Edmondson”) and Brad Henry, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Oklahoma (“Henry”) (collectively “Oklahoma Officials”); and (2) the United States of America, ex rel. John Ashcroft, in his official capacity as Attorney General of the United States of America and George W. Bush, in his official capacity as President of the United States. On August 16, 2006, the Court ruled on several pending motions, including motions to dismiss (“8/16/06 Order”). See Bishop v Okla. ex rel. Edmondson, 447 F.Supp.2d 1239 (N.D.Okla.2006). Relevant to the currently pending motion, the Court allowed certain of Plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges to proceed against the Oklahoma Officials over their objections. Specifically, the Court ruled that the Ex Parte Young doctrine applied, such that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar the relief sought against the Oklahoma Officials, see id. at 1255, and that Plaintiffs had constitutional standing to challenge one part of the Oklahoma Amendment, see id. at 1256–57. The Oklahoma Officials appealed this Court’s application of the Ex Parte Young doctrine to deny the Oklahoma Officials their alleged sovereign immunity. The Court stayed the case pending a ruling by the Tenth Circuit.
Synopsis Background: Lesbian couples brought action against various government officials claiming that Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) section which functioned to deprive same-sex married couples of federal benefits, and amendment to Oklahoma constitution limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated due process and equal protection. Defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part, 447 F.Supp.2d 1239.
*4 Although the Court did not issue a formal stay of the proceedings, the Court was aware that the United States Supreme Court had granted certiorari in two cases presenting nearly identical issues to those presented here—namely, the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA and the constitutionality of Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative amending the California Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. The Court delayed ruling in this case pending the Supreme Court’s decisions.
2000. On February 13, 2009, the Bishop couple sought the issuance of a marriage license from Smith. Smith refused them a marriage license based upon their status as a same-sex couple.","In 2010, two same-sex couples filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenging the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and the Oklahoma Amendment to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs alleged that DOMA violated the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, and the Privilegseand Immunities Clause. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The case is still pending before the 9th Circuit.","On November 3, 2004, two same-sex couples filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oklahoma challenging the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and the Oklahoma Amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution (the Oklahoma Amendment) on the grounds that DOMA violated their due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The plaintiffs alleged that Missouri Department of Social Services and MO HealthNet denied medically necessary treatment to Medicaid beneficiaries with Hepatitis C, discriminated against similarly situated Medicaid beneficiaries, failed to provide ""reasonably prompt"" treatment, violated due process, and violated the American with Disabilities Act. In November 2017, MO HealthNet modified its policies and the case was dismissed as moot without prejudice. The case closed in November 2017.","1. This case challenges the policies of the Missouri Department of Social Services which result in the denial of medically necessary treatment for Plaintiffs J.E.M., J.L.M., and numerous other Medicaid beneficiaries infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a serious and communicable disease that can cause severe liver scarring, liver damage, cancer, and death.

Plaintiffs J.E.M. and J.L.M, Medicaid beneficiaries with Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”), seek a preliminary injunction against Defendant Brian Kinkade in his official capacity as Director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, and Joe Parks, M.D., in his official capacity as Director of the MO HealthNet Division, enjoining them from applying certain Hepatitis C drug- treatment policies and prior-authorization criteria that Plaintiffs argue exclude them from medically-necessary, direct-acting antiviral treatment (“DAAs”). With the Defendants’ agreement, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from requiring three months of negative drug and alcohol screens prior to submitting requests for DAA approval. The Court finds, however, that an evidentiary hearing is necessary before the Court can rule on the Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from applying policies and prior authorization criteria regarding fibrosis scores because a material factual dispute exists regarding the medical necessity of treating all HCV patients with DAAs regardless of fibrosis score.

On May 10, 2017, the MO HealthNet Division sent another notice to her doctor indicating that H.L.O.’s request for prior authorization “could not be processed at this time” because the “patient does not meet MO HealthNet’s criteria.” On May 12, 2017, MO HealthNet again denied her doctor’s request for prior authorization, providing the same rationale for the denial.

After years of litigation, the claims were eventually dismissed.","page 1 I. Introduction This action anses out of recent U.S. Bureau of Prisons (BOP) rules and regulations that authorize male prison inmates to be housed in the same facilities that house female inmates. Such a blending of the sexes in the confined and restricted conditions attendant to prisons violates the privacy of female inmates and causes numerous dangers and threats to the physical and mental health and safety of our female Plaintiffs, and has in fact resulted in many such dangers coming to fruition as detailed below. The basis for the recent changes to rules and regulations is a politically-driven agenda to affirm that gender identity theory, rather than biological sex, is the normative basis to determine whether an inmate is male or female. Consequently, male inmates who profess to be transgender women are being placed in female-only prison facilities as a method of affirming their misperceived sex. Housing male inmates in facilities otherwise housing only female inmates creates a situation that incessantly violates the privacy of female inmates; endangers the physical and mental health of the female Plaintiffs and others,
