•Filed 08/09/04 Page 2 of 10

3. The Court has ju:r..i.sdiction over the federal claims of discrimination alleged herein in t.hae Cerda filed a complaint respecti.ng the wrongful acts of disc:cimination alleged herein with the United States Equal F.mployment Opportunity Commission on
or about October 27, 2003, which claim was dismissed upon the
issuance of a Notice of Right To .sue on June 14, 2004. Fewer than 90 days have elapsed since the date of the issuance of said Notice of Right To Sue.

4. The Court has jurisdiction over the claims of discrimination alleged herein under NYSHRL and NYCHRL under principles of supplemental and pendant jurisdiction.

THE PARTIES 5. Plaintiff Cerda is a citizen and resident of the State of New York who resides at 30:< East 103'" Street, Apt. 3-D, New York, New York 10029.

6. Plaintiff Cerda is of Hispanic national origin in that his mother is of Puerto :oI.ican, and hi.s father of Mexican, national origin.

7. For eleven years Cerda's principal cccupation has been employment as a refreshment vendor at various sports events, including the US Open.

8. Defendan:: RESTAURANT ASSOC~ATBS, INC. {"Associates"), is
a Ne~1 York: corporation having a principal place of business at 36 West 44'" Street, 5" Floor, New York, New York 10036.

9. Defendant RA TS",'NIS CORP. ("Rl\" ~ is a New York
Corporation having a prine'..:;:>al place ot business at J71ushing Meadow P<l.rk, Flushing, Queens, New York.

10. Associates and RA are coach engaged in interstate commerce and employ more than 100 persons each.

11. Because Associates and RA are closely affiliated with respect to ownership, manag8ment, labor rela~ions and all matters at issue in this case, they ar.e jointly and severally liable with respect to all claims alleged 11e);ein.
THE FACTS 12. Every year during late August and early September the United States Tennis FederatioTl (the "USTA") conducts the US Open at its tennis center located at Flushing Meadow Park, in the
Borough of Queens, City ano. State of New York. The US Open is regarded as one of the f01.:r premier international tennis tournaments. According to its organizen" tl'_e us Opon is "the hi.ghest attended annual sporting event in ehe world".

13. A spectator event of ::he magn~tude of the US Open 3

• Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 1

•Filed 08/09/04 Page 4 of 10

necessarily has facilities for Vr.ovi.din9 :'000. and bevf':cages. These facilities are located thrQughou:: the grounds of the tennis center, both inside and outsids the main stadium. Since at least 2000, and at all times relevant to this complaint, the USTA has contracted with Associates and Rh to oper"-tc "-:ld manage such facilities.

14. Each year in the months of June and July, Associ.ates and RA interview and hire several ~'lundred persons La staff the refreshment facilities at the US Open.

15. Tho. refreshment facilities at lha US Open are not equally valuable in terms of compensation n~ceived by the personnel who staff them. The stationary beer wagons are the best sales assignments because: (a) they generate the most tips; and (b) they are staffed by an~y two people per wagon, which means that the 14% sales ccmmj.ssians paid for each sales location are only divided between t~ose two people. Other locations are staffed by as many as 20 people in sales and support, all of whom receive a smaller share? of the commi"sions.

16, In each year since 2000, the great majority of personnel have beBn Hispanic and/or non-white (including African-Americans and Asian-Americans), but Assocj.ates and RA Lave deliberately and overwhelmingly assigned the Deer wagon" to non-Hispanic white people,

• Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 1

•Filed 08/09/04 Page 5 of 10

17. O:orda worked as a vendo," i'lt tl-::" US Open in ).000 a:ld 2003. In both years defendants l\ssooiates and RA failed a::ld refused to assign him to the beer wagons whDe assigning these positions to non-Hispanic white personnel. In 2002 Cerda also received a discriminatory assignment at a facility other than a beer wagon.

18. Because of the r.ecnrring nature but short time-span of the US Open (less than three weeks) Cerda and the class set forth herein do not have an adequate r.emedy at la.,1 for the wrongful conduct of Associates.

19. The USTA is not being nam8d as a defendant at this time solely on the basis of its representation to the 8EOC that it nas no role in hiring or staffing decisions by Associates and RA. In the event that evidence developed during d~scovery indicates that the USTA is in a position to stop Lhe discriminatory conduct by its concessionaires Associatss and RA, Csrda may move to amenci this complaint to nane the USTl\. as an addicional defendant.

CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS 20. Cerda brings this action as a class action pursuant to subparts (a), (b) (2) and ('0) (3) of Rule 23, Fed. R. Civ. l?roc., on behalf of a class consisting of alJ Hispanic and/or non-white refreshment concessioL personne~ who were hired, employed cr offered employment by Associates or RA ac the US Open in all

• Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 1

•Filed 08/09/04 Page 6 of 10

years since 2000.

21. Members of the class are 50 numerOuS that joinder of all members is impracticable. The exae::: number of class members is
not known at this time and can only be ascertained through
appropriate discovery. Several hundred refreshmenc concession workers are employed during each US Open and the individuals who are so employed change from year to year. ,"creaver, the short time-span of the US Open meanS that this is a situation which has recurred and will likely recur in the future before many of the individual class members become aWare of the degree to which they havB been injured and of their legal remedios Eor sllch injury. The identity of class members may be determined from records maintained by Associates and RA and, if appropriatG, by advertisement. Class melnbers may be notified by mail and publication, using forms of notice similar to those customarily used in employment discrimination class actions.

22. CGrda' s claims arc typical of. the claims of the other members of the class. Cerda was assigced to facilities other than a beer wagon during three of the years subject to this complaint. He suffered actual diminution of income, humiliation and emotional injury as a result of being discriminated against in favor of non-Hispanic white vendors. Hc has retained competent and experienced counsel who intend tc prcsecute this action vigorously. Cerda has no interests which are contrary to

• Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 1

•Filed 08/09/04 Page 7 of 10

or In conflict with those of tho class which he seeks to represent. ThG interests of the class will be fairly and adequat.ely protected by Ccrdil..

23. Common questions of law and fact [lxist "-8 to all members of the class and predominate ovcr any questions solely affecting
individual members of ~he class. Among lhe questions of law and fact commOn to the class are:
(OIl Whether the distribution by hssociates and Rll. of preferable work assignmclIlts to non-Hispanic whites
constituted acts of unlawful em:ploym8nt discrimination is violation of Title VII, the NY$HRL and the NYCHl{L; (b) Whether mombers of :eha class have ,,"..!stained damages as a result of :;he conduct of Associates and RA and the proper measure of such damages; (c) Whether an injunction shoU~Q be issued barring Associates and RA from engaging in such conduct in ::he future I and (dl Whether the USTA bore any measure of responsibility for the discriminatory acts set forth herein.

24. A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient adjud~oation of this controversy. Cerda knows of nO difficult to be encountered in the management of ths action that would preclude its maintenanoe

Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 19 Filed 07/24/06 Page 2 of 10
Preliminary Statement Plaintiff now requests Court approval of the settlement of this class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). The class consists of all Hispanic and non-white employees of defendants Restaurant Associates, Inc., and RA Tennis Corp. who worked at the US Open Tennis Tournament in 2003. Notice of the settlement has been sent to each of the 279 members of the class. Declaration of Laurence B. Jones, ¶¶ 3-4. A total of 101 claim forms have been submitted, of which 97 have been determined by the parties to be eligible for participation in the class action settlement. This memorandum of law is submitted in support of approval of the proposed settlement.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND Defendant Restaurant Associates, Inc. (“RA”) operates and manages the facilities at the US Open for providing food and beverages, both inside and outside the Arthur Ashe stadium. Each summer RA hires several hundred persons to staff these facilities for approximately a three-week period. Plaintiff alleges that RA has given the higher-paying concession stand jobs to white employees and that he and all Hispanic and non-white employees are shunted off to lower-paying positions, in violation of the federal, state and City employment non-discrimination statutes. Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 15-16. Defendant has denied these allegations and denies any liability
1

Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 19 Filed 07/24/06 Page 3 of 10
to plaintiff or to the proposed class. In discovery the RA payroll records for concession
stand vendors at the US Open in 2003 have been produced and exhaustively reviewed by counsel for the parties. While plaintiff contends that these records demonstrate that the pay of non-whites working at food and beverage stands is systematically lower than that of whites working at those stands, defendant has identified instances where the pay of a black employee is higher than that of white employees. Given the conflicting evidence, establishment of discrimination against non-whites therefore remains uncertain.
As the Court is aware, extensive settlement negotiations took place during 2004-2005 that were supervised by the Court. These negotiations did not result in a settlement. In December of 2005 plaintiff served a motion for class certification on defendant as well as a motion to amend the complaint. Settlement negotiations resumed in January of 2006 before the full briefing and filing of these motions; plaintiff and an executive of defendant, in addition to their respective counsel, participated in these negotiations.
Eventually the negotiations resulted in a settlement which calls for defendant to establish a $90,000 settlement fund to be divided pro rata among non-white employees and employees of non-U.S. national origin who file claims. Counsel fees of $50,000 and an incentive award to the named plaintiff of $7,500
2

Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 19 Filed 07/24/06 Page 4 of 10
are provided for separately in the settlement agreement, and these payments are not charged against the $90,000 class member fund. Reference is made to the attached settlement agreement for a complete statement of the settlement terms. Approximately 100 class members have filed claim forms. Therefore the payment to each class member will be approximately $900.
Based on comparison of the wages paid by RA to white and non-white employees, plaintiff’s counsel estimate that the average lost wage claim of each class member is in the vicinity of $400.00. This estimate is the result of extensive review and analysis by plaintiff's counsel (with the participation of plaintiff himself) of the data in defendant's files concerning the job assignments and wages of persons employed by RA at the 2003 US Open.
Besides considering race and ethnicity, they reviewed such factors as type and location of concession, day of the week and point of time within the overall tournament to obtain an accurate cross-section of the differential in compensation between white non-Hispanic employees and class members. The small (but internally consistent) amount of the differential reflects the short period of employment (two-three weeks) and the low pay for these jobs. The amount to be received by each class member in excess of $400 is applicable to each class member’s non-economic claim for damages other than lost wages under the employment discrimination statutes.

Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 19 Filed 07/24/06 Page 5 of 10
ARGUMENT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROPRIATE The parties have conducted substantial discovery and have engaged in court-supervised negotiations followed by armslength separate negotiations that resulted in the proposed settlement. The undersigned counsel have achieved a thorough understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the claims and of the potential defenses. The state of the evidence is such that it is far from a foregone conclusion that the class would achieve a more favorable result if the case went to trial. In particular, it is uncertain what damages a jury would award in excess of the wage differential being recovered by means of the settlement. The settlement in this case has drawn no objections and has received support from nearly 100 class members who desire to participate in it. The recovery for class members is certain and represents well more than the average lower-pay claim that each class member has. And further prosecution of this action would take significantly more time for remaining discovery, motions, trial, and any appeal, for an uncertain result. For these reasons, as supported by the applicable case law factors, the settlement should be approved. 1. Standards for Approval of a Class Action Settlement “The central question raised by the proposed settlement of a class action is whether the compromise is fair, reasonable
4

Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 19 Filed 07/24/06 Page 6 of 10
and adequate.” Schenek v. FSI Futures, Inc., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 707 at *3-4, (S.D.N.Y. 1999), citing Weinberger v. Kendrick, 698 F.2d 61, 73 (2nd Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 818 (1983); accord, Maywalt v. Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co., 67 F.3d 1072, 1079 (2d Cir. 1995). A proposed class action settlement enjoys a strong presumption that it is fair, reasonable and adequate if, as is the case here, it was the product of arms-length negotiations conducted by capable counsel experienced in class action litigation. See, e.g., In re Sumitomo Copper Litig., 189 F.R.D. 274, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 1999; New York & Maryland v. Nintendo of Am., Inc., 775 F. Supp. 676, 680-81 (S.D.N.Y. 1991). Moreover, “(s)ettlement approval is within the Court’s discretion, which ‘should be exercised in light of the general judicial policy favoring settlement.’”) Sumitomo, supra, 189 F.R.D. at 280 (citation omitted).
The factors governing approval of class action settlements are well-established in this Circuit. In City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448 (2d Cir. 1974), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that the following factors are to be considered in evaluating a proposed class action settlement:
(1) the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation . . ; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed; (4) the risks of establishing liability; (5) the risks of establishing damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the
5

Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 19 Filed 07/24/06 Page 7 of 10
best possible recovery; [and] (9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation. Id. at 463(citations omitted); see also County of Suffolk v. Long Island Lighting Co., 907 F.2d 1295, 1323-24 (2d Cir. 1990). These factors support the settlement achieved in this case or are neutral; none of them disfavors the settlement. As to factor (1), the settlement saves the significant time that would be required for the remaining discovery (depositions of RA staff, among others), for class certification briefing and decision, for disposing of the likely summary judgment motion, and for trial. As to (2), the reaction of the class is overwhelmingly favorable: nearly 100 eligible class members have filed claims and no class member has objected. As to (3), sufficient discovery has been obtained from defendant’s pay records to establish the likely damages and the possible difficulties of maintaining a class action. As to (4) and (5), while plaintiff does not perceive a significant risk as to whether liability will be established, it is not realistic to ignore the risk that defendant’s counterexamples will be credited by a jury. As to (6), class action certification has not yet been granted, so there is the risk that it will not be granted at all if the settlement and settlement class are not approved. Factor (7) is neutral: there is no question as to the ability of the defendant to withstand a larger judgment and the case is not being settled on that basis; rather,
6

Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 19 Filed 07/24/06 Page 8 of 10
the dollar amount reflects the low wage amounts paid in a period of only three weeks. As to (8), the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in relation to the best possible recovery, it suffices to state that the recovery is greater than the lost wage claim alone (determined in the manner summarized above at p. 3). No one can say whether a jury would award significant noneconomic damages in this case. As to (9), given all the risks already discussed, the amount to be paid is more than reasonable in light of the litigation risks and the uncertainty as to what might be recovered through further litigation.
In short, the $90,000 settlement in this case is within a range which reasonable and experienced attorneys, and class representatives, could accept, considering the size of the class, the low dollar amounts at issue in a wage case involving three weeks, and all of the risks, facts and circumstances in the case. The range for an acceptable settlement, as once defined by Judge Friendly, “recognizes the uncertainties of law and fact in any particular case and the concomitant risks and costs necessarily inherent in taking any litigation to completion . . . .” Newman v. Stein, 464 F.2d 689, 693 (2nd Cir. 1972).
Finally, we note that the class action notice procedures met the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2). All class members had provided their home addresses to their employer, and notice was sent to all class members at their last known address. This satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.
7

Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 19 Filed 07/24/06 Page 9 of 10 Martens v. Smith Barney, Inc., 1998 WL 1661385 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (court ordered that class notice be distributed by first-class mail to the last known addresses of all members of the class); Langford v. Devitt, 127 F.R.D. 41, 45 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (“notice mailed by first class mail has been approved repeatedly as sufficient notice of a proposed settlement”) (citation omitted). Moreover, as a practical matter, close to 100% individual notice was achieved. Individual mailed notice was provided through first-class mail to all class members at their last known addresses.
In sum, considering the risks, delays and expenses associated with trial, we submit that the proposed $90,000 settlement is well within the range of reasonableness considering the number of class members, the wage amounts involved, and the
8

Case 1:04-cv-03394-DLI-RML Document 19 Filed 07/24/06 Page 10 of 10

short (three-week) duration of the wage differential.

CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff respectfully requests that the settlement be approved by the Court.
