The Court DECLARES that with respect to all persons who owe or will incur court debts arising from cases adjudicated in OPCDC, the Judges’ policy or practice of not inquiring into the ability to pay of such persons before they are imprisoned for nonpayment of court debts is unconstitutional.
The Court further DECLARES that with respect to all persons who owe or will incur court debts arising from cases adjudicated in OPCDC, and whose debts are at least partly owed to the OPCDC Judicial Expense Fund, the Judges’ failure to provide a neutral forum for determination of such persons’ ability to pay is unconstitutional.

The plaintiff objected to the three-drug cocktail (sodium pentothal, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride) used in Maryland's lethal injections. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's lethal injection procedures arbitrarily and unnecessarily created a grave risk that he would suffer extreme pain during his execution, thus violating his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.

The Court also granted NCBF a preliminary injunction, enjoining Gentry from enforcing Rule 10(B) against NCBF during the pendency of this action.
The parties thus agree that the Preliminary Injunction should become a permanent injunction, and the permanent injunction should prohibit the Criminal Court Clerk from enforcing Rule 10(B) against any third-party attempting to post a cash bail bond in Davidson County.

In doing so, Defendant actively misled Plaintiffs to believe that they had just two options — monetary payment of their fines or jail.
Defendant issued these tickets to Ms. Canaan years after her prior arrests and detention.
Defendant further continues to enforce these unconstitutional policies, practices, and procedures against the same class of indigent Municipal Debtors, and in the same manner, as Defendant did against Plaintiffs.
The Court denies these motions.
The district court denied preliminary injunctive relief.

The Court first addressed Plaintiff’s claim that the food-preparation counters at Defendant’s restaurants were too high and violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).
Chipotle intends to serve all of its customers fast.
They can see the freshness and quality of the ingredients.
The only 22 defense to compliance with the ADA is structural impracticability.
Antoninetti is a paraplegic who uses a wheelchair for mobility.
7.2(2)(ii) because the counter, alone, does not provide customers in wheelchairs with full and equal access.
Nor could it.
A, § 2.2.
The “Chipotle Experience” for Standing Customers.
A, § 7.2(2)(ii).
Just as an award of $148,000 in attorneys’ fees to a plaintiff who recovered only $34,000 in damages was held to be an abuse of discretion in McGinnis, so, too, must the award to Antoninetti by the District Court of $136,537.83 in attorneys’ fees for recovery of a mere $5,000 in statutory damages be a clear abuse of discretion.
On that basis, the Ninth Circuit found that the high walls were in violation of the ADA.
On remand, the district court entered judgment against Chipotle for violation of the ADA."

On January 11, 2016, SFFA submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) to the Department, seeking the following: All documents concerning the investigation of Princeton University in Case Number 02-08-6002, which is referenced in the September 9, 2015 letter from Timothy C.J.
On April 18, 2016, John Carroll, an officer of the U.S. Department of Education, New York Office for Civil Rights, had a telephone conversation with Edward Blum, the President of SFFA, and SFFA’s counsel about SFFA’s FOIA request.
Later that afternoon, Mr. Carroll sent Mr. Blum an email purporting to summarize the conversation: “[Y]ou confirmed that you are making this request on behalf of Students for Fair Admission.
Finally, you confirmed that you would like the entire case file.
The following day Mr. Carroll responded to SFFA via email.
As of October 27, 2016, SFFA has not received any documents from the Department in response to its January 11, 2016, FOIA request.
The Department of Education is a federal agency subject to FOIA’s requirements.
The Department’s failure to make a “determination” as to SFFA’s FOIA request within the required time period violates FOIA and the Department’s corresponding regulations and relieves SFFA of any obligation to exhaust administrative appeal remedies before filing its FOIA lawsuit.
The Department’s failure to make a reasonable effort to search for records in electronic form or a format responsive to SFFA’s FOIA request violates FOIA and the Department’s corresponding regulations.
The Department’s failure to make promptly available the records sought by SFFA violates FOIA and the Department’s corresponding regulations.
(3) enjoin the Department from continuing to withhold any and all non-exempt records responsive to SFFA’s FOIA request; ."

The ability to file a complaint and have it thoroughly reviewed is integral to the mission of the OCR.
The changes included new provisions to require mandatory dismissal of certain complaints and the elimination of the appeal rights of complainants.
This second complaint would have been dismissed under the March 2018 CPM.
The first change (“Rule Change 1”) meant that, as of March 5, 2018, OCR would no longer investigate a claim of illegal discrimination if the claim was part of “a pattern” of complaints by an individual complainant against multiple recipients.
This provision, as written, was not limited to those complaints that would place an “unreasonable burden” on OCR.

Defendant United States Department of Education
Defendant ED Secretary Elisabeth DeVos has discarded decades of ED’s experience addressing sexual harassment and assault by promulgating regulatory provisions that sharply limit educational institutions’ obligations to respond to reports of sexual harassment and assault.
Any perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation.
COPAA is incorporated in Florida and operates out of Baltimore County, Maryland (within the Northern Division of the District of Maryland).
Defendant Elisabeth D. DeVos is the U.S. Secretary of Education.
Defendant U.S. Department of Education is a cabinet agency within the executive branch of the United States government and is an agency within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions receiving federal funds.
On May 6, 2020, the Agency released the Rule.
The Agency also completely excluded sexual harassment committed abroad from Title IX protections, requiring that it be perpetrated “against a person in the United States.”

The EEOC claimed that BDC discriminated against the employee in violation of the ADA when it conditioned his employment on the results of a medical exam and subsequently refused to hire him as a night warehouse loader upon learning that he had a disability. The jury initially awarded the employee $132,347 in back pay, but it found that his damages should be reduced by $102,803 because he could have mitigated those damages by finding a comparable position.

","On November 10, 2004, the plaintiff, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC""), filed its complaint in this Court alleging that the defendant, Sears, Roebuck and Company (""Sears""), discriminated against John Bava and a class of disabled employees by failing to accommodate their disabilities, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (""ADA""), 42 U.S.C. § 12117(a), and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. § 1981(a).
The EEOC further alleges that Sears discriminated against a class of disabled employees by unlawfully maintaining an inflexible worker's compensation leave policy, which provides for discharge of employment after a year instead of ""reasonable accommodation of employees with disabilities.""
The complaint conforms with the requirements of Rule 8(a) by providing a short and plain statement of its claims.
As for the class allegations, the complaint alleges that Sears ""maintained an inflexible worker's compensation one year leave policy which does not provide for reasonable accommodation of employees with disabilities.""
EEOC contends that Sears violated Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) by terminating Bava and other employees because they spent more than one year on disability leave and without regard to their individual circumstances and return-to-work prospects.
""As for the class allegations,"" Judge Anderson continued, ""the Complaint alleges that Sears 'maintained an inflexible worker's compensation one year leave policy which does not provide for reasonable accommodation of employees with disabilities.'
As a result, he remained on leave because he was unable to return to his prior service technician job.
The EEOC is also responsible for enforcing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended; the Equal Pay Act of 1963; and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibits discrimination based on disability.

The complaint was filed with a joint motion for a consent decree, which the Court (Donald E. Walter) approved on November 11, 2005.
The terms of the decree provided for damages ($60,000 to the employee) and injunctive relief. The parties bore their own costs. Under the decree, Tasa, Inc., had to provide annual Title VII training to all employees in Louisiana, to post an EEOC poster in a conspicuous location, to report to the EEOC annually the date, attendees, and subject matters of the Title VII trainings, and to institute and follow a promotion policy.

Victoria A. Roberts Guardsmark, LLC, Defendant.
The Court finds Plaintiffs have standing; a reasonable worker might be dissuaded from opposing sexually inappropriate conduct in the workplace if he knew that he would be fired.
In its Complaint (the “EEOC Complaint”), the Commission alleged that Guardsmark violated Title VII by discharging Smith in retaliation for Smith opposing sexually inappropriate conduct by a co-worker.
Within twenty-one (21) business days after this Decree has been entered by the Court, Guardsmark shall pay a total amount of One Hundred and Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($115,000) in monetary relief to Christopher Smith.
Pursuant to Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee because s/he has opposed discriminatory employment practices, including opposing sexual harassment or sexually inappropriate behavior in the workplace.
In compliance with federal law, Guardsmark will not retaliate against an employee who has made an internal complaint of employment discrimination or contacted the EEOC.

In 1975, Latrobe Steel Company was subsequently acquired by the Timken Company and renamed Timken Latrobe Steel.
Plaintiffs were terminated from their employment by Defendant Latrobe Specialty Steel Company (“LSS”), for allegedly sending graphic and sexually explicit emails on company time and equipment.
If the employer articulates such a reason, the burden of production returns to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer's proffered rationale was a pretext for age discrimination.”
Plaintiffs have therefore failed to demonstrate that LSS had discriminated against plaintiffs in the past and, thus, have failed to demonstrate that the decision of LSS to terminate plaintiffs‟ employment because they were sending sexually explicit email was pretext for discrimination.
Plaintiffs have offered no evidence that those emails were found or should have been found during LSS‟ investigation or that the decision makers in this case were aware of, or should have been aware of the emails which he identified.
Appellants subsequently filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging that LSS discriminated against them because of their age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq. On December 29, 2010, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of LSS, concluding that Appellants had failed to demonstrate that “but for” their ages, LSS would not have terminated their employment.
Because this justification is not discriminatory on its face, the burden of production shifts back to Appellants “to demonstrate that the employer’s proffered rationale was a pretext for age discrimination.”
Given the conduct in which Appellants engaged and the lack of sufficient evidence suggesting an atmosphere of age discrimination at LSS, there is no basis for a finding that LSS’s proffered rationale was a pretext for age discrimination.
Likewise, Robert Smith is not similarly situated to Appellants because there is no evidence that Smith actually sent sexually explicit emails.
Objections were called for by the plaintiffs and none have been filed.
Therefore, costs are taxed this 26th day of September, 2012 in the amount of $21,863.88 in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiffs, and are included in the judgment.
Plaintiff JOSEPH A. LITVIK on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated
In fact there is an entire culture at LSS which condones the transmission of inappropriate emails.

ORDER: The court adopts and so orders the parties' proposed scheduling order
AFFIDAVIT/AFFIRMATION by Town of Smithtown (Arntsen, David) (Entered: 08/24/2009)
This class action is brought by four low-income minority individuals in need of affordable housing who live and work near Smithtown, New York.
In this and other ways, the residency preference has actually operated as a residency requirement.
Smithtown's voucher program is supervised by the Town of Smithtown Planning and Community Development Department (""PCDD"") and its administration is subcontracted to the Community Development Corporation of Long Island.
HUD therefore recommended that Smithtown rescind the residency preference.
Smithtown nonetheless continues to use the residency preference.
Further, an independent HUD review of Smithtown's Section 8 program in 1997 revealed that the residency preference was an impediment to fair housing and recommended that Smithtown rescind the residency preference because of its racially exclusionary effect.
In derogation of its affirmative fair housing obligations, Smithtown continues to use the residency preference with clear knowledge of its racially exclusionary effect."

On February 15, 2012, Judge Arthur D. Spatt granted defendant County's motion for summary judgment dismissing all claims against it. 

On April 22, 2014, Judge Spatt issued a final order for the plaintiffs and ordered Defendant Garden City to take a number of steps to prevent discrimination and to increase access to affordable housing. After Judge Spatt's order, both parties appealed the decision. The Second Circuit affirmed in part and remanded in part. The case is back in the lower courts on remand. On remand, Judge Spatt found that the plaintiffs had met their burden at trial in demonstrating that the Garden City’s proffered reasons for its chosen zoning change could have been met by another practice, such as R-M zoning, that had a less discriminatory effect. Magistrate Judge Arlene R. Lindsay thereafter awarded plaintiffs $5,255,108.94 in attorneys fees and costs from Garden City. On March 15, 2019, Judge Spatt signed the parties’ stipulation of discontinuance with prejudice, except without prejudice as to the court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of interpretation or enforcement of the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement required the County to pay $5,400,000 to the plaintiffs to be used for the purpose of furthering and promoting mixed-income affordable housing; $120,000 to NYCC to be used for activities related to fair and affordable housing; and $400,000 to plaintiffs’ counsel for attorneys’ fees.

For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that the Plaintiffs met their burden at trial in demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Garden City’s proffered reasons for its chosen zoning change could have been met by another practice that had a less discriminatory effect.
The Second Circuit’s Decision On March 23, 2016, the Second Circuit issued its decision.
By Memorandum and Order dated February 15, 2012, Judge Spatt granted the County’s motion for summary judgment dismissing all claims against it; denied the Garden City Defendants’ motion for summary judgment and granted NYCC’s motion to amend.
On May 5, 2014, the Garden City Defendants appealed the final judgment to the Second Circuit.
Plaintiffs filed their first motion for attorneys’ fees on May 15, 2014 (“Initial Application”).

On Feb. 20, 2015, the Court granted a preliminary injunction. Defendants ended the policy in May 2015. This case is now administratively closed. If the defendants reinstate a policy of considering deterrence in determining whether to detain a family, they must notify the court and the plaintiffs may move to administratively reopen the case.

Plaintiffs and the class of individuals they seek to represent have all been detained pursuant to the No-Release Policy.
DHS primarily uses its family detention facilities to detain adult mothers and their children under the age of 18.

Certify this case as a class action lawsuit, as proposed herein, appoint Plaintiffs as class representatives, and appoint the undersigned counsel as class counsel; b.
This Opinion now follows.
When moving for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff “bear[s] the burdens of production and persuasion.”
The Court, accordingly, is satisfied that ICE has a policy of taking deterrence of mass migration into account in making custody determinations, and that such consideration has played a significant role in the large number of Central American families detained since June 2014, including the named Plaintiffs.
The named Plaintiffs acknowledge, as they must, that they have all been released.
Emphasizing that Plaintiffs have been unable to establish a categorical No-Release Policy, Defendants argue that a class action is an improper vehicle to challenge Plaintiffs’ alternative articulation of the relevant policy – to wit, that ICE treats deterrence of mass immigration as a factor in making custody determinations.
DHS’s policy of considering deterrence has profound and immediate consequences for Central American asylum seekers detained as a result.
Defendants have provided no additional evidence to rehabilitate their theory.
Upon completion of briefing, the Court will issue its ruling on Plaintiffs’ motion to reinstate the preliminary injunction.
Since that time, R.I.L.R., J.L.S., and K.L.S."

As non-citizen soldiers serving honorably during wartime, Plaintiffs have an absolute statutory right to apply to become naturalized U.S. citizens, but Defendants are refusing to certify their naturalization application eligibility as required by law, leaving these soldiers to languish in immigration limbo, notwithstanding their ongoing military service to this Nation.

Additionally, under Section 18, effective July 1, 2011, she will not be able to use her CID for identification without being subject to a civil infraction.
She has a removal order, which was issued against her by an immigration court in 1996.

Thus, the challenged statutory provisions—allegedly allowing arrests without probable cause and creating civil sanctions for the use of consular identification—are matter of state policy.
The plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment against the City.
Given summary judgment against the City of Indianapolis (and all other defendants).
Factual Background On May 25, 2011, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the recently enacted Senate Enrolled Act 590 (SEA 590), which was adopted by the Indiana General Assembly and originally scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2011.
As written, Section 20 authorizes state and local law enforcement officers to make a warrantless arrest of a person if the officer has a removal order issued by an immigration court, a detainer or notice of action issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or probable cause to believe that the person has been indicted for or convicted of at least one aggravated felony.
For example, USCIS prohibits the use of consular identification cards for purposes of the I-9 Employment Eligibility Form.
The Act specifically permits the use of a pa ssport issued by the government of a foreign state for identification purposes.
The Complaint in this class action challenges the constitutionality of Section 18 (currently codified at Indiana Code § 34-28-8.2) and Section 20 (currently codified at Indiana Code § 35-33-1(1)(a)(11)-(13)) of the 2011 Senate Enrolled Act (“SEA”) 590.1 On June 24, 2011, our court entered a preliminary injunction in favor of Plaintiffs enjoining Defendants from enforcing Sections 18 and 20 until further order of the Court.
On November 20, 2011, Plaintiffs filed their motion for summary judgment and supporting memorandum.
On April 20, 2012, Plaintiffs filed their reply in support of their motion for summary judgment, at which point the motion was fully briefed.

Clearly, such is the case here.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Denis R. Hurley, Judge).
On May 18, 2010, two organizations of day laborers sued the Town and its Supervisor (together, “the Town”) in the district court, seeking to enjoin the town from enforcing the ordinance on the ground that the ordinance violated their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection of the laws.
Following that meeting, the Town Board proposed an ordinance (hereinafter, “the Ordinance”) intended to prohibit the solicitation of labor from the town’s streets and sidewalks.
(4) Award the Plaintiffs attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1988; and (5) Grant any other relief the Court deems appropriate.
Thereafter, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Second Circuit, and the Second Circuit affirmed this Court’s decision but emphasized that this Court retained the power to reconsider the preliminary injunction or to leave it in place.
Accordingly, their motion for summary judgment is denied III.
(4) The Ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague and does not violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments.
at *3.
The plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss defendants’ counterclaims is granted.
These residents' ability to seek work has been significantly curtailed by the recent passage of Chapter 205.32 of the Code of the Town of Oyster Bay (the ""Ordinance""), which unlawfully prohibits speech related to employment and was enacted specifically in response to and as a result of discriminatory community animus regarding this group of workers, 2.

The claim was that DHS lacked the authority to confer “lawful[] presen[ce]” and the Fifth Circuit agreed.
6 Id.
DHS is an “agency” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), and the September 5, 2017 memorandum from Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke rescinding DACA is an “agency action” subject to judicial review.
In 2012, the Department of Homeland Security created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (""DACA"") program.
however, so the court may not consider it.
The court agrees in part and disagrees in part.
DHS’s decision to rescind DACA was arbitrary and capricious under the APA Pp.
The Department’s Acting Secretary issued a memorandum terminating the program on that basis.
It is so ordered.
Two District Courts granted a preliminary nationwide injunction, while the third vacated the rescission.
Accordingly, DACA is substantively unlawful.
Shortly thereafter, one of the nearly 700 federal district court judges blocked this rescission, and since then, this issue has been mired in litigation.
On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that Duke’s 2017 rescission of DACA was arbitrary and capricious under the APA."

Public officials who do not comply face removal.
The House considered SB 4 on April 26, 2017.
SB 4 passed the Texas House and was sent to the Senate.
SB 4 never defines “Sanctuary City” or “Sanctuary Jurisdiction”.
It does not define “pattern or practice” in relation to a material limitation or prohibition of federal immigration laws.
SB 4’s requirement that local law enforcement comply with federal authorities in the enforcement of immigration laws does have a discriminatory purpose.
SB4 is in disharmony with the United States Constitution, federal immigration law, and all other federal laws.

This action seeks to enhance public understanding of an urgent concern: discrimination in immigration enforcement against Muslims, Latinos, and other members of disfavored groups by the U.S. Department of State (“DOS”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”).
The requests seek disclosure of agency policies, communications, and statistics related to visa processing and visa issuances for individuals applying abroad; to adjudication of entry document applications; and to screening and searching of individuals arriving at U.S. ports of entry.
The requests are not limited to policies, communications, and statistics produced pursuant to, or as a result of, the President’s travel ban orders, but encompass immigration enforcement policies broadly.
Plaintiffs are concerned that in recent months, either as a result of the travel ban orders or otherwise, Defendants have been targeting individuals based on their actual or perceived religion, ethnicity, race, national origin, and/or other group identity for special treatment with respect to entry document applications, visa processing, and screening of individuals arriving at U.S. ports of entry.

For more than seventeen years, Muhammad Salah (“Salah”), a U.S. citizen residing in Bridgeview, Illinois, has lived under an unprecedented “embargo” imposed on him by the U.S. Department of Treasury in August 1995, when it designated him a “Specially Designated Terrorist.”
Upon information and belief, Salah is the only U.S. citizen residing in the United States subject to such a designation.
There is no endpoint to the designation and its restrictions.
Salah seeks a declaration that these actions violate the Constitution and federal statutes, and an injunction against their enforcement and ordering his removal from the list of “Specially Designated Terrorists.”
Defendant United States Department of the Treasury is an agency of the United States.
Defendants’ designation of Salah as a Specially Designated Terrorist imposes extremely severe restrictions on Salah."

The HIG's primary goal would be the collection of intelligence to protect national security.
The HIG should also ensure that the research would focus on the most difficult cases and issues.

There have also been cases where assurances have been used successfully.
Particularly in ~he context of a multi-faceted bilateral relationship, a country may have a far greater incentive to live up to a specific bilateral assurance than to its obligations under the CAT generally.
The specific form of monitoring may depend on the circumstances.

This recommendation is to implement this policy directive.
Another high profile removal case is the case of Maher Arar.
The policies, which dealt with such subjects as the detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects and the expanded use of surveillance, are of significant public interest because they attempt to balance national security with the protection of civil liberties and compliance with the law.

The District Court for the District of Columbia held that the Secretary did act in an arbitrary and capricious manner because he failed to analyze whether the demonstrations would promote the primary objective of Medicaid—to furnish medical assistance.
We granted the unopposed motion.
The district court entered final judgment on April 4, 2019, and the Secretary filed a notice of appeal on April 10, 2019.
In short, we agree with the district court that the alternative objectives of better health outcomes and beneficiary independence are not consistent with Medicaid.
The text of the statute includes one primary purpose, which is providing health care coverage without any restriction geared to healthy outcomes, financial independence or transition to commercial coverage.
In this situation, the loss of coverage for beneficiaries is an important aspect of the demonstration approval because coverage is a principal objective of Medicaid and because commenters raised concerns about the loss of coverage.
Failure to consider whether the project will result in coverage loss is arbitrary and capricious.
CONCLUSION Because the Secretary’s approval of Arkansas Works was arbitrary and capricious, we affirm the district court’s judgment vacating the Secretary’s approval.
The work requirement does not apply to pregnant women or medically frail individuals."

The primary issue before this Court is whether the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs and members of their olase are being violated by their incarceration at Sonera, a Connecticut state prison which is egregiously overcrowded, unsanitary, lacking in aeouxity, and unable to provide adequately the basics of general human living needs.
The violations of constitutional rights alleged by the facts in this complaint axe common to all members of the class.
The defendants' failure to provide an adequate system of mediaal and mental health care services delivery violates plaintiffs' and members of their class rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States constitution."

Class action plaintiffs in this case, inmates at the Occoquan facilities, won a judgment based on violations of the Eighth Amendment.
I A Seventeen inmates of Occoquan filed this class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1982), alleging that conditions at the prison violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
On December 22, 1986, the District Court filed its opinion and accompanying order entering judgment in plaintiffs' favor.
The judiciary is to be cautious in the sensitive terrain of the Eighth Amendment.
In September, the District court found that the District had deliberately failed to obey its orders concerning overcrowding at the Jail and held the District in civil contempt.
The case lives on.
Plaintiffs, inmates confined at the District of Columbia's Occoquan Facility of the Lorton Correctional Complex, brought this action claiming violations of their eighth amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.
The population of the Occoquan Facility has risen steadily since the initial trial in 1986.
On November 26, 1986, the population at Occoquan had risen to 1,637 Id.
He stated that ""[t]he condition had deteriorated since 1986.""

Royal states that in September 2001, he was advised by a nurse employed by CMS that he had HCV and liver damage.
DISCUSSION This Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over cases that are moot and, therefore, we first address the issue of whether Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief is justiciable if Defendants have adopted current Federal Bureau of Prison (“FBOP”) guidelines for the management of HCV, and if all NJDOC inmates have been “back-screened.”
The care and treatment of all HCV inmates is closely tracked.
The NJDOC monitors the HCV care and treatment given to inmates and CMS is subject to contractual penalties if it does not comply with its contract.
Therefore, we deny Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive and declaratory relief as moot.
Lacey argues that inmates entered the New Jersey Prisons who were unscreened for HCV, and uneducated about prevention and treatment of the virus.
This evidence suggests that some action on the part of prison officials is appropriate.
Plaintiffs maintain that the claims of the class members are identical since they are seeking compensatory damages for constitutional violations, punitive damages and injunctive relief all arising from Defendants’ common HCV policies and practices in New Jersey State prisons.
In considering a motion for summary judgment, a district court may not make credibility determinations or engage in any weighing of the evidence; instead, the non-moving party's evidence “is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.”
Hayman also notes that in the 1990's and early 2000's, there was confusion within the scientific community on how to detect and treat HCV and available medical treatment options evolved over time.

Jewish prisoners at WSP, as well as Muslim prisoners, have been adversely impacted by Defendants' ""twenty-minute"" rule.
Both Jewish and Muslim prisoners have grieved the rule through the prison's administrative grievance process, to no avail.
The rules apply to all, even those.

Defendant Michael Murphy is the Warden of WSP, and Defendant Robert Lampert is the Director of the Wyoming Department of Corrections (""WDOC"").
As a result, the instant lawsuit was filed on April 3, 2008.
On April 5, 2008, for instance, Correctional Officer Fuller confiscated meals served to Plaintiffs Miller and Purdiman.
While they waited for their religious meals to be delivered, all prisoners were sent to their cells to be counted.
Defendants' ""twenty-minute"" rule punishes Plaintiffs for engaging in practices required by their religious precepts.
First, Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their case.

PN-CA-0018,"On June 26, 2003, two separate suits were filed against the City of Oakland and the Oakland Police Department (OPD), and related defendants, in federal court. The suits were filed in response to the OPD's actions on April 7 at a peaceful antiwar demonstration at the Port of Oakland. The Police, without giving sufficient notice to disperse and without provocation, barraged demonstrators with a variety of ""less-lethal"" munitions, while blocking the main exit routes. Police pursued demonstrators and others present when they attempted to disperse, while continuing to fire at them and intentionally strike them with motorcycles. On August 11, 2003, the Court ordered that the cases be officially related and heard before the same judge. One of the two cases, Local 10 ILWU v. City of Oakland, was filed as a class-action on behalf of all persons who attended the April 7 demonstration. The suit also named as plaintiffs Local 10 of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, plus nine of its members who were ""standing by"" in the vicinity of the demonstration but not active participants in it. The other suit, Coles v. City of Oakland, sought relieve for several individual demonstrators who were allegedly injured by the OPD. In both cases, Plaintiffs sought compensatory, exemplary, and punitive damages, as well as to recover legal costs. They also sought declaratory judgments holding the Defendants' actions to be unlawful violations of the Plaintiffs' rights under the Constitutions of the U.S. and of California and of statutory law. They sought injunctions that among other things would prohibit the Defendants from unlawfully interference with the constitutional and statutory rights of participants in public demonstrations and protests.

Oakland adopted a new official Crowd Control Policy that forbade the police from dispersing crowds that had not behaved illegally or that did not pose a clear and present danger of imminent violence. It also forbade the indiscriminate use of less-lethal weapons directly against crowds, even when specific individuals in the group were violent.

On March 4, 2019, HHS published a Final Rule, scheduled to go into effect on May 3, 2019, which would alter longstanding regulations governing Title X grants for family planning services. Washington sought declaratory and injunctive relief to invalidate the Final Rule and prohibit HHS from implementing or enforcing it, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. On March 18, 2019, this case was consolidated for pretrial proceedings with a separate case filed by the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA; a national membership organization of Title X providers that operate or administer more than 3,500 health centers providing family planning services to more than 3.7 million patients each year), a Washington-based NFPRHA member organization, and two health care professionals, challenging the same HHS Rule on behalf of themselves and their patients.

Washington and the NFPRHA parties filed preliminary injunctions on March 22, 2019, seeking to prohibit HHS from implementing the Final Rule. Judge Bastian granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Final Rule nationwide until further order of the court.

On May 3, 2019, defendants filed a notice of appeal and motion to stay the preliminary injunction, as well as a notice of interlocutory and preliminary injunction appeal regarding plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction.

On June 20, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a three-judge panel per curiam decision granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit noted that the Final Rule was challenged in federal court in California, Oregon, and Washington (this case), and district courts in each case granted plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions on nearly identical grounds. HHS appealed in each case and sought to stay the injunctions pending a decision of the merits of its appeals. The panel found that HHS was likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and that the remaining factors also favored a stay pending appeal. 

On June 25, 2019, plaintiffs in the Oregon and Washington cases filed an emergency motion for reconsideration en banc regarding the stay. On July 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that the three cases (California, Oregon, and Washington) be reheard en banc, and that the motions for stay pending appeal granted by the Ninth Circuit panel would not be cited as precedent by or to any court of the Ninth Circuit. 

On July 11, 2019, the Ninth Circuit en banc court denied the motions for administrative stay of the three-judge panel’s order granting defendant’s motion to stay pending appeal. The en banc court stated they would proceed expeditiously to rehear and reconsider the merits of Defendant-Appellants’ motions for stay of the district courts’ preliminary injunction orders pending consideration of the appeals on the merits.

Introduction Plaintiff Barbara Grutter commenced this action in December 1997 Ms. Grutter alleges that in 1996 she applied for admission to the University of Michigan Law School (hereinafter “the law school”).
First, she claims that defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her race, thereby violating her rights to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.2 This claim is brought under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983.
Davis’ quota system was not narrowly tailored to serve this interest.
Davis’ quota system unconstitutional.
The court finds and declares that the University of Michigan Law School’s use of race in its admissions decisions violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

EE-IL-0330,"The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit against Yellow Transportation, Inc., and YRC, Inc., for discriminatory employment practices on behalf of 14 current or former black employees and the class of similarly situated black employees. The EEOC alleged that Yellow Transportation (later merged into YRC) had violated §703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) by subjecting black employees to greater scrutiny, more frequent and greater discipline, lower paying and less favorable job assignments, more difficult and time-consuming work, and a hostile work environment. The EEOC sought injunctive and monetary relief, including economic and noneconomic harm to the employees, punitive damages, development of policies and programs to provide equal employment opportunity and eradicate the effects of its past discrimination.

NOVEMBER 15,
Plaintiffs’ claim for damages does not predominate over their claim for injunctive relief.
This action is properly maintainable as a class action also because questions of law and fact common to the members of the class predominate over questions affecting only the individual members.
Defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of disparate discipline with respect to African-American police officers.
Upon information and belief, the BPD has never petitioned to have a police officer’s bail revoked.
Upon information and belief, this charge was filed against Plaintiff Carter for opposing racial discrimination in the BPD.
Plaintiff Carlos Perry has been subjected to discrimination on the basis of his race and/or color in the form of disparate discipline and a hostile work environment.
Plaintiff Perry timely filed this action.
On or about December 15, 2004, Plaintiff Ellison timely filed a charge of discrimination with the CRC.
Upon information and belief, the discipline charges filed against Plaintiff Ellison were filed in retaliation for Plaintiff Ellison filing his December 2004 CRC charge."

Trump; Eugene Scalia, United States Secretary of Labor; and the United States Department of Labor (collectively, “Defendants”) for violations of the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
This censorship of Plaintiffs’ speech by the federal government is anathema to a free democracy.
Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States.
In that capacity, he issued the EO 13950 challenged in this lawsuit.
EO 13950 imposes the inaccurate and ahistorical viewpoints of the Trump Administration on federal contractors and grantees simply because President Trump disagrees with the Protected Speech.
EO 13950 sets forth similar restrictions for federal grant recipients.
EO 13950 also threatens the prospect of enforcement against those who express viewpoints that the Trump Administration disfavors.

SB 20 mandates that state and local law enforcement officers investigate the immigration status of any individual they stop, detain, or arrest whenever they have a “reasonable suspicion” that the individual lacks immigration status.
SB 20 also creates a South Carolina-specific alien registration scheme, allowing state and local law enforcement officers to arrest individuals simply for failing to carry with them certain registration documents.
Some members are U.S. citizens while others are undocumented.
The majority of its members are Latino.
Under threat of civil liability, law enforcement agencies will be compelled to enforce the provisions in SB 20 to the full extent possible, even where discretion in enforcement is permitted.

On January 5, 2015, the parties executed a settlement agreement for dismissal of the matter, in which the PDOC agreed to implement certain improvements and to pay $750,000 to DRN.  In particular, the PDOC will evaluate all incoming prisoners for serious mental illness, and will place prisoners with serious mental illness in solitary confinement only in ""exceptional"" circumstances; even then, a prisoner with serious mental illness can be kept in solitary confinement for no longer than 30 days and must be allowed out of their cells for 20 hours per week. The settlement also provided for a monitor to report on compliance, and will remain in effect for 3 years (less if the defendant demonstrates substantial compliance for a period of 18 months). There has been no activity on the docket since May 2015 and the case is presumably closed since the three year time period set in the agreement has lapsed. ","Pennsylvania Department of Corrections

The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
Dear Judge Jones: Undersigned counsel write to inform the Court that the parties executed a Settlement Agreement in the above captioned matter on January 5, 2015.
RHU prisoners are permitted three showers per week.
RHU prisoners must eat every meal in their cells.
Prison guards strip-search and handcuff RHU prisoners, and at times shackle their feet and legs, before allowing them out of their cells for any activity.
Mentally ill prisoners languish in Pennsylvania’s RHUs, however, for months and even years at a time.
Although DOC policy requires a psychologist or psychiatrist to interview and assess any prisoner remaining in solitary confinement in administrative custody for more than 30 days, and every 90 days if confinement continues, in practice any such assessment recommending the removal of a mentally ill prisoner from the RHU is ignored.
As of December 2012, SSNUs had space for only 141 of the approximately 800 prisoners with serious mental illness in RHUs in all DOC facilities.
Prisoner #3 74.
He has been treated for serious mental illness since he was a child.
He has been in prison for over 20 years.
This treatment cannot be provided in an RHU."

The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, by policy and practice, systematically denies necessary medical care for inmates with serious eye conditions including severe cataracts, thereby condemning them to partial or total blindness.
There is no medical justification for the “One Good Eye” policy.
Defendant Hyde’s conclusion, on multiple occasions, that Mr. Hollihan failed to meet the criteria for a cataract surgery and denial of cataract surgery based on the “One Good Eye” policy constitutes deliberate indifference to Mr. Hollihan’s serious medical need thereby violating his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment as proscribed by the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
Defendant Robinson’s awareness of Mr. Hollihan’s need for cataract surgery and refusal to approve this necessary medical treatment constitutes deliberate indifference to Mr. Hollihan’s serious medical need, thereby violating his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment as proscribed by the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

Thereafter, the Court entered a Final Judgment by which the case was dismissed with prejudice.
In their Motion, Plaintiffs argue that the Court erred in finding that Eleventh Amendment immunity barred their claim for declaratory relief because the relief they requested was prospective in nature, i.e. they sought to remedy an on-going violation of the Mississippi Readmission Act of 1870.
They filed suit against multiple state officials in 2017, alleging that the current version of the Mississippi Constitution violates the “school rights and privileges” condition of the Mississippi Readmission Act.

The Plaintiffs allege that they were discharged from their duties in the Air Force due to their HIV status. The case was assigned to Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.  On January 11, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to  prevent the defendants from restricting Roe and Voe and others similarly situated from being promoted, changing duty station, or re-training on the same terms as other service members living with HIV who are not being separated.  A hearing was held before Judge Brinkema on February 15, 2019. The same day, Judge Brinkema issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.

/s/ Phil Telfeyan Attorney for Plaintiffs
The City of McCrory has enacted an ordinance prohibiting the placement of mobile homes within the City unless the owners show at their own cost that the trailers have a value of at least $7,500.
The McCrory City Council passed and approved the ordinance on September 12, 2016, less than one week after they moved their mobile home into McCrory.
No justification is given for the wealth-based provision.
The only clear way for Plaintiffs to stop the fines is to leave the city.
Plaintiffs are restrained from living in the only home they can afford.
• Do the City of McCrory and Police Chief Paul Hatch impose fines upon residents living in mobile homes worth less than $7,500?
• Does the Trailer-Banishment Ordinance deter indigent residents from living in McCrory or cause indigent residents to leave McCrory?"

Dr. Al Homssi is a resident in Internal Medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago/Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn, Illinois.
On January 18, 2017, Dr. Al Homssi returned to the United Arab Emirates to get married, which he did on January 23, 2017.
The U.S. Officers then informed Dr. Al Homssi that he could not board his flight because he was not able to return to the United States based upon President Trump’s Executive Order.
The U.S. Officers also told Dr. Al Homssi that it might be 90 days or longer before he could ever expect to board a flight to the U.S Dr. Al Homssi now finds himself unable to return to his residency program at UIC, and if he cannot complete this program he faces the risk of being excluded from the UAE and forced to return to war-torn Syria—where he has not been since he was 17 years old on vacation, and where he has never lived.
Amer Al Homssi, Plaintiff, is a citizen of Syria.
He also holds legal residency in the United Arab Emirates.
Despite being currently domiciled in Oak Lawn, Illinois, and in possession of a valid J-1 visa issued to complete his residency at the University of Illinois College of Medicine/Christ Advocate Hospital, Plaintiff was briefly detained at Abu Dhabi International Airport on Sunday, January 29, 2017, and subsequently refused entry onto an Etihad Airways flight bound for Chicago, O’Hare International Airport.
According to the terms of the EO, therefore, the “entry into the United States” of non-citizens from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen is “suspended” from 90 days from the date of the EO.
Plaintiff arrived in the United States to complete his residency in internal medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago/Christ Advocate Hospital on August 2, 2016.
At U.S. Pre-Clearance, Dr. Al Homssi spoke with a U.S. Pre-Clearance security officer Dr. Al Homssi explained that he was returning to Chicago to continue his medical residency.
30 Dr. Al Homssi is currently in the UAE and his J-1 visa has been cancelled.
He is expected at work at the University of Illinois Chicago/Christ Advocate Hospital to be on duty as a resident doctor tomorrow, Tuesday, February 1, 2017.
This is a clear violation of the Establishment Clause.
If Dr. Al Homssi is denied reentry into the United States to complete his medical residency, he will be excluded from the UAE and forced to return to war-torn Syria, where he has never lived.
Defendants’ actions in seeking to effectively return Plaintiff to Syria, taken pursuant to the EO, deprive Plaintiff of his rights under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b) and the Convention Against Torture without due process of law.

The marriage ban inflicts serious and irreparable harm on same-sex couples and their children.
Because the freedom to marry is one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men and women, Veronica and Mayra seek equal access to the freedom to marry for same-sex couples and recognition of legal marriages performed in other states as the only means to secure their rights to due process and equal protection of the law, and to eliminate the myriad serious harms inflicted on Plaintiffs by the marriage ban and Defendants’ enforcement of it.
No legitimate — let alone important or compelling — interest exists to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages.
They were married in the State of Illinois on March 7, 2014.
The Indiana marriage ban is unconstitutional.
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”
Enforcement and/or defense of the marriage ban violates Veronica’s and Mayra’s fundamental right to marry and the rights protected under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to liberty, dignity, autonomy, family integrity, association, and due process of Plaintiffs."

PB-NY-0003,"This class action was about whether the City of New York improperly denied federally sponsored cash assistance to qualified New York City residents under a program implemented by the city in the late 1990s. The plaintiffs each claimed to be qualified welfare beneficiaries who had been improperly denied assistance by one of New York City’s new job centers in violation of the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process, the city’s obligations under 7 U.S.C. §2020 (the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—then referred to as Food Stamps) and 42 U.S.C. §1396 (Medicaid), in addition to violating state law; the plaintiffs sought class certification for all similarly situated New York City residents, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 16, 1998, with Judge William H. Pauley presiding. The court entered a temporary restraining order on the same day directing the city to provide emergency food stamps and cash assistance to the named plaintiffs. The court granted a preliminary injunction in-part to the plaintiffs on January 21, 1999. The court ordered the city to (1) allow applicants for public assistance to apply for benefits the first day they visit a job center, (2) cease conversion of income support centers to job centers without a formal hearing, (3) make eligibility requirements for food stamps and Medicaid separately from the eligibility determination from cash assistance, (4) send applicants timely notice of the city’s decision on whether they qualify for benefits, and (5) form a corrective plan for achieving its policy goals while also meeting the needs of public assistance applicants. The city moved to vacate the preliminary injunction on December 10, 1999, after procuring more evidence surrounding the efficacy of the job centers in achieving their welfare obligations. Meanwhile, the State of New York moved to dismiss the complaint against them for failure to state a claim. Judge Pauley denied both motions and granted the plaintiff’s motion for class certification on July 21, 2000. 

The court entered a permanent injunction in favor of the plaintiffs on December 30, 2004. The permanent injunction directed both the city and state to: (i) provide expedited food stamp service to eligible applications within 7 days; (ii) separately process applications for food stamps when the applications for cash assistance are denied or withdrawn; (iii) send notices to applicants confirming voluntary withdrawals for Medicaid in accord with 42 C.F.R. 435.913 and document such withdrawals pursuant to 7 C.F.R. 273.2(c)(6); and (iv) provide adequate and timely notice by correctly completing certain documentation. The injunction also required the state to supervise the city and make sure it met the obligations of the injunction. On January 13, 2005, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the part of the December order in which the court concluded that 8 N.Y.C.R.R. § 387.8(a)(2)(i)(a) did not confer a privately enforceable right of action and that plaintiffs’ claim under New York Social Services Law § 133 was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court granted the motion on February 14, 2005. Final judgement was entered on December 14, 2005; the court also granted the plaintiffs declaratory judgment.

Both the state and the city appealed the permanent injunction to the Second Circuit on January 12, 2006, but the city dropped its appeal. On October 31, 2007, the Second Circuit reversed the district court, ruling that the state did not have a non-delegable duty to administer the decentralized Medicaid and Food Stamp programs, the state’s efforts in supervising the city since the permanent injunction was issued were adequate, and the district court exceeded its authority by issuing a permanent injunction in light of New York State’s affirmative supervisory steps it had taken to assure compliance. In a series of stipulations and orders from January 31, 2007 to July 22, 2011, the City of New York agreed to pay a total of $2,920,675.94 to plaintiffs for attorney fees and costs sought; the state agreed to pay a further $639,918.98.
