Arrest warrants for Hamilton County children are issued by the Juvenile Court.
The Rules of Practice of the Hamilton County Juvenile Court do not explicitly require or prescribe procedures for conducting a probable cause determination in delinquency cases.
The Juvenile Court conducts detention hearings to determine whether a child's continued detention is required within 72 hours of arrest.
Some youth are held in detention beyond that time.
The Juvenile Court did not make a probable cause determination prior to issuing an arrest warrant for S.W.
nor within 48 hours of his admission to the Detention Center.
This lack of due process has fundamentally harmed S.W.
There was no probable cause determination at arrest or subsequent detention at the Detention Center.
This lack of due process has fundamentally harmed L.D.
Because the Juvenile Court does not make probable cause findings within 48 hours of detention as constitutionally required, each of the children annually arrested and detained at the Detention Center are at risk of the same due process deprivations.
The standard procedures and practices promulgated by the Hamilton County Juvenile Court and Detention Center violate the liberty interests of children by issuing improper warrants, authorizing the arrest and detention of children without any procedural safeguards or due process whatsoever."

MINUTE ORDER. The parties must file another joint status report by December 3,
Civil Action No. 18-0871 (ABJ) MEMORANDUM OPINION Plaintiff Arab American Institute has sued the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq Compl.
Plaintiff requested documents in connection with whether “Middle Eastern and North African” would be included as a race reporting category on the 2020 Census.
OMB conducted a search and released a number of records to plaintiff, but it withheld 161 documents in full pursuant to FOIA Exemption 5.
On January 31, 2020, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.
The Census Bureau needed to make a decision on the design of the race and ethnicity questions by December 31, 2017 in order to prepare for the 2020 Census Jan.
On April 13, 2018, plaintiff filed this lawsuit, see Compl., and on May 18, 2018, the Court ordered OMB to file a report setting forth a production schedule by June 15, 2018.
On March 12, 2020, plaintiff opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.
On May 13, 2020, the parties filed a joint status report stating that they had resolved their dispute as to four of the nine documents.
When considering a motion for summary judgment under FOIA, the court must conduct a de novo review of the record.
CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant defendant’s motion for summary judgment, and it will deny plaintiff’s cross-motion for summary judgment.
Announced on January 26, 2018, USCB stated it will not use a combined question format for race and ethnicity, and will not include a separate 'Middle Eastern or North African' (""MENA"") category.
Therefore, by failing to release the records specifically requested by the Plaintiff, defendant OMB had violated FOIA."

IM-CA-0104,"This lawsuit, filed by the City of Los Angeles on Sept. 29, 2017 challenged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)'s imposition of immigration-related conditions on federal funding to the city. Plaintiff filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

Los Angeles receives federal funding through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) Program and the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, both administered by DOJ and its component agencies Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The latest DOJ requirements for FY2017 program funding imposed new conditions on recipient cities, including Los Angeles. One condition was compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that a local government entity cannot prohibit or restrict communication between government entities or officials and federal immigration authorities. The other two conditions required recipients to allow the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to access any correctional or detention facility and question suspected undocumented immigrants about their right to be in the U.S., and to provide DHS at least 48 hours advance notice of any noncitizen's scheduled release from custody. 
After several lawsuits challenged these conditions, the federal government was preliminarily enjoined from imposing them on Byrne JAG funding in City of Chicago v. Session. DOJ continued to revise these conditions, but Los Angeles believed the revised requirements were ambiguous. 

Both parties moved for partial summary judgment, and the court granted Los Angeles' motion. On April 11, 2018, Judge Real held that the challenged conditions exceeded DOJ's legal authority (as federal power infringing on the state police power), in violation of the Spending Clause (because Congress did not unambiguously condition grant receipt on local compliance with federal authorities for a matter not reasonably related to COPS's goal), and in violation of the APA (as arbitrary and capricious without a reasonable basis). Judge Real then permanently enjoined DOJ from imposing the challenged conditions nationwide. The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit. 

On Sept. 13, 2018, Judge Real granted Los Angeles' application for a preliminary injunction. The court held that the statutes in question gave ""no indication that DOJ is authorized to add civil immigration conditions"" and that Congress did not grant the attorney general authority to impose such conditions. The court also held that Los Angeles faced irreparable harm because it was forced to make ""an impossible choice: either it must certify compliance with unconstitutional and unlawful directives that impinge on the City's sovereignty, damage community trust, and harm public safety, or it will lose congressionally authorized Byrne JAG funding."" The government appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit, which then docketed the appeal as No. 18-56292. Four days later, the district court denied the government's motion to dismiss. The court held that the City had plausibly stated claims that the new funding conditions were ultra vires, and also violated the separation of powers, the spending clause, and the APA.

These 5 conditions infringe upon the state police power.

On April 29, 2011, Judge Emmitt G. Sullivan of the District Court granted a final approval of the settlement agreement, in which the USDA agreed to revise policies to prevent further discrimination and create a compensatory fund of $680,000,000, from which claimants could bring evidence of discrimination in order to receive a monetary reward up to $250,000. On August 30, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed a status report notifying the court that the claims process had concluded, but that approximately $380,000,000 remained available for cy pres distribution. On December 14, 2015, the Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to modify the settlement agreement’s cy pres provision. The proposed modification provided for (1) a supplemental award of $18,500 to each claimant who prevailed in the original claims process, and (2) an amended process through which $38,000,000 of cy pres funds were to be distributed.

This is an action under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 552 et seq., seeking declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief to compel the Defendants, the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) (collectively “Defendants”), to produce agency records that have been improperly withheld from Plaintiffs, Color of Change (“COC”) and the Center for Constitutional Rights (“CCR”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”).
Plaintiffs’ submitted a FOIA request to Defendants on July 5, 2016, seeking records related to federal government surveillance and monitoring of protest activities related to the Movement for Black Lives (“MBL”).
Government documents, news reports, and first-hand accounts demonstrate that Defendants and state and local law enforcement agencies (“LEAs”) have engaged in the surveillance and monitoring of MBL demonstrations and individual activists aligned with the movement.
Monitoring MBL’s legitimate protest activities with the same surveillance methods used to target and disrupt potential terrorists undermines the First Amendment’s robust protection of political speech.

It was filed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus (to seek immediate release of plaintiffs from detention) and a civil complaint, on behalf of two individuals and the class of ""all individuals with refugee applications approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas, and other individuals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen legally authorized to enter the United States, but who have been or will be denied entry to the United States on the basis of the January 27, 2017 Executive Order.""

The complaint argued that their continued detention based solely on the executive order violated their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights, and exceeded the government's authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act.

At 7:30 pm the day the matter was filed, Judge Donnelly heard an emergency motion to stay all removals (that is, deportations) under the order. After a hearing, she granted a nationwide stay of removals to all members of the class. Judge Donnelly also required the defendants to provide a list of all individuals detained as a result of the EO. 

The case was randomly reassigned to Judge Carol Bagley Amon on January 30, 2017. On Feb. 2, Judge Amon extended the TRO to Feb. 21, 2017 for good cause shown. 

On Feb. 7, the plaintiffs moved for the court to enforce its Jan. 28 order, which had directed the government to provide the plaintiffs' counsel with a list of all individuals detained pursuant to the EO, including individuals previously released or removed.

On Feb. 8, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' petition and complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The defendants' motion also opposed the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.

The Federal District Court granted the defendant's motion for summary on the grounds that, because the state's guardianship scheme required individualized determination of a person's abilities and qualifications to vote, it did not violate the federal constitution or statutes.

The district court granted summary judgment to the defendant state officials on the basis of a conclusion that Missouri law does not categorically disenfranchise individuals under full guardianship.
That determination directly conflicts with the plain text of the state’s constitution and statutes.

The Complaint accused the defendants of instructing staff not to show newly renovated apartments to minority and family tenants, steering them to less desirable buildings, demanding proof of citizenship, asking them not to speak to one another in their first language, requiring stricter application requirements, and refusing services.

STATEMENT OF FACTS 20.
The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (""the Parole Board"") determined by majority vote on September 24, 2002, that Meza was required to receive sex-offender treatment.
Meza filed this lawsuit on December 5, 2005, alleging that Defendant parole officers, Collier and Livingston, violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”) and his constitutional rights.
Meza alleges that he has not been given the same opportunities as other supervisees to acquire a job, obtain a driver’s license, or receive education such that his rights under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment have been violated.
Initially, it falls to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the government practice complained of imposes a “substantial burden” on his religious exercise.
He has been convicted of murder.
Id The court held that Ohio's Supermax-assignment procedures complied with dueprocess requirements Id.
The Court dismissed Meza's remaining claims without prejudice.

IM-MA-0009,"This federal lawsuit, filed by the cities of Chelsea and Lawrence, Massachusetts, on Feb. 8, 2017, challenged President Trump’s Jan. 25, 2017 Executive Order dealing with immigration enforcement, which threatened to withhold federal funds from ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" and take enforcement action against any locality that impedes the federal government's immigration law. 

The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked for a declaration that Chelsea and Lawrence comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, that § 1373 is an unconstitutional infringement on municipal and state self-government authority, and that the Executive Order violates the Tenth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. In addition, they claimed that the Executive Order violates the separation of powers by penalizing § 1373 violations without Congressional approval. On April 25, 2017 the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against operation of the Executive Order.  See the case San Francisco v. Trump (3:17-cv-00485-WHO) for more details.

Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Protect Democracy’s motion for a preliminary injunction.
For the most part, the Court finds the agencies’ withholdings justified.
The Court does, however, find that a small amount of information in several of the talking-point documents has already been officially acknowledged, and thus that the agencies may not withhold that information.
It will therefore grant in part and deny in part each party’s motion for summary judgment.
The Court will therefore grant in part and deny in part both parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.

The court also found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs’ challenge under section 46110.

Here, the Court has determined that it does not have jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s non-dismissed claims against the Official Capacity Defendants.
The plaintiff resides within the Fourth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit has subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs remaining claims pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 46110.
Plaintiff’s remaining claims against the Official Capacity Defendants and the defendant Unknown TSC Agents will be transferred to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

Texas Civil Rights Project (“TCRP”) files suit on behalf of dozens of unnamed migrant minors who came to the United States unaccompanied, were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), were subjected to the Title 42 Process, and who—as of July 23, 2020— were temporarily housed in Hampton Inn Suites McAllen, 10 West Expressway 83, McAllen, Texas 78501, as they await their deportation pursuant to the Title 42 Process (hereinafter “Unnamed Children”).
In one reported case, the child was held in a hotel for as long as 19 days.
This increases the risk of exposure to COVID19 both for border enforcement agents and the children themselves.
Unnamed Unaccompanied Children #1-100 (hereinafter “Unnamed Children”) are unaccompanied migrant children who came to the United States and, on information and belief, were put in the Title 42 Process.
Defendant Chad Wolf is the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, which is a cabinetlevel department of the U.S government.
DHS’s components include CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”).
ICE is the sub-agency of DHS that is responsible for carrying out removal orders and overseeing immigration detention.
In that capacity, he authorized the Title 42 Process at issue in this case.
The specific provision of Title 42 invoked by the Administration was § 265.
In 2001, HHS delegated this authority to the CDC.
The application of the Title 42 Process to the Unnamed Children is contrary to law.
Defendants applied the Title 42 Process and regulation to the Unnamed Children without any of these required safeguards.
The Title 42 Process creates an alternative removal mechanism.

The United States cannot now renege on its promise.
Based on that and other unlawful conduct, the United States sued Arpaio, MCSO, and the County of Maricopa under two statutes: Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, and 34 U.S.C. § 12601 (formerly codified at 42 U.S.C. § 14141).1 The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the United States on the claims relating to the unlawful traffic stops; the parties settled the remaining claims.
The County contended that, because Arpaio’s policies were not policies of the County, it could not be held liable for the constitutional violations caused by execution of them.
As to Title VI, the Supreme Court has held that an entity’s liability is limited to the entity’s own misconduct, as it is under § 1983.

The court granted a permanent injunction against that requirement, although in the meantime, Kentucky amended the law to remove the citizenship requirement.  This case was closed in 2009.  ","Kentucky law authorizes the State Police to issue and renew licenses to carry a concealed deadly weapon (“CCDW license”).
The citizenship provision allows citizens to obtain a CCDW license, and prohibits all aliens, including lawful permanent residents, from obtaining a license.
The Court’s preliminary injunction, entered on March 14, 2008, is hereby converted into a permanent injunction.
BACKGROUND This matter stems from a constitutional challenge to Kentucky’s concealed weapon law, KRS § 237.110.
Plaintiff challenged a provision of the law requiring applicants seeking to obtain licenses to carry concealed deadly weapons be citizens of the United States as unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause.
Here, Plaintiff has obtained a permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from enforcing the statutory provision limiting the issuance of carry concealed deadly weapon licenses to United States citizens.
(10) the “undesirability” of the case; .
While recognizing the complexities inherent to constitutional litigation, the equal protection analysis in this case was relatively straightforward.
Other than the citizenship requirement, there is no unfulfilled requirement that would prevent Mr. Say from obtaining a CCDW license.
KRS 237.110(4), as amended to include the citizenship requirement discriminates based on alienage.
Declare that the United States citizenship requirement contained in the KRS 237.110(4), as amended, denies Mr. Say equal protection ofthe laws; B."
IM-CA-0095,"The Regents of the University of California filed this lawsuit challenging DHS's revocation of DACA on September 8, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs stated that DACA recipients have enabled the nation and the university to greatly benefit from their presence as students and employees at the university. The plaintiffs argued that DHS’ revocation of DACA violates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process clause and the Administrative Procedure Act. On Jan. 9, 2018, the court ordered a nationwide preliminary injunction, ordering that DACA remain in effect on the same terms and conditions that existed prior to the recession. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's rulings on Nov. 8, 2018. 

The defendants petitioned the Supreme Court of the U.S. for a writ of certiorari on Nov. 5 which was granted on July 3, 2019. On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court held that the DACA rescission was subject to judicial review under the APA and that the DHS secretary had offered insufficient justification to rescind the program. The Ninth Circuit  remanded the case to the district court for further action consistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court. DHS then issued a memorandum on July 28, 2020, stating that Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf would reconsider DACA's future and in the interim, instructed USCIS to reject all initial requests for DACA, to only grant advance parole to current DACA beneficiaries in exceptional circumstances, and grant DACA renewals for only one-year, rather than two-year, periods. In response to the Wolf Memorandum, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, arguing that Wold did not have the authority to issue the memo and that Wolf's actions were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. Though the parties in this case have yet to file motions for summary judgment and the court has yet to rule on the plaintiffs' amended complaint, on December 4, the court in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15462""><i>Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen</i></a> and <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16130""><i>State of New York v. Trump</i></a> ordered DHS to fully reinstate DACA as it existed prior to the attempted recession in September 2017.

Arcara PERSON ||| Second Circuit ORG [SUMMARY] On September 9, 2008, in response to charges filed by 18 women, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit against Sterling Jewelers, Inc., alleging violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through sex-discriminatory employment practices. The EEOC alleged that Sterling's system of promotion and compensation decisions was excessively subjective, which intentionally facilitated or encouraged discrimination and, in addition, that the decisions had a disparate impact on female sales employees. The EEOC sought injunctive relief and monetary relief for the class of female sales employees and to recover its costs. The progress of the case has been slow because of numerous disputes over procedure and discovery. On April 25, 2011, the Court (Richard J. Arcara) bifurcated trial and discovery into two phases, liability (Stage I) and damages (Stage II). The bifurcation was followed by extensive discovery disputes. The court initially granted summary judgment in favor of Sterling on the grounds that the EEOC failed to satisfy its obligation to conduct a nationwide investigation of Sterling's employment practices. The EEOC appealed, and the Second Circuit vacated and remanded. The EEOC and Sterling the entered into a consent decree. The court maintained jurisdiction, and provisions included changes in employment practices and the appointment of an employment practice expert. The consent decree remains in force","([1], 7(a)), and by “maintain[ing] a system for making promotion and compensation decisions that is excessively subjective and that has a disparate impact on female retail sales employees”.
Stage I would include discovery and trial of issues relating to pattern or practice liability, injunctive relief and punitive damages.
The Court explained: Generally, a pattern-or-practice suit is divided into two phases: liability and remedial.
At that point, Stage II discovery will commence, to be followed by a Stage II trial.
At that point, Stage II discovery will commence, to be followed by a Stage II trial.
Similarly, in Jillian’s the court granted summary judgment dismissing the EEOC’s claims of nationwide discrimination, finding that the EEOC had failed to conduct a nationwide investigation: “[t]he nationwide class named in the EEOC’s Amended Complaint is not reasonably anticipated in its investigation into the four charges filed against Jillian’s Indianapolis.
Following discovery, Sterling moved for summary judgment on grounds that the EEOC had not satisfied its statutory obligation to conduct a pre‐suit investigation.
The EEOC timely appealed.
That is plainly not the case here.

Defendant Donald Trump is the President of the United States.
In May of 2020, hundreds of thousands of American civil rights activists began protesting the murder of George Floyd, a Black man killed by police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
President Trump has repeatedly advocated the use of force against Black demonstrators and civil rights activists protesting the murder of George Floyd.
President Trump’s statements about Black demonstrators and civil rights protesters were different from his statements about other demonstrators.
DHS law enforcement officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, two of the department’s immigration agencies, were deployed to Portland.
Federal authorities have protected the Mark O. Hatfield US Courthouse and, at times, interaction between protesters and law enforcement has gotten violent.
Last weekend, one protester was seriously injured after the man was shot in the head with impact munition.”
“It’s not the first time DHS – the largest federal law enforcement organization – has found itself acting upon Trump’s long-held feuds against Democratic-run cities.

BACKGROUND On June 27, 2017, a group of Plaintiffs filed suit against Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell.
A district court has great discretion in certifying and managing a class action.
116-1 at 29.
Plaintiffs argue that these practices violate their due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Additionally, the Fourteenth Amendment requires a neutral forum for consideration of ability to pay and alternative conditions of release.
Plaintiffs are granted summary judgment on Count One and the following declaratory relief: In the context of hearings to determine pretrial detention Due Process requires: 1) an inquiry into the arrestee’s ability to pay, including notice of the importance of this issue and the ability to be heard on this issue; 2) consideration of alternative conditions of release, including findings on the record applying the clear and convincing standard and explaining why an arrestee does not qualify for alternative conditions of release; and 3) representative counsel.
Plaintiffs are also granted summary judgment on Count Two and a declaratory judgment that Judge Cantrell’s institutional incentives create a substantial and unconstitutional conflict of interest when he determines their ability to pay bail and sets the amount of that bail.

1 Cases that cite this headnote [Holding:] The Court of Appeals, Costa, Circuit Judge, held that practice created conflict of interest that violated Due Process Clause.
We decide whether this dual role violates due process.
Judge Henry Cantrell is the magistrate for the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court.
The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.
Defendant violates Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights by keeping them in jail after arrest when they cannot afford to pay the amount of money set by the Defendant without an inquiry into and findings concerning their ability to pay and without consideration of alternative non-financial conditions of release.
Defendant Cantrell’s dual role as a judge determining conditions of pretrial release and as an executive in charge of managing the Court’s finances creates an institutional conflict of interest that deprives Plaintiffs of their right to a neutral tribunal."

BACKGROUND On August 14, 2018, a grand jury in the Eastern District of Michigan returned an indictment charging Defendant and a co-defendant with multiple counts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 2.
The indictment accuses Defendant and his codefendant of engaging in a scheme to obtain Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds by fraudulent means.
To this end, Defendant contends the use of FISA materials is improper in the criminal prosecution of an American citizen for an entirely “domestic” criminal prosecution.
because in his view, the primary purpose of the warrants and subsequent surveillance was for a domestic criminal prosecution.

That certification adopts the Complaint’s allegations and, as noted supra, creates a class of Navy and Marine Corps veterans who served from 2001 to the present, received less-than-Honorable discharges, were denied upgrades by the NDRB, and had diagnoses of PTSD, TBI, or other related mental health conditions attributable to their military service.
The gravamen of the present Plaintiffs’ claim against the Navy Secretary is that the process by which the Navy decided not to upgrade class members’ discharges was deficient.
As of those dates of decision, the Hagel and Carson Memos had been issued.

2020. The plaintiffs shall serve their settlement demand on defendant by February 7,
Veterans may apply to a review board, such as the Naval Discharge Review Board (""NDRB""), to upgrade their discharge characterization.
In 2014, then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel instructed the NDRB and other boards to give ""special"" or ""liberal"" consideration to applications from veterans diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (""PTSD"") and to consider PTSD and PTSD-related conditions as ""potential mitigating factors in the misconduct that caused"" a lesser characterization than ""Honorable.""
Plaintiffs file this action against Defendant Richard V. Spencer, in his official capacity as United States Secretary of the Navy, to challenge the NDRB's characterization upgrade decisionmaking procedures, which are allegedly in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment's due process protections Id.
The Court thus declines to address issues that are wholly unrelated to class certification at the moment.

Thus, the logic of Windsor is as follows: just as DOMA’s denial of marriage to same-sex couples was unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, a state’s denial of marriage to same-sex couples is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.
And courts in Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Ohio have already relied in part on Windsor to rule against state laws that refuse to recognize same-sex marriages.
The Parties 12.
And section 2 of DOMA says that no state shall be required to “give effect” to same-sex marriages created in other states.
Or, in other words, the purpose of these Texas laws is “to impose inequality.”

They have a life together.
Therefore, these Texas laws violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause.
