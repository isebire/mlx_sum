BSc Dissertation (Artificial Intelligence) - Isabel Sebire
The code submission is structured as follows:
* 1_DATASET_AND_EXPLORATORY: Code relating to the exploratory analysis of the Multi-LexSum dataset.
* 2_CLEANING_AND_NER: Code relating to dataset cleaning and NER tagging.
* 3_PRELIM_EXT: Code relating to constructing input representations (includes OREO, and CaseLawBERT classification).
* 4_ABSTRACTIVE: Code relating to finetuning PEGASUS models for abstractive summarisation.
* 5_EVALUATION: Code relating to the evaluation of model outputs.
* 6_QUALITATIVE_EVAL: Utility files for qualitative evaluation.
* CLUSTER_RESOURCES: Utility files for use of external GPU resources.


(Please note, the directory structure and so filepaths in code files may have changed between the time the code was run and this submission. Additionally, models and datasets are not included due to upload size constraints - datasets and selected trained models are stored in [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/isebire) and available on request.)
All code was written in Python.
